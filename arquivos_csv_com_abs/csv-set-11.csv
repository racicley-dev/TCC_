0,34726708,"The optimal dose and duration of oral amoxicillin for children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are unclear. To determine whether lower-dose amoxicillin is noninferior to higher dose and whether 3-day treatment is noninferior to 7 days. Multicenter, randomized, 2 × 2 factorial noninferiority trial enrolling 824 children, aged 6 months and older, with clinically diagnosed CAP, treated with amoxicillin on discharge from emergency departments and inpatient wards of 28 hospitals in the UK and 1 in Ireland between February 2017 and April 2019, with last trial visit on May 21, 2019. Children were randomized 1:1 to receive oral amoxicillin at a lower dose (35-50 mg/kg/d; n = 410) or higher dose (70-90 mg/kg/d; n = 404), for a shorter duration (3 days; n = 413) or a longer duration (7 days; n = 401). The primary outcome was clinically indicated antibiotic re-treatment for respiratory infection within 28 days after randomization. The noninferiority margin was 8%. Secondary outcomes included severity/duration of 9 parent-reported CAP symptoms, 3 antibiotic-related adverse events, and phenotypic resistance in colonizing Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. Of 824 participants randomized into 1 of the 4 groups, 814 received at least 1 dose of trial medication (median [IQR] age, 2.5 years [1.6-2.7]; 421 [52%] males and 393 [48%] females), and the primary outcome was available for 789 (97%). For lower vs higher dose, the primary outcome occurred in 12.6% with lower dose vs 12.4% with higher dose (difference, 0.2% [1-sided 95% CI -∞ to 4.0%]), and in 12.5% with 3-day treatment vs 12.5% with 7-day treatment (difference, 0.1% [1-sided 95% CI -∞ to 3.9]). Both groups demonstrated noninferiority with no significant interaction between dose and duration (P = .63). Of the 14 prespecified secondary end points, the only significant differences were 3-day vs 7-day treatment for cough duration (median 12 days vs 10 days; hazard ratio [HR], 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; P = .04) and sleep disturbed by cough (median, 4 days vs 4 days; HR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; P = .03). Among the subgroup of children with severe CAP, the primary end point occurred in 17.3% of lower-dose recipients vs 13.5% of higher-dose recipients (difference, 3.8% [1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to10%]; P value for interaction = .18) and in 16.0% with 3-day treatment vs 14.8% with 7-day treatment (difference, 1.2% [1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to 7.4%]; P value for interaction = .73). Among children with CAP discharged from an emergency department or hospital ward (within 48 hours), lower-dose outpatient oral amoxicillin was noninferior to higher dose, and 3-day duration was noninferior to 7 days, with regard to need for antibiotic re-treatment. However, disease severity, treatment setting, prior antibiotics received, and acceptability of the noninferiority margin require consideration when interpreting the findings.

1,29262176,"Acute otitis media is defined as an infection of the middle ear space. It is a spectrum of diseases that includes acute otitis media (AOM), chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), and otitis media with effusion (OME). Acute otitis media is the second most common pediatric diagnosis in the emergency department, following upper respiratory infections. Although otitis media can occur at any age, it is most commonly seen between the ages of 6 to 24 months. Infection of the middle ear can be viral, bacterial, or coinfection. The most common bacterial organisms causing otitis media are  "
2,14726904,"Treatment guidelines developed by the Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) were originally published in 2000. These guidelines were designed to: (1) educate clinicians and patients (or patients’ families) about the differences between viral and bacterial rhinosinusitis; (2) reduce the use of antibiotics for nonbacterial nasal/sinus disease; (3) provide recommendations for the diagnosis and optimal treatment of ABRS; (4) promote the use of appropriate antibiotic therapy when bacterial infection is likely; and (5) describe the current understanding of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics and how they relate to the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy. The original guidelines are updated here to include the most recent information on management principles, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, and therapeutic options. An estimated 20 million cases of ABRS occur annually in the United States. According to National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) data, sinusitis is the fifth most common diagnosis for which an antibiotic is prescribed. Sinusitis accounted for 9% and 21% of all pediatric and adult antibiotic prescriptions, respectively, written in 2002. The primary diagnosis of sinusitis results in expenditures of approximately $3.5 billion per year in the United States. ABRS is most often preceded by a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI). Allergy, trauma, dental infection, or other factors that lead to inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses may also predispose individuals to developing ABRS. Patients with a “common cold” (viral URI) usually report some combination of the following symptoms: sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, hyposmia/anosmia, facial pressure, postnasal drip, sore throat, cough, ear fullness, fever, and myalgia. A change in the color or the characteristic of the nasal discharge is not a specific sign of a bacterial infection. Bacterial superinfection may occur at any time during the course of a viral URI. The risk that bacterial superinfection has occurred is greater if the illness is still present after 10 days. Because there may be cases that fall out of the “norm” of this typical progression, practicing clinicians need to rely on their clinical judgment when using these guidelines. In general, however, a diagnosis of ABRS may be made in adults or children with symptoms of a viral URI that have not improved after 10 days or worsen after 5 to 7 days. There may be some or all of the following signs and symptoms: nasal drainage, nasal congestion, facial pressure/pain (especially when unilateral and focused in the region of a particular sinus), postnasal drainage, hyposmia/anosmia, fever, cough, fatigue, maxillary dental pain, and ear pressure/fullness. Physical examination provides limited information in the diagnosis of ABRS. While sometimes helpful, plain film radiographs, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging scans are not necessary for cases of ABRS. The most common bacterial species isolated from the maxillary sinuses of patients with ABRS are  The increasing prevalence of penicillin nonsusceptibility and resistance to other drug classes among  These guidelines apply to both adults and children. When selecting antibiotic therapy for ABRS, the clinician should consider the severity of the disease, the rate of progression of the disease, and recent antibiotic exposure. The guidelines now divide patients with ABRS into two general categories: (1) those with mild symptoms who have not received antibiotics within the past 4 to 6 weeks, and (2) those with mild disease who have received antibiotics within the past 4 to 6 weeks or those with moderate disease regardless of recent antibiotic exposure. The difference in severity of disease does not imply infection with a resistant pathogen. Rather, this terminology indicates the relative degree of acceptance of possible treatment failure and the likelihood of spontaneous resolution of symptoms—patients with more severe symptoms are less likely to resolve their disease spontaneously. The primary goal of antibiotic therapy is to eradicate bacteria from the site of infection, which, in turn, helps (1) return the sinuses back to health; (2) decrease the duration of symptoms to allow patients to resume daily activities more quickly; (3) prevent severe complications such as meningitis and brain abscess; and (4) decrease the development of chronic disease. Severe or life-threatening infections with or without complications are rare, and are not addressed in these guidelines. Prior antibiotic use is a major risk factor associated with the development of infection with antimicrobial-resistant strains. Because recent antimicrobial exposure increases the risk of carriage of and infection due to resistant organisms, antimicrobial therapy should be based upon the patient’s history of recent antibiotic use. The panel’s guidelines, therefore, stratify patients according to antibiotic exposure in the previous 4 to 6 weeks. Lack of response to therapy at ≥72 hours is an arbitrary time established to define treatment failures. Clinicians should monitor the response to antibiotic therapy, which may include instructing the patient to call the office or clinic if symptoms persist or worsen over the next few days. The predicted bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of antibiotics in adults and children has been determined according to mathematical modeling of ABRS developed by Michael Poole, MD, PhD, based on pathogen distribution, resolution rates without treatment, and in vitro microbiologic activity. Antibiotics can be placed into the following relative rank order of predicted clinical efficacy for adults: 90% to 92% = respiratory fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), ceftriaxone, high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (4 g/250 mg/day), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (1.75 g/250 mg/day); 83% to 88% = high-dose amoxicillin (4 g/day), amoxicillin (1.5 g/day), cefpodoxime proxetil, cefixime (based on  "
3,29461265,"Advances in our understanding of the treatment of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in a resource-limited environment are needed to improve outcome. Ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs) made from local products and with reduced milk content lower costs and may be effective in older children. None of the therapeutic foods used to treat severely malnourished children correct long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid deficiencies.Routine short-term antibiotic (amoxicillin) treatment, in the context of adequate healthcare supervision, does not improve the recovery rate. Long-term antibiotic (cotrimoxazole) treatment also does not provide significant benefit to non-HIV-infected children.Increased pathogenic bacteria have been found in the intestinal microbiome of malnourished children and candidate organisms for use as probiotics have been identified. There is, however, no evidence to support the routine use of probiotics in these children. Although exocrine pancreatic function is reduced in malnourished children, routine pancreatic enzyme supplementation does not lead to accelerated recovery. Alternative RUTF may provide a cheaper and more acceptable alternative to standard RUTF in the near future. Further research is needed to understand the implications of fatty acid deficiencies and dysbiosis that occur in malnourished children. Routine antibiotic administration in the appropriate setting is unnecessary. "
4,32841941,"Large variability in neonatal amoxicillin dosing recommendations may reflect uncertainty about appropriate efficacy and toxicity targets. The aim of this study was to model efficacious and safe exposure for current neonatal amoxicillin dosing regimens, given a range of assumptions for minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), targeted %fT > MIC, and potential for aminopenicillin-related neurotoxicity. Individual intravenous amoxicillin exposures based on 6 international and 9 Swiss neonatal dosing recommendations, reflecting the range of current dosing approaches, were assessed by a previously developed population pharmacokinetic model informed by neonatal data from an international cohort. Exposure was simulated by attributing each dosing regimen to each patient cohort. End points of interest were %fT > MIC and potential neurotoxicity using Cmax > 140 mg/L as threshold. None of the dosing regimens achieved targets of ≥100%fT > MIC at any of the relevant MICs for a desired probability of target attainment (PTA) of ≥90%. All regimens achieved a PTA ≥90% for Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC 0.25 mg/L) and Listeria monocytogenes (MIC 1 mg/L) when targeting ≤70%fT > MIC. In contrast, none of the regimens resulted in a PTA ≥90% targeting ≥70%fT > MIC for enterococci (MIC 4 mg/L). The maximum amoxicillin concentration associated with potential neurotoxicity was exceeded using 4 dosing regimens (100 mg/kg q12, 60/30 mg/kg q12/8, 50 mg/kg q12/8/6, and 50 mg/kg q12/8/4) for ≥10% of neonates. The acceptability of regimens is highly influenced by efficacy and toxicity targets, the selection of which is challenging. Novel randomized trial designs combined with pharmacometric modeling and simulation could assist in selecting optimal dosing regimens in this understudied population. "
5,30407457,"Ambulatory therapy in low-risk patients with cancer, fever, and neutropenia seems to be a secure and effective alternative. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of the antimicrobial treatment in early discharge vs. in-hospital treatment in children with cancer and febrile neutropenia (FN) with low risk of invasive bacterial infection (IBI). Quasi-experimental design with a historical cohort control group. Children with cancer during an episode of FN and low risk of IBI were included. The control group were inpatient children that received intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam. The experimental group was early discharge patients, who received 48 h of IV treatment and were switched to oral treatment. Outcomes: fever resolution, readmissions, and mortality. Eighty low-risk FN episodes were included; the median age was 6 years old (2.6-11 years), and 43 (54%) were female. Main diagnoses were solid tumors (52 patients) and leukemia or lymphoma (28 patients). Forty-three patients received in-hospital treatment, and 37 were selected for early discharge (31 patients received ciprofloxacin and six received amoxicillin/clavulanate). Two patients were readmitted, one due to a relapse of fever with tumor progression and the other due to epistaxis. Adverse effects occurred in 21.6% of the early discharge group and 12% of the inpatient treatment group (p = 0.04). Early discharge in pediatric patients with cancer, fever, and neutropenia is an acceptable and safe alternative for low-risk patients. El tratamiento ambulatorio en pacientes con cáncer, fiebre y neutropenia de bajo riesgo parece ser una alternativa segura y efectiva. El objetivo de este trabajo fue comparar la efectividad y la seguridad del tratamiento antimicrobiano en la modalidad de egreso temprano vs. el tratamiento intrahospitalario en niños con cáncer y neutropenia febril (NF), con bajo riesgo de infección bacteriana invasiva (IBI). Diseño cuasi-experimental con un grupo control histórico. Se incluyeron niños con cáncer durante un episodio de NF con bajo riesgo de IBI. El grupo control fue constituido por pacientes que recibieron tratamiento hospitalario con piperacilina-tazobactam intravenosa. Los pacientes en el grupo de egreso temprano recibieron 48 horas de tratamiento intravenoso y egresaron con antimicrobianos por vía oral. Desenlaces: resolución de la fiebre, reingreso al hospital y muerte. Se incluyeron 80 pacientes con NF de bajo riesgo; la mediana de edad fue de 6 años; 43 pacientes (54%) eran de sexo femenino. Los diagnósticos principales fueron tumores sólidos (52) y leucemia o linfoma (28). Cuarenta y tres pacientes recibieron tratamiento hospitalario y 37 fueron seleccionados para egreso temprano. En el grupo de egreso temprano, 31 pacientes recibieron ciprofloxacino y 6 recibieron amoxicilina-clavulanato. Dos pacientes reingresaron, uno por fiebre secundaria a progresión tumoral y otro por epistaxis. Los efectos adversos se presentaron en el 21.6% de los pacientes en el grupo de egreso temprano y en el 12% del grupo de tratamiento hospitalario (p = 0.04). El egreso temprano para niños con cáncer y NF de bajo riesgo es una alternativa aceptable y segura. "
6,37493159,"Group A ß-hemolytic  This article aims to familiarize clinicians with the clinical manifestations, evaluation, diagnosis, and management of GABHS pharyngitis. A search was conducted in December 2022 in PubMed Clinical Queries using the key term ""group A β-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis"". This review covers mainly literature published in the previous ten years. Children with GABHS pharyngitis typically present with an abrupt onset of fever, intense pain in the throat, pain on swallowing, an inflamed pharynx, enlarged and erythematous tonsils, a red and swollen uvula, enlarged tender anterior cervical lymph nodes. As clinical manifestations may not be specific, even experienced clinicians may have difficulties diagnosing GABHS pharyngitis solely based on epidemiologic or clinical grounds alone. Patients suspected of having GABHS pharyngitis should be confirmed by microbiologic testing (e.g., culture, rapid antigen detection test, molecular point-of-care test) of a throat swab specimen prior to the initiation of antimicrobial therapy. Microbiologic testing is generally unnecessary in patients with pharyngitis whose clinical and epidemiologic findings do not suggest GABHS. Clinical score systems such as the Centor score and McIssac score have been developed to help clinicians decide which patients should undergo diagnostic testing and reduce the unnecessary use of antimicrobials. Antimicrobial therapy should be initiated without delay once the diagnosis is confirmed. Oral penicillin V and amoxicillin remain the drugs of choice. For patients who have a non-anaphylactic allergy to penicillin, oral cephalosporin is an acceptable alternative. For patients with a history of immediate, anaphylactic-type hypersensitivity to penicillin, oral clindamycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin are acceptable alternatives. Early diagnosis and antimicrobial treatment are recommended to prevent suppurative complications (e.g., cervical lymphadenitis, peritonsillar abscess) and non-suppurative complications (particularly rheumatic fever) as well as to reduce the severity of symptoms, to shorten the duration of the illness and to reduce disease transmission.

7,14632104,"Bacterial skin and skin structure infections commonly encountered in children include impetigo, folliculitis, furunculosis, carbuncles, wound infections, abscesses, cellulitis, erysipelas, scarlet fever, acute paronychia, and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. If diagnosed early and treated appropriately, these infections are almost always curable, but some have the potential to cause serious complications such as septicemia, nephritis, carditis and arthritis if diagnosis is delayed and/or treatment is inadequate. During the initial evaluation, it is important to determine whether the infection is superficial or deep, and whether it is localized or spreading. Prompt treatment is essential if the infection appears to be spreading, as the sequelae can be life threatening. Once the proper diagnosis is made, the next important step is selecting the most appropriate therapy. In children presenting with mild or moderately severe bacterial skin and skin structure infections and not requiring inpatient management or urgent operative débridement, prompt provision of oral antimicrobial therapy avoids the risk of worsening infection or hospitalization. Empiric antimicrobial therapy should be directed at the most likely pathogens, (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes), although some infections (e.g. subcutaneous abscesses and cellulitis following animal or human bites) may have a polymicrobial origin. In choosing the appropriate antimicrobial therapy, one must take into account the resistance profile of the target pathogen, the agent's antibacterial profile and intrinsic activity against the target pathogen, and its pharmacokinetic properties (including absorption, elimination, and extent of tissue penetration). Other factors to consider include tolerability of the drug, convenience of the dosing regimen, and acceptability and palatability of the oral formulation administered. Any treatment plan for bacterial skin and skin structure infections should aim to minimize the emergence of resistant organisms so that the risk of their dissemination to others in the community is reduced. Oral antimicrobial agents currently available that may be considered include: beta-lactamase-stable penicillins (e.g. cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium), the macrolides (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin), and the cephalosporins. Cephalosporins are now the most commonly used class, particularly because of increasing resistance among strains of S. pyogenes to erythromycin (and by implication, the other macrolides). The second- and third-generation cephalosporins have many advantages, with their extended spectra of antimicrobial activity, favorable pharmacokinetic and tolerability profiles, and convenient dosage schedules. The third-generation agent, cefdinir, has good activity against a broad range of likely pathogens, including staphylococci, a twice-daily administration schedule, a favorable efficacy and tolerability profile, is well accepted by young children when administered as an oral suspension, and may be an attractive alternative in the pediatric setting.

8,38250287,"To describe baseline antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) metrics and apply AMS interventions in an inpatient obstetrical population. From October 2018 to October 2019, our tertiary-care obstetrical center reviewed components of our AMS program, which included: (1) antimicrobial consumption data, (2) point prevalence surveys (PPS), and (3) prospective audit and feedback. We reviewed institutional data for antimicrobial consumption from the pharmacy database. Detailed point prevalence surveys were conducted for all antimicrobial prescriptions on two predefined dates each month. Daily audits and feedback assessed the appropriateness of all non-protocolized antimicrobials. Our average antimicrobial length of therapy (LOT) was 12 days per 100 patient-days, where erythromycin (2.33), amoxicillin (2.28), and ampicillin (1.81) were the greatest contributors. Point prevalence surveys revealed that 28.8% of obstetrical inpatients were on antimicrobials, of which 11.2% were inappropriate. Protocolized antimicrobials were 62% less likely ( Antimicrobial use in obstetrics is unique compared to general inpatients. We provide a baseline set of metrics for AMS at our obstetrical center intending to lay the groundwork for AMS programming in our discipline. Antimicrobial protocolization, as well as audit and feedback, are feasible interventions to improve antimicrobial prescribing patterns. Décrire les mesures de gouvernance antimicrobienne (GAM) fondamentales et utiliser les interventions de GAM dans une population obstétricale hospitalisée. D’octobre 2018 à octobre 2019, le centre obstétrical de soins tertiaires a révisé les éléments du programme de GAM, qui incluait : 1) les données sur la consommation d’antimicrobiens, 2) les enquêtes de prévalence ponctuelles (EPP) et 3) la vérification et la rétroaction prospectives. Les chercheurs ont examiné les données institutionnelles relatives à la consommation d’antimicrobiens dans la base de données de la pharmacie. Ils ont effectué des enquêtes de prévalence ponctuelles détaillées sur toutes les prescriptions d’antimicrobiens à deux dates déterminées chaque mois. Les vérifications et les rétroactions quotidiennes ont permis d’évaluer la pertinence de tous les antimicrobiens non protocolisés. La durée du traitement antimicrobien moyen était de 12 jours sur 100 jours-patients, et l’érythromycine (2,33), l’amoxicilline (2,28) et l’ampicilline (1,81) étaient les plus utilisées. Les enquêtes de prévalence ponctuelles ont révélé que 28,8 % des patientes obstétricales hospitalisées prenaient des antimicrobiens, dont 11,2 % étaient inappropriés. Les antimicrobiens protocolisés étaient 62 % moins susceptibles d’être inappropriés (p = 0,027). Des 565 prescriptions vérifiées, 110 (19,5 %) ont donné lieu à des rétroactions, et 90 % des recommandations ont été acceptées et mises en œuvre. Les principales raisons d’intervenir incluaient une posologie inexacte, la recommandation d’un test diagnostique avant de poursuivre l’antimicrobien, ainsi que le changement d’antimicrobien d’après la culture et sensibilité spécifiques. L’utilisation d’antimicrobiens est unique en obstétrique par rapport aux autres patients hospitalisés. Les chercheurs fournissent la série de mesures de GAM de référence utilisée à leur centre obstétrical pour jeter les bases de la programmation de la GAM dans la discipline. La protocolisation des antimicrobiens, de même que la vérification et la rétroaction, est une intervention faisable pour améliorer les profils de prescription d’antimicrobiens. "
9,22208358,"The development of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines has gained wide acceptance in high-income countries and reputable international organizations. Whereas this approach may be a desirable standard, challenges remain in low-income settings with limited capacity and resources for evidence synthesis and guideline development. We present our experience using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for the recent revision of the Kenyan pediatric clinical guidelines focusing on antibiotic treatment of pneumonia. A team of health professionals, many with minimal prior experience conducting systematic reviews, carried out evidence synthesis for structured clinical questions. Summaries were compiled and distributed to a panel of clinicians, academicians and policy-makers to generate recommendations based on best available research evidence and locally-relevant contextual factors. We reviewed six eligible articles on non-severe and 13 on severe/very severe pneumonia. Moderate quality evidence suggesting similar clinical outcomes comparing amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole for non-severe pneumonia received a strong recommendation against adopting amoxicillin. The panel voted strongly against amoxicillin for severe pneumonia over benzyl penicillin despite moderate quality evidence suggesting clinical equivalence between the two and additional factors favoring amoxicillin. Very low quality evidence suggesting ceftriaxone was as effective as the standard benzyl penicillin plus gentamicin for very severe pneumonia received a strong recommendation supporting the standard treatment. Although this exercise may have fallen short of the rigorous requirements recommended by the developers of GRADE, it was arguably an improvement on previous attempts at guideline development in low-income countries and offers valuable lessons for future similar exercises where resources and locally-generated evidence are scarce.

10,15156358,"Antimicrobial resistance patterns among the principal bacterial pathogens from infections of the respiratory tract, blood, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract of pediatric patients from the USA, Canada, Germany, France, and Italy were studied using the The Surveillance Network (TSN) database. Among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from respiratory tract infections, the prevalence of high-level penicillin resistance (MIC>/=2 microg/ml) ranged from 1.1 (Italy) to 36.2% (USA); erythromycin resistance was higher, ranging from 13.4 (Germany) to 63.8% (France). The prevalence of beta-lactamase-positive Haemophilus influenzae among isolates from lower respiratory tract infections ranged from <10 (Italy and Germany) to 38.4% (USA). Among isolates from blood and skin and soft tissue infections, the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ranged from 7.2% (Canada and Germany) to 27.3% (Italy). The prevalence of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae with putative extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among isolates from blood, urinary tract, and skin and soft tissue infections ranged from 0 (Germany and France) to 29.6% (Italy). With the exception of pseudomonal infections or infections with MRSA, amoxicillin-clavulanate retained moderate activity, whilst ceftriaxone and cefepime were the most effective broad-spectrum injectable agents. Meropenem was the most effective agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with <5% resistance. Low levels of resistance, along with acceptable safety profiles and the availability of convenient oral formulations, continue to support the use of ceftriaxone, cefepime, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and meropenem as viable options for the treatment of infections in pediatric patients.

11,9041624,"Use of a beta-lactamase stable antibiotic is called for in cases of acute otitis media (AOM) likely to be caused by beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis. Two beta-lactamase-stable agents commonly used for empirical treatment of AOM are amoxicillin/clavulanate and cefixime. A multicenter, randomized clinical trial compared cefixime (CFX; 8 mg/kg once daily) with amoxicillin/clavulanate (A/C; 40 mg/kg/day in three divided doses) for the treatment of children with AOM. Three hundred thirteen children were randomly assigned to a 10-day course of either CFX (n = 158) or A/C (n = 155). Based on history, physical examinations and otoscopic and tympanometric assessments, clinical responses were evaluated as cure, improvement, failure, relapse or nonevaluable. Compliance and patient/parent acceptability were also analyzed. Overall favorable clinical responses (cure plus improvement) were comparable post-therapy for the two treatments (CFX = 76%; A/C = 77%). Significant differences in response rates for both treatments were noted among different geographic regions, with the highest response rates observed in the Northeast and South. Acceptability of CFX was significantly better than that of A/C (P = 0.0001), and the adverse experience rate was lower (P = 0.001). The most frequently reported adverse experiences were diarrhea (CFX 15.2%, A/C 29.7%) and vomiting (CFX 3.2%, A/C 10.32%). Relapse rates were 26% for CFX and 29% for A/C. This study demonstrated that CFX has comparable clinical efficacy and a better adverse events profile than A/C when used to treat AOM of childhood. "
12,18958497,"This observational study was designed to evaluate the acceptability of oral antibiotics (including generics) commonly prescribed to children by community practitioners in France. Between February and July 2006, the parents of 953 children enrolled by 46 pediatricians completed a questionnaire, including a taste assessment based on representations of five facial expressions. The proportions of ""satisfactory"" taste judgments showed a significant difference between amoxicillin-clavulanate reference product and its generics (77.9% vs. 65%, p = 0.01). The amoxicillin-clavulanate generics were more likely than the reference product to be spat out at least once (28.7% vs. 19%, p = 0.05). The full treatment course was taken by 91.7% and 82.3% of children prescribed the amoxicillin-clavulanate reference product and its generics, respectively (p = 0.02). The proportions of ""satisfactory"" taste judgments showed no significant difference between amoxicillin reference product and generics (64.3% vs. 72.5%, p = 0.3). The amoxicillin generics were not different from the reference product to be spat out at least once (8.6% vs. 14.3%, p = 0.2). The full treatment course was taken by 90.7% and 94.6% of children prescribed the amoxicillin reference product and its generics, respectively (p = 0.3). This study suggests the role of the active substance in the taste, and calls for the evaluation of palatability of future drugs (generics and references) before granting of the marketing authorization, particularly for active substances of poor taste; this palatability plays a significant role in the compliance of the treatment, notably in children. Poor compliance increases the risk of therapeutic failures and the emergence of resistance. "
13,31152030,"We conducted a study to evaluate the use of job aids and simple user instructions to improve adherence for the treatment of childhood pneumonia with amoxicillin dispersible tablet (DT). A mixed-method study implemented in three phases between October 2015 and February 2016. The study was implemented in two subdistricts of Bangladesh. Caregivers of children aged 2-59 months, health service providers and key stakeholders at national and district level. An intervention including training and job aids and user-friendly instructions was introduced in one subdistrict while standard amoxicillin DT packaging and instructions with no training served as the control in the comparison subdistrict. Adherence behaviour of caregivers of children aged 2-59 months for the treatment of childhood pneumonia with amoxicillin DT. We conducted a survey with 56 caregivers in the intervention subdistrict and 38 caregivers in the comparison subdistrict. We also conducted 44 in-depth interviews to evaluate the job aids and user-friendly instructions with healthcare providers and caregivers to assess the feasibility, usability and acceptability of the tools in intervention subdistrict. For 5-day treatment course, 32.1% (95% CI 23.1% to 41.1%) of caregivers in the intervention subdistrict and 2.6% (95% CI 0.3% to 7.8%) in the comparison subdistrict maintained full adherence to the amoxicillin DT treatment for pneumonia. More children under 12 months were given age-appropriate treatment than older children. Key stakeholders and healthcare providers considered the use and integration of the tools into the health system to be feasible and acceptable. The provision of tools for the treatment of childhood pneumonia with amoxicillin DT had a positive influence on adherence behaviours. These tools can help close information gaps and overcome the barriers posed by medical illiteracy and remembering instructions from providers. "
14,16507381,"This analysis of the results of 7 trials compared the taste and smell acceptability scores of cefdinir oral suspension and 4 other pediatric antibiotic oral suspensions--amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium, cefprozil, azithromycin, or generic amoxicillin--using a visual smile-face scale. Data from 7 randomized, single-blind, cross-over trials were pooled and analyzed. In each study, children aged 4 to 8 years were asked to taste and smell 2 different antibiotic suspensions and assign preference using a visual smile-face scale. Ratings were converted to a numeric score ranging from 5 (really good) to 1 (really bad). A total of 1011 healthy subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment-order groups; 965 were evaluable for the taste and smell analyses. Baseline demographics of evaluable subjects were similar among test groups. Approximately even proportions of participants were female or male (50.1 % vs 49.9%), most (84.1%) were white, and slightly more participants were aged 7 or 8 years rather than younger (age 4 years, 16.0%; age 5 years, 17.4%; age 6 years, 18.7%; age 7 years, 23.2%; age 8 years, 24.8%). Of the 965 children who tasted both antibiotic suspensions and determined their preference, 798 (82.7%) rated the taste of cefdinir as really good or good (the highest possible ratings); 712 (73.8%) assigned the same ratings to amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium, cefprozil, azithromycin, or generic amoxicillin (P < or = 0.001). With regard to smell, 671 (69.5%) rated the smell of cefdinir as really good or good; 636 (65.9%) assigned these same ratings to the comparator agents (P = NS). In this pooled analysis of data from 7 randomized, single-blind, crossover trials, children between the ages of 4 and 8 years preferred the taste of cefdinir oral suspension to that of other pediatric antibiotic suspensions. Based on smile-face scores, subjects found the smell of cefdinir oral suspension to be at least as good as that of the comparators. "
15,12765486,"The approaches to diagnosing and treating Lyme disease (LD) have been improved and refined as a result of basic and clinical research, and considerable practical experience. In addition, there have been recent studies that have allowed improvements in the ability to prevent infection with Borrelia burgdorferi. This paper will review the relevant literature and address recent developments in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of LD. Issues specifically related to the management of children will be identified. Controversies regarding treatment approaches will be examined in some detail. Understanding the clinical manifestations, or stage, of LD is crucial when approaching both diagnosis and treatment. Early localized disease is best diagnosed by recognizing the characteristic skin lesion, erythema migrans. Early disease will frequently, but not always, be accompanied by a detectable antibody response, particularly IgM antibody to the spirochete. Late disease, chiefly arthritis, is generally associated with high levels of IgG antibody. Western blot technology allows confirmation of enzyme immunoassay results and is especially useful when the latter is in the low or equivocal range. Early localized disease responds well to oral antibacterial therapy. Early disseminated disease, often associated with neurologic findings, may require parenteral therapy. The arthritis associated with LD frequently responds to oral antibacterials, but some refractory cases may require intravenous therapy, and occasionally surgery. Doxycycline is the oral antibacterial of choice, while amoxicillin and cefuroxime axetil are alternatives that may be preferred in young children. Owing to its long half-life and once daily dose administration, intravenous ceftriaxone has become the accepted standard for parenteral therapy. Tick avoidance has long been the mainstay for preventing LD. Antibacterial prophylaxis, using doxycycline, for tick bites has been shown to be an effective approach to prevention, but its relevance to pediatrics is uncertain. Vaccines designed to prevent infection have also been developed. "

To know the current pattern of antibiotic susceptibility/resistance of the most frequent germs that cause UTI in our healthcare area. Secondary objective is to know the evolution of these patterns over time. A cross-sectional retrospective study of UTI episodes in a first-level hospital in two periods: 1st January 2008-31th December 2010 and 1st January 2017-31th December 2019 through a review of medical records, recording the following variables: Age, sex, fever, hospital admission, uropathy/bladder dysfunction, antibiotic prophylaxis. First period: 174 UTI episodes (156 patients); Second period: 266 UTI episodes (218 patients). The most frequently isolated germ was  The increased resistance of the most frequent uropathogens in the UTI of the pediatric population of our healthcare area to amoxicillin/clavulanate makes it unsuitable as empirical therapy. First-generation cephalosporins are an adequate alternative in patients without risk factors. "
17,11144401,"Patient adherence to therapeutic regimens is extremely important to successful treatment of acute otitis media. Among pediatric patients medication palatability, particularly that of oral suspensions, is essential for patient acceptance, therapeutic compliance and successful outcome. A series of six randomized, single blind, crossover trials were conducted, each comparing cefdinir oral suspension with one of the following antibiotic oral suspensions: amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium; cefprozil; or azithromycin. Each medication comparison was evaluated in a single center and multicenter study. Subjects 4 to 8 years of age were asked to taste and smell each medication and assign preference using a visual ""smile-face"" scale. Ratings were converted to a numeric score ranging from 5 (""really good"") to 1 (""really bad""). Among the 715 subjects 85% rated the taste of cefdinir as good or really good, the highest possible ratings; 63% of subjects assigned the same ratings to amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium, cefprozil or azithromycin. Seventy-one percent rated the smell of cefdinir as good or really good; 64% assigned the same ratings to the comparators. Based on the findings from these trials, children 4 to 8 years of age preferred the taste and smell of cefdinir oral suspension to that of the comparator agents. "
18,3847523,"Bacteriological and clinical evaluations of BRL 25000 (1 part clavulanic acid plus 2 parts amoxicillin) granules in the pediatric field have been performed. The MICs of BRL 25000 against 25 clinically isolated strains of S. aureus, 40 E. coli, and 14 K. pneumoniae were compared with those of AMPC. Against beta-lactamase non-producing strains of S. aureus and E. coli, the MICs of both drugs were nearly equal, however, against beta-lactamase producing strains of these species and K. pneumoniae, BRL 25000 was superior to AMPC. The blood levels of AMPC and CVA after single oral administration of approximately 15 mg/kg of BRL 25000 granules to fasted children were studied in 3 subjects. The mean levels of AMPC and CVA peaked about 1 hour after administration at values of 11.40 and 5.49 micrograms/ml, respectively, with half-lives of 0.91 and 1.02 hours, and AUCs of 23.52 and 12.66 hr X micrograms/ml, respectively. The 6-hour urinary recovery of AMPC ranged from 30.59% to 52.03% and for CVA from 16.31% to 45.18%. There was no significant difference between the blood level of AMPC following single oral administration of approximately 10 mg/kg AMPC granules and that of AMPC following single oral administration of approximately 15 mg/kg BRL 25000 granules to the same children. Clinical evaluation of BRL 25000 granules administered orally 3-4 times a day at total daily doses of between 42.9-52.9 mg/kg resulted in improvement, judged excellent or good, in all 7 cases of tonsillitis and 2 cases of pyelonephritis. In particular, the clinical effect was excellent in the case of tonsillitis where a beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae was isolated. In the total 11 cases treated, including 2 cases of mycoplasmal pneumonia excluded from the clinical evaluation, 1 case of rash and eosinophilia was observed. No other adverse reactions or abnormal laboratory findings were observed. The taste and flavor of the drug were well accepted by the children. It was concluded that BRL 25000 granules are promising new drug which should be markedly useful in the treatment of infections in pediatric outpatients. "
19,8878243,"This multicenter, randomized, open label study compared the efficacy and safety of azithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate for the treatment of acute otitis media among children who were attending a day-care facility or school. Eligible children with acute otitis media from 21 US centers were randomized to treatment with 10 mg/kg of azithromycin oral suspension on Day 1, followed by 5 mg/kg once daily for the next 4 days or approximately 40 mg/kg/day of amoxicillin/clavulanate suspension in 3 divided doses for 10 days. Clinical efficacy was evaluated on Days 14, 30 and 45. Acceptance and convenience of the medications were assessed on Day 14 by parent interviews with a standardized questionnaire. Of the 263 children enrolled in the study, 233 were evaluable at the primary evaluation 45 days after the start of treatment. Satisfactory clinical response rates (cure, delayed cure and improvement) were 60.5% in patients treated with azithromycin and 64.9% in patients treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate. Satisfactory clinical response rates at secondary evaluations were also comparable: 92.2% vs. 90.0% at Day 14 and 66.7% vs. 72.7% at Day 30 in patients treated with azithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate, respectively. No significant differences in treatment failures, relapses or recurrences were noted with either medication. Azithromycin was significantly better tolerated and caused fewer treatment-related adverse events (7.2%) than amoxicillin/clavulanate (17.1%) (P < 0.001). In response to the interview and questionnaire, parents of children treated with azithromycin noted less need for special arrangements to give medication (2.0% vs. 14.9%). Children liked the taste of azithromycin (89.2%) and did not have to be forced to take the medication (2.4%). Parents of children receiving amoxicillin/clavulanate noted that 61.8% liked the medication and 19.4% of children had to be forced to take it. This study demonstrates that azithromycin was comparable to amoxicillin/clavulanate in achieving satisfactory clinical response rates in children with acute otitis media attending day care or school. Azithromycin was significantly better tolerated than amoxicillin/ clavulanate. Parents considered azithromycin to be significantly more convenient to administer and more acceptable to children. "
20,9076838,"Respiratory infections in children may occur as a consequence of resistant bacterial pathogens. Streptococcus pneumoniae organisms resistant to penicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and macrolides are increasingly prevalent. Amoxicillin- and macrolide-resistant Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis are also more commonly seen. Traditional agents such as amoxicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole remain acceptable choices for most children with respiratory infections because currently most patients are not infected by resistant pathogens and there is a high spontaneous cure rate associated with these infections. To analyze the criteria for the selection of extended spectrum antimicrobials as empiric therapy for respiratory infections. When an extended spectrum antimicrobial is appropriate for empiric therapy, selection should be based on: (1) efficacy; (2) adverse event profile; and (3) compliance-enhancing features (dosing with meals, once or twice daily administration, good palatability in suspension, shortened course of therapy and affordability). A new agent, ceftibuten, has recently joined other extended spectrum cephalosporins and newer macrolides (clarithromycin and azithromycin) as a choice to be considered for empiric therapy for respiratory infections. These antimicrobials are differentiated from each other and traditional agents by differences in activity in vitro against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, relative beta-lactamase stability against Gram-negative bacteria and pharmacodynamic properties. When resistant organisms are isolated or suspected in community-acquired respiratory infections, cautious use of newer antibiotics may have to be considered. "
21,15270741,"Re-infection with Helicobacter pylori is more common in children than adults, and it is generally accepted that the family unit plays a significant role in primary childhood infection. We investigated whether the family unit plays a significant role in pediatric re-infection and if eradication of H. pylori from the entire family reduces the risk of childhood re-infection. Fifty families, each with an H. pylori-infected pediatric index case (mean age 9.48 years), were recruited. A 13carbon urea breath test was performed on all family members in the same house as the index case. Each family unit was randomized into a 'family unit treatment' group (all infected family members treated) or an 'index case treatment' group (index case only treated). At long-term follow-up (mean 62.2 months), there were three re-infected children in the 'index case treatment' group compared with one in the 'family unit treatment' group. The re-infection rate was 2.4% per patient per year in the 'index case treatment' group and 0.7% per patient per year in the 'family unit treatment' group (p = .31). This study is the first to evaluate the effect of total family unit H. pylori eradication on pediatric re-infection rates and reports the longest period of re-infection follow-up in children. In childhood, re-infection with H. pylori is not significantly reduced by family unit H. pylori eradication. "
22,11917721,"Helicobacter pylori infection presents high prevalence in developing countries, but there are few pediatric assays evaluating antimicrobial treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate Helicobacter pylori eradication rate using a short regimen (7 and 10 days) of triple therapy with clarithromycin, amoxicillin and omeprazole. Twenty-five Hp positive patients who presented severe epigastralgia, were submitted to antimicrobial treatment with amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/day--maximum dose 1 g bid), clarithromycin (30 mg/kg/day--maximum dose 500 mg bid) and omeprazole (0.6 mg/kg/day--maximum dose 20 mg bid) during 7 or 10 days. After 2 months, clinical symptoms were evaluated and gastric biopsies were taken to test Hp eradication. Overall eradication rate was achieved in 16/25 patients (64%--IC(95% = 45-83%), in 11/15 (73%--IC(95%) = 51-95%) patients who used 10 days therapy course and in 5/10 (50%--IC(95%) = 19-81%) who used 7 days therapy course. Eradication drugs were well accepted and adverse effects were reported in two patients (8%). This triple therapy regimen had moderate efficacy (64%). The data suggests that 10 days therapy course achieves better eradication rate (73%) than 7 days course (50%) to treat Hp infection in our population. "
23,35241278,"Antibiotic choice for complicated appendicitis should be based on both microbiological effectiveness as well as ease of administration and cost especially in lower resourced settings. Data is limited on comparative morbidity outcomes for antibiotics with similar microbiological spectrum of activity. Incidence and morbidity of surgical site infection after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis was assessed after protocol change from triple antibiotic (ampicillin, gentamycin, and metronidazole) regimen to single agent (amoxycillin/clavulanic acid). Surgical site infection (SSI) rate, relook surgery rate and length of hospital stay were retrospectively compared in patients treated for acute appendicitis preceding (2014, 2015; ""triple-therapy, TT"") and following (2017, 2018; ""single agent, SA"") antibiotic protocol change. The rate of complicated appendicitis was similar between groups; 72.6% in TT and 66% in SA (p = 0.239). Significantly, SSI occurred in 22.7% of the SA group compared to 13.3% in TT group (OR 1.920, 95% CI 1.000-3.689, p = 0.048). Use of laparoscopy increased from 31% in TT to 89% in SA, but with subgroup analysis this was not associated with increased SSI (17.3% in open and 20.6% in laparoscopic; OR 0.841, 95% CI 0.409-1.728, p = 0.637). Relook rate (OR 1.444, 95% CI 0.595-3.507, p = 0.093) length of hospital stay (U = 6859, z = -1.163, p = 0.245), and ICU admission (U = 7683, z = 0.634 p = 0.522) were equivocal. Neither group had mortalities. Despite increased SSI with SA, overall morbidity relating to ICU admission, relook rate and length of hospital stay was similar in both groups. More prospective research is required to confirm equivalent overall morbidity and that single agent therapy is more cost-effective with acceptable clinical outcomes. "
24,21281502,"Streptococcal pharyngitis is a very common pathology in paediatric age all over the world. Nevertheless there isn't a joint agreement on the management of this condition. Some authors recommend to perform a microbiological investigation in suspected bacterial cases in order to treat the confirmed cases with antibiotics so to prevent suppurative complications and acute rheumatic fever. Differently, other authors consider pharyngitis, even streptococcal one, a benign, self-limiting disease. Consequently they wouldn't routinely perform microbiological tests and, pointing to a judicious use of antibiotics, they would reserve antimicrobial treatment to well-selected cases. It has been calculated that the number of patients needed to treat to prevent one complication after upper respiratory tract infections (including sore throat), was over 4000. Even the use of the Centor score, in order to evaluate the risk of streptococcal infection, is under debate and the interpretation of the test results may vary considerably. Penicillin is considered all over the world as first line treatment, but oral amoxicillin is also accepted and, due to its better palatability, can be a suitable option. Macrolides should be reserved to the rare cases of proved allergy to β-lactams. Cephalosporins can be used in patients allergic to penicillin (with the exception of type I hypersensibility) and have been also proposed to treat the relapses. "
25,29332208,"Localised aggressive periodontitis (LAgP), characterised by rapid attachment and bone loss, which may occur in children and adolescents, without clinical evidence of systemic disease. Three-year-old boy was referred with excessive mobility of 83 and exfoliation of 73. Clinical examination revealed acceptable oral hygiene. Blood tests were performed to evaluate PMNs activity and the parents were advised to apply 0.2% chlorhexidine twice a day. One month later 83 was still excessively mobile. Blood tests were normal. A full mouth scaling and curettage were performed under general anaesthesia. Since 83 had been spontaneously exfoliated one day earlier, a biopsy was taken from its socket. The biopsy examination revealed granulation tissue with actinomyces colonies. A course of amoxicillin 250 mg three times a day for 7 days was prescribed. Cultures from periodontal pockets of the child's family members were found negative to Aggregatibacter actinomycetem comitans (Aa). Examination 3 months later, no tooth mobility was observed and the cultures from the periodontal pockets were negative to Aa. Thereafter, the child was periodically reviewed every 3 months for 26 months with no signs of periodontal disease. Amoxicillin combined with curettage around the involved teeth may be effective in LAgP treatment. "
26,25842223,"WHO recommends referral to hospital for possible serious bacterial infection in young infants aged 0-59 days. We aimed to assess whether oral amoxicillin treatment for fast breathing, in the absence of other signs, is as efficacious as the combination of injectable procaine benzylpenicillin-gentamicin. In a randomised, open-label, equivalence trial at five sites in DR Congo, Kenya, and Nigeria, community health workers followed up all births in the community, identified unwell young infants, and referred them to study nurses. We randomly assigned infants with fast breathing as a single sign of illness or possible serious bacterial infection, whose parents did not accept referral to hospital, to receive either injectable procaine benzylpenicillin-gentamicin once per day or oral amoxicillin treatment twice per day for 7 days. A person who was off-site generated randomisation lists using computer software. Trained health professionals gave injections, but outcome assessors were masked to group allocations. The primary outcome was treatment failure by day 8 after enrolment, defined as clinical deterioration, development of a serious adverse event including death, persistence of fast breathing on day 4, or recurrence up to day 8. The primary analysis was per protocol and we used a prespecified similarity margin of 5% to assess equivalence between regimens. This study is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12610000286044. From April 4, 2011, to March 29, 2013, we enrolled 2333 infants aged 0-59 days with fast breathing as the only sign of possible serious bacterial infection at the five study sites. We assigned 1170 infants to receive injectable procaine benzylpenicillin-gentamicin and 1163 infants to receive oral amoxicillin. In the per-protocol analysis, from which 137 infants were excluded, we included 1061 (91%) infants who fulfilled predefined criteria of adherence to treatment and adequate follow-up in the injectable procaine benzylpenicillin-gentamicin group and 1145 (98%) infants in the oral amoxicillin group. In the procaine benzylpenicillin-gentamicin group, 234 infants (22%) failed treatment, compared with 221 (19%) infants in the oral amoxicillin group (risk difference -2·6%, 95% CI -6·0 to 0·8). Four infants died within 15 days of follow-up in each group. We detected no drug-related serious adverse events. Young infants with fast breathing alone can be effectively treated with oral amoxicillin on an outpatient basis when referral to a hospital is not possible.

27,2218657,"In this randomized, blinded, multicenter comparison study, 377 infants and children with acute otitis media (AOM) received a 10-day course of an oral suspension of one of the following: cefuroxime axetil (CAE), 30 mg/kg/day; cefaclor (CEC), 40 mg/kg/day; or amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium (AMX-CL), 40 mg/kg/day. Clinical efficacy was determined by pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometric testing 3 to 5, 11 to 14, and 22 to 26 days after the initiation of therapy. There was a statistically significant difference among the three treatment groups with respect to clinical outcome; more patients in the CAE group (62%) than in the CEC group (46%) or the AMX-CL group (52%) had complete resolution of signs and symptoms of AOM (including effusion). Paired comparisons revealed a significant difference in efficacy between CAE and CEC and a nearly significant difference between AMX-CL and CEC. Taste acceptability was highest for CEC and lowest for this formulation of CAE. Significantly more patients in the AMX-CL group than in the CAE or CEC group had a side effect, primarily diarrhea, vomiting, or diaper rash. We conclude that CAE suspension has greater clinical efficacy than CEC and fewer side effects than AMX-CL. "
28,24939259,"Liquid oral medicines being the most accepted form of medication in children are frequently prescribed. The harmful effects of these liquid medicaments on a child's dental health are not known to many. The present study aimed to evaluate and compare the cariogenic and erosive potential of 5 most commonly prescribed pediatric liquid medicaments (PLM) in Pimpri Chinchwad and Pune city, Pune district. Most commonly prescribed PLM in Pune district were selected as opined by 50 pediatricians. The selected medicaments were Syr. Augmentin® Duo, Syr. Valparin®, Syr. Combiflam®, Syr. Visyneral and Syr. Orofer®. An estimation of pH, percentage of sucrose concentration and calcium dissolving capacity of these preparations was carried out. The results as obtained were subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS v 17.0 for windows. The statistical test as undertaken was Pearson's correlation coeffcient(r). Sucrose was seen to be present in Syr. Combiflam® (35.75% ± 0.25%) and Syr. Visyneral (18.48% ± 0.43%). Acidic pH was observed for Syr. Visyneral (mean pH 3.63 ± 0.04), Syr. Combiflam®(mean pH 5.03 ± 0.02) and Syr. Augmentin® (mean pH 6.22 ± 0.02). Highest calcium dissolution was seen with Syr. Combiflam®(295.86 mg/ml) and the least with Syr. Orofer® (25.51 mg/ml). No statistical significant correlation was observed with calcium dissolution potential of PLM in comparison with their respective pH. Syr. Combiflam® can be regarded as the highest cariogenic and erosive potential medicament among the compared and tested PLM. Considering syrups with high cariogenic and erosive potential should always follow with proper oral hygiene practices or search for an alternative drugs void of such detrimental effects. "
29,19996970,"Recently, recommendations from the American Heart Association regarding treatment of streptococcal tonsillo-pharyngitis were revised. This review provides the background for changes that were made in comparison with the group's 1995 recommendations. Recent papers on other issues relating to group A Streptococcus are also reviewed. For antibiotic treatment of streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis the recommendations for injectable penicillin and for oral erythromycin are downgraded. First choice remains penicillin V but there is increasing acceptance of once-daily amoxicillin. Streptococcal pharyngitis is still a major infectious disease seen in pediatric office practice. The main job of the practitioner is to make an accurate diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment in timely fashion in order to prevent acute rheumatic fever. "
30,39210755,"Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection predisposes to malignant and non-malignant diseases warranting eradication. In Belgium, resistance rates for clarithromycin demonstrate regional variations making the use of standard triple therapy (STT) borderline acceptable. According to a recent Belgian survey, STT and bismuth-based quadruple therapy (BQT), are equally frequent prescribed as first line treatment for treatment naïve Hp positive patients. This study aims to evaluate the eradication rates (ER) of BQT versus STT. Multicentre, non-blinded randomized, prospective study comparing ER in treatment-naïve Hp positive patients. ER were compared by intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analysis. Overall 250 patients were included (STT 126, BQT 124). Seventeen patients were lost to follow-up (6,8%). No significant difference in ER between BQT and STT was observed in ITT (73% vs 68%, p= 0,54) neither in PP analysis (81% vs 75%, p= 0,33). Side effects and endoscopic findings were comparable between groups. Post-hoc analysis showed no differences according to gender or site allocation. The numerical advantage of BQT did not translate in a significant improvement of ER when compared with STT. These results question the cost-effectiveness of BQT, while confirming the suboptimal eradication rates on STT. A nationwide monitoring of resistance patterns, maximal investments in treatment adherence as well as a detailed follow-up of the changing treatment landscape are mandatory to continuously optimise Hp ER in Belgium.

31,7970967,"Palatability of oral antibiotic suspensions is important and may be a substantial factor in determining compliance in young pediatric patients. Because no comparative systematic data are available, we undertook the present study to assess the acceptance of and compliance with oral antibiotic suspensions commonly used in Israel. During a 4-month period lists of children receiving oral antibiotic suspensions were obtained from 3 major pediatric clinics, and parents were contacted by telephone 10 to 14 days after initiation of therapy, at which time information on age, sex, main disease, prescribed drugs and duration of treatment was obtained. Information regarding acceptance, side effects and compliance was obtained from 11 questions with graded scores. In the study 546 children received one of the following drugs: amoxicillin (n = 222); cefaclor (n - 142); cefuroxime axetil (n = 107); trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (n = 75). No major differences in background data were noted; more than 50% of each group had acute otitis media. Seventy-three percent of the cefaclor group reported acceptance of the drug with ""pleasure"" or ""without problems"" vs. 60, 55 and 20% for amoxicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and cefuroxime axetil, respectively, whereas ""resentment"" or ""refusal"" was reported in 11, 16, 26 and 56%, respectively (P < 0.0001). Mothers reported to be generally ""satisfied"" or ""extremely satisfied"" with the drug in 89, 81, 74 and 67% with cefaclor, amoxicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and cefuroxime axetil, respectively, and 85, 77, 73 and 67% of the children, respectively, received the drug for the entire prescribed course (P < 0.001). Our data demonstrate that marked variations exist in acceptance and compliance of oral antibiotic suspensions with children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) "
32,6980775,"An open comparative study was carried out in 56 paediatric patients with acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections to assess the efficacy and tolerance of treatment with erythromycin, amoxicillin or co-trimoxazole. Patients were treated with the standard recommended doses for 7 to 10 days. Diagnoses included otitis, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, epiglottiditis, pertussis, scarlet fever and bronchitis and, when possible, pathogens were isolated and identified at the initial visit. The clinical findings showed that all three treatment resulted in statistically significant decreases in final mean values for temperature, pulse rate and respiration rate. Twenty of the patients with positive cultures on entry became negative by the end of treatment. No clinical side-effects, were reported with any of the treatments. Overall assessment of response and acceptability of treatment by physician and patient/parent indicated that erythromycin was at least equally as effective as the other two drugs in treating common respiratory diseases found in paediatric practice.

33,38591640,"Determine the optimal antibiotic choice for lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in children with neurodisability. Embase, Ovid Emcare and MEDLINE were searched for studies from inception to January 2023. All studies, except case reports, focusing on the antibiotic treatment of LRTI in children, with neurodisabilities were included. Outcomes included length of stay, intensive care admission and mortality. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria (5115 patients). All the studies were of low quality. The shortest length of stay was with anaerobic and gram-positive cover. Five studies used anaerobic, gram-positive and gram-negative cover (e.g., amoxicillin-clavulanic acid), which was frequently adequate. In one large study, it was better than gram-positive and gram-negative cover alone (e.g. ceftriaxone). Those unresponsive or more unwell at presentation improved faster on Pseudomonas aeruginosa cover (e.g., piperacillin-tazobactam). In this context, anaerobic, gram-positive and gram-negative cover is just as effective as P. aeruginosa cover, supporting empiric treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. If there is a failure to improve, broadening to include P. aeruginosa could be considered. This is consistent with a consensus statement on the treatment of LRTI in children with neurodisability. An accepted definition for what constitutes LRTI in this cohort is required before designing prospective randomised trials. "
34,20924533,"The present study was conducted to evaluate the utilization of Clark's, Salisbury and Penna's rules and the Body Surface Area (BSA) formula for calculation of pediatric drug dosage, as well as their reliability and viability in the clinical use. These rules are frequently cited in the literature, but much controversy still exists with regards to their use. The pediatric drug dosage was calculated by utilization of the aforementioned rules and using the drugs Paracetamol, Dipyrone, Diclofenac Potassium, Nimesulide, Amoxicillin and Erythromycin, widely employed in Pediatric Dentistry. Weight and body surface areas were considered of children with ages between 1 and 12 years old as well as the dosage for the adult. The pediatric dosages achieved were compared to the predetermined dosages in mg kg-1 herein-named standard dosages. The results were submitted to the parametric test ANOVA and to the Tukey test (p<0,05). The antibiotics and Diclofenac provides acceptable utilization of the rules in pediatric dentistry, however for the Dipyrone, the dosages obtained by the rules suggest their clinical ineffectiveness. For the Paracetamol, the Penna's rule and the BSA formula should not be clinically employed, especially for children between 1 and 5 years old, once such dosages were much close to the hepatotoxic dosage of the drug. It can be concluded that the use of the rules for safe calculation of the pediatric drug dosage is possible and it depends on the used drug and age group. "
35,34535473,"Pneumonia is a leading cause of death among children under 5 specifically in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Hypoxaemia is a life-threatening complication among children under 5 with pneumonia. Hypoxaemia increases risk of mortality by 4.3 times in children with pneumonia than those without hypoxaemia. Prevalence of hypoxaemia varies with geography, altitude and severity (9%-39% Asia, 3%-10% African countries). In this protocol paper, we describe research methods for assessing impact of Lady Health Workers (LHWs) identifying hypoxaemia in children with signs of pneumonia during household visits on acceptance of hospital referral in district Jamshoro, Sindh. A cluster randomised controlled trial using pulse oximetry as intervention for children with severe pneumonia will be conducted in community settings. Children aged 0-59 months with signs of severe pneumonia will be recruited by LHWs during routine visits in both intervention and control arms after consent. Severe pneumonia will be defined as fast breathing and/or chest in-drawing, and, one or more danger sign and/or hypoxaemia (Sa02 <92%) in PO (intervention) group and fast breathing and/or chest in-drawing and one or more danger sign in clinical signs (control) group. Recruits in both groups will receive a stat dose of oral amoxicillin and referral to designated tertiary health facility. Analysis of variance will be used to compare baseline referral acceptance in both groups with that at end of study. Ethical approval was granted by the Ethics Review Committee of the Aga Khan University (4722-Ped-ERC-17), Karachi. Study results will be shared with relevant government and non-governmental organisations, presented at national and international research conferences and published in international peer-reviewed scientific journals.

36,37594179,"Information on the average and incremental costs of implementing alternative strategies for treating young infants 0-59 days old in primary health facilities with signs of possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) when a referral is not feasible is limited but valuable for policymakers. Direct activity costs were calculated for outpatient treatment of PSBI and pneumonia in two districts of India: Palwal, Haryana and Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. These included costs of staff time and consumables for initial assessment, classification, and referrals; recommended treatment of fast breathing (oral amoxicillin for seven days) and PSBI (injection gentamicin and oral amoxicillin for seven days); and daily assessments. Indirect operational costs included staff training; staff time cost for general management, supervision, and coordination; referral transport; and communication. The average cost per young infant treated for recommended and acceptable treatment for PSBI was 16 US dollars (US$) (95% CI = US$15.4-16.3) in 2018-19 and US$18.5 in 2022 (adjusted for inflation) when all direct and indirect operational costs were considered. The average cost of recommended treatment for pneumonia was US$10.1 (95% CI = US$9.7-10.6) or US$11.7 in 2022, per treated young infant. The incremental cost 2018-2019 for supplies, medicines, and operations (excluding staff time costs) per infant treated for PSBI was US$6.1 and US$4.3 and for pneumonia was US$3.5 and US$2.2 in Palwal and Lucknow, respectively. Operation and administrative costs were 25% in Palwal and 12% in Lucknow of the total PSBI treatment costs. The average cost per live birth for treating PSBI in each population was US$5 in Palwal and US$3 in Lucknow. Higher operation costs for social mobilisation activities in Palwal led to the empowerment of families and timely care-seeking. Costs of treatment of PSBI with the recommended regimen in an outpatient setting, when a referral is not feasible, are under US$20 per treated child and must be budgeted to reduce deaths from neonatal sepsis. The investment must be made in activities that lead to successful identification, prompt care seeking, timely initiation of treatment and follow-up. "
37,25841891,"Severe infections remain one of the main causes of neonatal deaths worldwide. Possible severe infection is diagnosed in young infants (aged 0-59 days) according to the presence of one or more clinical signs. The recommended treatment is hospital admission with 7-10 days of injectable antibiotic therapy. In low-income and middle-income countries, barriers to hospital care lead to delayed, inadequate, or no treatment for many young infants. We aimed to identify effective alternative antibiotic regimens to expand treatment options for situations where hospital admission is not possible. We did this randomised, open-label, equivalence trial in four urban hospitals and one rural field site in Bangladesh to determine whether two alternative antibiotic regimens with reduced numbers of injectable antibiotics combined with oral antibiotics had similar efficacy and safety to the standard regimen, which was also used as outpatient treatment. We randomly assigned infants who showed at least one clinical sign of severe, but not critical, infection (except fast breathing alone), whose parents refused hospital admission, to one of the three treatment regimens. We stratified randomisation by study site and age (<7 days or 7-59 days) using computer-generated randomisation sequences. The standard treatment was intramuscular procaine benzylpenicillin and gentamicin once per day for 7 days (group A). The alternative regimens were intramuscular gentamicin once per day and oral amoxicillin twice per day for 7 days (group B) or intramuscular procaine benzylpenicillin and gentamicin once per day for 2 days, then oral amoxicillin twice per day for 5 days (group C). The primary outcome was treatment failure within 7 days after enrolment. Assessors of treatment failure were masked to treatment allocation. Primary analysis was per protocol. We used a prespecified similarity margin of 5% to assess equivalence between regimens. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00844337. Between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013, we recruited 2490 young infants into the trial. We assigned 830 infants to group A, 831 infants to group B, and 829 infants to group C. 2367 (95%) infants fulfilled per-protocol criteria. 78 (10%) of 795 per-protocol infants had treatment failure in group A compared with 65 (8%) of 782 infants in group B (risk difference -1.5%, 95% CI -4.3 to 1.3) and 64 (8%) of 790 infants in group C (-1.7%, -4.5 to 1.1). In group A, 14 (2%) infants died before day 15, compared with 12 (2%) infants in group B and 12 (2%) infants in group C. Non-fatal relapse rates were similar in all three groups (12 [2%] infants in group A vs 13 [2%] infants in group B and 10 [1%] infants in group C). Our results suggest that the two alternative antibiotic regimens for outpatient treatment of clinical signs of severe infection in young infants whose parents refused hospital admission are as efficacious as the standard regimen. This finding could increase treatment options in resource-poor settings when referral care is not available or acceptable. "
38,33784321,"Neonatal infections contribute substantially to infant mortality in Nigeria and globally. Management requires hospitalization, which is not accessible to many in low resource settings. World Health Organization developed a guideline to manage possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) in young infants up to two months of age when a referral is not feasible. We evaluated the feasibility of implementing this guideline to achieve high coverage of treatment. This implementation research was conducted in out-patient settings of eight primary health care centres (PHC) in Lagelu Local Government Area (LGA) of Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. We conducted policy dialogue with the Federal and State officials to adopt the WHO guideline within the existing programme setting and held orientation and sensitization meetings with communities. We established a Technical Support Unit (TSU), built the capacity of health care providers, supervised and mentored them, monitored the quality of services and collected data for management and outcomes of sick young infants with PSBI signs. The Primary Health Care Directorate of the state ministry and the local government led the implementation and provided technical support. The enablers and barriers to implementation were documented. From 1 April 2016 to 31 July 2017 we identified 5278 live births and of these, 1214 had a sign of PSBI. Assuming 30% of births were missed due to temporary migration to maternal homes for delivery care and approximately 45% cases came from outside the catchment area due to free availability of medicines, the treatment coverage was 97.3% (668 cases/6861 expected births) with an expected 10% PSBI prevalence within the first 2 months of life. Of 1214 infants with PSBI, 392 (32%) infants 7-59 days had only fast breathing (pneumonia), 338 (27.8%) infants 0-6 days had only fast breathing (severe pneumonia), 462 (38%) presented with signs of clinical severe infection (CSI) and 22 (1.8%) with signs of critical illness. All but two, 7-59 days old infants with pneumonia were treated with oral amoxicillin without a referral; 80% (312/390) adhered to full treatment; 97.7% (381/390) were cured, and no deaths were reported. Referral to the hospital was not accepted by 87.7% (721/822) families of infants presenting with signs of PSBI needing hospitalization (critical illness 5/22; clinical severe infection; 399/462 and severe pneumonia 317/338). They were treated on an outpatient basis with two days of injectable gentamicin and seven days of oral amoxicillin. Among these 81% (584/721) completed treatment; 97% (700/721) were cured, and three deaths were reported (two with critical illness and one with clinical severe infection). We identified health system gaps including lack of staff motivation and work strikes, medicines stockouts, sub-optimal home visits that affected implementation. When a referral is not feasible, outpatient treatment for young infants with signs of PSBI is possible within existing programme structures in Nigeria with high coverage and low case fatality. To scale up this intervention successfully, government commitment is needed to strengthen the health system, motivate and train health workers, provide necessary commodities, establish technical support for implementation and strengthen linkages with communities. Trial is registered on Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) ACTRN12617001373369. "
39,21420838,"Compliance with antibiotics is essential to ensure treatment efficacy and to prevent the emergence of bacterial resistant stains. In children who take oral form, the palatability and the frequency of administration seem to be factors important to good compliance. This observational study was designed to assess the acceptability of oral antibiotics (including generics) commonly prescribed to children by primary care physicians in France. It was given to 50 pediatricians and 50 GPs in private practice. For each patient, the physician and parents completed a questionnaire, and parents filled out a log for each drug intake. Between September 2006 and September 2007, 91 physicians enrolled 2400 children and 1482 patient records are fully assessable. The two factors that improve significantly compliance are administration in two doses by day (OR 2.2 [95% CI 1 6-3]) and acceptability ≥80% (OR 2.6, [95% CI 1.9-3.7]). The acceptability was better for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 65.4% (95% CI [57.6 to 72.4]) than for cefpodoxime 47.1% (95% CI [43.8-50.4]) or cefuroxime axetil 26% (95% [CI 15.9-39.6]). Conversely, cefpodoxime proxetil obtained a better score for compliance 91.8% (95% CI [89.8 to 93.4) as amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 84.6% (95%CI 80.8 to 87.8) because of its mode of administration in two doses per day. There is no difference between the amoxicillin clavulanic acid reference product and its generics as a whole, however a large variability exists between generics. If, for antibiotics prescribed in two doses per day, the two administrations by day are roughly equidistant, it is not the same for those prescribed three times a day: indeed, while the doses taken are identical, only four hours separate the first intake of the morning from the second intake in mid-day and more than 12 hours between the evening dose from the next morning intake. This study confirms the disparity in terms of acceptability among the different antibiotics prescribed for children even for the same drug, warranting evaluation for marketing of future generic drugs pediatric oral suspension. The disparity ranges for drugs three times daily asking consequences pharmacokinetics and dosage adjustment for a transition to two doses per day. "
40,29501295,"Acute otitis media (AOM) is predominantly a disease of childhood and one of the common reasons for prescribing antibiotics. Ear pain is the main symptom of AOM, with the result that parents frequently seek immediate medical assistance for their children. Antibiotic therapy for AOM does not provide symptomatic relief in the first 24 hours, and analgesics are commonly recommended for relieving the pain associated with AOM. The aims of the present study were to assess pediatricians' attitudes toward AOM and ear pain management in Turkey. This multicenter descriptive questionnaire study was conducted in 20 centers from different geographic locations in Turkey, with 977 pediatricians, between June 2015 and December 2016. The questionnaire comprised 20 questions focusing on the pediatricians' sociodemographic variables, experiences, and treatment related to AOM and ear pain. Of the pediatricians, 58.2% were residents, 36.5% were specialists, and 4.3% were lecturers. Most participants were working in a university hospital (54.8%) or education and research hospital (32.2%). In general daily practice, the AOM diagnosis rates were between 6% and 20% in outpatient clinics, and 52.3% of the participants stated the patients complained about ear pain in pediatric clinics. The watchful waiting (WW) rate, as opposed to immediate antibiotic treatment, was 39.8% for all the pediatricians. The pediatric residents used the WW strategy less than the specialists and lecturers did (p = 0.004). The rates of the WW strategy were higher in outpatient clinics where AOM was commonly diagnosed (p < 0.001). The most common antibiotic prescribed for AOM was amoxicillin clavulanate (76.7%). The mean recommended treatment period for AOM was 9.3 ± 2.2 days. The choices for systemic ear pain treatment were acetaminophen (26.8%), ibuprofen (29.4%), and alternating between ibuprofen and acetaminophen (43.9%). Moreover, 34.6% of the participants recommended topical agents for otalgia. Topical agents were more commonly recommended by the pediatric residents than specialists or lecturers (p < 0.001). Finally, 58.3% of pediatricians had experiences of the parents' usage of a variety of herbal and folk remedies, such as breast milk or olive oil, for their children's ear pain. Amoxicillin clavulanate was the most frequently prescribed antibiotic for AOM. WW was approved by the pediatricians, and having more AOM patients was a significant factor in the physicians' choice of WW; nevertheless, the WW rate was poor. Implementation of educational intervention strategies will help pediatricians in improving their compliance with evidence-based guidelines for AOM treatment. Otalgia is taken seriously by parents and pediatricians, and otalgia treatment seems to be well accepted in Turkey for providing symptomatic relief and enhancing the patients' quality of life. "
41,33108920,"To gain an overview of the current management of patients with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) in Swiss maternity hospitals. We conducted a survey among all maternity hospitals in Switzerland from January to December 2018, irrespective of their annual birth rate and level of complexity. The survey consisted of an 11-item questionnaire, which was developed to retrieve information relevant to different areas of PPROM management. Of 64 questionnaires distributed by email, 36 (56.3%) centers responded to the survey. Up to 12 different antibiotic regimens were reported. Among these, 91.7% included a beta-lactam, with amoxicillin as the preferred agent (55.6%). Combined antibiotic schemes were used in 30.6% of hospitals. All centers considered the use of corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity if PPROM occurred before 34 weeks, although 36.1% would consider their use until 37 weeks' gestation in the presence of an increased risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Maternity hospitals who accept deliveries at any gestational age usually used magnesium sulfate as fetal neuroprotection when delivering babies <32 weeks, with the exception of two hospitals where it was either not used or only indicated if maternal preeclampsia was present. Concerning the time to delivery, 58.3% centers tended to wait until 37 weeks' gestation, while the others considered that it was not necessary to go beyond 34 weeks. Our survey shows that the current management of PPROM in Switzerland appears to be mostly in line with international recommendations. However, some heterogeneity exists, thus reflecting a lack of international consensus across guidelines, together with the absence of national Swiss guidelines, and this needs to be addressed to ensure high quality care for all patients and neonates.

42,24237429,"Escherichia coli is the most frequently isolated microorganism from both community-acquired and nosocomial urinary tract infections in Turkey. A large number of studies concerning antibiotic susceptibility of E.coli have been published from different centers throughout the country. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibiotic resistance patterns of E.coli strains isolated from urine cultures by a meta-analysis in published medical literature between the years of 1996-2012 in Turkey. The study was planned and conducted in accordance with the declaration of PRISMA and describes the methods of literature search, the determining criteria for inclusion and evaluation of articles, data collection and statistical analysis. To find the published series Google Scholar and PubMed international databases were used to access published manuscripts evaluated according to the determined criteria for acceptance and rejection. For each study, general data and antibiotic resistance rates were collected as a common unit. Publications considered as lacking in appropriate content was eliminated from the study. Statistical analysis of the data obtained were 95% confidence intervals, and p≤ 0.05 value was considered as significant difference. A total of 228 articles were found to be published during 1996-2012 period, while 101 of them were included in the meta-analysis according to the eligibility criteria. The analyses indicated that nitrofurantoin and piperacillin resistance rates have been decreased, whereas ciprofloxacin, cefepime, co-trimoxazole and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) positivity rates have been increased during the study period. The increases in the rates of ciprofloxacin and cefepime resistance and and ESBL production were statistically-significant (p< 0.05). A significant reduction in resistance rates for ampicilin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and amikacin was noted in pediatric patients between 2002-2012. Ceftriaxone, imipenem, gentamicin and amikacin resistance were not homogenous between the geographical regions, and statistically significant differences were observed for amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime and ciprofloxacin resistance rates (p< 0.05). Antibiotic resistance rates, except for imipenem, in bacterial strains, isolated from hospitalized patients were found significantly higher in strains obtained from outpatients. The differences between those groups were significant in terms of ampicilin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, amikacin and cefepime resistances (p< 0.05). It has been noted that antibiotic resistance patterns of E.coli strains isolated from urine cultures between 1996-2012 demonstrated significant variability, and many studies were based only on laboratory data. The results of this meta-analysis demonstrated that the resistance rates in commonly-used antibiotics for empirical therapy were high. In conclusion, information obtained by systematic evaluation of national data will be valuable for the determination of optimal antibiotic regimens and in prevention of unnecessary antibiotic use. "
43,33052981,"The World Health Organization (WHO) launched a guideline in 2015 for managing Possible Serious Bacterial Infection (PSBI) when referral is not feasible in young infants aged 0-59 days. This guideline was implemented across 303 Basic Health Unit (BHU) Plus primary health care (PHC) facilities in peri-urban and rural settings of Sindh, Pakistan. We evaluated the implementation of PSBI guideline, and the quality of care provided to sick young infants at these facilities. Thirty (10%) out of 303 BHU Plus facilities were randomly selected for evaluation. A survey team visited each facility for one day, assessed the health system support, observed the management of sick young infants by health care providers (HCP), validated their management, interviewed HCPs and caretakers of sick infants. HCPs who were unable to see a young infant on the day of survey were evaluated using pre-prepared case scenarios. Thirty (100%) BHU Plus facilities had oral amoxicillin, injectable gentamicin, thermometers, baby weighing scales and respiratory timers available; 29 (97%) had disposable syringes and needles; 28 (93%) had integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI)/PSBI chart booklets and job aids and 18 (60%) had a functional ambulance. Each facility had at least one HCP trained in PSBI, and 21 (70%) facilities had been visited by a supervisor in the preceding six months. Of 42 HCPs, 19 (45.3%) were trained within the preceding 12 months. During the survey, 26 sick young infants were identified in 18 facilities. HCPs asked about history of breastfeeding in 23 (89%) infants, history of vomiting in 17 (65%), and history of convulsions in 14 (54%); weighed 25 (97%) infants; measured respiratory rate in all (100%) and temperature in 24 (92%); assessed 20 (77%) for movement and 14 (54%) for chest indrawing. HCPs identified two infants with fast breathing pneumonia and managed them correctly per IMCI/PSBI protocol. HCPs identified six (23%) infants with clinical severe infection (CSI), two of them were referred to a higher-level facility, only one accepted the referral advice. Only one CSI patient was managed correctly per IMCI/PSBI protocol at the outpatient level. HCPs described the PSBI danger signs to eight (31%) caretakers. Caretakers of five infants with CSI and two with pneumonia were not counselled for PSBI danger signs. Five of the six CSI cases categorized by HCPs were validated as CSI on re-examination, whereas one had pneumonia. Similarly, one of the two pneumonia patients categorized by HCPs had CSI and one identified as local bacterial infection was classified as CSI upon re-examination. Health system support was adequate but clinical management and counselling by HCPs was sub-optimal particularly with CSI cases who are at higher risk of adverse outcomes. Scaling up PSBI management is potentially feasible in PHC facilities in Pakistan, provided that HCPs are trained well and mentored, receive refresher training to appropriately manage sick young infants, and have adequate supplies and counselling skills.

44,32650737,"There is no current standard rescue treatment for dual drug-resistant strains of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). This aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of rifabutin-based triple therapy for patients infected with dual drug-resistant strains to clarithromycin and levofloxacin. After 2 or 3 H. pylori treatment failures, patients underwent upper endoscopy with tissue biopsies. Phenotypic and genotypic resistances were determined using agar dilution test and polymerase chain reaction with direct sequencing, respectively. Patients infected with dual drug-resistant (clarithromycin and levofloxacin) strains and receiving rifabutin-based triple therapy (rifabutin 150 mg bid, amoxicillin 1 g bid and esomeprazole 40 mg bid for 10 days) were enrolled. Eradication status was determined by 13C-urea breath test 4 weeks after treatment completion. A total of 39 patients infected with dual drug-resistant strains were enrolled in this study, with a mean age of 55.9 years. The eradication rate was 79.5% (31/39) (95% confidence intervals: 54.96% ~ 111.40%). Adverse event was reported in 23.1% (9/39) of patients but they were mild and tolerable. In univariate analysis, no factor was identified as an independent predictor of eradication failure. Our current study demonstrated that rifabutin-based triple therapy was well tolerated and yielded an acceptable eradication rate for patients infected with dual drug-resistant strains of H. pylori. "
45,22407247,"The aim of this study is to describe the epidemiological and microbiological characteristics and outcome of children with septicemia at the Charles de Gaulle University Pediatric Hospital of Ouagadougou to help improve probabilistic antibiotic therapy in this type of infection. This retrospective descriptive study covered all the children from 0 to 15 years old seen over a period of 7 years in any hospital department with suspected bacteriemia and for whom the bacteriology laboratory performed a blood culture. During the study period, the laboratory received 842 requests for blood cultures and found 154 (18.3%) of them to be positive. Files for 81 of the 154 patients could be found and examined. The distribution according to age showed septicemia was most frequent among those aged 6-15 years (61.7% of the cases). Microbial identification showed the dominant species to be Salmonella enterica (serovars paratyphi and typhi) (58%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (12.3%). The salmonella isolates had a high rate of resistance to amoxicillin, chloramphenicol and cotrimoxazole. Staphylococci were always sensitive to the antibiotics with which they were tested, although to a lesser extent for penicillin G. All patients routinely received antibiotic treatment, and 81.5% (n=66) were cured (5 children died and 10 left the hospital against medical advice). This study shows that the bacterial epidemiology of septicemia in our setting is dominated by salmonella. Trends in bacterial resistance to antibiotics showed that common antibiotics such as amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole are no longer acceptable as probabilist therapy here. They should be replaced in this type of infection by injectable third generation cephalosporin alone or combined with aminoglycosides. "
46,8032405,"Clinicians all too often face the difficult dilemma of deciding whether a bone fracture in a young child was intentional. A structured expert consensus process suggests that all rib fractures; midshaft or metaphyseal fractures of the humerus; and fractures of the radius, ulna, tibia, or fibula in children younger than 1 year of age are highly likely to have been caused by abuse. Abused children are more likely to have negative social relationships with other children than their school-aged peers. Research on the causes of sudden infant death syndrome is still confounded by the likelihood that some deaths for which the label was misapplied are included in many studies; however, the presence of smokers in the household in the postnatal period appears to be yet another factor associated with increased risk. Congenital syphilis is on the rise. Detection of infants who have been infected is incomplete. Lack of prenatal care is strongly associated with infection. Cord serology is not sensitive enough to detect all possible cases. Testing of both maternal and neonatal sera results in detection of more infants at risk. Current tests still result in the treatment of some infants who are not themselves infected. Amoxicillin clavulante given twice daily rather then thrice, cefixime given once a day, and a single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone have all shown acceptable--though not exceptional--cure rates for otitis media. Price is a consideration. Fewer courses of antibiotics would be necessary if more infants were breastfed. Exclusively breastfeeding to at least 4 months cuts the number of bouts of otitis media almost in half.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) "
47,34370744,"Of 2.5 million newborn deaths each year, serious neonatal infections are a leading cause of neonatal death for which inpatient treatment is recommended. However, manysick newborns in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia do not have access to inpatientcare. A World Health Organization (WHO) guideline recommends simplified antibiotic treatment atan outpatient level for young infants up to two months of age with possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI), when referral is not feasible.We implemented this guidelinein Ethiopia to increase coverage of treatment and to learn about potential facilitating factors and barriers for implementation. We conducted implementation research in two districts (Tiro Afata and Gera) in Jimma Zone, Ethiopia, to learn about the feasibility of implementing the WHO PSBI guideline within a programme setting using the existing health care structure. We conducted orientation meetings and policy dialogue with key stakeholders and trained health extension workers and health centre staff to identify and manage sick young infants with PSBI signs at a primary health care unit. We established a Technical Support Unit (TSU) to facilitate programme learning, built health workers' capacity and provided support for quality control, monitoring and data collection.We sensitized the community to appropriate care-seeking and supported the health care system in implementation. The research team collected data using structured case recording forms. From September 2016 to August 2017, 6185 live births and 601 sick young infants 0-59 days of age with signs of PSBI were identified. Assuming that 25% of births were missed (total births 7731) and 10% of births had an episode of PSBI in the first two months of life, the coverage of appropriate treatment for PSBI was 77.7% (601/773). Of 601 infants with PSBI, fast breathing only (pneumonia) was recorded in 432 (71.9%) infants 7-59 days of age; signs of clinical severe infection (CSI) in 155 (25.8%) and critical illnessin 14 (2.3%). Of the 432 pneumonia cases who received oral amoxicillin treatment without referral, 419 (97.0%) were successfully treated without any deaths. Of 169 sick young infants with either CSI or critical illness, only 110 were referred to a hospital; 83 did not accept referral advice and received outpatient injectable gentamicin plus oral amoxicillin treatment either at a health post or health centre. Additionally, 59 infants who should have been referred, but were not received injectable gentamicin plus oral amoxicillin outpatient treatment. Of infants with CSI, 129 (82.2%) were successfully treated as outpatients, while two died (1.3%). Of 14 infants with critical illness, the caregivers of five accepted referral to a hospital, and nine were treated with simplified antibiotics on an outpatient basis. Two of 14 (14.3%) infants with critical illness died within 14 days of initial presentation. In settings where referral to a hospital is not feasible, young infants with PSBI can be treated on an outpatient basis at either a health post or health centre, which can contribute to saving many lives. Scaling-up will require health system strengthening including community mobilization. Trial is registered on Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials registry (ANZCTR) ACTRN12617001373369. "
48,33544712,"Neonatal bacterial infections are a common cause of death, which can be managed well with inpatient treatment. Unfortunately, many families in low resource settings do not accept referral to a hospital. The World Health Organization (WHO) developed a guideline for management of young infants up to 2 months of age with possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) when referral is not feasible. Government of Ethiopia with WHO evaluated the feasibility of implementing this guideline to increase coverage of treatment. The objective of this study was to implement a simplified antibiotic regimen (2 days gentamicin injection and 7 days oral amoxicillin) for management of sick young infants with PSBI in a programme setting when referral was not feasible to identify at least 80% of PSBI cases, achieve an overall adequate treatment coverage of at least 80% and document the challenges and opportunities for implementation at the community level in two districts in Tigray, Ethiopia. Using implementation research, we applied the PSBI guideline in a programme setting from January 2016 to August 2017 in Raya Alamata and Raya Azebo Woredas (districts) in Southern Tigray, Ethiopia with a population of 260884. Policy dialogue was held with decision-makers, programme implementers and stakeholders at federal, regional and district levels, and a Technical Support Unit (TSU) was established. Health Extension Workers (HEWs) working at the health posts and supervisors working at the health centres were trained in WHO guideline to manage sick young infants when referral was not feasible. Communities were sensitized towards appropriate home care. We identified 854 young infants with any sign of PSBI in the study population of 7857 live births. The expected live births during the study period were 9821. Assuming 10% of neonates will have any sign of PSBI within the first 2 months of life (n = 982), the coverage of appropriate treatment of PSBI cases in our study area was 87% (854/982). Of the 854 sick young infants, 333 (39%) were taken directly to a hospital and 521 (61%) were identified by HEW at health posts. Of the 521 young infants, 27 (5.2%) had signs of critical illness, 181 (34.7%) had signs of clinical severe infection, whereas 313 (60.1%) young infants 7-59 days of age had only fast breathing pneumonia. All young infants with critical illness accepted referral to a hospital, while 117/181 (64.6%) infants with clinical severe infection accepted referral. Families of 64 (35.3%) infants with clinical severe infection refused referral and were treated at the health post with injectable gentamicin for 2 days plus oral amoxicillin for 7 days. All 64 completed recommended gentamicin doses and 63/64 (98%) completed recommended amoxicillin doses. Of 313 young infants, 7-59 days with pneumonia who were treated by the HEWs without referral with oral amoxicillin for 7 days, 310 (99%) received all 14 doses. No deaths were reported among those treated on an outpatient basis at health posts. But 35/477 (7%) deaths occurred among young infants treated at hospital. When referral is not feasible, young infants with PSBI can be managed appropriately at health posts by HEWs in the existing health system in Ethiopia with high coverage, low treatment failure and a low case fatality rate. Moreover, fast breathing pneumonia in infants 7-59 days of age can be successfully treated at the health post without referral. Relatively higher mortality in sick young infants at the referral level health facilities warrants further investigation. "
49,26089185,"Severe delayed drug-induced skin reactions in children are not common but potentially serious. This article describes aspects concerning the etiology, pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of these processes; it presents three paediatric cases, namely STS (Steven Johnson Syndrome), TEN (toxic epidermal necrolysis), probably related to amoxicillin/clavulanate and ibuprofen and DRESS (a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) secondary to phenytoin; and in relation to them, the diagnosis and the treatment of these processes are discussed and reviewed. The AGEP (acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis) is also reviewed. The aetiological diagnosis of severe non-immediate reactions is difficult, and the value of current allergological testing is not well defined in these cases. Diagnosis is based on clinical history, the empirical risk of drugs to trigger SJS/TEN or DRESS, and the in vivo and in vitro testing of the suspect drug. Skin biopsy confirms that the clinical diagnosis and delayed hypersensitivity tests, especially the patch test and the lymphoblastic transformation test (LTT), may be important to confirm the aetiological diagnosis, in our cases emphasising the latter. These diseases can be life threatening (especially DRESS and TEN) and/or have a high rate of major complications or sequelae (SJS/TEN). The three cases described progressed well without sequelae. All were treated with corticosteroids, which is the most currently accepted treatment although the effect has not been clearly demonstrated. "
50,18661005,"Tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy still is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures in the world, mostly in the pediatric population. to study the impact of amoxicillin for 7 days in post-adenotonsillectomy recovery, comparing results with a control group. prospective, randomized, controlled study with 120 patients. the patients were randomized according to surgery time to receive 7 days of amoxicillin associated with pain killers, or analgesic alone. During the first week of postoperative, we assessed the level of pain, oral intake acceptance, nausea and vomits, fever and return to daily activities. It was only in the fourth post-operative day that the group receiving antibiotic agents showed a statistically significant difference as far as pain is concerned. There was no difference between the two groups for other data analyzed. considering the results from our study and reviewing the literature on the use of antibiotic agents, we agree that there is no improvement in patient recovery after adenotonsillectomy with the use of amoxicillin for 7 days in the postoperative.

51,35138390,"The objective was to achieve high coverage of possible serious bacterial infections (PSBI) treatment using the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline for managing it on an outpatient basis when referral to a hospital is not feasible. We implemented this guideline in the programme settings at 10 Basic Health Units (BHU) in two rural districts of Sindh in Pakistan using implementation research. A Technical Support Unit supported the programme to operationalize guidelines, built capacity of health workers through training, monitored their clinical skills, mentored them and assured quality. The community-based health workers visited households to identify sick infants and referred them to the nearest BHU for further management. The research team collected data. Of 17 600 identified livebirths, 1860 young infants with any sign of PSBI sought care at BHUs and 1113 (59.8%) were brought by families. We achieved treatment coverage of 95%, assuming an estimated 10% incidence of PSBI in the first 2 months of life and that 10% of young infants came from outside the study catchment area. All 923 infants (49%; 923/1860) 7-59 days old with only fast breathing (pneumonia) treated with outpatient oral amoxicillin were cured. Hospital referral was refused by 83.4% (781/937) families who accepted outpatient treatment; 92.2% (720/781) were cured and 0.8% (6/781) died. Twelve (7.6%; 12/156) died among those treated in a hospital. It is feasible to achieve high coverage by implementing WHO PSBI management guidelines in a programmatic setting when a referral is not feasible. "

The eradication rate of the first-line triple therapy with a PPI+ amoxicillin+clarithromycin is falling to about 70%. A triple therapy with a PPI+ amoxicillin+metronidazole is acceptable as the second-line therapy. According to recent reports, the clarithromycin resistance rate is more than 40% in Japanese children. Antibiotics susceptibility testing before first-line therapies is taken into account. There is no available data about sequential therapy in Japanese children. The 13C-urea breath test and/or stool antigen test are recommended for confirmation of eradication at least 4 to 8 weeks following completion of therapy. "
53,16010300,"As an update to previously published recommendations for the management of Helicobacter pylori infection, an evidence-based appraisal of 14 topics was undertaken in a consensus conference sponsored by the Canadian Helicobacter Study Group. The goal was to update guidelines based on the best available evidence using an established and uniform methodology to address and formulate recommendations for each topic. The degree of consensus for each recommendation is also presented. The clinical issues addressed and recommendations made were: population-based screening for H. pylori in asymptomatic children to prevent gastric cancer is not warranted; testing for H. pylori in children should be considered if there is a family history of gastric cancer; the goal of diagnostic interventions should be to determine the cause of presenting gastrointestinal symptoms and not the presence of H. pylori infection; recurrent abdominal pain of childhood is not an indication to test for H. pylori infection; H. pylori testing is not required in patients with newly diagnosed gastroesophageal reflux disease; H. pylori testing may be considered before the use of long-term proton pump inhibitor therapy; testing for H. pylori infection should be considered in children with refractory iron deficiency anemia when no other cause has been found; when investigation of pediatric patients with persistent or severe upper abdominal symptoms is indicated, upper endoscopy with biopsy is the investigation of choice; the 13C-urea breath test is currently the best noninvasive diagnostic test for H. pylori infection in children; there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend stool antigen tests as acceptable diagnostic tools for H. pylori infection; serological antibody tests are not recommended as diagnostic tools for H. pylori infection in children; first-line therapy for H. pylori infection in children is a twice-daily, triple-drug regimen comprised of a proton pump inhibitor plus two antibiotics (clarithromycin plus amoxicillin or metronidazole); the optimal treatment period for H. pylori infection in children is 14 days; and H. pylori culture and antibiotic sensitivity testing should be made available to monitor population antibiotic resistance and manage treatment failures.

54,31971139,"The main objective of this study was to assess whether training of private health providers and community sensitization on the importance of effective prompt care seeking and the need for referral could improve treatment of sick children in the private health sector in Uganda. Private providers were trained to diagnose and treat sick children according to the integrated community case management (iCCM) guidelines. In the control arm, routine services were offered. The outcomes were seeking care within 24 hours of onset of symptoms and appropriate case management for malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea among children aged < 5 years. A total of 10,809 sick children (5,955 in the intervention arm and 4,854 in the control arm) presented for diagnosis and treatment. The percentage seeking care within 24 hours of onset of symptoms was 45.4% (95% CI 36.0-48.8) in the intervention arm versus 43.9% (95% CI 38.1-49.8) in the control arm ( "
55,19000857,"The skin infections are common in pediatrics, ranging from furonculosis or impetigo to the severe forms of necrotizing dermohypodermitis. The general antibiotic treatments are not always indicated but when they are, they must take into account the resistance of two main species of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes), the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamic parameters and the severity and type of infection. Two situations should be treated by topical treatements: limited impetigo and furonculosis. The two topical antibiotics used preferentially are mupirocine and fucidic acid. Soon, a third topical antibiotic, reptamuline will complete these. For uncomplicated superficial skin infections justifying an oral antibiotic, amoxicillin-clavulanate offers the best guarantee of efficiency. Poor pharmacodynamic-pharmacokinetic must lead to not prescribe oral M penicillins. In case of allergy, a first-generation cephalosporin, a macrolide (if the susceptibility of the strain was checked) or pristinamycine (after 6 years of age) are acceptable alternatives. For dermohypodermitis bacterial antibiotic of choice remains amoxicillin-clavulanate through IV route, to be active against S. pyogenes but also S. aureus and anaerobic bacteria. The IV route is maintained until regression general signs and a relay orally by the same drug is then possible. For toxinic syndromes and necrozing fascitis clindamycin should be added to a beta-lactam because of its action on protein synthesis in particular reducing the toxins production. "

57,20027983,"A first urinary tract infection (UTI) in childhood is more prevalent in females < 5-years-old. Circumcision generally protects males from UTI, however, during the month following the procedure, the prevalence of infection increases up to 12 times in circumcised boys when compared with those not circumcised. Almost all the infections are caused by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria of which E. coli are responsible for 70-90% of the cases. Signs and symptoms of UTI vary in different age groups. Factors associated with the likelihood of UTI are: non-circumcised male, fever > 40 degrees C, and a fever > 39 degrees C for more than 48 hours with no other focus of infection on physical examination. Urinalysis and urine microscopy are screening tests for UTI. In children with clinical symptoms and signs suggesting UTI, the results of these tests have a positive predictive value (if both are positive), or negative predictive value (if both are negative) approximating 100%. The definitive diagnosis of UTI is based on the urine culture. Bag urine culture is associated with a very high rate of contamination. Therefore, in non-toilet trained children, urine culture should be obtained directly from the urinary bladder either by supra pubic aspiration or in and out transurethral catheterization. Mid stream clean voided urine specimens obtained from circumcised males in the first months of life are also acceptable. Depending on the clinical presentation, oral therapy can begin from as early as two months of age, and the recommended empiric drugs for first febrile UTI are cefuroxime axetil, or amoxicillin clavulanate. Cephlexin is recommended for cystitis. "
58,7792129,"Most authorities continue to recommend penicillin as the treatment of choice for group A streptococcal pharyngitis. If penicillin is used, 10 days of treatment are necessary to achieve a clinical and bacteriologic cure. The usually recommended penicillin V dose is 250 mg (400,000 IU) three times daily. Twice daily dosing is acceptable to some authorities if compliance is good. However, oral penicillin fails to eradicate group A streptococci from the pharynx in up to 17% of cases; in some studies 30% failure rates have been reported. Several European and United States studies indicate that a variety of oral cephalosporins, when used for 10 days, are significantly superior to penicillin V in eradicating group A streptococci from the pharynx. For example cefpodoxime proxetil given twice daily for 10 days is comparable to penicillin V given three times daily for 10 days in achieving a clinical cure and appears to be significantly superior to penicillin in eradicating group A streptococci from the pharynx. Preliminary studies from Europe and the United States strongly suggest that 5-day therapy with cefpodoxime (or other selected oral cephalosporins) is at least as effective, clinically and microbiologically, as 10-day therapy with penicillin V. Further clinical trials are warranted to confirm the adequacy of 5-day treatment and to assess the efficacy of cefpodoxime and other agents in preventing rheumatic fever. "
59,19999117,"Proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapies are performed worldwide for Helicobacter pylori-associated diseases in childhood. As the first-line therapy, the Japanese Pediatric Guideline in H. pylori Infection has recommended a triple regimen with amoxicillin and clarithromycin, because the Japanese national health care insurance system has permitted only this regimen. However, the primary resistance to clarithromycin in Japan is demonstrated in around 30% of the strains, leaving an urgent issue for the physicians. A triple regimen with amoxicillin and metronidazole is acceptable as the second-line therapy. In children with chronic H. pylori gastritis, eradication should be considered if they have gastric atrophy or a family history of gastric cancer. In children, however, a 'test and treat' strategy to prevent gastric cancer is not recommended. "
60,24064294,"To document the trends of sensitivity and to find whether it is necessary to change antibiotics in selected patients according to the sensitivity test results in our clinical practice. We collected urine culture results from 0-18-year-old patients in the National Taiwan University Hospital from January 1, 2003 to October 31, 2012. Their medical chart was reviewed to identify true pathogens responsible for their urinary tract infection (UTI). We checked the percentage of susceptibility of these pathogens to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate (AMC), cefazolin, cefmetazole, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline. The extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases (ESBLs) rate was also checked. In addition, we reviewed the treatment response of different antibiotics. Defervescence within 48 hours after initial antibiotics use was considered responsive. A total of 7758 urine cultures positive for Escherichia coli infection were collected during the 10-year period. The E. coli cefazolin susceptibility rate was 62-73% during 2003-2010, but it dropped to 23% in 2011 and 28% in 2012 after the new CLSI guideline (M100-S21) was released. However, other antibiotics did not show a significant difference. In UTI caused by E. coli, on average, the sensitivity rates for various antibiotics were as follows: cefmetazole, 90%; ceftriaxone, 85%; gentamicin, 77%; AMC, 61%; TMP-SMX, 47%; and ampicillin, 20%. The ESBL rate was also found to increase (2-11%; p < 0.01). The overall response rate of UTI caused by E. coli to first-line antibiotics such as first-generation cephalosporin and/or gentamicin was 78%. The susceptibility of common urinary tract pathogens to cefazolin has decreased dramatically since 2010. This trend may be due to the change in the CLSI guideline. Although the susceptibility rate to first-line empirical antibiotics shows a decreasing trend, we found that the clinical response was acceptable for our first-line empirical antibiotics. "
61,28611102,"The World Health Organization recently provided guidelines for outpatient treatment of possible severe bacterial infections (PSBI) in young infants, when referral to hospital is not feasible. This study evaluated newborn infection treatment at the most peripheral level of the health system in rural Ethiopia. We performed a cluster-randomized trial in 22 geographical clusters (11 allocated to intervention, 11 to control). In both arms, volunteers and government-employed Health Extension Workers (HEWs) conducted home visits to pregnant and newly delivered mothers; assessed newborns; and counseled caregivers on prevention of newborn illness, danger signs, and care seeking. Volunteers referred sick newborns to health posts for further assessment; HEWs referred newborns with PSBI signs to health centers. In the intervention arm only, between July 2011 and June 2013, HEWs treated newborns with PSBI with intramuscular gentamicin and oral amoxicillin for 7 days at health posts when referral to health centers was not possible or acceptable to caregivers. Intervention communities were informed of treatment availability at health posts to encourage care seeking. Masking was not feasible. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality of newborns 2-27 days after birth, measured by household survey data. Baseline data were collected between June 2008 and May 2009; endline data, between February 2013 and June 2013. We sought to detect a 33% mortality reduction. Analysis was by intention to treat. (ClinicalTrials.gov registry: NCT00743691). Of 1,011 sick newborns presenting at intervention health posts, 576 (57%) were identified by HEWs as having at least 1 PSBI sign; 90% refused referral and were treated at the health post, with at least 79% completing the antibiotic regimen. Estimated treatment coverage at health posts was in the region of 50%. Post-day 1 neonatal mortality declined more in the intervention arm (17.9 deaths per 1,000 live births at baseline vs. 9.4 per 1,000 at endline) than the comparison arm (14.4 per 1,000 vs. 11.2 per 1,000, respectively). After adjusting for baseline mortality and region, the estimated post-day 1 mortality risk ratio was 0.83, but the result was not statistically significant (95% confidence interval, 0.55 to 1.24;  When referral to higher levels of care is not possible, HEWs can deliver outpatient antibiotic treatment of newborns with PSBI, but estimated treatment coverage in a rural Ethiopian setting was only around 50%. While our data suggest a mortality reduction consistent with that which might be expected at this level of coverage, they do not provide conclusive results. "
62,31870334,"Community acquired pneumonia is responsible for 16% of under 5 mortality in India, probably due to delayed recognition and qualified care seeking. Therefore these deaths could possibly be averted by creating community awareness and promoting care seeking from qualified physicians in the government system. The objective of study was to assess the effectiveness of facility-based and village-based behavior change communication interventions delivered to community using validated information, education and communication materials, along with infrastructural strengthening of health facilities, for change in care seeking from government system for community acquired pneumonia in rural Lucknow, India. Community based open labeled behavioral trial in 2 by 2 factorial design was conducted in eight rural blocks of Lucknow, northern India. Trained community health workers conducted Pneumonia Awareness Sessions once a month for the care givers of children using validated information, education and communication materials either at the villages or at government health facilities. Prior infrastructural strengthening of public health facilities was done to provide optimal care to cases. Pre packed pneumonia drug kits were provided which had amoxicillin, paracetamol and an instruction card on their use as well as pictorial representation of danger signs of pneumonia. Study lasted from October 2015 to September 2018. Adherence to conduct of facility-based intervention was 93.0% (279/300) and to village-based intervention was 73.4% (7638/10410). In village-based intervention there was 79.3% (p < 0.0001) increase from a baseline of 3.3% (14/420) and facility-based intervention 68.9% (p = 0.02) increase from a baseline of 5.35% (21/392) in cases of possible pneumonia treated at government health facilities. Conduct of structured pneumonia awareness session using validated information, education and communication material at village level with infrastructural strengthening resulted in improved qualified care seeking from government facilities for community acquired pneumonia.

63,20100746,"Observation without initial antibiotic therapy was accepted as an option for acute otitis media (AOM) management in the 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians clinical practice guideline. The guideline also recommended amoxicillin as the first-line treatment for most children, and analgesic treatment to reduce pain if it was present. Our objective was to compare the management of AOM after publication of the 2004 guideline. We analyzed the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 2002-2006 (N = 1114), which occurred in US physicians' offices. The patients were children aged 6 months to 12 years who were diagnosed with AOM. The time comparisons were the 30-month periods before and after the guideline. The main outcome was the encounter rate at which no antibiotic-prescribing was reported. Secondary outcomes were the identification of factors associated with encounters at which no antibiotic-prescribing was reported and antibiotic- and analgesic-prescribing rates. The rate of AOM encounters at which no antibiotic-prescribing was reported did not change after guideline publication (11%-16%; P = .103). Independent predictors of an encounter at which no antibiotic-prescribing was reported were the absence of ear pain, absence of reported fever, and receipt of an analgesic prescription. After guideline publication, the rate of amoxicillin-prescribing increased (40%-49%; P = .039), the rate of amoxicillin/clavulanate-prescribing decreased (23%-16%; P = .043), the rate of cefdinir-prescribing increased (7%-14%; P = .004), and the rate of analgesic-prescribing increased (14%-24%; P = .038). Although management of AOM without antibiotics has not increased after the publication of the 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians clinical practice guideline, children who did not receive antibiotics were more likely to have mild infections. In accordance with the guideline, the prescribing of amoxicillin and analgesics has increased. Contrary to the guideline, the prescribing of amoxicillin/clavulanate has decreased, whereas the prescribing of cefdinir has increased. "
64,26774460,"The objectives of our study were to analyse the prescriptions of antibiotics and assessing the relevance of pharmacist interventions (PI) in outpatient consultations in a pediatric unit of a Teaching Hospital of Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study from May to December 2013. The analysis of antibiotic prescriptions was documented. The tool of PI classification validated by the French Society of Clinical Pharmacy was used. The PI rating was made by prescribers. This rating evolved from PI0 to PI3 depending on the severity of the clinical impact of the problem and to the severity of clinical consequences avoided by the PI. The relevance was evaluated by the PI acceptance rate by physicians and clinical evaluation of their impact. Our study included 150 patients with a mean age of 11.75 months and a sex ratio (M/F) of 2. The amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (27.2 %) and amoxicillin (22.3 %) were the most prescribed antibiotics. Sixty-three drug-related problems (DRPs) were detected on the antibiotic prescriptions. They were non-optimal drug administration plan (88.9 %) and underdose (11.1 %). The amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (61.9 %) and josamycin (17.4 %) were the most affected by these DRPs. PI were related to the precision of modes of drug administration (88.9 %) and dose adjustments (11.1 %). The prescribers accepted 93.7 % of PIs. All accepted PIs was rated PI1 (significant clinical impact). PIs performed on antibiotic prescription were relevant with a high rate of acceptance and a significant clinical impact. "
65,16601883,"Persistent trimethylaminuria in children is caused by autosomal recessively inherited impairment of hepatic trimethylamine (TMA) oxidation due to deficiency of flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) secondary to mutations in the FMO3 gene. Trimethylaminuria or 'fish odour syndrome' is due to excessive excretion into body fluids and breath of TMA derived from the enterobacterial metabolism of dietary precursors. The disorder is present from birth but becomes apparent as foods containing high amounts of choline or of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) from marine (sea or saltwater) fish are introduced into the diet. In our experience, trimethylaminuria (FMO3 deficiency) in children is rare. We have compared the dynamics and diagnostic efficacy of choline loading with marine fish meals in six children with trimethylaminuria. Loading with a marine fish meal provides a simple and acceptable method for confirmation of diagnosis of suspected trimethylaminuria in children, with the effects being cleared more quickly than with a choline load test. However, oral loading with choline bitartrate allows estimation of residual oxidative capacity in vivo and is a useful adjunct to molecular studies. Patients homozygous for the 'common' P153L mutation in the FMO3 gene showed virtual complete lack of residual TMA N-oxidative capacity, consistent with a nonfunctional or absent FMO3 enzyme, whereas a patient with the M82T mutation showed some residual oxidative capacity. A patient compound heterozygous for two novel mutations, G193E and R483T, showed considerable residual N-oxidative capacity. A further patient, heterozygous for two novel sequence variations in the FMO3 gene, consistently showed malodour and elevated urinary TMA/TMAO ratios under basal conditions but a negative response to both choline and marine fish meal loading. Comparison of the effects of administration of antibiotics (metronidazole, amoxicillin, neomycin) on gut bacterial production of trimethylamine from choline showed they all reduced TMA production to a limited extent, with neomycin being most effective. 'Best-practice' diagnostic and treatment guidelines are summarized. "
66,3700293,"The pharmacokinetics of a syrup formulation consisting of four parts of amoxycillin and one part of potassium clavulanate (Augmentin) were studied in 11 paediatric patients, 3 to 14 years of age. Single oral doses of 25 mg of Augmentin per kg body weight (20 mg of amoxycillin per kg plus 5 mg of potassium clavulanate per kg, i.e. 1 mg of the syrup per kg) were administered on an empty stomach, and were well accepted and tolerated. Mean peak plasma concentrations 60-90 min after dosing were 7.2 mg/l for amoxycillin and 2.0 mg/l for clavulanic acid. Mean terminal phase plasma half-lives were 1.4 and 1.0 h, respectively. It is concluded that 25-mg/kg doses of this syrup formulation of Augmentin administered three times daily should be adequate therapy for various childhood bacterial infections. "
67,11106041,"To assess the incidence of cagA (cytotoxin-associated protein) and to evaluate its correlation with endoscopic-histologic findings and with eradication rate in a series of children affected by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) gastritis. Fifty consecutive H. pylori gastritis children (27M; median age 10 y and 11 mo) were tested for IgG cagA protein (Western Blot technique). Pretreatment H. pylori infection was assessed on the grounds of endoscopic antral biopsy specimens by means of rapid urease test and histologic examination (Giemsa staining). All the children were treated with omeprazole (1 mg/kg/d), clarithromycin (15 mg/kg/d) and amoxycillin (50 mg/kg/d) for 2 wk. According to universally accepted clinical practice, outcome of treatment was assessed by 13C urea breath test at least 6 wk after the end of therapy. Thirty-five children (70%) were seropositive to cagA+ protein (median age 11 y and 1 mo). Endoscopic findings of cagA+ patients were similar to those of cagA- patients. In cagA seropositive patients the severity of histologic gastritis was higher (p < 0.05) and the granulocytic infiltration more marked (p < 0.01) than in seronegative ones. In cagA+ children, H. pylori eradication rate was significantly lower (p < 0.02). cagA testing may be of useful clinical interest because its positivity can imply a more severe gastritis and a lower susceptibility to eradication treatment.

68,25859167,"Conversion of pediatric essential drugs from syrup to dispersible tablet formulations would require fixed dose options guided by the weight band in which a child falls or a proxy for weight, such as height or age. The purpose of this study was to determine whether weight, height, or age bands can be created that would lead to greater than 95% of children receiving a therapeutic dose of 6 commonly prescribed essential drugs, including paracetamol, iron sulfate, amoxicillin, co-trimoxazole (i.e., trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole), ciprofloxacin, and co-artemether (i.e., artemether/lumefantrine). Using World Health Organization growth standards, we created 4 weight bands and then matched them to height and age 50th percentile growth curves. The resulting weight, height, and age bands were then applied to Ugandan and Bangladeshi anthropometric data sets, and the percentage of children who would have received a correct therapeutic dose based upon weight, height, or age was determined. This percentage was interpreted as acceptable if >95%, marginal if 90% to 95% and unacceptable if <90%. Applying the 4 weight bands to the 6 selected drugs, greater than 95% of children would have received an acceptable therapeutic dose across the 4 weight bands for each of the 6 drugs tested. None of the drugs tested would deliver an acceptable therapeutic dose across all bands based upon height or age among Ugandan children, and only co-trimoxazole would have been delivered at acceptable therapeutic levels based upon these bands in Bangladeshi children. For the 6 drugs tested, dispersible tablets prescribed on the basis of a 4-dose regimen determined by weight bands would deliver an acceptable therapeutic dose greater than 95% of the time. Substituting weight for age or height bands would result in unacceptable levels of under- or overdosing. "
69,16645499,"To identify primary care physicians' familiarity with the 2004 acute otitis media (AOM) clinical practice guideline and to compare their practices with its recommendations. Mail survey October through December 2004 to all active physician members of the Slone Center Office-based Research Network, a national, practice-based, pediatric research network. The response rate was 276 of 469 (58.8%). Overall, 90.5% had read the guideline or summaries of it. Pneumatic otoscopy was always used by 16.2%, used half the time or more by 23.1%, used less than half the time by 34.6% and never used by 26.2%. Observation is considered a reasonable option for some AOM cases by 88.0% and, over the previous 3 months, these physicians used observation a median of 10% of the time (25th and 75th percentiles, 5% and 25%, respectively). In terms of concern that the observation option may increase AOM complications, 75.6% were not at all or only slightly concerned; 24.4% were moderately or very concerned. In general, these physicians have altered their antibiotic prescribing practices for AOM towards the guideline's recommendations since its publication. However, antibiotic choices deviated most widely from the guideline in cases of AOM with severe illness, where only 17.9% follow the recommendation for high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate, and in cases of children who fail treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate, where only 27.7% favor the recommended intramuscular ceftriaxone. Most physicians in this survey are familiar with the AOM guideline, but many do not follow its diagnostic and antibiotic recommendations. Observation for selected cases is acceptable to most of these physicians and is currently used in a small proportion of cases. "
70,25842221,"WHO recommends hospital-based treatment for young infants aged 0-59 days with clinical signs of possible serious bacterial infection, but most families in resource-poor settings cannot accept referral. We aimed to assess whether use of simplified antibiotic regimens to treat young infants with clinical signs of severe infection was as efficacious as an injectable procaine benzylpenicillin-gentamicin combination for 7 days for situations in which hospital referral was not possible. In a multisite open-label equivalence trial in DR Congo, Kenya, and Nigeria, community health workers visited all newborn babies at home, identifying and referring unwell young infants to a study nurse. We stratified young infants with clinical signs of severe infection whose parents did not accept referral to hospital by age (0-6 days and 7-59 days), and randomly assigned each individual within these strata to receive one of the four treatment regimens. Randomisation was stratified by age group of infants. An age-stratified randomisation scheme with block size of eight was computer-generated off-site at WHO. The outcome assessor was masked. We randomly allocated infants to receive injectable procaine benzylpenicillin-gentamicin for 7 days (group A, reference group); injectable gentamicin and oral amoxicillin for 7 days (group B); injectable procaine benzylpenicillin-gentamicin for 2 days, then oral amoxicillin for 5 days (group C); or injectable gentamicin for 2 days and oral amoxicillin for 7 days (group D). Trained health professionals gave daily injections and the first dose of oral amoxicillin. Our primary outcome was treatment failure by day 8 after enrolment, defined as clinical deterioration, development of a serious adverse event (including death), no improvement by day 4, or not cured by day 8. Independent outcome assessors, who did not know the infant's treatment regimen, assessed study outcomes on days 4, 8, 11, and 15. Primary analysis was per protocol. We used a prespecified similarity margin of 5% to assess equivalence between regimens. This study is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12610000286044. In Kenya and Nigeria, we started enrolment on April 4, 2011, and we enrolled the necessary number of young infants aged 7 days or older from Oct 17, 2011, to April 30, 2012. At these sites, we continued to enrol infants younger than 7 days until March 29, 2013. In DR Congo, we started enrolment on Sept 17, 2012, and continued until June 28, 2013. We randomly assigned 3564 young infants to either group A (n=894), group B (n=884), group C (n=896), or group D (n=890). We excluded 200 randomly assigned infants, who did not fulfil the predefined criteria of adherence to treatment and adequate follow-up. In the per-protocol analysis, 828 infants were included in group A, 826 in group B, 862 in group C, and 848 in group D. 67 (8%) infants failed treatment in group A compared with 51 (6%) infants in group B (risk difference -1·9%, 95% CI -4·4 to 0·1), 65 (8%) in group C (-0·6%, -3·1 to 2·0), and 46 (5%) in group D (-2·7%, -5·1 to 0·3). Treatment failure in groups B, C, and D was within the similarity margin compared with group A. During the 15 days after random allocation, 12 (1%) infants died in group A, compared with ten (1%) infants in group B, 20 (2%) infants in group C, and 11 (1%) infants in group D. An infant in group A had a serious adverse event other than death (injection abscess). The three simplified regimens were as effective as injectable procaine benzylpenicillin-gentamicin for 7 days on an outpatient basis in young infants with clinical signs of severe infection, without signs of critical illness, and whose caregivers did not accept referral for hospital admission.

71,10710025,"To evaluate the palatability of antimicrobial agents effective against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in American children. In a taste test of 4 antimicrobial agents, azithromycin (cherry flavored), cefprozil (bubble gum flavored), cefixime (strawberry flavored), and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (banana flavored) were compared. An urban inner-city primary care clinic. A volunteer sample of 30 healthy children (aged 5-8 years). Palatability was determined using a single-blind taste test of 4 flavored antimicrobial agents. The 4 antimicrobial agents used were azithromycin, cefprozil, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. After each antimicrobial test dose, subjects rated the taste on a 10-cm visual analog scale incorporating a facial hedonic scale. Preference assessments for the best-tasting and worst-tasting agent were also conducted. Of the 20 children who expressed a preference, significantly more children (9 [45%], P<.05) selected the cefixime preparation as the best-tasting formulation compared with the other preparations. The cefixime preparation was also significantly the least likely to be selected as the worst-tasting preparation (2 [10%], P<.05). There were no significant differences between the other 3 preparations with respect to being selected as either the best or worst tasting. The mean (+/- SD) visual analog scale score for cefixime was highest (8.53 [2.49]) compared with the scores for azithromycin (6.78 [3.45]), cefprozil (6.26 [4.04]), and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (6.24 [4.01]). The cefixime preparation was most commonly rated as best tasting by children. "
72,10608630,"Noncompliance with a prescribed therapy is a common problem in ambulatory pediatrics. To establish a nationwide status quo of compliance of German ambulatory pediatric patients with oral antibiotics prescribed for various bacterial infections. In this study, organized and financed by the German Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases, 42 pediatricians in private practice who were selected to represent the 3 main regions of Germany and residence in large cities or small towns, respectively, enrolled consecutive patients who had bacterial infections that required therapy with oral antibiotics. Choice of agent and duration of treatment were left to the study physicians. Compliance was measured by a standardized telephone interview on the penultimate day and a urine bioassay for antibacterial activity on the last day of the planned treatment period. Parents did not know the true purpose of the study. Five hundred eight-four patients were fully evaluable. The most frequent diagnoses included tonsillopharyngitis (n = 231), otitis media (n = 170) and lower respiratory tract infections (n = 114). Most frequently prescribed antibiotics included amoxicillin (n = 102), potassium penicillin V (n = 81) and clarithromycin (n = 67). Overall compliance (positive urine test) on the last day of therapy was 69.5% (406 of 584 patients). Compliance was not significantly influenced by the region of residence or the underlying bacterial infection. It was significantly associated with the antibiotic used (macrolides, 89.0%; penicillins, 62.2%; cephalosporins, 66.4%; P = 0.0001 for macrolides vs. the others). Best compliance was found with clarithromycin (94.0%) and erythromycin estolate (89.8%). Compliance was also significantly better in patients > or =6 years old (77.7%; P = 0.016); with a treatment duration of < or =7 days (77.6%; P = 0.014); when the drug package contained a dose-taking reminder (79.7%; P = 0.003); and when the pediatrician's behavior toward the patient was assessed by the parents as ""very sympathetic"" or ""sympathetic"" (72.6%; P = 0.017). Subjecting all variables to logistic regression analysis, we found 3 variables to be significant predictors of treatment compliance: choice of antibiotic (P = 0.0001); patient age (P = 0.0008); and residence in town or city (P = 0.03). A noncompliance rate of >30% is unsatisfactory. Whereas some variables significantly associated with compliance cannot be influenced (patient age; place of residence in town or city), others are amenable to modifications. These include the physician-patient interaction and the choice of antibiotic. Agents should be preferred that are well-accepted by patients, that enable short-term therapy with few daily doses and with a package that contains a dose-taking reminder. "
73,17671053,"In 2004, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians released a clinical practice guideline on the management of acute otitis media that included endorsement of an observation option for selected cases and recommendations of specific antibiotics. We sought to describe primary care physicians' current management of acute otitis media to compare it with the guideline's recommendations and describe trends since 2004. We used a mail survey from March through June 2006 within the Slone Center Office-Based Research Network, a national practice-based pediatric research network. The response rate was 299 (62.7%) of 477. The observation option was considered reasonable by 83.3%, compared with 88.0% in 2004, and was used in a median of 15% of acute otitis media cases over the previous 3 months. The most common physician-identified barriers to the use of the observation option were parental reluctance (83.5%) and the cost and difficulty of follow-up of children who do not improve (30.9%). In terms of antibiotic choices for acute otitis media, agreement with the guideline's antibiotic recommendation for 4 common clinical scenarios was as follows: high-dose amoxicillin for acute otitis media with nonsevere symptoms (57.2%), high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate for acute otitis media with severe symptoms (12.7%), high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate for cases that failed to respond to amoxicillin (42.8%), and intramuscular ceftriaxone for cases that failed to respond to treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate (16.7%). Each of these proportions declined from 2004. Most primary care physicians accept the concept of an observation option for acute otitis media but use it only occasionally. Antibiotics prescribed for acute otitis media differ markedly from the guideline's recommendations, and the difference has increased since 2004. "
74,2648939,"In a multicenter study, Augmentin pediatric suspension was given to 1,227 young children (3 months - 3 years) with otitis media seen in private practice. Patterns of otitis included first episodes, recurrences, and forms that had failed to respond to previous antimicrobial therapy. The study medication was given as a first-line treatment, on the basis of epidemiologic data, in a daily dose of 40 mg/kg for 7 to 10 days. In the 3 months to 3 years age group, two micro-organisms are prevalent, ie. Haemophilus influenzae, which is the most common agent and may produce beta-lactamases (10 to 18% of strains), and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Among our patients, the otitis-conjunctivitis syndrome caused by Haemophilus influenzae was fairly frequent (8.7% of cases). Clinical effectiveness as evaluated between D8 and D11 was good or very good in 91.2% of cases. Tolerance was satisfactory in 83% of patients. Side effects were uncommon and consisted primarily in gastrointestinal symptoms. We point out the potentially deleterious effect of concurrent anti-inflammatory treatment. Acceptability of the suspension was judged satisfactory by the parents in 91.6% of cases. Augmentin proved well-suited to epidemiologic data, outstandingly effective, well tolerated, and easy to use because of its presentation as a pediatric suspension; it is therefore an appropriate first-line drug in the common indication addressed in our study.

75,15336482,"The aim of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness hreshold of a ciprofloxacin 0.3% and dexamethasone 0.1% (CD) otic suspension relative to olfloxacin otic solution (OFX) for the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients with tympanostomy tubes (AOMT). This study used a decision-analytic model to simulate the costs and consequences of the ototopical treatment of AOMT. The AOMT model consisted of 3 tiers of antimicrobial therapy. Each successive tier represented the repeat treatment of clinical failures from the preceding tier. Patients were modeled for treatment until cured or until third-tier therapy was complete, at which time patients were considered cured. First-tier therapy modeled a comparison of CD and OFX using efficacy rates taken from a randomized clinical trial with a population of 599 patients. Second-tier therapy modeled the use of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid using an efficacy rate taken from the medical literature. Third-tier therapy was modeled as being pathogen specific and could follow 1 of 3 possible clinical pathways: (1) PO fluconazole, (2) IM ceftriaxone, or (3) IV antibiotics administered in a hospital setting. Third-tier therapeutic pathway probabilities were based on the microbiologic spectrum of the treatment failures from the clinical trial. Cost information (in year-2003 US dollars) was taken from accepted cost reference sources and presented from the perspective of a third-party payer. The economic outcome of interest was the cost-effectiveness threshold of CD relative to OFX. Given the model parameters, CD had a cost-effectiveness threshold value of 4.5 times the wholesale acquisition cost of OFX. Based on actual cost, first-tier CD therapy was more cost-effective than OFX up to a threshold price of US 152.64 dollars. In this decision-analytic model, CD was more cost-effective than OFX for AOMT therapy in pediatric patients up to a threshold price of 4.5 times the price of OFX. "
76,15930204,"The widespread use of antibiotics for treatment of acute otitis media (AOM) has resulted in the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens that are difficult to treat. However, it has been shown that most children with nonsevere AOM recover without ABX. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety, efficacy, acceptability, and costs of a non-ABX intervention for children with nonsevere AOM. Children 6 months to 12 years old with AOM were screened by using a novel AOM-severity screening index. Parents of children with nonsevere AOM received an educational intervention, and their children were randomized to receive either immediate antibiotics (ABX; amoxicillin plus symptom medication) or watchful waiting (WW; symptom medication only). The investigators, but not the parents, were blinded to enrollment status. Primary outcomes included parent satisfaction with AOM care, resolution of symptoms, AOM failure/recurrence, and nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains resistant to ABX. Secondary outcomes included medication-related adverse events, serious adverse events, unanticipated AOM-related office and emergency department visits and telephone calls, the child's absence from day care or school resulting from AOM, the parent's absence from school or work because of their child's AOM, and costs of treatment. Subjects were defined as failing (days 0-12) or recurring (days 13-30) if they experienced a higher AOM-severity score on reexamination. A total of 223 subjects were recruited: 73% were nonwhite, 57% were <2 years old, 47% attended day care, 82% had experienced prior AOM, and 83% had not been fully immunized with heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine. One hundred twelve were randomized to ABX, and 111 were randomized to WW. Ninety-four percent of the subjects were followed to the 30-day end point. Parent satisfaction with AOM care was not different between the 2 treatment groups at either day 12 or 30. Compared with WW, symptom scores on days 1 to 10 resolved faster in subjects treated with immediate ABX. At day 12, among the immediate-ABX group, 69% of tympanic membranes and 25% of tympanograms were normal, compared with 51% of normal tympanic membranes and 10% of normal tympanograms in the WW group. Parents of children in the ABX group gave their children fewer doses of pain medication than did parents of children in the WW group. Subjects in the ABX group experienced 16% fewer failures than subjects in the WW group. Of the children in the WW group, 66% completed the study without needing ABX. Immediate ABX resulted in eradication of S pneumoniae carriage in the majority of children, but S pneumoniae strains cultured from children in the ABX group at day 12 were more likely to be multidrug-resistant than strains from children in the WW group. More ABX-related adverse events were noted in the ABX group, compared with the WW group. No serious AOM-related adverse events were observed in either group. Office and emergency department visits, phone calls, and days of work/school missed were not different between groups. Prescriptions for ABX were reduced by 73% in the WW group compared with the ABX group. Costs of ABX averaged $47.41 per subject in the ABX group and $11.43 in the WW group. Sixty-six percent of subjects in the WW group completed the study without ABX. Parent satisfaction was the same between groups regardless of treatment. Compared with WW, immediate ABX treatment was associated with decreased numbers of treatment failures and improved symptom control but increased ABX-related adverse events and a higher percent carriage of multidrug-resistant S pneumoniae strains in the nasopharynx at the day-12 visit. Key factors in implementing a WW strategy were (a) a method to classify AOM severity; (b) parent education; (c) management of AOM symptoms; (d) access to follow-up care; and (e) use of an effective ABX regimen, when needed. When these caveats are observed, WW may be an acceptable alternative to immediate ABX for some children with nonsevere AOM. "
77,16803605,"Helicobacter pylori infection is common in paediatric population. To date, there is still no universally accepted recommendation on the treatment of this infection in children. Ranitidine bismuth citrate-based triple therapy has been shown to be effective in H. pylori eradication in adults but its use has rarely been validated in children. To investigate the efficacy of ranitidine bismuth citrate-based triple therapy in eradication of H. pylori in children and to determine the shortest duration of treatment required. We conducted a prospective randomized study comparing ranitidine bismuth citrate plus amoxicillin plus clarithromycin given for 4 days vs. 7 days in H. pylori-infected children diagnosed by (13)C-urea breath test. Eradication was evaluated by repeat (13)C-urea breath test at 6 weeks after treatment. A total of 206 children were recruited (median age 12 years, 97 boys and 109 girls). Ninety-eight (47.6%) and 108 (52.4%) children were randomized to receive 7-day and 4-day regimen respectively. The eradication rate of 4-day treatment arm was 77.8% (both intention-to-treat and per protocol) compared with 88.8% (intention-to-treat, P = 0.036) and 89.7% (per protocol, P = 0.022) of 7-day regimen. There was no statistical difference in terms of side effects between the two groups. Seven-day ranitidine bismuth citrate-based triple therapy is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for eradication of H. pylori in children. "
78,7127989,"The substitution of a syringe in place of a teaspoon for the delivery of oral medications has become routine in some pediatric practices for reasons that are not clear. Although a syringe would measure dosages more accurately, most oral medications have a broad acceptable dose range. A possible advantage of syringes is that parents who receive these may be more impressed with the importance of treatment than those prescribed medications by teaspoon. To test this hypothesis, 72 patients below 24 months of age with otitis media were randomly divided into a group that received a prescription indicating amoxicillin should be given by teaspoon and a group that received a labeled syringe for this purpose. The qualitative presence of the antibiotic in urine at seven-day follow-up visit was 56 per cent among the teaspoon users and 67 per cent among syringe users, while return rates for one week appointments were 51 per cent and 32 per cent, respectively. Neither difference was significant. Use of a measured oral dispensing syringe did not improve compliance in administration of medication or return for follow-up and therefore, was judged not to be cost effective. "
79,1048199,"Amoxicillin granule (100 mg AMPC potency per 1.0 g granule) was administered to pediatric patients with the following results. 1) AAMPC serum concentration and the urinary recovery of two preparations (Clamoxyl 'Beecham' and Sawacillin 'Fujisawa') granule were compared in a cross over trial in 5 healthy adult volunteers. No significant difference in the results was observed between the two granules. 2) The peak serum concentration after oral administration of 10 mg/kg AMPC to 5 children gave an average of 5.06 mug/ml 1 hour after administration. The 6-hour urinary excretion was distributed 51.4 approximatley 78.9%. 3) AMPC was administered at a dose of about 20 mg/kg/day to 35 children with acute pediatric infections that is scarlet fever, acute tonsillitis, tonsillitis lacunalis, acute bronchitis, bronchial asthma +bronchitis and infectious impetigo. An effective therapeutic result was obtained in all cases. 4) The granule was well accepted by young children, and at a dose level of about 20 mg/kg/day for a week no disorder on hepatorenal function was observed in any og the patients.
