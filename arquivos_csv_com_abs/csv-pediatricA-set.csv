0,26677512,"Following dietary exposure to fructose, sucrose, or sorbitol, untreated hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is characterized by metabolic disturbances (hypoglycemia, lactic acidemia, hypophosphatemia, hyperuricemia, hypermagnesemia, hyperalaninemia) and clinical findings (nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distress; chronic growth restriction / failure to thrive). While untreated HFI typically first manifested when fructose- and sucrose-containing foods were introduced in the course of weaning young infants from breast milk, it is now presenting earlier, due to the addition of fructose-containing nutrients in infant formulas. If the infant ingests large quantities of fructose, the infant may acutely develop lethargy, seizures, and/or progressive coma. Untreated HFI may result in renal and hepatic failure. If identified and treated before permanent organ injury occurs, individuals with HFI can experience a normal quality of life and life expectancy. The diagnosis of HFI is established in a proband with suggestive metabolic disturbances and clinical findings following dietary exposure to fructose, sucrose, or sorbitol and either biallelic pathogenic variants in"

2,36471989,"There are many kinds of pharmaceutical preparations for children in China, which are generally divided into oral solid preparations and oral liquid preparations. Solid preparations, such as microtablets, pellets, dispersible tablets, and fine granules, have become the development trend of pediatric drugs. Liquid preparations mainly include syrup, suspension, oral solution, and drops. The poor taste and the treatment of drugs in children of different ages are the key factors affecting the efficacy, safety, and compliance of pediatric drugs. To reduce the risk caused by the fluctuation of blood concentration and improve the oral compliance of pediatric drugs, it is urgent to develop new techniques for granulation and flavor maskingto improve the poor taste of solid preparations. For liquid pre-parations with poor taste, the flavor correction technique should be used. This paper summarized the new pharmaceutical techniques for granulation and flavor masking, and it was found that sustained/controlled-releasegranules, fine granules, and chewing solid mini-tablets became the mainstream of oral solid preparations for children. Generally, multiparticle preparation, coating, microencapsulation, and other granulating techniques were involved in these preparations. Granulation and flavor masking are closely related and synergetic. Flavor masking techniques mask the bitter taste of Chinese medicine from four aspects, including confusing the brain taste, changing the compounds, reducing the exposure of bitter molecules to bitter receptors in the mouth, and numbing the taste cells to increase the threshold of bitter perception. At present, the main drugs for children on the market mainly inhibit the oral release of bitter drugs. "
3,31315084,"Indomethacin is used for off-label prescription for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants. In Argentina, indomethacin is only available as a suppository, dermic cream, injectable ampules, and delayed-release capsules. Aiming to improve pediatric treatment and minimize the risk associated with improper dosage, this work focused on the development of an extemporaneous 0.2% indomethacin oral suspension, starting from the commercially injectable formulation. Two 150-mL batches of suspension were prepared using Generally Recognized as Safe excipients. The suspensions were stored for 17 days at room temperature. Physical stability, morphological analysis of suspended particles, sedimentation volume, easy re-suspension, and dynamic viscosity were studied. The indomethacin content, dissolution studies, and microbiological attributes of nonsterile pharmaceutical products were also evaluated. After 17 days of storage, the suspension was easily re-dispersed after 15 seconds of the hand-shaking technique. There were no detectable changes in color, odor, and/or flavor. The suspension showed minimal changes in pH, viscosity, shape, and mean size of the suspended indomethacin particles. The content uniformity and drug dissolution remained within the acceptable range during storage. This oral liquid suspension is an interesting alternative to be prepared by hospital pharmacy services for optimizing the pediatric treatment of patent ductus arteriosus. "
4,17090745,"The stability and viscosity of preparations of a commercially available, flavored, immediate-release powder for oral suspension (omeprazole-sodium bicarbonate) during refrigerator and room temperature storage were investigated. Omeprazole-sodium bicarbonate 20-mg packets were suspended to initial omeprazole concentrations of 0.6 and 2 mg/mL, and omeprazole-sodium bicarbonate 40-mg packets were suspended to initial omeprazole concentrations of 1.2, 2, 3, and 4 mg/mL. Suspensions were stored at 4 degrees C in darkness (refrigerated) or 22-25 degrees C (room temperature) in light for one week. A third set of suspensions was stored refrigerated for one month. Omeprazole's stability was quantified after 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 168 hours in one-week samples and after 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days in one-month samples using high-pressure liquid chromatography. Viscosities of refrigerated suspensions were measured after 0, 1, and 7 days. Refrigerated suspensions retained >98% and >96% of their initial omeprazole concentrations after one week and one month, respectively. Stability of room temperature suspensions was concentration dependent. After one week, the 0.6- and 1.2-mg/mL suspensions retained 87.2% and 93.1% of their respective initial omeprazole concentrations, whereas the 2-, 3-, and 4-mg/mL suspensions retained >97% of their initial omeprazole concentrations. Suspension viscosities varied 10-fold over the concentrations studied, but all were within the viscosity ranges of other commercially available oral suspensions. Prolonged refrigeration did not increase the suspensions' viscosities. Omeprazole-sodium bicarbonate suspensions of 0.6-4 mg/mL omeprazole were stored at 4 degrees C in darkness for up to 28 days. The viscosities of refrigerated suspensions did not increase over 7 days. Except for the 0.6 mg/mL preparations, suspensions stored at room temperature in the light retained >90% of their initial omeprazole content after 7 days, despite turning yellow. "
5,31611144,"Taste is a crucial factor that determines the palatability of the oral dosage form and patient compliance. The aim of this work was to evaluate the organoleptic excipients in oral antibiotics for pediatric use marketed in Brazil. The information was obtained from the GuidetoPharmacy, a reference for the pharmaceutical trade. The analysis included dosage forms for oral administration and drugs and their combination with antibacterial action. After this survey, we identified the constitution of the flavoring, sweetening, and coloring agents of each medicine. The results are presented in a descriptive form. Twelve drugs or associations are distributed in 70medicines. Oral suspension was the most common pharmaceutical dosage form. Sweeteners were sucrose, sodium saccharin, and sodium cyclamate. All the coloring agents observed are synthetic and the most frequent ones were yellow twilight no. 6, yellow tartrazine no. 5, and red ponceau 4R. The presence of two or more types of flavorings per medicine was observed. Antibacterials use coloring agents, flavorings, and sweeteners to facilitate the administration of medicines for children, using up to six different substances per formulation. No natural coloring agent was observed, demonstrating an issue to be explored in the future. It is important to note that, although necessary, these excipients are responsible for a high incidence of allergic reactions in children. "

7,35631381,"The development of oral pediatric forms by pharmaceutical companies is still insufficient. In fact, many drugs used in paediatric oncology, such as temozolomide, are not labeled and adapted for paediatric use. Temozolomide (TMZ) is an alkylating agent used as the standard of care for many adult and pediatric brain tumours, such as neuroblastoma, glioblastoma and medulloblastoma. The present study was carried out to propose a suitable and palatable formulation of the oral liquid preparation of TMZ. The suspension is composed of TMZ suspended in SyrSpend SF pH 4, as well as TMZ crystallization stabilizing agents and sweetening agents. To reach this formulation, several taste-masking agents were evaluated. Here, we describe the method of preparation of the formation as well as the monocentric population treated with the formulation over a 5-year period. A 20 mg/mL TMZ suspension was developed. TMZ suspension is stable for 6 weeks, stored between 2 and 8 degrees, protected from light, and compatible with nasogastric tubes. Thirty-eight patients participated in the palatability study and choose cola flavour, and 104 patients were treated in Gustave Roussy with the developed suspension; no unexpected event was reported. To conclude, we propose here a new TMZ liquid formulation which is stable for at least 6 weeks and well-tolerated with extensive feedback. "
8,36634740,"Non-compliance, dosing inaccuracy, choking risk, flavour, and instability, are some of the issues associated with paediatric, oral dosage forms - tablets, capsules, solutions, and suspensions. Orally disintegrating drug carriers, a dosage form with growing interest, are thought to overcome several of the challenges associated with these conventional formulations by rapidly disintegrating within the buccal cavity without the need for water. This review serves as an up-to-date report on the various types of orodispersible delivery systems, currently being developed or commercialized, by detailing their characteristics, manufacturing processes, and applications in the paediatric population. Mentioned are orodispersible tablets, films, wafers and lyophilisates, mini-tablets, capsules, granules, electrospun fibers and webs. Also highlighted are the choice of excipients, quality control requirements, and expected pharmacokinetics of orally disintegrating drug carriers concerning the paediatric population. Overall, orodispersible formulations, particularly tablets, films, and lyophilisates/wafers, have shown to be a valuable addition to medication administration in minors, thus the execution of more targeted research and development activities is expected to lead to enhanced paediatric care and outcomes.

Amiodarone hydrochloride is an antiarrhythmic drug used to treat supraventricular tachycardia. However, there are currently no commercial pediatric forms available to treat young patients. Various oral formulations were previously reported in the literature, but the concentration was lower than the doses prescribed in clinical practice (a loading dose of 500 mg/m2/day for 7-10 days followed by a maintenance dose of 250 mg/m2/day). The objective of this study was to develop an oral liquid formulation of amiodarone hydrochloride at an optimal concentration for use in children and to evaluate its physicochemical and microbiological stability. No commercial suspension vehicle was used, allowing the choice of excipients. Compounding was performed using hydroxypropylmethylcellulose as thickener, potassium sorbate preservative, citric acid/sodium citrate buffer, sodium saccharin as a , and a strawberry flavoring agent. A concentration of 40 mg/mL was selected based on a 5-year compilation of prescribed doses. Analyses performed were the following: visual and microscopic inspection, testing for antimicrobial preservation, osmolality and pH measurements, quantification of amiodarone hydrochloride by a stability-indicating liquid chromatography method, and a microbiological count. At least 95% of the initial amiodarone hydrochloride remained stable during the 60-day study period under refrigeration. All other tested parameters remained stable at 5 °C. A targeted log reduction of the microorganism inoculum by day 14 and no microbial growth by day 28 were demonstrated in the test for antimicrobial preservation. The stability of 40 mg/mL amiodarone hydrochloride oral suspension was maintained under refrigeration for 60 days before opening bottles and for 1 month after opening bottles. "
10,39245358,"This publication is the first to report current, global, pediatric oral extemporaneous compounding practices. Complete survey responses were received from 479 participants actively involved in compounding across all the World Health Organization (WHO) regions. The survey addressed oral formulation of extemporaneous liquids, including the use of commercial or in-house vehicles, flavoring excipients, source of formulation recipes, and beyond use dates (BUDs). Over 90% of the survey participants prepared oral liquids. Solid dosage forms, comprising capsules and powder papers (sachets), were also frequently prepared for children, albeit to a lesser extent. The top 20 active pharmaceutical ingredients compounded for children, globally, were: omeprazole, captopril, spironolactone, propranolol, furosemide, phenobarbital, hydrochlorothiazide, ursodeoxycholic acid, sildenafil, melatonin, clonidine, enalapril, dexamethasone, baclofen, caffeine, chloral hydrate, trimethoprim, atenolol, hydrocortisone, carvedilol and prednisolone. Diuretics, drugs for acid-related disorders, and beta-blockers were the top three most frequently compounded classes per the WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. The principal need identified for the practice of extemporaneous compounding for children was the development of an international, open-access formulary that includes validated formulations, as well as updated compounding literature and guidelines. Furthermore, improved access to data from stability studies to allow compounding of formulations with extended BUDs. "
11,23979771,"Amiodarone is commercially available as both a tablet and an injectable formulation. It is widely dispensed as an extemporaneously compounded suspension for pediatric and geriatric patients. Extensive stability data at numerous temperatures and a calculated shelf life based on kinetics for such a formulation have not been reported. Refrigeration and room temperature data for finite times have been reported in the literature. In this study, a stable extemporaneous formulation of amiodarone hydrochloride was formulated using Paceron tablets. The formulation consisted of 0.75% carboxymethylcellulose and 0.75% Veegum as suspending agents; 25% sucrose, provided as simple syrup; and aqueous strawberry concentrate as flavor. A total of 2.5L of the formulation was compounded and stored in quanitites of 150 mL in 8-oz glass containers. The initial drug content was determined by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, with a method that was developed in our laboratory. The stability study was carried out by storing three containers at five different temperatures, namely 4, 30, 40, 50, and 60 deg C. The suspension was analyzed at the end of 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours at 7 days, and, therafter, at the end of every week for 13 weeks. The percentage of drug remaining was plotted against time for each temperature. The slope of the regression line was obtained for each temperature and the zero-order degradation rate constant obtained. The logarithm of the zero-order degradation rate constants was plotted against the inverse of the temperature in degrees Kelvin to obtain the Arrhenius plot. From the regression line for the Arrhenius plot, the zero-order degradation constant at 25 deg C was calculated to be 0.0517 day -1. The shelf life for the formulation at 25 deg C was calculated to be 193.4 days; the shelf life under refrigeration (4 deg C) was found to be 677.3 days. The degradation products were characterized using high-performance liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometry. Data obtained from the analysis suggested that amiodarone cleaved at its ketone and ether linkages to yield corresponding degradation products. "
12,36136756,"We present here a robust and reliable protocol by which to differentiate pancreatic islet-like aggregates (SC-islets) from human pluripotent stem cells. The 7-stage protocol mimics developmental patterning factors that induce endocrine lineage formation and spans monolayer, microwell, and aggregate suspension culture. The SC-islets demonstrate dynamic glucose-sensitive insulin secretion and an endocrine cell composition similar to those of primary human islets. SC-islets generated using this optimized protocol are suitable for in vitro modeling of islet cell pathophysiology and therapeutic applications. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Balboa et al. (2022). "
13,23610969,"The stability of theophylline (T) and propranolol hydrochloride (P) in extemporaneously compounded oral suspensions (25 mg/mL or 50 mg/mL for T and 2 mg/mL or 5 mg/mL for P) were studied. Suspension with P and T were prepared with bulk substance or tablets using three different suspending vehicles: Ora-Sweet (M1), modified Ora-Sweet (M2) and simple syrup with glycerol and sorbitol (M3). Each suspension was stored for 35 days in a dark place at 25 degrees C and 4 degrees C. The results demonstrated that the prepared suspensions with P either from tablets or from a substance were stable in all three studied vehicles (more than 95% of initial concentration remaining). However, it is recommended that storage at 4 degrees C of suspensions prepared with M2 should be avoided because of crystallization of the buffer substances. Extemporaneous suspensions with T in an appropriate pediatric concentrations of the drug were not obtained because the problem of fast crystallization of T was not eliminated. "
14,28987500,"Pharmaceutical cocrystals have garnered significant interest as potential solids to address issues associated with formulation development of drug substances. However, studies concerning the understanding of formulation behavior of cocrystals are still at the nascent stage. We present results of our attempts to evaluate suspension formulations of cocrystals of an antiasthmatic drug, theophylline, with 2 artificial sweeteners. Stability, solubility, drug release, and taste of the suspension formulations were evaluated. Suspension that contained cocrystal with acesulfame showed higher drug release rate, while a cocrystal with saccharin showed a significant reduction in drug release rate. The cocrystal with saccharin was found stable in suspension for over 9 weeks at accelerated test condition; in contrast, the cocrystal with acesulfame was found unstable. Taste analysis using an electronic taste-sensing system revealed improved sweetness of the suspension formulations with cocrystals. Theophylline has a narrow therapeutic index with a short half-life which necessitates frequent dosing. This adversely impacts patient compliance and enhances risk of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular adverse effects. The greater thermodynamic stability, sweetness, and sustained drug release of the suspension formulation of theophylline-saccharin could offer an alternative solution to the short half-life of theophylline and make it a promising formulation for treating asthmatic pediatric and geriatric patients.

15,36986818,"L-Methionine (Met) is an essential alpha-amino acid playing a key role in several metabolic pathways. Rare inherited metabolic diseases such as mutations affecting the MARS1 gene encoding methionine tRNA synthetase (MetRS) can cause severe lung and liver disease before the age of two years. Oral Met therapy has been shown to restore MetRS activity and improve clinical health in children. As a sulfur-containing compound, Met has a strongly unpleasant odor and taste. The objective of this study was to develop an optimized pediatric pharmaceutical formulation of Met powder, to be reconstituted with water, to obtain a stable oral suspension. Organoleptic characteristics and physicochemical stability of the powdered Met formulation and suspension were evaluated at three storage temperatures. Met quantification was assessed by a stability-indicating chromatographic method as well as microbial stability. The use of a specific fruit flavor (e.g., strawberry) with sweeteners (e.g., sucralose) was considered acceptable. No drug loss, pH changes, microbiological growth, or visual changes were observed at 23 ± 2 °C and 4 ± 2 °C with the powder formulation for 92 days, and the reconstituted suspension for at least 45 days. The developed formulation facilitates the preparation, administration, the dose adjustment and palatability of Met treatment in children. "
16,32619118,"Paracetamol is a common antipyretic and analgesic medicine used in childhood illness by parents and physicians worldwide. Paracetamol has a bitter taste that is considered as a significant barrier for drug administration. This study aimed to develop an oral dosage form that is palatable and easy to swallow by pediatric patients as well as to overcome the shortcomings of liquid formulations. The paracetamol was encapsulated in beads, which were prepared mainly from alginate and chitosan through electrospray technique. The paracetamol beads were sprinkled on the instant jelly prepared from glycine, ι-carrageenan and calcium lactate gluconate. The paracetamol instant jelly characteristics, in terms of physical appearance, texture, rheology,  The paracetamol instant jelly was easily reconstituted in 20 mL of water within 2 min to form jelly with acceptable consistency and texture. The jelly must be ingested within 30 min after reconstitution to avoid the bitter taste. The palatability assessment carried out on 12 human subjects established the similar palatability and texture of the paracetamol instant jelly dosage comparable to the commercial paracetamol suspension and was found to be even better in overcoming the aftertaste of paracetamol. Such findings indicate that paracetamol instant jelly will compensate for the use of sweetening and flavoring agents as well as develop pediatric dosage forms with limited undesired excipients. "
17,33418165,"We report our experience with topiramate rectal suspensions in a single center case series of three patients <1 year of age from 2017 to 2020 who received topiramate per rectum after being placed nil per os (NPO) status at a free standing children's hospital. The objective was to describe the compounding methods and clinical outcomes of three of the youngest patients to receive topiramate rectal suspensions. All three patients received topiramate per rectum for 2-4 days. No adverse effects or increase in seizure frequency were noted. For patients placed on NPO status, there is currently no alternative to oral topiramate. No studies describe per rectum topiramate use in pediatrics. Rectal administration of topiramate is not only useful in times when patients are NPO, but may also be useful when patients on topiramate experience status epilepticus. The formulation of topiramate suppositories should be explored in the future. Until further information is available, dose substitution should be done carefully with close supervision by a healthcare provider. "
18,17039647,"Although numerous taste studies have compared the palatability of antibiotic suspensions, few have compared the palatability of corticosteroid suspensions. Therefore, we compared the taste of 8 commonly prescribed liquid corticosteroid suspensions with the intent to help guide prescribing practices and improve patient compliance. We conducted a randomized, double-blind study using 31 adult volunteers ages 24 to 57. All volunteers were asked to sample 8 different pediatric corticosteroid suspensions and to rate the palatability of their taste and aftertaste. The mean scores for each sample were then compared. The 8 suspensions fell into 2 groups based on their taste scores: one group with relatively high scores or more acceptable tastes (Orapred, Pediapred, and a dexamethasone suspension) and a second group with relatively low scores or less acceptable tastes (a prednisone suspension and 4 cherry-flavored prednisolone suspensions). The results demonstrate a significant difference in palatability between corticosteroid suspensions. Not only will this new information help clinicians choose between otherwise equivalent corticosteroid suspensions but, given the importance children place on taste, may improve compliance as well. "
19,33611378,"Ketamine is an anesthetic agent commonly used for the induction of anesthesia. Ketamine is also given to control pain, for treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder, and to induce bronchodilation in refractory asthma. Moreover, ketamine therapy is gaining ground as an intervention for patients with treatment-resistant depression and individuals who have depression with serious suicidal ideation. Recently, the drug has been used to disrupt maladaptive reward memories in individuals with harmful alcohol consumption behaviors. The stability of 10-mg/mL and 50-mg/mL ketamine solutions stored at ambient and refrigeration temperatures was assessed over 90 days. Three batches of 10-mg/mL and 50-mg/mL ketamine solutions were stored for 90 days under two temperature conditions (2°C-8°C and 22°C-25°C) in amber plastic bottles. Chemical stability was assessed using a stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography assay. At each study time, visual inspection and pH assessments of ketamine concentration and pH were conducted. For all solutions tested at each condition, the ketamine concentration remaining was at least 98% of the initial concentration over 90 days of storage. Throughout the study period, solution pH remained stable and the color and odor of the suspensions remained unchanged. Extemporaneously compounded 10-mg/mL and 50-mg/mL oral solutions of ketamine prepared in a flavored suspending excipient and stored in amber polypropylene plastic bottles were stable for at least 90 days at both ambient and refrigeration temperatures.

21,26200148,"The role of antibiotics containing sucrose on the formation of dental caries is still controversial. This study aimed to investigate the effect of two antibiotics (amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate suspension), with and without sucrose, on human dental hardness and Streptococcus mutans counts in dental biofilm. Primary tooth fragments (n=72) were coated with nail varnish leaving a window of 2.25 mm diameter. Specimens were fixed in 24-well polystyrene plates, containing BHI medium. S. mutans (clinical strains) represented the inoculum to form biofilm on the fragments for 24 h. Twelve fragments were separated for the initial count of microorganisms (baseline). The other fragments were divided into 4 groups (n=12) of treatment: G1 (Clavulin(r)), G2 (Betamox(r)), G3 (chlorhexidine 0.12%), G4 (sucrose 10%). All specimens had their self-control area (covered area). The cross-sectional microhardness (CSMH) was evaluated for each specimen. All the treated groups had a loss of hardness compared to their self-controls (p<0.05). Both drugs inhibited the S. mutans growth and promoted no CSMH difference among them. Both antibiotics eliminated all formed biofilm and did not cause mineral loss from the enamel, regardless the presence of sucrose in its formulation. "

23,14725575,"The management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) continues to garner vast amounts of attention among physicians who care for adults. However, there is an increasing awareness of the fact that this disease, as well as several other lifelong digestive diseases (i.e. Crohn's disease) may actually have their origins in childhood. Paediatric gastro-oesophageal reflux (GER) is likely to share a similar pathophysiology to adult GER, and mounting evidence from published preliminary data suggests a genetic susceptibility to GERD. However, further studies will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis. In children, GER has a distinct presentation from that in adults, with the diagnostic work-up based upon the patient's age as well as their presenting signs and symptoms. Like their adult counterparts, the early detection and treatment of GER in children may result in a better long-term outcome, improved quality-of-life, and a reduction in overall healthcare burden. While the treatment of GER in infants tends to be conservative (i.e. positioning during feeding, smaller feedings), its management in older children parallels that of adults and includes lifestyle changes and pharmacological therapy. However, with persistent symptoms, acid suppression is the mainstay of GERD management in both children and adults. Several studies in children have verified that acid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor is superior to histamine-2 receptor antagonists. Among the proton pump inhibitors, both lansoprazole and omeprazole have been the subject of published adult and paediatric studies demonstrating their short and long-term safety, in addition to their efficacy in a variety of oesophageal and supra-oesophageal GERD related conditions. These two proton pump inhibitors are manufactured as capsules containing enteric-coated granules that can be emptied into soft foods or liquids without compromising their pharmacological effects or pharmacokinetic properties. Lansoprazole is also available as a strawberry-flavoured suspension that is acceptable to children and as an oral disintegrating tablet. "
24,29737955,"Purpose To prospectively compare small bowel distention provided by, as well as patient acceptance of, two different neutral (negative) oral contrast materials used for cross-sectional enterography in a pediatric population. Materials and Methods In this noninferiority study, 66 pediatric patients undergoing clinical computed tomographic (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) enterography were randomized to receive either a flavored beverage for neutral abdominal and pelvic imaging (Breeza; Beekley Medical, Bristol, Conn) or a low-density barium sulfate suspension. Patients were blinded to the oral contrast material administered and were asked to rate taste, texture, and their perceived health state (where 0 was very bad and 10 was very good). Ingested volume of the prescribed weight-based oral contrast material preparation was recorded. Maximum small bowel diameter was measured in all four abdominal quadrants. Mean bowel diameter as well as taste, texture, and health state scores were compared between cohorts by using t tests; proportions were compared by using Fisher exact tests. Results Thirty-three patients each received Breeza and barium sulfate suspension, respectively. No difference was found in age (Breeza, 13.5 years ± 2.6 [standard deviation]; barium sulfate suspension, 13.9 years ± 2.8; P = .49), sex distribution (15 girls each; P > .99), or health state (P = .21) between cohorts. Twenty-eight of 33 (84.8%) and 17 of 33 (51.5%) patients completed the Breeza and barium sulfate suspension preparations, respectively (P = .007). Breeza received higher scores for taste (6.1 ± 2.5 vs 2.7 ± 2.5; P < .0001) and texture (7.3 ± 2.3 vs 3.6 ± 2.9; P < .0001). No difference was found in bowel distention between Breeza and barium sulfate suspension (1.63 cm ± 0.24 vs 1.69 cm ± 0.25; P = .44). Conclusion The neutral oral contrast materials Breeza and low-density barium sulfate suspension provide similar small bowel distention. Patients receiving Breeza are more likely to ingest the entire prescribed volume. "
25,38457115,"Fecal microbiota transplants can be administered orally in encapsulated form or require invasive procedures to administer liquid formulations. There is a need for an oral liquid formulation of fecal microbiota for patients who are unable to swallow capsules, especially if they require multiple, repeated administrations. These studies were conducted to develop a protocol to manufacture an organoleptically acceptable powdered fecal microbiota formulation that can be suspended in a liquid carrier and used for fecal microbiota transplantation. Several processing steps were investigated, including extra washes of microbiota prior to lyophilization and an addition of a flavoring agent. The viability of bacteria in the transplant formulation was tested using live/dead microscopy staining and engraftment into antibiotic-treated mice. After development of a clinical protocol for suspension of the powdered microbiota, the new formulation was tested in three elderly patients with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections and who have difficulties in swallowing capsules. Changes in the microbial community structure in one of the patients were characterized using 16S rRNA gene profiling and engraftment analysis. The processing steps used to produce an organoleptically acceptable suspension of powdered fecal microbiota did not result in loss of its viability. The powder could be easily suspended in a liquid carrier. The use of the new formulation was associated with abrogation of the cycle of C. difficile infection recurrences in the three patients. We developed a novel organoleptically acceptable liquid formulation of fecal microbiota that is suitable for use in clinical trials for patients with difficulties in swallowing capsules. "
26,26998661,"The objective of our study was to compare a flavored beverage containing a thickening agent for enterography with a low-Hounsfield-value barium suspension for side effects, taste, subjects' willingness to repeat the drinking protocol, and small-bowel distention. The following five drinking protocols were administered to 10 volunteers: 1000 mL of flavored beverage followed by 350 mL of water, 1500 mL of flavored beverage, 900 mL of low-Hounsfield-value barium suspension followed by 450 mL of water, 1350 mL of low-Hounsfield-value barium suspension followed by 150 mL of water, and 1500 mL of water. MR images were obtained 50 and 60 minutes after initiation of drinking. Subjects completed a questionnaire evaluating the side effects, the taste of the drink, and their willingness to repeat the drinking protocol. Reviewers assigned scores evaluating small-bowel distention and ranked the examinations in order of preference. There was no significant difference in nausea or vomiting among the protocols (p = 0.20 and 0.42, respectively), but larger volumes of flavored beverage and low-Hounsfield-value barium suspension resulted in more cramping and diarrhea (p = 0.001 and 0.002, respectively). The taste of the low-Hounsfield-value barium suspension was rated the worst (p < 0.0001). The subjects' willingness to repeat the drinking protocol was highest for the 1000 mL of flavored beverage or water alone (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in subjective small-bowel distention except that water was rated the worst by two of the three readers (p < 0.02). There was no significant difference in the diameter of the most dis-tended small bowel for any segment or reader (p > 0.23). A flavored beverage containing a thickening agent has a similar side effect profile and results in equivalent small-bowel distention compared with a low-Hounsfield-value barium suspension, but subjects rate taste and their willingness to repeat the drinking protocol higher for this new agent.

27,20637962,"Children who experience adverse reactions to cow's milk or who have diseases predisposing them to low bone mass are often prescribed a supplementation of calcium and vitamin D(3), but adherence can be poor. Age-specific preferences for different formulations may exist and at least partially explain poor compliance. The aim of this study was to compare the preference of Swiss children at risk for low bone mass for either a single-serving sachet or a suspension containing calcium and vitamin D(3). Two different commercial formulations containing calcium and vitamin D(3), either as a lemon-flavored single-serving sachet or as a banana-flavored commercial suspension, were tested for preference by means of a 5-point facial hedonic scale in children aged 4 to 7 and 8 to 11 years. A concealed random allocation procedure was used. The investigator asking about preference was blinded to the sequence. A total of 40 Swiss children (13 boys and 7 girls aged 4-7 years; 11 boys and 9 girls aged 811 years) were assessed in this study. Low bone mass risks included adverse reactions to cow's milk (n = 25); cerebral palsy (4), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (4), cystic fibrosis (3), inflammatory bowel diseases (2), anorexia nervosa (1), and osteogenesis imperfecta (1). Two children (10%) aged 4 to 7 years were not able to express their preference. Twelve of the remaining 18 children (67%) aged 4 to 7 years preferred the suspension, 5 (28%) did not express a clear preference, and 1 (5%) preferred the sachet (P < 0.002). In children aged 8 to 11 years, 15 (75%) preferred the sachet, 4 (20%) did not express a clear preference, and 1 (5%) preferred the suspension (P < 0.001). The results were not significantly different between boys and girls or between children initially presented the suspension and those initially presented the sachet. In this small study, significantly more Swiss children aged 4 to 7 years who were prescribed a supplementation of calcium and vitamin D(3) preferred a banana-flavored suspension compared with those who preferred a lemon-flavored single-serving sachet. However, significantly more children aged 8 to 11 years prescribed the same supplementation preferred the single-serving sachet compared with the suspension. "
28,31218388,"To evaluate the ability of pediatric patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease to ingest a new oral distending agent at CT or MR enterography (CTE/MRE), and to determine the impact on small bowel (SB) distension and diagnostic confidence. The study design is that of retrospective review of pediatric patients who underwent CTE or MRE from January 2014 to June 2016. Patients ingested low-concentration barium suspension or flavored beverage containing sorbitol and mannitol. The need for nasogastric tube (NGT) administration, amount ingested, emesis, distal extent of contrast, SB distension, terminal ileum (TI) transverse dimension, and diagnostic confidence in TI disease were assessed. Three radiologists each blindly reviewed a subset of the studies. Of the total 591 scans in 504 patients, 316 scans used low-concentration barium suspension and 275 scans flavored beverage. Nearly all consumed the entire amount (97% vs. 96%). Low-concentration barium suspension exams required NGT more often (7% [23/316] vs. 1% [3/275]; p < 0.0003), and tended to have more emesis (3% [9/316] vs. 1% [3/275]; p = 0.13). Diagnostic confidence score was nearly identical (p = 0.94). Qualitative and quantitative analyses showed no difference in SB distension, except for distension of mid-ileum (flavored beverage > low-concentration barium suspension; p = 0.02). Flavored beverage exams demonstrated a slight increase in distal extent of luminal distension (p = 0.02). A new flavored beverage distends small bowel as well as low-concentration barium suspension, with decreased requirement for NGT insertion and improved distal extent of luminal distension, and without any decrease in diagnostic confidence in the presence or the absence of TI disease.

30,26926148,"The purpose of this study is to develop an oral suspension of clindamycin resin complex for the potential use in pediatrics. Several types of Ion exchange resins were screened for their binding efficiency with clindamycin. In order to develop a suspension formulation, several thickening agents, surfactants, sweeting, and flavoring agents were evaluated for their influence on the release of clindamycin from resinate. Rheological studies were also conducted to select the optimum amounts of the suspending agents. The release profiles of clindamycin in SGF and SIF were also evaluated from freshly prepared suspension and from suspension formulation after storage for 1 month at 25 °C and 40 °C. Clindamycin bitterness threshold was determined based on volunteers' evaluation, and taste evaluation was conducted in 12 adult volunteers who evaluated the taste of the optimized suspension against clindamycin solution. Among all resins tested, Amberlite IRP 69 showed the highest binding efficiency to clindamycin. Several excipients were selected into the suspension formulation based on no or minimum influence on the release of clindamycin from the resinate complex. Moreover, xanthan gum was selected as the optimal suspending agent for the suspension. Clindamycin release profiles in SGF or SIF showed 90% release within 30 min from freshly prepared sample. Clindamycin exhibited good stability profiles at 25 °C and 40 °C over 1 month storage. The mean bitterness threshold of clindamycin was 12.5 μg/ml, and taste evaluation study in adults showed sustainable taste improvement for suspension over clindamycin solution. Clindamycin/resin complexation has shown to be an efficient method to mask the taste of clindamycin and was developed into a suspension formulation that can be used in pediatrics. "
31,25747220,"Children generally reject taking medicine which does not have a favorable shape, taste, flavor, etc. However, if a child who needs to take a medicine, rejects taking it, he might never recover from his condition. When a child is unable to take medicine orally, it is intravenously administered, and he and his caregivers then may experience stress. Syrups and suspensions are considered as favorable types of dosage forms in which to orally administer medicine to infants and children. However, they may have disadvantages such as solubility, a bad taste, portability problems or required refrigerator storage. World Health Organization (WHO) currently favors that infants and children be treated with oral solid medicines. New oral solid tablets, such as a mini-tablet, instead of liquid medicines are proposed for this group, however, there are a few reports that mini-tablets are suitable for infants and children. Palatability is one of the main elements of patient acceptability of an oral pediatric medicine. Palatability is defined as the overall appreciation of an oral medicinal product in relation to its smell, taste, aftertaste and feeling in the mouth. Design of the formulation of an oral pediatric medicine should be considered together with its palatability. "
32,26402434,"The insulin-responsive facilitative glucose transporter GLUT4 is of fundamental importance for maintenance of glucose homeostasis. Despite intensive effort, the ability to express and purify sufficient quantities of structurally and functionally intact protein for biophysical analysis has previously been exceedingly difficult. We report here the development of novel methods to express, purify, and functionally reconstitute GLUT4 into detergent micelles and proteoliposomes. Rat GLUT4 containing FLAG and His tags at the amino and carboxy termini, respectively, was engineered and stably transfected into HEK-293 cells. Overexpression in suspension culture yielded over 1.5 mg of protein per liter of culture. Systematic screening of detergent solubilized GLUT4-GFP fusion protein via fluorescent-detection size exclusion chromatography identified lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG) as highly effective for isolating monomeric GLUT4 micelles. Preservation of structural integrity and ligand binding was demonstrated via quenching of tryptophan fluorescence and competition of ATB-BMPA photolabeling by cytochalasin B. GLUT4 was reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs and proper folding was confirmed. Reconstitution of purified GLUT4 with amphipol A8-35 stabilized the transporter at elevated temperatures for extended periods of time. Functional activity of purified GLUT4 was confirmed by reconstitution of LMNG-purified GLUT4 into proteoliposomes and measurement of saturable uptake of D-glucose over L-glucose. Taken together, these data validate the development of an efficient means to generate milligram quantities of stable and functionally intact GLUT4 that is suitable for a wide array of biochemical and biophysical analyses.

33,35532810,"Dielectric spectroscopy has been used in the study and development of non-invasive glucose monitoring (NIGM) sensors, including the range of microwave frequencies. Dielectric relaxation of red blood cell (RBC) cytosolic water in the microwave frequency band has been shown to be sensitive to variations in the glucose concentration of RBC suspensions. It has been hypothesized that this sensitivity stems from the utilization of D-glucose by RBCs. To verify this proposition, RBCs were pretreated with inhibitors of D-glucose uptake (cytochalasin B and forskolin). Then their suspensions were exposed to different D-glucose concentrations as measured by microwave dielectric spectroscopy (MDS) in the 500 MHz-40 GHz frequency band. After incubation of RBCs with either inhibitor, the dielectric response of water in the cytoplasm, and specifically its relaxation time, demonstrated minimal sensitivity to the change of D-glucose concentration in the medium. This result allows us to conclude that the sensitivity of MDS to glucose uptake is associated with variations in the balance of bulk and bound RBC cytosolic water due to intracellular D-glucose metabolism, verifying the correctness of the initial hypothesis. These findings represent a further argument to establish the dielectric response of water as a marker of glucose variation in RBCs. "
34,25784402,"To develop an extemporaneous 1% benznidazole (BNZ) suspension, with masked taste and adequate stability starting from available commercial tablets. The quality of compounding was evaluated through content uniformity measurement and physical and microbiological stability evaluation, under different storage conditions during 90 days. Six batches of 1% BNZ suspension were prepared using safe excipients currently available in a galenic area of Hospital Pharmacy and then stored at 5 and 25 °C for 90 days. The BNZ content was determined by UV spectrophotometry. Physical stability was defined as the absence of colour, odour and/or flavour changes and the re-suspension of solid phase by a reasonable amount of simple 15-s shaking. The compliance with microbiological attributes of non-sterile pharmaceutical products was also evaluated. An oral liquid suspension, containing 1% of BNZ, was developed from commercially available BNZ tablets. The formulations stored for 90 days were easily re-dispersed after a simple 15-s shaking, ensuring the pouring of a liquid volume containing the desired dose of BNZ. All samples were within the acceptable range of BNZ concentration with minimal standard deviations. There were no detectable changes in colour, odour, viscosity, pH and microbial growth, complying with official quality requirements. The quality attributes were not affected by storage, room or refrigeration conditions or by the frequent opening or closing of the multidose containers. Paediatric oral liquid suspension containing 1.0% of BNZ was easily prepared starting from commercial tablets, being an interesting alternative for optimising the paediatric treatment of Chagas disease.

35,8878244,"Azithromycin, the prototypical azalide antibiotic, has a wide spectrum of activity that is characterized by resistance to beta-lactamase-producing microbes and efficacy against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae. Tissue-directed pharmacokinetics include tissue concentrations up to 100-fold higher than those in plasma and a tissue half-life of up to 4 days. Pharmacokinetics of azithromycin permits a reduction in dosage frequency and duration while maintaining efficacy comparable to that of conventional 7- to 10-day three or four times daily regimens. Dosage interval, duration of treatment, side effects and palatability can affect compliance and thus clinical outcome. Compliance among children is important in light of the high incidence of community-acquired infections such as otitis media and streptococcal pharyngitis. To compare the flavor, taste acceptability and color preference of oral antibiotic suspensions given to children. The taste and acceptability of the oral suspension form of azithromycin vs. cefixime, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefprozil, clarithromycin or loracarbef were rated by children during blinded taste tests and with acceptability/ preference questionnaires. Analysis of the mean acceptability/ preference rating from 769 children demonstrated that the flavor of azithromycin was rated significantly higher than that of cefpodoxime (4.3 vs. 2.8), cefprozil (4.0 vs. 3.4) and clarithromycin (4.3 vs. 2.7) and was comparable to that of cefixime (4.0 vs. 4.2) and loracarbef (4.4 vs. 4.5). A greater percentage of children preferred the taste of azithromycin to that of cefpodoxime (90.0% vs. 5.2%), cefprozil (63.0% vs. 33.1%) and clarithromycin (89.0% vs. 11.0%). The taste of azithromycin was not preferred to that of cefixime (39.0% vs. 53.9%) or loracarbef (36% vs. 58.5%). The efficacy and safety of azithromycin in otitis media and streptococcal pharyngitis, the simple dosing regimen and a highly palatable oral suspension formulation should increase compliance among pediatric patients and thereby improve clinical outcomes.

36,24061605,"This in situ study aimed to investigate the effect of a sugar-free antibiotic suspension containing amoxicillin and clavulanic acid on enamel hardness of human primary teeth simulating different conditions of cariogenic challenge. A crossover, partially double-blind study was conducted in three phases of 14 days each, during which 11 volunteers wore palatal devices containing six dental enamel blocks covered with plastic meshes to allow biofilm formation. Dental blocks were extraorally submitted to treatment with a 20 % sucrose solution at three different daily frequencies of exposure (0, 3, and 8 times/day), and to the antibiotic suspension or its excipients at an 8-h time interval application regimen. On the 14th day of each phase, the blocks were removed for enamel analysis (surface and cross-sectional microhardness--SMH and CSMH). The antibiotic suspension showed significant higher SMH and CSMH values than the excipients (p < 0.05; Wilcoxon), regardless of the frequency of sucrose exposure. Sucrose exposure did not account for further enamel demineralization both for antibiotic and excipients (p > 0.05; Friedman). A protective effect of the antibiotic suspension on enamel demineralization was verified because its excipients alone promoted more pronounced surface and subsurface enamel demineralization, even in the absence of sucrose exposure. The use of a sugar-free amoxicillin/clavulanic acid suspension may promote a protective effect on primary enamel demineralization probably due to its topical effect on dental biofilm. "
37,15478849,"Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is a ubiquitous disorder in infants. Whereas infants typically outgrow regurgitation by 1 year of age, the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms in those aged 3 to >18 years ranges from 1.8% to 22%. The pathophysiology of GERD in children is similar to that in adults. However, children may present with gastroesophageal and extraesophageal symptoms distinct from classic heartburn. In addition to a growing awareness of the high prevalence of the disorder, increasing evidence supports GERD being a lifelong condition in some individuals that begins in childhood. Although the diagnostic workup in children compared with adults may differ, studies suggest that the early detection and treatment of GERD in childhood may result in better adult disease outcomes, improved quality of life, and decreased overall healthcare burden. Studies of proton pump inhibitor therapy in children confirm high rates of mucosal healing and GER symptom resolution, even in children whose symptoms did not respond to H2-receptor therapy or fundoplication procedures. Omeprazole, lansoprazole, and esomeprazole are formulated as capsules containing enteric-coated granules that can be sprinkled onto applesauce or other soft foods. Lansoprazole is also formulated as strawberry-flavored granules for suspension. These as well as other alternative dosing formulations expand the ability to administer these agents to children. Moreover, long-term studies in adults and in children demonstrate that these agents are safe and well tolerated, even at the higher milligram per kilogram doses that are often required in pediatric patients because of their greater hepatic metabolic capacity.

38,36432645,"Prednisolone is a frequently prescribed steroid with a bitter, unpalatable taste that can result in treatment refusal. Oral suspensions or powder dosage forms are often prescribed, particularly to pediatric patients, as they improve swallowability and ease of dose adjustment. Consequently, the bitterness of prednisolone is more apparent in these dosage forms. Few studies have investigated prednisolone's bitterness. Thus, in this study, 50 adults evaluated the bitterness of prednisolone using the generalized Labeled Magnitude Scale (gLMS), in comparison with quinine, a standard bitter substance. Overall, prednisolone-saturated solution demonstrated the same extent (mean gLMS score: 46.8) of bitterness as 1 mM quinine solution (mean gLMS score: 40.1). Additionally, large individual differences were observed in the perception of the bitterness of prednisolone and quinine. Perceived flavors of some drugs are reportedly associated with bitter-taste receptor (TAS2Rs) polymorphisms. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between subjects' genetic polymorphisms of  "
39,20237383,"The stability of an extemporaneously prepared clopidogrel oral suspension was studied. Methods Clopidogrel oral suspension (5 mg/mL) was prepared using clopidogrel bisulfate tablets, Ora-Plus, and Ora-Sweet. Six 2-oz samples were prepared; three were stored at room temperature and three under refrigeration. One milliliter was withdrawn from each sample, diluted to 10 mL with methanol, and exposed to high-frequency sound waves in a water bath to ensure complete dissolution of clopidogrel. A 300-microL sample was then withdrawn, diluted with mobile phase to an expected concentration of 15 microg/mL, and assayed in duplicate using high- performance liquid chromatography immediately after preparation and at 7, 14, 28, and 60 days. The stability of the clopidogrel suspension was determined by calculating the percentage of the initial concentration remaining on each test day. Stability was defined as retention of at least 90% of the initial concentration. At least 97% of the initial clopidogrel concentration remained throughout the 60-day study period, regardless of storage conditions. There were no detectable changes in color, odor, taste, or pH and no visible microbial growth in any sample. The preparation was palatable, with a slightly gritty consistency and a slightly bitter aftertaste; the bitterness intensified slightly between 28 and 60 days but remained fairly mild. Extemporaneously compounded suspensions of clopidogrel, 5 mg/mL, in a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Plus and Ora-Sweet were stable for at least 60 days when stored in amber plastic bottles at room temperature and under refrigeration.

40,30852650,"Oral contrast preparation is fundamental to ensuring diagnostic examination quality for magnetic resonance enterography (MRE), yet little is known about the relative palatability and tolerability of various oral contrast agents in pediatric patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease. We prospectively compared three MRE oral preparations in pediatric patients with known or suspected Crohn disease with respect to patient-reported tolerability and radiologist-determined small-bowel distension and opacification. Seventy-five pediatric patients (mean age 14.8 years, 55% female) with known or suspected Crohn disease referred for MRE were randomized to an oral preparation with a sugar alcohol-based flavored beverage (Breeza), polyethylene glycol preparation (MiraLAX), or low-concentration barium sulfate suspension (VoLumen). Patients were instructed to consume oral contrast agent (using a weight-based protocol) beginning 60 min prior to MRE imaging. Following MRE, patients completed a questionnaire regarding their oral preparation solution including: taste (1-5 scale), feeling of well-being (1-5 scale) and willingness to consume again (yes/no). Two radiologists reviewed all MRE exams and rated exams for global features (active disease, overall small-bowel distention [1-4 scale]) and features specific to individual small-bowel segments (extent of distention, maximal luminal diameter, opacification, and susceptibility artifact). Statistical methods included one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey honest difference and Fisher exact tests. The overall rate of completion of the entire prescribed contrast volume was 53% (40/75), with a significantly higher rate of completion for MiraLAX than for VoLumen (70% vs. 30%, P=0.007). Crossover to a different preparation occurred in nine patients (12%) and was significantly more frequent when the initial preparation was VoLumen versus MiraLAX (29% vs. 0%, P=0.005). Mean subjective taste ratings for both MiraLAX (3.4, P<0.0001) and Breeza (2.8, P=0.006) were superior to those of VoLumen (1.9), which persisted in the subset of patients with MRE evidence of active Crohn disease. Patients who consumed MiraLAX were more likely to be willing to drink it again compared to those consuming VoLumen (82% vs. 46%, P=0.009). Overall small-bowel distention and bowel-segment-specific metrics (distention, maximal diameter, opacification and susceptibility) did not significantly differ among groups. In pediatric patients with known or suspected Crohn disease, MiraLAX and Breeza were rated as more palatable than VoLumen, and all three preparations achieved a similar degree of small-bowel distension and opacification on MRE. Imaging centers performing MRE should stock multiple oral contrast preparations because a sizable proportion of children require more than one agent to ingest the requisite oral contrast volume. "
41,19136828,"This study evaluated acid production from cooked starch by Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus mitis, and the effects of alpha-amylase inhibitors (maltotriitol and acarbose) and xylitol on acid production. Streptococcal cell suspensions were anaerobically incubated with various carbohydrates that included cooked potato starch in the presence or absence of alpha-amylase. Subsequently, the fall in pH and the acid production rate at pH 7.0 were measured. In addition, the effects of adding alpha-amylase inhibitors and xylitol to the reaction mixture were evaluated. In the absence of alpha-amylase, both the fall in pH and the acid production rate from cooked starch were small. On the other hand, in the presence of alpha-amylase, the pH fell to 3.9-4.4 and the acid production rate was 0.61-0.92 micromol per optical density unit per min. These values were comparable to those for maltose. When using cooked starch, the fall in pH by S. sanguinis and S. mitis was similar to that by S. mutans and S. sobrinus. For all streptococci, alpha-amylase inhibitors caused a decrease in acid production from cooked starch, although xylitol only decreased acid production by S. mutans and S. sobrinus. These results suggest that cooked starch is potentially acidogenic in the presence of alpha-amylase, which occurs in the oral cavity. In terms of the acidogenic potential of cooked starch, S. sanguinis and S. mitis were comparable to S. mutans and S. sobrinus. Alpha-amylase inhibitors and xylitol might moderate this activity. "
42,22478950,"Prescribing of diclofenac for children usually involves a dose different from commercially available strengths. This drug is available only as tablets, which can be divided only so many times before the dose obtained becomes inaccurate. In addition, children may have difficulty swallowing tablets. For these reasons, a compounding formula for a liquid dosage form is essential to ensure effective delivery of the drug to pediatric patients. To develop a compounding formula for diclofenac sodium and to determine the extended physical and chemical stability of this compound when stored in amber polyvinyl chloride (PVC) prescription bottles under refrigeration and at room temperature. A suspension of diclofenac sodium (10 mg/mL) was prepared from commercially available diclofenac sodium tablets, with Ora-Blend as the suspending and flavouring agent. The suspension was packaged in 60-mL amber PVC prescription bottles and stored at either room temperature (23°C) or under refrigeration (5°C). Samples were collected on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 27, 56, and 93. Chemical stability was determined using a validated stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography method. At each sampling time, the suspensions were checked for changes in appearance (i.e., colour, layering, caking, ease of resuspension), odour, and pH. The diclofenac sodium suspensions were very stable, retaining at least 99.5% of the original concentration for up to 93 days, regardless of storage temperature. There were no apparent changes in the physical appearance of the suspensions, nor were there any substantial changes in odour or pH. Suspensions of diclofenac sodium (10 mg/mL) were quantitatively stable but difficult to prepare because of the enteric coating of the tablets. Therefore, it is recommended that diclofenac powder be used for the preparation of suspensions. For pediatric use, palatability is a consideration, and a masking agent should be added before administration. An expiry date of up to 93 days is suggested. La prescription de diclofénac aux enfants requiert généralement une dose qui ne correspond à aucun des dosages disponibles dans le commerce. Ce médicament n’existe que sous forme de comprimés qui ne peuvent être subdivisés que quelques fois sans compromettre l’exactitude de la dose obtenue. En outre, les enfants peuvent avoir du mal à avaler les comprimés. Pour ces raisons, il faut une recette pour la préparation d’une forme pharmaceutique liquide afin d’assurer l’administration effective du médicament aux patients en pédiatrie. Développer une recette pour la préparation de diclofénac sodique et déterminer la stabilité physique et chimique prolongée de cette préparation lorsqu’elle est conservée dans des flacons en polychlorure de vinyle (PVC) ambré pour médicaments d’ordonnance au réfrigérateur ou à la température ambiante. Une suspension de diclofénac sodique (10 mg/mL) a été préparée à partir de comprimés de diclofénac sodique commercialisés avec l’agent de suspension et aromatisant, Ora-Blend. La suspension a été conditionnée dans des flacons en PVC ambré de 60 mL pour médicaments d’ordonnance, puis entreposée à la température ambiante (23 °C) ou au réfrigérateur (5 °C). Des échantillons ont été prélevés aux jours 0, 7, 14, 21, 27, 56 et 93. La stabilité chimique a été déterminée à l’aide d’une épreuve validée par chromatographie liquide haute performance. À chaque prélèvement d’échantillon, les suspensions ont été inspectées visuellement pour déceler tout changement d’apparence (c.-à-d., couleur, stratification, agglutination et facilité de remise en suspension), d’odeur et de pH. Les suspensions de diclofénac sodique sont demeurées très stables, conservant plus de 99,5 % de la concentration initiale pendant une période allant jusqu’à 93 jours, peu importe les conditions d’entreposage. On n’a observé aucun changement évident dans l’apparence des suspensions ni de changement substantiel dans l’odeur ou le pH des suspensions. Les suspensions de diclofénac sodique (10 mg/mL) étaient quantitativement stables, mais difficiles à préparer à cause de l’enrobage entérosoluble des comprimés. Par conséquent, il est recommandé d’utiliser plutôt le diclofénac en poudre. La palatabilité étant un facteur dont il faut tenir compte en pédiatrie, on devrait ajouter un masquant du goût avant l’administration de la préparation. La durée de conservation suggérée est de 93 jours au maximum. [Traduction par l’éditeur] "
43,2511611,"The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the taste of two formulations of phenoxymethylpenicillin suspension in children. The two suspensions, designated Test and Standard, differed only in their flavouring and sweetening agents. The secondary objectives were to study age-related differences in taste perception, to evaluate the acceptability of the suspensions, and to determine patient compliance. In 319 children with acute otitis media a taste description was recorded after a single therapeutic dose. The patient's own spontaneous verbal judgements, directly after the dose intake and also 3-4 minutes later, were recorded. The parents were asked about the child's acceptance of the suspension after finalized treatment. For 214 patients compliance was calculated from the remaining amount of suspension in the returned medication bottles. The study indicated that children aged 6 years or older considered the test formulation to be better-tasting than the standard formulation. The judgements by the parents also indicated that the test suspension was more acceptable. In children below 6 years there was no significant difference between the two suspensions with regard to taste or acceptance. A high patient compliance (greater than or equal to 90%) was obtained in 88% of the patients. "
44,23092239,"The increasing interest in probiotic lactobacilli in health maintenance has raised the question of potential risks. One possible side effect could be an increased acidogenicity in dental plaque. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of probiotic lactobacilli on plaque lactic acid (LA) production in vitro and in vivo. In the first part (A), suspensions of two lactobacilli strains (L. reuteri DSM 17938, L. plantarum 299v) were added to suspensions of supragingival dental plaque collected from healthy young adults (n=25). LA production after fermentation with either xylitol or fructose was analyzed. In the second part (B), subjects (n=18) were given lozenges with probiotic lactobacilli (L. reuteri DSM 17938 and ATCC PTA 5289) or placebo for two weeks in a double-blinded, randomized cross-over trial. The concentration of LA in supragingival plaque samples was determined at baseline and after 2 weeks. Salivary counts of mutans streptococci (MS) and lactobacilli were estimated with chair-side methods. Plaque suspensions with L. reuteri DSM 17938 produced significantly less LA compared with L. plantarum 299v or controls (p<0.05). Fructose gave higher LA concentrations than xylitol. In part B, there were no significant differences in LA production between baseline and follow up in any of the groups and no differences between test and placebo were displayed. The salivary MS counts were not significantly altered during the intervention but the lactobacilli counts increased significantly in the test group (p<0.05). Lactic acid production in suspensions of plaque and probiotic lactobacilli was strain-dependant and the present study provides no evidence of an increase in plaque acidity by the supply of selected probiotic lactobacilli when challenged by fructose or xylitol. The study protocol was approved by The Danish National Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics (protocol no H-2-2010-112). NCT01700712. "
45,28271493,"Prednisone is a widely used anti-inflammatory for a variety of conditions. While oral liquid formulations of prednisone enable weight-based dosing, children frequently find them to be objectionable due to bitter taste. This limitation of prednisone can adversely impact patient acceptance and may result in non-compliance. Efforts to mask flavours often result in poorly controlled, heterogeneous particle distributions and can provide ineffective taste masking. The present work utilized a novel drug delivery technology developed by Orbis Biosciences, Inc., to create an oral taste-masked formulation of prednisone. The study examined the palatability of Orbis' microsphere prednisone formulation in healthy young adults (n = 24). Four test articles were used in the study including a reference formulation (Roxanne Laboratories), a control and the test formulation (Orbis) prepared in two different ways. Study participants were randomized in a crossover design. Results indicated that the test prednisone formulation was indistinguishable from the control, and both were preferable to the reference formulation in every category of palatability assessed using a validated 9-point Hedonic Scale. The data also suggested that preparing the microsphere suspension immediately before administration results in the most ideal palatability properties. In conclusion, the novel microsphere formulation technology was effective in taste-masking prednisone. "
46,15154922,"This study aimed to investigate two dose regimens of xylitol-containing tablets on the ecology of dental plaque and saliva during treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances. The study group comprised 56 healthy patients (mean age 15.8 yr) randomly assigned into the following groups: A, (n = 23) two xylitol tablets two times a day (1.7 g xylitol d(-1)) for 18 wk; B, (n = 23) two tablets four times per day (3.4 g xylitol d(-1)) for 18 wk; and C, (n = 10) no tablets. The levels of mutans streptococci (ms) were enumerated in plaque and saliva and the proportion of xylitol-sensitive (X(S)) strains in saliva was determined by autoradiography with [(14)C]-xylitol at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 wk. The lactic acid formation rate was assessed enzymatically in sucrose-challenged plaque suspensions. A drop in salivary ms levels was found in Group A after 6 wk but not after 12 or 18 wk. The proportion of X(S) ms was decreased after 6 wk in groups A and B and remained so during the experimental period. The lactic acid formation rates decreased slightly ( approximately 10%) in the two xylitol groups compared with baseline. In conclusion, our results showed that although an alteration of ms strains was demonstrated following a regular daily low-dose intake of xylitol, the long-term total ms counts in plaque and saliva as well as plaque acidogenicity remained unchanged.

47,16732449,"Growing evidence from clinical studies suggests that mothers using xylitol gums or lozenges have decreased levels of Streptococcus mutans (SM) and do not transmit these cariogenic bacteria as readily to their children. To begin to determine mechanisms for these clinical findings and to explore potential synergism of antimicrobial combinations, we studied the effect of multiple exposures of chlorhexidine (CHX) combined with copper gluconate (CG) or zinc gluconate (ZG) followed by xylitol (XYL) on the ability of SM to adhere and form biofilms. Cell suspensions of SM were exposed two times to CHX; CG; CHX plus CG; ZG; and CHX plus ZG, and then four times to XYL. Control cells were exposed six times to water or XYL or received no treatment. For biofilm assessment, glass slides were inoculated with treated cells, and numbers of bacteria were enumerated after 48 hours of incubation. To assess the ability of SM to adhere, microtiter plate wells coated with primary S. sanguinis biofilms grown in sucrose were inoculated with treated SM, and adhesion was determined. Cells exposed to CHX-XYL combinations exhibited significant but transient inhibition of growth. The multiple-exposure regimen groups showed significant decreases in the ability of SM to form biofilms (P < 0.05). However, the CHX-XYL group exhibited a much greater effect than the other treatment groups (P < 0.001). Adhesion studies revealed that none of the multiple-exposure regimens had a significant effect on adhesion of SM to primary biofilms of S. sanguinis. We concluded that significant inhibition of SM growth and subsequent inability to grow as biofilms in the presence of sucrose occurs after a staggered exposure regimen to CHX initially and then to XYL. This may help explain the clinical data showing the decreased levels of SM in mothers treated with CHX and XYL. "

49,2024660,"Hypernatremic dehydration due to unreplaced stool water losses often complicates the use of the osmotic cathartic lactulose in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. Sorbitol, another osmotic cathartic commonly used in the treatment of drug intoxications, has been reported in the pediatric literature to induce severe hypernatremia, but there is only a rare case report in an adult. We report a dramatic case of severe hypernatremia secondary to repetitive administration of activated charcoal-sorbitol suspension for the treatment of phenobarbital intoxication in an adult. Based on our experience with this case, several recommendations are provided regarding management of drug intoxications with charcoal-sorbitol suspension, including meticulous attention to fluid-electrolyte balance, type of replacement fluid, and dosing of the suspension.

50,26386139,"Praziquantel (PZQ), an anthelmintic drug used in developing countries for the treatment of schistosome infections, was processed using the fluid bed wet granulation technology to prepare fast dispersible granules, as an appropriate and flexible dosage form for pre-school-aged children. Granulation experiments were performed incorporating PZQ either in the powder mixture, according to the traditional way, or in the liquid phase containing wetting agents. In the powder mixture several excipients were tested: Flowlac 100 as filler, Galeniq 721 (isomalt) and Neosorb P 100 T (D-sorbitol) as sweeteners and PVP K30 as binder; while in the liquid phase Lutrol F68, Cremophor RH 40 or Tween 80 as surfactants were investigated. Different formulations loaded with 10% w/w (batches 1-8) and 20% w/w of PZQ (batches 9-13) were produced The majority of granules displayed good flow properties and uniform drug content. X-ray powder diffraction showed that PZQ remained in its original crystalline state, while differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform-infrared analysis evidenced the formation of chemical interactions among the ingredients. The solubilisation test performed in non-sink condition to reproduce the actual condition in which a child of 4 years takes the medicine revealed that granules quickly formed a very fine suspension in water (dV90=39.9 μm). Although after the granulation process the solubility of raw PZQ was not increased, adding the aqueous suspension to 500 ml of buffer solution of pH 1.5, simulating the fasted state of a child, 50% of the drug was dissolved after 30 min. After granule manipulation with milk and fruit juices, no PZQ degradation was observed during time. Finally, the selected granule formulation provided evidence to be stable even at hot and very humid climate (30°C/75% RH), at least for the examined time. "
51,8792942,"To evaluate the palatability of four commonly prescribed antistaphylococcal antibiotics, cloxacillin, cephalexin, erythromycin, and fusidic acid, in volunteer children. A single-blind taste test of four flavored antibiotic suspensions commonly used in the treatment of skin infections in pediatric patients. University teaching hospital. Twenty healthy volunteer children with a mean age of 9.2 +/- 2.0 SD years (range 6-12). The taste of each antibiotic was rated by the children on a 10-cm visual analog scale incorporating a facial hedonic scale. The children were also asked which antibiotic they thought tasted the best and which tasted the worst. Taste scores were as follows: cloxacillin 1.4 +/- 1.8 cm, cephalexin 6.5 +/- 2.7 cm, erythromycin 6.8 +/- 3.0 cm, and fusidic acid 6.3 +/- 2.4 cm. The taste rating of cloxacillin was significantly lower compared with the other three antibiotics (p = 0.001). Cloxacillin was chosen as having the worst taste by a significant proportion of the children (18 of 20). None of the antibiotics was clearly best tasting. Given similar effectiveness, taste considerations may be important in the decision as to which antibiotic to prescribe. The perception that cloxacillin is poor tasting to children is supported by this study, which suggests that when compliance with oral medication is critical for successful treatment, prescription of cloxacillin suspension should be avoided.

52,23383224,"This study aimed to investigate the possible topical effect of a broad-spectrum antibiotic on dental biofilm formed in situ in the absence or presence of sucrose. A crossover study was conducted in three phases of 14 days each, during which 11 volunteers wore palatal devices containing 6 enamel blocks covered with meshes to allow biofilm formation. Dental blocks were extraorally submitted to a 20% sucrose solution at three different frequencies of exposure (0, 3 and 8 times/day), and to a suspension of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium (A/CP) or a placebo (P) suspension at an 8-hour time interval application regimen. On the 14(th) day of each phase, biofilms were collected for microbiological (conventional culture) and molecular (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis--DGGE) analyses. In the absence of sucrose exposure (SE) and at the 3-time daily frequency, dental biofilms treated with A/CP showed lower total biofilm weight and lower counts of total microbiota than the ones treated with P (p>0.05). A/CP presented higher counts of Candida spp. when compared with P in the presence of SE, especially at the 8-time daily frequency (p<0.05). Considering the DGGE analysis, the mean number of bands was higher for P (p>0.05), regardless of SE. However, DGGE profiles demonstrated large interindividual variability. Both conventional culture and DGGE have demonstrated some differences on total microbiota of dental biofilms when exposed to the A/CP or P suspensions, mainly in the absence of sucrose, which suggests a possible topical effect of the sugar-free A/CP suspension on dental biofilm.

53,21607955,"Electronic tongues are sensor array systems that are increasingly being used in the field of pharmaceutics to provide taste assessment data of formulations. The applicability of an electronic tongue in the development of a taste masked generic ibuprofen suspension, starting from a commercial taste masked product, was evaluated in this study. The initial screening study on 3 proprietary and 11 generic products showed that sensors of the taste sensing system TS-5000Z could clearly detect differences between the products. The variation of sensor responses were mainly caused by sodium salts, sweeteners, and preservatives, whereas pH and viscosity did not affect sensor response. In addition, the presence of the particles (20-100 µm) did not damage the sensor membranes. Based on this screening, and the known qualitative composition of the proprietary formulations, the approximate quantitative composition of a proprietary formulation could be deduced and a taste masked generic formulation could be developed using the electronic tongue data. Differences in sensor responses between the proprietary and optimized generic formulation were smaller than 11 mV for each sensor. Based on these results a rational approach of implementing an electronic tongue to simplify the development of a taste masked generic formulation could be introduced. "
54,18245869,"Palatability is an important factor in medication compliance for children where the acceptability of a liquid medication and its ease of administration will be greatly affected by its taste. The objective of this study was to determine which, if any of two steroid preparations, oral dexamethasone or oral prednisolone, was more palatable to children requiring steroid treatment for asthma. A single-blind taste test of 2 different steroid suspensions, liquid prednisolone (1mg/ml) versus liquid dexamethasone (1mg/ml), was conducted in children aged 5-12 years, presenting to the pediatric emergency department with an exacerbation of asthma requiring steroid treatment. Children received 2.5mls of either prednisolone or dexamethasone and were asked to score their impression of taste on a 10 cm visual analog scale. After cleansing of the palate they were given the other steroid and scored its taste. Thirty-nine children (54% male) were enrolled in the study. The mean age was 7.1 years (SD=2.0). The median visual analog scale measurement for dexamethasone was 8.2 cm (IQR= 5.2) whilst the median measurement for prednisolone was 5.0 cm (IQR= 7.3), p=0.03. Male children were more likely to prefer dexamethasone than females with a median score of 9.9 cm (IQR=3.8) for males vs. 5.9 cm (IQR=9.3) for females, p=0.005. There was no gender preference for prednisolone. There was a statistically significant difference between the taste of dexamethasone and prednisolone, with dexamethasone being the preferred steroid among pediatric patients with asthma. Males were much more likely to prefer dexamethasone than females. "
55,38257156,"This study aimed to compare whether a super bolus (SB) is a more efficient strategy than a normal bolus (NB) for high glycemic index (h-GI) meals in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). A randomized, double-blind, crossover trial with an allocation ratio of 1:1, registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04019821). 72 children aged 10-18 years with T1D > 1 year, and on insulin pump therapy > 3 months were included. As an intervention, they ate a h-GI breakfast for the two following days and receive a prandial insulin bolus either in the form of SB or NB. The SB group had lower glucose values during the observation time and lower glucose levels in 90th min (primary end point). The median time in range was also higher after SB. At the same time, more hypoglycemic episodes and a higher time below range were noted in this group. Almost 90% of them were the threshold value for initiating treatment for hypoglycemia and occurred near the end of observation period. More hyperglycemic episodes and over twice as much time in hyperglycemia were noted after NB. Super bolus is an effective strategy to avoid postprandial hyperglycemia but the basal insulin suspension should be longer to avoid hypoglycemia (f.ex. 3 h). "
56,8777661,"A substance commercially described as 'sugar free,' used as a sweetener for paracetamol suspension, was evaluated on measures of neonatal pain. Sixty infants were randomly allocated to receive one of four solutions before heel stab blood sampling: sterile water (placebo); 25 or 50% sucrose (weight/volume); and the commercial sweet-tasting solution. There was a significant reduction in crying time and pain score 3 minutes after the painful stimulus in all groups compared with the controls. It is concluded that this sweet-tasting solution has analgesic effects as potent as those of concentrated sucrose solutions. "
57,8431459,"We have investigated the mechanism by which amiloride and 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA) inhibit glucose-stimulated medium acidification in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The addition of glucose to an unbuffered suspension of cells results in the extrusion of acid. This process was inhibited by diethylstilbestrol (DES), an inhibitor of the H(+)-ATPase (IC50 71 microM), and also by amiloride (IC50 824 microM) and EIPA (IC50 203 microM). The presence of 100 mM NaCl reduced the degree of inhibition observed for amiloride and EIPA, but had no effect on inhibition by DES. N-Methylglucosamine partially protected the cells against the effect of amiloride, but choline chloride did not, suggesting that sodium may be important in the action of amiloride. To establish the site of action of amiloride and EIPA, ATP hydrolysis assays were performed on isolated plasma membranes. H(+)-ATPase activity was inhibited by orthovanadate, but not by amiloride or EIPA. However, both amiloride and EIPA were found to inhibit the incorporation of radioactivity from labelled glucose in S. pombe, with IC50 values of 879 and 272 microM for amiloride and EIPA respectively. Again, 100 mM NaCl was found to reduce the effectiveness of inhibition. Amiloride had no effect on the uptake of 2-deoxyglucose under the same conditions, indicating that amiloride does not inhibit the glucose transporter. We propose that amiloride and EIPA disrupt glucose-induced acidification by inhibiting glucose metabolism. "
58,1590430,"To determine whether growth hormone (GH) directly affects ammoniagenesis in the renal proximal tubule, ammonia production was measured in suspensions of isolated canine renal proximal tubule segments (IPTs) incubated with 2.5 mM L-glutamine and varying concentrations of human growth hormone (hGH). Ammonia production from IPTs significantly increased by nearly threefold in the presence of hGH (10(-6) M) at 60 min. This increase was dose dependent, with as little as 10(-9) M hGH significantly stimulating ammonia production. In addition, hGH enhanced glucose production when lactate, alanine, and succinate replaced L-glutamine as substrate. hGH significantly stimulated ammonia production when IPTs were incubated at alkalotic and neutral pH. The effect of hGH was lost at acidic pH. When hGH was added to IPTs incubated under Na(+)-equilibrated conditions, ammonia production was not different from control. hGH stimulated ouabain-sensitive Na(+)-K(+)-adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) activity by 8.1 +/- 1.1% in basolateral membranes isolated from IPTs. hGH stimulation of proximal tubule ammonia production from L-glutamine occurs at physiological concentrations of hGH and when the extracellular-to-intracellular Na+ gradient favors L-glutamine transport. This effect is associated with an increase in basolateral Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity. The data suggest a role for hGH in the regulation of renal acid-base metabolism under physiological conditions in which increased net acid excretion is important. "
59,21894724,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has a prevalence of 10% to 20% in the pediatric population. The 24-hour pHmetry is still considered the ""gold standard"" for its correct diagnosis. Omeprazole is the elective drug for a proper treatment. However, there are no adequate pharmaceutical presentation forms for infants. To assess the acid suppression capacity of a new pharmaceutical association of omeprazole with sodium bicarbonate and sodium alginate (OBA), powder for oral suspension, in small infants with GERD. The response was measured according to the gastric variations of pH after a 3-day treatment with OBA. This is a pilot, prospective, open study in infants with no congenital nor associated anomalies under 12 months of age with GERD. Two double channel pHmetry with gastric sensor were performed on different days in the same patient. The first one to establish the diagnosis (day 0) and the second one (day 3) after receiving omeprazole (OBA) at 1.5 mg/kg/day in a twice/dose/day (BID). The comparison between the frst and the second gastric pHmetry showed a statistically significant reduction in gastric acidity. No adverse events were observed in infants and the suspension flavor was palatable. This new presentation of omeprazole (OBA) with sodium bicarbonate and sodium alginate powder for oral suspension is capable of a significant and intense acid suppression, necessary for treatment of infants with GERD. The taste of the solution was well accepted by all the babies, which is a very important finding for this age group. "
60,3333125,"Fourteen patients between the ages of 9 months and 5 years with chronic diarrhea and giardiasis were studied. Ten were eutrophic and 4 undernourished. The parasitological diagnosis was based on stool examination, a trophozoite search in duodenal aspiration, mucus adhered to mucosa and parasite identification in the intestinal biopsy material. Functional intestinal absorption studies, IgA determination in intestinal secretions and immunofluorescence studies were made. After the tests, tinidazole in suspension was administered at 60-70 mg/kg in one single oral dose. Patients were clinically re-evaluated and tests were done again after 30 days. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the changes in the functional morphologic and immunologic studies and the therapeutic efficacy of the drug in a single dose. Nine patients had good clinical results, 2 fair and 3 were not evaluated due to celiac disease. All had negative results on the parasitological tests after treatment. There was no relationship between the number of parasites and the severity of symptoms. There was no significant difference between stool fat and d-xylose at the time of diagnosis and 30 days after the administration of tinidazole. The lactose tolerance test presented a significant difference (p less than 0.05) in the disaccharide absorption after treatment. The secretory IgA revealed significantly lower value (p less than 0.01) with respect to the normal values. The immunofluorescence showed productive IgA cells in all cases. The histologic changes were: mild enteropathy (grade I) in 6 patients; moderate (grade II) in 5; and severe (grade III-IV) in 3. Improvement of the mucosa was seen in 6 patients. "
61,8345001,"The pharmacokinetics of fusidic acid (Fucidine, Leo Laboratories) were studied in 10 children after single oral dosing with 20 mg/kg of a new banana-flavoured paediatric suspension (titrating at 50 mg/ml). Nine blood samples were drawn from each child at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h following dosing with the antibiotic. Serum fusidic acid levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A model-independent method was used for the pharmacokinetic analysis. Results were compared with those obtained after dosing eight healthy adult volunteers with 500 mg of sodium fusidate by parenteral administration (infusion) then per os. The acceptability of the single dose was good. The terminal elimination half-life t1/2 (h) and the mean residence time (MRT, h) of fusidate were similar to those determined in healthy adults after oral dosing, i.e. 16.0 +/- 14.5 versus 16.0 +/- 3.5 and 17.7 +/- 12.1 versus 17.7 +/- 2.5, respectively. In contrast, the oral bioavailability of the suspension (Fapprox., %) was relatively low: of the order of 22.5 versus 91.0% for tablets in the healthy adult, which justifies the use of a relatively higher dose in the child. This led to the calculation of an estimated total clearance (Clest., ml/min) significantly less than that in the healthy adults, while the estimated apparent volume of distribution (Vd, litre/kg) was significantly increased (10.4 +/- 9.1 versus 21.8 +/- 2.1 and 0.73 +/- 0.53 versus 0.30 +/- 0.04, respectively). Fusidic acid is normally excreted in metabolized form (98%). The decrease in clearance could be attributed to the almost immediate saturation of liver enzymes in immature infants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) "
62,10499281,"Xylitol possesses anti-bacterial effects on pneumococci in vitro. To study the effect in vivo, the nostrils of 80 rats were inoculated with pneumococci. Intervention groups (n = 20) received either a xylitol diet or xylitol nasal sprays. The control groups were on a normal diet or had saline sprays. After 3 days, a quantitative bacterial culture and a PCR were done from the mucosal suspension. Neither the mean colony-forming unit counts nor the PCR counts differed statistically significant between the xylitol and control groups. Thus, we found that xylitol had no significant effect on pneumococcal mucosal colonisation. "
63,11169141,"Beta-galactosyllactose is a trisaccharide containing the beta-galactosidic linkage at the nonreducing end. The purpose of this study was to determine whether certain oral streptococci could utilize four kinds of beta-galactosyllactoses. Three of four beta-galactosyllactoses were unable to support growth of the oral streptococci and to be a substrate for producing acid from the cell suspensions and dental plaque. 4'-beta-Galactosyllactose supported growth of Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 35105, ATCC 49298, Streptococcus mitis ATCC 15914, Streptococcus oralis ATCC 35037, ATCC 10557 and Streptococcus milleri 10707 and produced acid from dental plaque. Although beta-galactosidase activities were observed in all the strains, 4'-beta-galactosyllactose could not be used as a carbon source for the growth of mutans streptococci. Enzymes metabolizing 4'-beta-galactosyllactose were induced when S. oralis ATCC 10557 was cultured in medium containing galactose. These results suggested that 4'-beta-galactosyllactose could be as cariogenic as lactose if it is consumed frequently and retained for a long period in the mouth. "
64,2847549,"To determine whether parathyroid hormone (PTH) affects ammoniagenesis in renal proximal tubule, we measured ammonia production in suspensions of canine renal proximal tubular segments incubated with 10 mM L-glutamine in the absence or presence of 10(-7) M PTH. Productions of ammonia were linear functions of time for 120 min and averaged 231 +/- 55 and 311 +/- 67 mumol ammonia/g protein in the absence and presence of PTH, respectively. When measured over the range of 10(-11)-10(-7) M PTH, half-maximal stimulation of ammonia production occurred between 10(-10) and 10(-9) M PTH. Maximal production of ammonia was observed at 10(-8) M PTH. Incubation of proximal tubular segments with PTH increased levels of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) in vitro. Ammonia production was significantly enhanced by incubation of segments with the cAMP analogue, 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate. PTH also increased ammonia production in segments incubated with 1 mM L-glutamine. We conclude that PTH stimulates ammonia production in canine renal proximal tubular segments. This effect appears to be mediated, at least in part, through cAMP in vitro. Such stimulation could reflect a direct action of PTH on the proximal tubule to enhance ammoniagenesis in vivo. "
65,3386134,"Renal hypertrophy is a common consequence of diabetes mellitus that precedes and possibly accounts for the increased glomerular filtration rate. We have postulated that the glucose-mediated increase in the intracellular concentration of sodium [Na]i initiates the chain of events leading to the increase in cell size and eventually cell number. Experiments were conducted on Sprague-Dawley rats made diabetic by the intravenous injection of 45 mg/kg body wt of streptozotocin dissolved in a 5 mM citrate buffer solution. Control animals were injected with the vehicle alone. Ninety-six hours and 11 weeks later, measurements of [Na]i were done by NMR spectroscopy on suspensions of proximal tubules, using dysprosium tripolyphosphate as an extracellular shift reagent. At 96 hours after the induction of the diabetes, there was a 60% increase in [Na]i compared to control (P less than 0.01). No further increase in [Na]i was observed during the subsequent 11 weeks of observation. Addition of ouabain (1.0 mM) resulted in a fourfold increase in [Na]i in tubules from control animals, and a 2.5-fold increase in tubules from 96-hour diabetic rats. Ouabain-inhibitable Na+-K+-ATPase activity was substantially higher in the renal tubules of diabetic rats, the increase being proportional to that of [Na]i. In order to ascertain the effect of hyperglycemia on [Na]i, proximal tubules prepared from kidneys of normal and diabetic rats were exposed to low (5 mM) and high (25 mM) concentration of glucose in the media.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) "
66,15641497,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the lactic acid concentration in supragingival plaque from caries-active pre-school children after a short-term use of either xylitol- or sorbitol-containing chewing gums. The investigation consisted of a prospective crossover design with 10 healthy children aged 2-4 years each with at least two caries lesions within the dentine (ds > or = 2). The children were instructed to chew 6 pieces of a test or a control gum every day for a 14-day period. The test gum contained 65% xylitol and the control gum was sweetened with sorbitol. At baseline and after 14 days, salivary mutans streptococci were enumerated with a chair-side test (Strip mutans) and dental plaque was collected from the upper maxillary incisors. After a washout period of 6 weeks, the same procedure was repeated with the corresponding test or control gum. Lactic acid was determined enzymatically in glucose-challenged plaque suspensions. The lactic acid concentration was significantly reduced (p<0.05) by 22% compared with baseline following the xylitol gum regimen but was unaltered after the control gum. The levels of salivary mutans streptococci were mainly unaffected by both chewing gums. A 14-day use of xylitol-containing chewing gums, corresponding to a daily amount of 5 grams of xylitol, could diminish glucose-initiated lactic acid formation in supragingival plaque in caries-active pre-school children.

67,7279470,"Cariogenicity of seven commonly prescribed liquid medications was studied. Sucrose content of the medications ranged from 0 to 70 gm/100 ml. Initial pH and buffering capacity were measured and found to vary widely among the medications. Intraoral microbial plaque pH changes were determined at intervals for 30 minutes following an oral rinse with each medication. These data were compared with plaque pH changes caused by rinsing with an established cariogenic challenge, 10% sucrose solution. Decreased plaque pH was caused by each medication tested. The extent and duration of the pH drop varied among the medications. Patterns of the pH curves are discussed in relation to sucrose content, endogenous pH, and buffering capacity of the medications. Intraoral pH response to several medications equaled or exceeded that seen when sucrose rinses alone were given. The findings are discussed in relation to dental caries-producing potential of long-term therapy with liquid medications, and two cases are presented that implicate liquid medications as a major etiologic factor leading to rampant dental decay. It is concluded that health practitioners should be aware of the sucrose content of pediatric medications. Patient education to ensure adequate oral clearance following each dose of medication is an essential first step in minimizing the risk of dental decay posed by long-term therapy with liquid medications.

68,11641569,"The cariogenic potential of lactosylfructoside [O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1-->4)-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1<-->2)-beta-D-fructofuranoside] was estimated by experiments on oral streptococci in vitro and human dental plaque in situ. Lactosylfructoside was unable to support growth of the strains of Streptococcus mutans and S. sobrinus used in this study. However, it was able to support growth of strains of S. sanguis, S. mitis and S. oralis. Acid was produced rapidly by cell suspensions of S. oralis ATCC 10557 incubated with lactosylfructoside. Application of 5% w/v solution decreased the pH of human dental plaque. The minimum pH value was below 5.3. The results suggest that lactosylfructoside is as acidogenic as lactose and could be cariogenic if it is consumed frequently and retained for a long period in the mouth. "
69,3237306,"A study was carried out to determine the effect of trypsin on glucose transport into brain cells. Two suspensions of dissociated cells were prepared from the two brain hemispheres of adult rats--one using only mechanical means to dissociate the cells and one using trypsin. The use of trypsin for preparation of dissociated brain cells caused a marked reduction in the rate of transport of [1,2-3H]-2-deoxy-D-glucose compared to uptakes of this glucose analog by cells prepared without trypsin. Responses of the two cell preparations to inhibitors of glucose transport (cytochalasin B and phloretin) were similar. Rates of oxidation of [6-14C]glucose to 14CO2 by trypsin-treated cells were nearly double those in cells prepared without trypsin. Electron microscopic examination of the two preparations revealed much less preservation of structural integrity if trypsin was used to prepare the cells. The findings suggest that trypsin alters cell structure and affects receptor-regulated events in brain cells. "
70,7595773,"The onset of hematochezia with the use of sodium polystyrene sulfonate enemas in an index case prompted us to review our experience with the use of such enemas in neonates. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate enemas were used in 20 of 2317 patients. Of these 20 patients, four (20%) had evidence of hematochezia temporally related to the use of the enemas. No episodes of such bleeding occurred in infants who were older than 29 weeks of gestation or larger than 1250 gm birth weight. In one case an autopsy performed within 2 days of the enemas showed extensive vascular congestion within the mucosa and submucosa with focal areas of hemorrhage. Approximately 20% sorbitol (1098 mOsm/L) was the vehicle for suspension of the sodium polystyrene sulfonate. On the basis of evidence regarding similar morbidities in adults, we are concerned that the hyperosmolar suspending agent, sorbitol, may be the cause of such pathologic conditions in the colon of susceptible infants.
