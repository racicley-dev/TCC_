0,37490085,"The large overlap between symptoms of acute sinusitis and viral upper respiratory tract infection suggests that certain subgroups of children being diagnosed with acute sinusitis, and subsequently treated with antibiotics, derive little benefit from antibiotic use. To assess if antibiotic therapy could be appropriately withheld in prespecified subgroups. Randomized clinical trial including 515 children aged 2 to 11 years diagnosed with acute sinusitis based on clinical criteria. The trial was conducted between February 2016 and April 2022 at primary care offices affiliated with 6 US institutions and was designed to evaluate whether symptom burden differed in subgroups defined by nasopharyngeal Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis on bacterial culture and by the presence of colored nasal discharge. Oral amoxicillin (90 mg/kg/d) and clavulanate (6.4 mg/kg/d) (n = 254) or placebo (n = 256) for 10 days. The primary outcome was symptom burden based on daily symptom scores on a validated scale (range, 0-40) during the 10 days after diagnosis. Secondary outcomes included treatment failure, adverse events including clinically significant diarrhea, and resource use by families. Most of the 510 included children were aged 2 to 5 years (64%), male (54%), White (52%), and not Hispanic (89%). The mean symptom scores were significantly lower in children in the amoxicillin and clavulanate group (9.04 [95% CI, 8.71 to 9.37]) compared with those in the placebo group (10.60 [95% CI, 10.27 to 10.93]) (between-group difference, -1.69 [95% CI, -2.07 to -1.31]). The length of time to symptom resolution was significantly lower for children in the antibiotic group (7.0 days) than in the placebo group (9.0 days) (P = .003). Children without nasopharyngeal pathogens detected did not benefit from antibiotic treatment as much as those with pathogens detected; the between-group difference in mean symptom scores was -0.88 (95% CI, -1.63 to -0.12) in those without pathogens detected compared with -1.95 (95% CI, -2.40 to -1.51) in those with pathogens detected. Efficacy did not differ significantly according to whether colored nasal discharge was present (the between-group difference was -1.62 [95% CI, -2.09 to -1.16] for colored nasal discharge vs -1.70 [95% CI, -2.38 to -1.03] for clear nasal discharge; P = .52 for the interaction between treatment group and the presence of colored nasal discharge). In children with acute sinusitis, antibiotic treatment had minimal benefit for those without nasopharyngeal bacterial pathogens on presentation, and its effects did not depend on the color of nasal discharge. Testing for specific bacteria on presentation may represent a strategy to reduce antibiotic use in this condition. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02554383. "
1,35913365,"Previous research has underscored a need to understand the experiences and decision-making processes that contribute to suspension and expulsion in early care and education settings, particularly among young children of color. The present study conducted qualitative interviews with 20 center- and family-based childcare providers from the Minnesota Early Care and Education (MECE) study. Participants were asked about challenging child behaviors that they have encountered, their perceptions of these behaviors and how they manage them, and their thought processes around suspension and expulsion. Overall, the most frequently reported categories of challenging behaviors were physical aggression and noncompliance/defiance/arguing. The most commonly reported perceived causes of challenging behaviors were typical child development and parenting problems. The primary reported strategy for addressing challenging behaviors was connecting with the child, with relatively few providers reporting using other evidence-based strategies. Finally, the most commonly reported reasons for considering suspension or expulsion were the providers feeling they had exhausted options and could not meet the child's needs, and the child's behavior being perceived as dangerous to self or others. Implications for future research and practice (including increased support services for childcare providers) are discussed. La investigación previa ha subrayado una necesidad de comprender las experiencias y los procesos de toma de decisiones que contribuyen a la suspensión y expulsión en centros de tempranos cuidados y educación, particularmente entre niños pequeños de color. El presente estudio llevó a cabo entrevistas cualitativas con 20 proveedores de cuidado infantil con base en el centro y en la familia, del estudio Tempranos Cuidados y Educación en Minnesota (MECE). A los participantes se les preguntó acerca de los retos enfrentados en cuanto al comportamiento de los niños, sus percepciones de estos comportamientos y cómo los manejaron, así como los procesos de pensamiento sobre la suspensión y expulsión. En términos generales, las categorías más frecuentemente reportadas de comportamientos desafiantes fueron la agresión física y la desobediencia/desafío/discusión. Las más comúnmente reportadas causas percibidas de comportamientos desafiantes fueron el típico desarrollo del niño y problemas de crianza. La estrategia primariamente reportada para hablar de y dirigir los comportamientos desafiantes fue la conexión con el niño, con relativamente pocos proveedores que reportaron el uso de otra estrategia con base en la evidencia. Finalmente, las razones más comúnmente reportadas en cuanto a considerar la suspensión o la expulsión fueron el instinto del proveedor de haber agotado las opciones y el no haber podido satisfacer las necesidades del niño, así como la percepción de que el comportamiento del niño era peligroso para el propio niño y otros. Se discuten las implicaciones para la futura investigación (incluyendo el aumento de servicios de apoyo para proveedores del cuidado infantil). Les recherches précédentes ont souligné un besoin de comprendre les expériences et les processus décisionnels qui contribuent à la suspension et à l'expulsion dans les contextes de la crèche ou de l’éducation, particulièrement chez les jeunes enfants racialisés / de couleur. Cette étude a procédé à des entretiens qualitatifs avec 20 prestataires de service de garde d'enfants (centres ou crèches et prestataires à domicile) de l’étude des Soins Précoces et de l'Education (abrégé MECE) dans l’état du Minnesota aux Etats-Unis. Les participants ont répondu à des questions sur les comportements difficiles de l'enfant auxquels ils ont fait face, leurs perceptions de ces comportements et la manière dont ils les ont gérés, et leurs processus de réflexion au sujet de la suspension et de l'expulsion. Dans l'ensemble les catégories les plus fréquemment rapportées de comportements difficiles étaient l'agression physique et le non-respect, la défiance et la dispute. Les causes perçues de comportements difficiles les plus fréquemment rapportées étaient les problèmes typiques de comportement de l'enfant et de parentage. La stratégie la plus rapportée pour faire face aux comportements difficiles était de communiquer avec l'enfant, avec relativement peu de prestataires utilisant d'autres stratégies fondées sur des données probantes. Enfant, les raisons les plus communément rapportées quant à la considération de la suspension ou de l'expulsion étaient que les prestataires sentaient qu'ils avaient épuisé les options et ne pouvaient pas répondre aux besoins de l'enfant et que le comportement de l'enfant était perçu comme dangereux pour lui / elle ou les autres. Les implications pour les recherches et la pratique futures (y compris l'augmentation de services de soutien pour les prestataires de garde d'enfant) sont discutées. Die Sicht von Kinderbetreuungseinrichtungen auf problematisches Verhalten von Kindern, Suspendierung und Ausschluss: Eine qualitative Analyse Frühere Forschungsarbeiten haben die Notwendigkeit betont, die Erfahrungen und Entscheidungsprozesse zu verstehen, die zur Suspendierung und zum Ausschluss von Kindern aus der Frühbetreuung/ -erziehung beitragen, insbesondere bei Kleinkindern of Color. In der vorliegenden Studie wurden mit 20 Anbietern von Kinderbetreuungseinrichtungen und Familienbetreuungseinrichtungen aus der Minnesota Early Care and Education (MECE) Studie qualitative Interviews durchgeführt. Die Teilnehmenden wurden zu herausfordernden Verhaltensweisen von Kindern befragt, mit denen sie konfrontiert wurden, zu ihrer Wahrnehmung dieser Verhaltensweisen, zu ihrer Art, damit umzugehen, und zu ihren Denkprozessen bezüglich Suspendierung und Ausschluss. Insgesamt waren die am häufigsten genannten Kategorien herausfordernder Verhaltensweisen körperliche Aggression und Ungehorsam/Trotz/Streit. Die am häufigsten genannten Ursachen für herausforderndes Verhalten waren typische kindliche Entwicklungsprozesse und Erziehungsprobleme bei den Eltern. Die am häufigsten genannte Strategie zur Bewältigung schwieriger Verhaltensweisen war die Kontaktaufnahme mit dem Kind. Nur relativ wenige Anbieter gaben an, andere evidenzbasierte Strategien zu verwenden. Die am häufigsten genannten Gründe für eine Suspendierung oder einen Ausschluss waren schließlich, wenn die Anbieter das Gefühl hatten, alle Möglichkeiten ausgeschöpft zu haben und den Bedürfnissen des Kindes nicht gerecht werden zu können. Ein weiterer häufig genannter Grund war, wenn das Verhalten des Kindes als selbst- oder fremdgefährdend eingeschätzt wurde. Implikationen für zukünftige Forschung und Praxis (einschließlich verstärkter Unterstützungsangebote für Anbieter von Kinderbetreuungseinrichtungen) werden diskutiert. 子どもの挑戦的行動と停学、退学に関する保育者の見解:定性的分析 これまでの研究で、特に有色人種の幼児において、早期ケアや教育の現場における停学や退学の原因となる経験や意思決定過程を理解する必要性が強調されてきた。本研究では、ミネソタ州早期ケアと教育 (MECE) 研究における施設保育者および在宅保育者20名に対して定性的面接を行った。参加者は、これまでに遭遇した子どもの挑発的行動、これらの行動に対する認知、どのように対処したか、そして停学や退学に関連する思考過程について質問された。全体として、最も頻繁に報告された挑戦的行動の領域は、身体的な攻撃性と不従順/反抗的/論争的であった。挑戦的行動の原因として最もよく報告されたのは、典型的な子どもの発達と子育ての問題であった。挑戦的行動に対処するための主な戦略は、子どもと関係をつくることであり、他のエビデンスに基づいた戦略を用いることを報告した保育者は比較的少数であった。最後に、停学や退学を検討する理由として最も多く報告されたのは、選択肢を使い果たし、子どものニーズに応えられないと保育者が感じたこと、子どもの行動が自分や他人にとって危険であると認識されたことであった。今後の研究と実践への示唆 (保育者への支援サービスの充実など) を述べる。. 前的研究强调, 在早期护理和教育机构中, 需要了解导致停学和开除 (特别是在有色人种的幼儿中) 的经验与决策过程。本研究对来自“明尼苏达州早期护理和教育”(MECE) 研究项目的20个中心托儿和家庭托儿服务提供者进行了定性访谈。参与者被问及他们遇到的具有挑战性的儿童行为, 他们对这些行为的看法, 他们如何管理这些行为, 以及他们围绕停学和开除的思维过程。总体而言, 最常报告的挑战性行为类别是身体攻击, 以及不服从、反抗或争吵。最常报告的导致挑战性行为的原因是典型的儿童发育和养育问题。报告的应对挑战性行为的主要策略是与儿童沟通, 而使用其他循证策略的提供者相对较少。最后, 最常报告的考虑停学或开除的原因是, 提供者觉得他们已经穷尽了选择而无法满足儿童的需求, 以及儿童的行为被认为对自己或他人有危险。还讨论了对未来研究和实践的影响 (包括增加对托儿服务提供者的支持服务) 。. آراء مقدمي رعاية الأطفال حول السلوكيات الصعبة للأطفال وحالات التعليق والطرد: تحليل وصفي أكدت الأبحاث السابقة على الحاجة إلى فهم الخبرات وعمليات صنع القرار التي تساهم في التعليق والطرد في أماكن الرعاية والتعليم المبكرة ، لا سيما بين الأطفال الصغار الملونين. أجرت الدراسة الحالية مقابلات نوعية مع 20 من مقدمي الرعاية من مراكز الرعاية وعلى مستوى العائلات باستخدام بيانات من دراسة مينيسوتا للرعاية المبكرة والتعليم (MECE). وسُئل المشاركون عن السلوكيات الصعبة التي واجهوها مع الأطفال ، وتصوراتهم عن هذه السلوكيات وكيفية إدارتها ، وعمليات تفكيرهم حول التعليق والطرد. بشكل عام ، كانت أنواع السلوكيات الصعبة الأكثر شيوعاً هي العدوان الجسدي وعدم الامتثال / التحدي / الجدال. وكانت الأسباب المتصورة الأكثر شيوعًا للسلوكيات الصعبة هي مشكلات نمو الطفل والتربية الوالدية. كانت الإستراتيجية الأولية التي تم الإبلاغ عنها لمعالجة السلوكيات الصعبة هي التواصل مع الطفل ، مع عدد قليل نسبيًا من مقدمي الخدمة الذين أبلغوا عن استخدام استراتيجيات أخرى قائمة على الأدلة. أخيرًا ، كانت الأسباب الأكثر شيوعًا للنظر في التعليق أو الطرد هي شعور مقدمي الخدمة بأنهم استنفدوا خياراتهم ولا يمكنهم تلبية احتياجات الطفل ، وأن سلوك الطفل يُنظر إليه على أنه خطر على نفسه أو على الآخرين. تم مناقشة التطبيقات العملية على البحث والممارسة في المستقبل (بما في ذلك زيادة خدمات الدعم لمقدمي رعاية الأطفال).

2,36678693,"The scarcity of age-appropriate pharmaceutical formulations is one of the major challenges impeding successful management of tuberculosis (TB) prevalence in minors. To this end, we designed and assessed the quality of a multiparticulate reconstitutable suspension powder containing fixed dose rifampicin and pyrazinamide (150 mg/300 mg per 5 mL) which was prepared employing solid−liquid direct dispersion coupled with timed dehydration, and mechanical pulverization. The optimized formulation had a high production yield (96.000 ± 3.270%), displayed noteworthy powder flow quality (9.670 ± 1.150°), upon reconstitution the suspension flow property was non-Newtonian and was easily redispersible with gentle manual agitation (1.720 ± 0.011 strokes/second). Effective drug loading was attained for both pyrazinamide (97.230 ± 2.570%w/w) and rifampicin (97.610 ± 0.020%w/w) and drug release followed a zero-order kinetic model (R2 = 0.990) for both drugs. Microscopic examinations confirmed drug encapsulation efficiency and showed that the particulates were micro-dimensional in nature (n < 700.000 µm). The formulation was physicochemically stable with no chemically irreversible drug-excipient interactions based on the results of characterization experiments performed. Findings from organoleptic evaluations generated an overall rating of 4.000 ± 0.000 for its attractive appearance and colour 5.000 ± 0.000 confirming its excellent taste and extremely pleasant smell. Preliminary cytotoxicity studies showed a cell viability above 70.000% which indicates that the FDC formulation was biocompatible. The optimized formulation was environmentally stable either as a dry powder or reconstituted suspension. Accordingly, a stable and palatable FDC antimycobacterial reconstitutable oral suspension powder, intended for flexible dosing in children and adolescents, was optimally fabricated. "
3,31611144,"Taste is a crucial factor that determines the palatability of the oral dosage form and patient compliance. The aim of this work was to evaluate the organoleptic excipients in oral antibiotics for pediatric use marketed in Brazil. The information was obtained from the GuidetoPharmacy, a reference for the pharmaceutical trade. The analysis included dosage forms for oral administration and drugs and their combination with antibacterial action. After this survey, we identified the constitution of the flavoring, sweetening, and coloring agents of each medicine. The results are presented in a descriptive form. Twelve drugs or associations are distributed in 70medicines. Oral suspension was the most common pharmaceutical dosage form. Sweeteners were sucrose, sodium saccharin, and sodium cyclamate. All the coloring agents observed are synthetic and the most frequent ones were yellow twilight no. 6, yellow tartrazine no. 5, and red ponceau 4R. The presence of two or more types of flavorings per medicine was observed. Antibacterials use coloring agents, flavorings, and sweeteners to facilitate the administration of medicines for children, using up to six different substances per formulation. No natural coloring agent was observed, demonstrating an issue to be explored in the future. It is important to note that, although necessary, these excipients are responsible for a high incidence of allergic reactions in children. "
4,35397909,"Featured with high multiplexibility, suspension microarray technology usually involves the conjugation of second-antibody with organic dye based fluorescent proteins, which are inherently unsuitable for multicolor signaling under single wavelength excitation. In addition, application of single QDs-based fluorescent reporter in suspension microarray is dramatically hampered since its preparation often suffers from poor reproducibility and stability. Herein, a novel suspension microarray system based on dual color quantum dots (QDs) nanobead as fluorescence label was developed for simultaneous detection of prostate specific antigen (PSA) biomarkers. When both antigens are present in sera sample, free (f)-PSA antibody-conjugated green and complexed (c)-PSA antibody-conjugated red QDs nanobeads would be both specifically absorbed onto the surface of total PSA antibody-conjugated magnetic beads, leading to the formation of magnetic fluorescent hybrid that can be purified from the mixture by an external magnet prior to flow cytometry analysis. The proposed method demonstrates simultaneous detection ability for f- and c- PSA antigen assay with high detection sensitivity that is comparable to clinical approaches including ELISA and chemiluminescence assay. Furthermore, result of clinical application of the proposed method is consistency with clinical data, demonstrating its potential in suspension microarray for accurate prostate cancer diagnosis. "
5,14752570,"Intussusception represents the most common abdominal emergency in infancy. The classical clinical triad, consisting of abdominal colics, red jelly stools and a palpable mass, is only present in approximately 50% of cases, 20% of patients are symptom free at clinical presentation. Primary imaging modality of choice is ultrasound scanning, which enables the diagnosis or exclusion of an intussusception at a sensitivity of 98-100%, specificity of 88% and a negative predictive value of 100%. In emergency cases, additional plain films are necessary to detect potential intestinal perforation, to identify intestinal obstruction or other diseases mimicking the clinical presentation. Once the diagnosis of an intussusception is established, non-surgical reduction (NSR) is used. A surgical approach is chosen in patients with signs of perforation, shock or peritonitis. Depending on the choice of guiding imaging technique, different contrast media are used for NSR. Barium suspension or air with fluoroscopic guidance, or saline only or mixed with water-soluble contrast under sonographic guidance, has to be used. Regardless of the used contrast medium, NSR is an effective technique, being successfully employed in more than 90% of cases. "
6,29387874,"Epidermal cell suspension (ECS) and follicular cell suspension (FCS) are successful surgical modalities for the treatment of stable vitiligo. However, repigmentation in generalized and acrofacial vitiligo and over acral or bony sites (eg, elbows, knees, iliac crests, and malleoli), which are difficult to treat, is challenging. To study the efficacy of transplanting a combination of autologous, noncultured ECS and FCS (ECS + FCS) compared with ECS alone in stable vitiligo. A prospective, observer-blinded, active-controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted at a tertiary care hospital, with treatment administered as an outpatient procedure. Thirty participants who had stable vitiligo with symmetrical lesions were recruited between October 18, 2013, and October 28, 2016. All of the lesions were resistant to medical modalities with minimum lesional stability of 1 year. Intent-to-treat analysis was used. ECS + FCS was prepared by mixing equal amounts (in cell number) of FCS with ECS. After manual dermabrasion, ECS was applied to 1 lesion and ECS + FCS was applied to the anatomically based paired lesion of the same patient. No adjuvant treatment was given. Patients were followed up at 4, 8, and 16 weeks by a blinded observer and extent of repigmentation, color match, pattern of repigmentation, patient satisfaction and complications were noted. Both the visual and the computerized image analysis methods were used for outcome assessment. Cell suspensions were assessed post hoc for OCT4+ stem cell counts using flow cytometry; expression of stem cell factor and basic fibroblast growth factor was evaluated using quantitative relative messenger RNA expression. Of the 30 patients included in the study, 18 (60%) were women; mean (SD) age was 23.4 (6.4) years. Seventy-four percent of the lesions (62 of 84) were difficult-to-treat vitiligo. ECS + FCS showed superior repigmentation outcomes compared with ECS: extent (76% vs 57%, P < .001), rapidity (48% vs 31%, P = .001), color match (73% vs 61%, P < .001), and patient satisfaction (mean [SD] patient global assessment score, 23.30 [6.89] vs 20.81 [6.61], P = .047). Melanocyte stem cell counts (2% in ECS + FCS vs 0.5% in ECS) as well as expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (11.8-fold) and stem cell factor (6.0-fold) were higher in ECS + FCS suspension (P<.05 for both). The findings from this study establish ECS + FCS as a novel approach in vitiligo surgery for attaining good to excellent repigmentation in a short period with good color match, even in difficult-to-treat vitiligo. ctri.nic.in Identifier: CTRI/2017/05/008692.

7,33435555,"Extemporaneous oral liquid preparations are commonly used when there is no commercially available dosage form for adjustable dosing. In most cases, there is a lack of stability data to allow for an accurately assigned shelf life and storage conditions to give greater confidence of product safety and efficacy over its shelf life. The aim of this study was to evaluate the physical, chemical and microbiological stability of an extemporaneous oral liquid suspension of losartan potassium, 5 mg/mL, used to treat paediatric hypertension in Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin, Ireland. The losartan content of extemporaneous oral suspensions, prepared with and without addition of water, was measured by UV and confirmed by HPLC analysis.

8,21507039,"Surgery is a well-established treatment for stable vitiligo in adults. However, there are few studies to date reporting the use of surgery in children and adolescents. To assess the efficacy and safety of transplantation of autologous noncultured epidermal suspension for the treatment of stable vitiligo in children and adolescents. Noncultured epidermal suspension transplantation was performed in 13 children and adolescents (age 8-17 years), with a total of 19 lesions of stable vitiligo. Patients were followed up for at least 1 year. Results were assessed for degree of repigmentation, colour match compared with normal skin, and adverse events. Of the 19 lesions, 15 (79%) had > 90% repigmentation at the end of 1 year, and the remaining 4 lesions (21%) had 75-90% repigmentation. Results were not influenced by age, gender, site or size of lesions, type of vitiligo, or duration of stability of disease, although the small sample size makes conclusions tentative. The colour match at the final visit was excellent for 16 of the 19 lesions (84.2%). No major adverse effects were seen except for infection at the recipient site in one patient. Transplantation of noncultured epidermal suspension is a safe and effective treatment for stable vitiligo in childhood. Considering its good efficacy and safety as a day-care procedure under local anaesthesia, it may be considered one of the treatments of choice for stable vitiligo in children and adolescents, especially for cases resistant to other therapies.

9,31496971,"Research from education, psychology, and human development indicates that social and emotional skills are essential to success in school, work, and life, and that high-quality social and emotional learning (SEL) programs can benefit students' mental health, academic achievement, and behavioral outcomes. While many schools are adopting an SEL approach, there remains a concerning gap between SEL research and policies and practices related to discipline and behavior management. Following the No Child Left Behind Act and education reform driven by a culture of high-stakes standardized testing and accountability benchmarks, there has been an increase in elementary schools adopting a ""no excuses"" model of education. This model is characterized by extended time in school, highly structured in-service teacher training, frequent assessments, and ""zero tolerance"" policies to strictly manage and control children's behavior. These behavior policies are problematic as they run counter to what research tells us about children's social and emotional development. Reactive and exclusionary discipline policies inhibit children's abilities to build and practice self-regulation skills and jeopardize the relationships between students and teachers. The developmental science perspective on children's regulatory skills suggests that the early years of school are a central context for developing and practicing self-regulation with the support of educators and peers. Research also indicates that warm, caring, reciprocal relationships based on trust are critical to learning and development. Yet, this research base is often overshadowed by pressures to improve standardized achievement scores or misinterpreted in the form of hyper-vigilance about children's behavior in the classroom. Finally, the ""no excuses"" approach to behavior management is used disproportionally in schools serving low-income students of color and thus may contribute to unequal rates of suspensions and expulsions, both of which are linked to negative developmental outcomes later in life. This is particularly true for students who have experienced trauma, in part because the act of social exclusion is often re-traumatizing. This article summarizes research on self-regulation, trauma, and developmental relationships, highlights potential consequences of ""no excuses"" policies and practices in schools, and presents an alternative view of learning environments which promote effective self-regulation skills in young children.

10,31464451,"Disproportionate rates of suspension and expulsion, evident from early childhood, for students of color relative to White peers are a significant racial equity issue in the U.S. education system, with far-reaching effects. In this article, we present a logic model for educator-level interventions that have the potential to reduce disparate discipline practices and ultimately work toward a more equitable school climate. We describe how an integrated approach to supporting all children's constitutional right to a free public education, which is prevented by exclusionary discipline practices, must purposefully integrate social and emotional learning, classroom management, cultural competence, and racial equity approaches that target educators. Together, the integration of these approaches has the potential to impact initial, intermediate, and long-term education outcomes by enhancing educators' practices and raising awareness of their internal and interpersonal biases and role in perpetuating institutional racism in education. We conclude with recommendations for how this logic model can be used to guide future research to further our knowledge in this area to support educators in their practice and inform educational policy.

Commercially available minoxidil tablets (10 mg) were crushed to a fine powder, and predetermined amounts of 2 suspending vehicles were added to produce a 1-mg/mL suspension, which was stored in glass bottles at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C) or in a refrigerator (4 ± 2 °C). To simulate daily patient use, 5 days weekly 1 bottle of the suspension was removed from refrigerated storage and shaken and 0.5 mL of the contents discarded. At each specified time point, samples were analyzed in duplicate ( The mean percentage of initial minoxidil concentration remaining in all refrigerated samples exceeded 90% throughout the 24-week study, with no change in appearance, pH, microbial activity, odor, or redispersibility. During storage at room temperature, the suspension exhibited a color change at week 4, with slight sedimentation after 6 weeks, although minoxidil recovery exceeded 90% for 10 weeks. An extemporaneously compounded minoxidil oral suspension was stable for 24 weeks when stored in a refrigerator. This suspension can be used for up to 3 weeks when stored at room temperature. "
13,30021187,"The stability of extemporaneously prepared sodium benzoate oral suspension in cherry syrup and Ora-Sweet was studied. Oral solutions of 250-mg/mL sodium benzoate were prepared in either cherry syrup or Ora-Sweet. To a beaker, 50 grams of Sodium Benzoate Powder USP was dissolved and filtered, the solution was divided equally into two parts, and each aliquot was added into two separate calibrated 100-mL amber vials. In the first vial, cherry syrup was added to make a final volume of 100 mL. In the second vial, Ora-Sweet was added to give a final volume of 100 mL. This process was repeated to prepare three solutions of each kind and all were stored at room temperature. A 250-µL sample was withdrawn immediately after preparation and again at 7, 14, 28, 60, and 90 days for each sample. At each time point, further dilution was made to an expected concentration of 0.25 mg/mL with sample diluent, and the samples were assayed in triplicate by stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography. Stability was defined as the retention of at least 90% of the initial concentration. At least 92% of the initial concentration of sodium benzoate in cherry syrup and at least 96% of the sodium benzoate in Ora-Sweet remained throughout the 90-day study period. There were no detectable changes in color and no visible microbial growth in any sample.

Using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, expression of DRC-1, Ki-M4, HLA-DR, CR1, C1q antigens, a macrophage marker, and surface IgG and IgM were found on isolated FDC and on FDC in situ. None of these reagents proved to be specific for FDC, e.g. the FDC-directed antibodies DRC-1 and Ki-M4 labelled B lymphocytes in cytofluorography. Enzyme cytochemical staining revealed activities of non-specific esterase, acid alpha-naphthylacetate esterase and ATPase in germinal centres and in freshly isolated FDC.

17,22897617,"Vitiligo is an acquired disorder of pigmentation due to loss of epidermal melanocytes. Autologous noncultured epidermal cell suspension (NCES; a cellular grafting technique) and suction blister epidermal grafting (SBEG; a tissue grafting technique) are important established surgical modalities for the treatment of stable vitiligo. To compare the two techniques, NCES and SBEG, for producing repigmentation in patients with stable vitiligo. We randomized 41 patients with 54 stable vitiligo lesions into two groups. Patients in group 1 were treated with NCES, and those in group 2 with SBEG. They were evaluated 16 weeks postsurgery for the extent of repigmentation, colour match, change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score and patient satisfaction. The extent of repigmentation was excellent (showing 90-100% repigmentation) in 71% of lesions in the NCES group and 27% of lesions in the SBEG group (P = 0·002). Repigmentation ≥ 75% (good repigmentation) was observed in 89% of lesions in the NCES group and 85% of lesions in the SBEG group (P = 0·61). There was a significant decline in DLQI score in both the groups; the mean decline among groups differed significantly (P = 0·045). No significant difference was seen in colour match and pattern of repigmentation. Adverse effects were minimal. NCES is significantly better than SBEG and should be the preferred treatment for patients with stable vitiligo. To best of our knowledge, this is the first study directly comparing these two techniques. "
18,24688040,"The stability of clonidine suspensions stored at room temperature and under refrigeration for three months was evaluated. Oral suspensions of clonidine 0.01 mg/mL were prepared in Ora-Blend and stored in clear plastic syringes at 25 °C and 4 °C. Samples were collected from each syringe at the time of preparation, at weekly intervals for up to 28 days, and on days 42, 56, 77, and 91. Changes in color, taste, and pH, as well as visual evidence of precipitation, were used to determine physical compatibility. Immediately after the physical observations were made, 1.5-mL samples from each syringe were transferred to polypropylene freezer vials and stored at -85 °C until high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis. The samples were analyzed by a validated stability-indicating HPLC-ultraviolet-light detection method. Stability was defined as the retention of at least 90% of the initial clonidine concentration. The precision of the assay was evaluated by intraday and interday validation methods. Clonidine suspensions stored at 25 °C and 4 °C maintained 99.2% and 99.0% of the initial concentration for 91 days, respectively. No interfering peaks were generated by forced degradation of clonidine with heat, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, or hydrogen peroxide There were no notable changes in pH, and all samples remained physically unchanged during the study period.

21,37007014,"Major depressive disorder is one of the most common neuropsychiatric diseases and it is a global public health problem that leads to disabilities. Currently, there is a growing need to explore novel strategy to cure major depressive disorder due to the limitation of available treatments. Rannasangpei (RSNP) is a traditional Tibetan medicine which acts as a therapeutic agent in various acute or chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. Crocin-1 a coloring ingredient of saffron which exhibited anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Here, we aimed to illustrate whether RSNP and its active ingredient crocin-1 rescue depressive-like phenotypes in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) induced mouse model of depression. Our results showed that peripheral administration of RSNP or crocin-1 ameliorated the depressive-like behaviors in CUMS-treated mice, as demonstrated by the forced swimming test and tail suspension test. Furthermore, RSNP or crocin-1 treatment reduced oxidative stress in the peripheral blood and hippocampus of the CUMS-treated mice. Additionally, the dysregulated immune system response, as demonstrated by the increased expression of the pro-inflammatory factors (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6) and the decreased expression of the anti-inflammatory factor-interleukin-10 in the prefrontal cortex and/or hippocampus of CUMS-treated mice, were at least partially restored by RSNP or crocin-1 treatment. RSNP or crocin-1 also restored apoptotic protein marker (Bcl-2 and Bax) levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of the CUMS-treated mice. Moreover, our data indicated that RSNP or crocin-1 increased astrocyte number and brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in the hippocampus of CUMS-treated mice after RSNP or crocin-1 administration. Taken together, our study for the first time revealed an anti-depressant effect of RSNP and its active ingredient crocin-1 in a mouse model of depression, with involvement of oxidative stress, inflammatory response and apoptotic pathway.

24,24231050,"Personalized medicine is a challenging research area in paediatric treatments. Elaborating new paediatric formulations when no commercial forms are available is a common practice in pharmacy laboratories; among these, oral liquid formulations are the most common. But due to the lack of specialized equipment, frequently studies to assure the efficiency and safety of the final medicine cannot be carried out. Thus the purpose of this work was the development, characterization and stability evaluation of two oral formulations of sildenafil for the treatment of neonatal persistent pulmonary hypertension. After the establishment of a standard operating procedure (SOP) and elaboration, the physicochemical stability parameters appearance, pH, particle size, rheological behaviour and drug content of formulations were evaluated at three different temperatures for 90 days. Equally, prediction of long term stability, as well as, microbiological stability was performed. Formulations resulted in a suspension and a solution slightly coloured exhibiting fruity odour. Formulation I (suspension) exhibited the best physicochemical properties including Newtonian behaviour and uniformity of API content above 90% to assure an exact dosification process. "

26,20850141,"Acceptable coaptation cannot always be obtained using standard repair techniques. We assessed the safety and mid-term results using a novel technique to address leaflet retraction or tethering in children with type III mitral or tricuspid regurgitation as an addition to standard valve repair techniques. Forty children were included, 36 for the mitral valve and 4 for the tricuspid valve, with a mean age of 11.3 ± 3.9 years. A polypropylene suture was placed on the free edge of the retracted or tethered leaflet segment and anchored to the atrial side of the opposite annulus. This avoided valve replacement in all patients. An additional 40 children were matched for age, etiology, leaflet retraction or tethering, and surgery in which the suspension stitch was not used and constituted the control group. The mean aortic crossclamp and cardiopulmonary bypass time was 36 ± 9 and 57 ± 9 minutes, respectively. No early or late deaths occurred. At discharge, no patient had more than mild regurgitation with a gradient of 4.4 ± 2.4 mm Hg in the mitral position and 2 ± 1.75 mm Hg in the tricuspid position. The results were not significantly different than those of the control group. During a follow-up of 37.7 ± 18.4 months, 3 patients required reoperation for mitral valve replacement in the suspension stitch group and 2 within the control group. At echocardiography of the remaining patients, the repair remained stable, with no suspension suture breakage. This suspension technique improved coaptation and resulted in avoidance or delay of valve replacement in patients with type III regurgitation, with an acceptable transvalvular gradient in most patients that did not significantly increase with growth.

29,27222300,"This study examines racial differences in students' connectedness to school adults and considers the possibility that disparities in exclusionary discipline practices may reduce all students' sense of connection to educators, not just those who have been disciplined or are from racial groups overrepresented in out-of-school suspensions. Data sources include a self-report survey of secondary school students (n = 29,148) linked to administrative data (n = 107 schools) from a large urban district. Multilevel modeling techniques were used to estimate the relationships between students' racial background, youths' connection to school adults, and school-level racial discipline gaps. Controlling for school racial composition, gender, grade level and other covariates, students of color were significantly less likely to feel connected to school adults than their White peers. Additionally, the racial discipline gap was significantly and negatively associated with connectedness for all students. Results indicate that strategies to improve educational outcomes for youth of color need to attend to relational dynamics between students and school adults. Research findings also suggest that efforts to reduce discipline disparities may improve all students' connectedness. "

31,22777228,"Tinea capitis periodically undergoes demographic shifts in causative dermatophyte and therapeutic response to oral anti-fungal therapy. To determine prevalent fungal species and response to standard antifungal therapy in inner-city children of color. An IRB-approved chart review of demographic, clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic data was conducted for children and young adults (0 to 18 years of age) who had scalp fungal culture performed for scalp hyperkeratosis and/or alopecia over a 2.5 year time-period. Supplemental parental phone interview was performed for missing data points. A total of 84 patients with final diagnosis of tinea capitis were identified-52% male, 60.6% African-American, 28.2% Hispanic, and 9.9% Caucasian. Complete resolution at 4 weeks was uncommon in all demographic groups (Hispanic: 11.7%, African-American: 41.3%). The Hispanic group and the youngest patients (aged less than 4 years) were less likely to respond to initial therapy, but the results were not significant. Of the 80 tinea capitis patients initially treated with griseofulvin, 41 out of 54 children (76%) had complete response to micronized suspension +/- crushed tablet (33% required shift to tablets from suspension) and 20 out of 26 (76.9%) cleared on crushed tablets alone. Of the 19 griseofulvin failures, 5 cleared on fluconazole suspension, 7 on terbinafine sprinkles, 3 on itraconazole therapy, and 4 were lost to follow-up. Of the 47 patients who could be evaluated long-term after a single course of oral griseofulvin at 6 weeks or greater, 38 had documented long-term mycological cure (80.8%) and 42 had long-term clinical cure (89%). Trichophyton tonsurans (n=40) was the most prevalent causative species identified on culture, followed by Alternaria species (n=10) and Microsporum canis (n=1). Retrospective chart review: patient population has a high rate of usage of over-the-counter antifungal creams and shampoos, affecting culture results. Tinea capitis is still the most common cause of Trichophyton tonsurans in New York City. Response rates to griseofulvin are similar to rates seen in the 1970s, but require higher dosing and conversion to crushed tablets in partial responders. Usage of crushed ultramicronized griseofulvin, terbinafine sprinkles, itraconazole, and fluconazole are alternative regimens for those children whose tinea capitis does not clear on griseofulvin suspension.

32,27703352,"The aim of the present study was to develop nanoprobes with theranostic features, including - at the same time - photoacoustic, near-infrared (NIR) optical imaging, and photothermal properties, in a versatile and stable core-shell silica-polyethylene glycol (PEG) nanoparticle architecture. We synthesized core-shell silica-PEG nanoparticles by a one-pot direct micelles approach. Fluorescence emission and photoacoustic and photothermal properties were obtained at the same time by appropriate doping with triethoxysilane-derivatized cyanine 5.5 (Cy5.5) and cyanine 7 (Cy7) dyes. The performances of these nanoprobes were measured in vitro, using nanoparticle suspensions in phosphate-buffered saline and blood, dedicated phantoms, and after incubation with MDA-MB-231 cells. We obtained core-shell silica-PEG nanoparticles endowed with very high colloidal stability in water and in biological environment, with absorption and fluorescence emission in the NIR field. The presence of Cy5.5 and Cy7 dyes made it possible to reach a more reproducible and higher doping regime, producing fluorescence emission at a single excitation wavelength in two different channels, owing to the energy transfer processes within the nanoparticle. The nanoarchitecture and the presence of both Cy5.5 and Cy7 dyes provided a favorable agreement between fluorescence emission and quenching, to achieve optical imaging and photoacoustic and photothermal properties. We obtained rationally designed nanoparticles with outstanding stability in biological environment. At appropriate doping regimes, the presence of Cy5.5 and Cy7 dyes allowed us to tune fluorescence emission in the NIR for optical imaging and to exploit quenching processes for photoacoustic and photothermal capabilities. These nanostructures are promising in vivo theranostic tools for the near future. "
33,23989441,"The stability of clonazepam as an extemporaneous suspension compounded from tablets was studied. The clonazepam suspension (0.1 mg/mL) was prepared by incorporating pulverized 0.5-mg clonazepam tablets into the suspending Hospital for Sick children (HSC) Vehicle containing simple syrup and methylcellulose. This vehicle is also prepared extemporaneously. A clonazepam suspension and a clonazepam solution, both prepared in HSC Vehicle, were analyzed at various times during the 60-day study period against a clonazepam standard acetonitrile solutions stored in glass. These preparations using HSC Vehicle were stored at 4*C in a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) amber-colored plastic bottle. At various times during the 60 day study period, three samples from each bottle were removed and the concentration of clonazepam determined by a high-performance liquid chromatography assay procedure. This stability study demonstrates that storage of clonazepam suspension is safe for at least 60 days in a PVC bottle at 4*C, while the HSC solution rapidly loses the active ingredient by adsorption onto the plastic matrix due to the immediate availability towards the PVC.

34,25784402,"To develop an extemporaneous 1% benznidazole (BNZ) suspension, with masked taste and adequate stability starting from available commercial tablets. The quality of compounding was evaluated through content uniformity measurement and physical and microbiological stability evaluation, under different storage conditions during 90 days. Six batches of 1% BNZ suspension were prepared using safe excipients currently available in a galenic area of Hospital Pharmacy and then stored at 5 and 25 °C for 90 days. The BNZ content was determined by UV spectrophotometry. Physical stability was defined as the absence of colour, odour and/or flavour changes and the re-suspension of solid phase by a reasonable amount of simple 15-s shaking. The compliance with microbiological attributes of non-sterile pharmaceutical products was also evaluated. An oral liquid suspension, containing 1% of BNZ, was developed from commercially available BNZ tablets. The formulations stored for 90 days were easily re-dispersed after a simple 15-s shaking, ensuring the pouring of a liquid volume containing the desired dose of BNZ. All samples were within the acceptable range of BNZ concentration with minimal standard deviations. There were no detectable changes in colour, odour, viscosity, pH and microbial growth, complying with official quality requirements. The quality attributes were not affected by storage, room or refrigeration conditions or by the frequent opening or closing of the multidose containers. Paediatric oral liquid suspension containing 1.0% of BNZ was easily prepared starting from commercial tablets, being an interesting alternative for optimising the paediatric treatment of Chagas disease.

Furthermore, children have difficulty swallowing tablets. This study aimed to determine the stability of an oral propafenone suspension made from commercial tablets with a syrup vehicle and to establish its reliable use with children. An extemporaneous suspension of propafenone 1.5 mg/ml was prepared with commercial tablets. Its physicochemical and microbiologic stability was established by constant monitoring during 90 days at room temperature (15 +/- 5 degrees C) and at refrigeration (3-5 degrees C). Plasma levels of propafenona were measured in two children with supraventricular tachycardia at steady state. The suspension was stable, maintaining its original physicochemical and microbiologic properties. Moreover, no apparent changes in color or odor were observed. Plasma levels of propafenone in patients demonstrated therapeutic concentrations after they had taken the suspension, with no unwanted outcome. The conservation of both physicochemical and microbiologic stability of the suspension represents an option for the administration of propafenone to children. "
37,8878244,"Azithromycin, the prototypical azalide antibiotic, has a wide spectrum of activity that is characterized by resistance to beta-lactamase-producing microbes and efficacy against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae. Tissue-directed pharmacokinetics include tissue concentrations up to 100-fold higher than those in plasma and a tissue half-life of up to 4 days. Pharmacokinetics of azithromycin permits a reduction in dosage frequency and duration while maintaining efficacy comparable to that of conventional 7- to 10-day three or four times daily regimens. Dosage interval, duration of treatment, side effects and palatability can affect compliance and thus clinical outcome. Compliance among children is important in light of the high incidence of community-acquired infections such as otitis media and streptococcal pharyngitis. To compare the flavor, taste acceptability and color preference of oral antibiotic suspensions given to children. The taste and acceptability of the oral suspension form of azithromycin vs. cefixime, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefprozil, clarithromycin or loracarbef were rated by children during blinded taste tests and with acceptability/ preference questionnaires. Analysis of the mean acceptability/ preference rating from 769 children demonstrated that the flavor of azithromycin was rated significantly higher than that of cefpodoxime (4.3 vs. 2.8), cefprozil (4.0 vs. 3.4) and clarithromycin (4.3 vs. 2.7) and was comparable to that of cefixime (4.0 vs. 4.2) and loracarbef (4.4 vs. 4.5). A greater percentage of children preferred the taste of azithromycin to that of cefpodoxime (90.0% vs. 5.2%), cefprozil (63.0% vs. 33.1%) and clarithromycin (89.0% vs. 11.0%). The taste of azithromycin was not preferred to that of cefixime (39.0% vs. 53.9%) or loracarbef (36% vs. 58.5%). The efficacy and safety of azithromycin in otitis media and streptococcal pharyngitis, the simple dosing regimen and a highly palatable oral suspension formulation should increase compliance among pediatric patients and thereby improve clinical outcomes.

At least 99% of the initial rifaximin remained throughout the 60-day study period in both preparations. There were no detectable changes in color, odor, taste, or pH and no visible microbial growth in any sample. Extemporaneously prepared suspensions of rifaximin 20 mg/mL in 1:1 mixtures of Ora-Plus with either Ora-Sweet or Ora-Sweet SF were stable for at least 60 days when stored in 2-oz amber plastic bottles at room temperature.

39,28268460,"Computer vision assisted diagnostic systems are gaining popularity in different healthcare applications. This paper presents a video analysis and pattern recognition framework for the automatic grading of vertical suspension tests on infants during the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE). The proposed vision-guided pipeline applies a color-based skin region segmentation procedure followed by the localization of body parts before feature extraction and classification. After constrained localization of lower body parts, a stick-diagram representation is used for extracting novel features that correspond to the motion dynamic characteristics of the infant's leg movements during HINE. This set of pose features generated from such a representation includes knee angles and distances between knees and hills. Finally, a time-series representation of the feature vector is used to train a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for classifying the grades of the HINE tests into three predefined categories. Experiments are carried out by testing the proposed framework on a large number of vertical suspension test videos recorded at a Neuro-development clinic. The automatic grading results obtained from the proposed method matches the scores of experts at an accuracy of 74%. "
40,22726558,"Hepatocyte transplantation is a promising alternative to liver transplantation in children with liver metabolic disorders and acute liver failure. Currently, it is difficult to assess rapidly hepatocyte function before transplantation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the uptake and release of indocyanine green (ICG) by hepatocytes could be used. Human hepatocytes (10(6) cells) isolated from unused donor livers were incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes with ICG (0-2mg/mL) in both cell suspension and on collagen-coated culture plates. Cells were then incubated in medium without ICG for 3 hours with supernatants collected at 1, 2 and 3 hours for measurement of ICG release. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion, (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity) and sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay (cell attachment). HepG2 cells were also used. ICG was taken up and secreted by hepatocytes with the release reaching a plateau level soon after 1 hour. Concentrations of ICG > 1.0mg/mL had toxic effects on hepatocytes. Hepatocytes incubated with 1.0mg/mL ICG had higher mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity compared to 0.5mg/mL ICG or control cells (0.025 ± 0.0004 OD unit vs. 0.019 ± 0.0008 OD unit or 0.020 ± 0.002 OD unit, p<0.05). Incubation of HepG2 cells with ICG reduced albumin production (98.9 ± 0.02 ng/mL, 66.6 ± 0.05 ng/mL and 39.1 ± 0.4 ng/mL for control cells, and 0.5mg/mL and 1.0mg/mL ICG, respectively), and decreased [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation in a dose-dependent manner. Addition of taurine (20mM) to plated hepatocytes gave greater release of ICG and hepatocyte attachment compared to controls, at all ICG concentrations (SRB 1.360 ± 0.083 optical density units vs. 0.908 ± 0.159 optical density units, p=0.011 at 1.0mg/mL). With further refinement, ICG could be used to develop a rapid assay for assessment of the function of isolated human hepatocytes. "

The assumption that bacteria in a wound correlate with infection is false; all wounds contain microorganisms, but not all wounds are clinically infected. This makes it difficult for clinicians to determine true wound infection, especially in wounds with pathogenic biofilms. If an infection is not properly treated, pathogenic virulence factors, such as rhamnolipids from  "
42,7847406,"The stability of isradipine in an extemporaneously compounded oral liquid was studied. A suspension was prepared from the powder of commercially available 5-mg isradipine capsules and sufficient Simple Syrup, NF, to make a final volume of 50 mL. A control suspension was prepared from analytical-grade isradipine powder and Simple Syrup, NF. The final concentration of isradipine in both suspensions was 1 mg/mL. Three identical volumes of each suspension were stored in 2-oz amber glass prescription bottles, which were stored at 4 degrees C. Immediately after preparation and at 7, 16, 22, 28, and 35 days, samples were visually inspected and assayed in duplicate by high-performance liquid chromatography; the pH of the samples was also determined. At least 95% of the initial isradipine concentration remained throughout the study period in all samples of both suspensions. Color, odor, and pH did not change appreciably. Isradipine 1 mg/mL in an oral liquid compounded from Simple Syrup, NF, and powder from capsules was stable for at least 35 days in amber glass bottles at 4 degrees C. "
43,36681238,"Link for Equity is a multi-tiered, school-based program of trauma-informed care and cultural humility designed to reduce the impact of Adverse Child Experiences among Black Indigenous and other children of color (BIPOC). This report describes the program, its trial design, and the study participants' baseline characteristics. We designed a nested waitlist-controlled trial to evaluate Link for Equity's effectiveness in reducing school violence among BIPOC students. Three pairs of school districts, matched on suspension rates and enrollment of Black/African American, Hispanic/Latinx, and American Indian/Alaska Native children, were randomized into either an intervention or delayed intervention (waitlist control) group. A community-engaged approach guided the development of protocols. Within intervention sites, BIPOC students who screened positive for ACEs or posttraumatic stress were also randomized into an immediate and waitlist control group to receive additional one-on-one support from trained school staff. The trial was implemented from 2019 to 2021, which overlapped with the pandemic and civil unrest in Minnesota. At baseline, 444 staff and 188 students enrolled in the study. Over a quarter of American Indian/Alaska Native students, 18% of multiple race, 12% of Black/African American, 14% of Hispanic/Latinx students reported 4+ ACEs. Between 44 and 53% of all the BIPOC students in the study were symptomatic for PTSD. Of the enrolled students, 78.7% qualified for one-on-one Link support. We implemented a multilevel waitlist-controlled trial of Link for Equity using community-engaged methods. Despite school closures during the pandemic, the study persisted with its methods now being employed in an expanded cohort of middle schools. ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04026477, NCT04026490). "
44,22479056,"Levetiracetam is widely used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures, myoclonic seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and idiopathic generalized epilepsy in the community and in hospital. However, no convenient, easy-to-swallow dosage form is commercially available in Canada. Moreover, no stability data are available for this antiepileptic prepared in a vehicle combining Ora-Sweet sweetener and Ora-Plus suspending agent. To evaluate the stability of levetiracetam suspensions in amber plastic bottles at room temperature and under refrigeration for up to 91 days. Suspensions of levetiracetam (50 mg/mL) were prepared in a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Sweet sweetening agent and Ora-Plus suspending agent. The suspensions were transferred to 50-mL amber plastic prescription bottles, which were stored at 25°C or at 4°C. Samples were collected from each bottle at time zero and on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, and 91. The samples were analyzed in triplicate by a validated, stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography method with ultraviolet detection. A suspension was considered stable if it maintained at least 90% of its initial concentration of levetiracetam. Colour, odour, taste, clarity, and pH were assessed to determine physical compatibility. All samples remained physically unchanged over time, and there was no significant change in pH. The 95% confidence interval of the slope of the curve relating concentration to time, determined by linear regression, indicated that suspensions stored at 25°C would maintain at least 91.4% of the initial levetiracetam concentration for 91 days and that suspensions stored at 4°C would maintain at least 93.2% of the initial concentration for 91 days, with 95% confidence. Levetiracetam suspensions prepared in Ora-Sweet/Ora-Plus vehicle and stored in plastic prescription bottles at either 25°C or 4°C can be expected to remain stable for 91 days. Le lévétiracétam est largement utilisé comme traitement d’appoint dans le traitement des crises partielles, des crises myocloniques, des crises tonico-cloniques généralisées primaires et de l’épilepsie généralisée idiopathique dans la communauté et dans les hôpitaux. Cependant, il n’existe aucune forme pharmaceutique pratique et facile à avaler au Canada.

45,2943795,"The germinal center of lymphoid tissues is a critical microenvironmental site of B cell activation and differentiation in response to antigenic stimuli. However, characterization of germinal center cells (GCC) in tissue sections has proved technically difficult. Therefore, we have employed two-color flow cytometric analysis of suspended human tonsillar lymphocytes in order to define more precisely the immunologic features of GCC. These cells were identified in suspension by virtue of their specific surface binding of the lectin peanut agglutinin (PNA), confirmed by tissue immunoperoxidase studies. Phycoerythrin-labeled lectin was used in combination with a variety of fluorescein-labeled antibodies in order to identify subpopulations of tonsillar lymphocytes. The majority of PNA+ cells were B cells, and both PNA+ and PNA- B cells stained for surface immunoglobulin light chains. PNA+ cells lacked surface IgD, but included cells with surface IgG and IgM. Both PNA+ and PNA- cells stained for B1, B2, BA-1, Leu-12, Leu-14, CR-I, and HLA-DR antigens, whereas CALLA was present only on PNA+ cells. There were differences between PNA+ and PNA- cells in the relative expression of B1 and B2 antigens, possibly reflecting differences in B cell activation or maturation. A small proportion of T cells were PNA+, including both helper/inducer and suppressor/cytotoxic phenotypes. PNA+ cells included both small and large lymphoid cells, and almost all DNA synthetic activity was associated with the large PNA+ cells. PNA+ B cells isolated by cell sorting had morphologic features characteristic of GCC. Therefore, PNA+ cells in suspension appeared to represent GCC, and features of these cells that cannot be convincingly shown in tissue section studies were demonstrated by flow cytometry. "

Oxandrolone oral suspension (1 mg/mL) was prepared using oxandrolone tablets, Ora-Plus, and either Ora-Sweet or Ora-Sweet SF. Three identical samples of each formulation were prepared and stored in 2-oz amber plastic bottles with child-resistant caps at room temperature (23-25 °C). After thorough but gentle shaking by hand to prevent foaming, a 1-mL sample was withdrawn from each of the six bottles, diluted with mobile phase to an expected concentration of 200 μg/mL, and assayed in duplicate by injecting 5 μL into the high-performance liquid chromatography system immediately after preparation and at 7, 14, 35, 60, and 90 days. The samples were examined for any change in color or pH on each day of analysis. The stability of the suspensions was determined by calculating the percentage of the initial oxandrolone concentration remaining on each test day. Stability was defined as the retention of at least 90% of the initial oxandrolone concentration. At least 98% of the original oxandrolone concentration remained in both formulations at the end of the 90-day study period. There was no appreciable change in odor, taste, color, or pH. Both suspensions remained white in color and sweet with no aftertaste throughout the study period. The oxandrolone was easily resuspended with gentle shaking.

47,18627019,"Tissue engineered lamb heart valve leaflets (N - 3) were constructed by repeatedly seeding a concentrated suspension of autologous myofibroblasts onto a biodegradable synthetic polymeric scaffold composed of fibers made from polyglycolic acid and polylactic acid. Over a 2-week period the cells attached to the polymer fibers, multiplied, and formed a tissue core in the shape of the matrix. The tissue core was seeded with autologous large-vessel endothelial cells that formed a monolayer which coated the outer surface of the leaflet. The tissue engineered leaflets were surgically implanted in place of the right posterior pulmonary valve leaflet of the donor lamb while on cardiopulmonary bypass. Pulmonary valve function was evaluated by two-dimensional echocardiography with color Doppler which demonstrated valve function without evidence of stenosis and with only trivial regurgitation under normal physiologic conditions. Histologically, the tissue engineered heart valve leaflets resembled native valve leaflet tissue. "

Many adult and elderly patients for whom propranolol is prescribed are also unable to swallow solid dosage forms. In Canada, propranolol is not commercially available in a liquid dosage form, and existing recipes for extemporaneously compounded suspensions of propranolol (1 mg/mL) are limited by concerns regarding diabetes mellitus in certain subpopulations, the need for a more concentrated suspension for patients taking larger doses, and the tediousness of compounding. To evaluate the stability of propranolol suspensions in a sugar-free, commercially available vehicle after storage at room temperature and under refrigeration for up to 120 days. Suspensions of propranolol (2 and 5 mg/mL) were prepared in the sugar-free vehicle (Ora-Blend SF), placed in 100-mL amber plastic prescription bottles, and stored at 25°C and 4°C. Samples were collected from each bottle once weekly for 120 days, stored frozen, and analyzed by a validated, stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography - ultraviolet detection method. A suspension was considered stable if it maintained at least 90% of its initial concentration of propranolol. Physical compatibility was evaluated in terms of colour, taste, precipitation, and pH. Propranolol suspensions 2 mg/mL and 5 mg/mL stored at 25°C maintained at least 94.7% of their initial concentration for 120 days, and suspensions stored at 4°C maintained at least 93.9% of their initial concentration for 120 days. There were no notable changes in pH, and all samples remained physically unchanged except for a slight change in colour, around day 70, of suspensions stored at room temperature.

49,28703954,"For consumers suffering with gluten intolerance, the only way to manage the condition is to avoid foods which are high in gluten. Instant gruels, processed from gluten-free corn and rice by extrusion cooking, could be used as a ready meal both for children and for adults on a gluten-free diet. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of various processing conditions on selected characteristics of corn-rice instant gruels. Corn-rice mixtures (75:25 and 50:50) were processed at 12, 14, 16 and 18% of initial moisture content, using an extruder with screw speeds of 80, 100 and 120 rpm. Bulk density, water absorption and solubility, gel formation, color and sensory characteristics were assessed, under various pro- cessing conditions and with various corn:rice ratios. The composition of the raw materials, initial moisture content and screw speed applied during processing affected the characteristics of the corn-rice extruded instant gruels. Increasing the amount of rice in the recipe from 25 to 50% resulted in decreased bulk density, water solubility, volumetric gel formation ability and b* value. Increasing the initial moisture content increased the bulk density, L*, a* and b* intensity, and gel formation index values of extrudates made with a 75:25 corn-rice recipe. Increased rpm increased extrudate solubility and water absorption, if the initial moisture content was higher than 14%. The highest scores for overall acceptability were found for milk suspensions of 75:25 and 50:50 corn-rice instant gruels processed at 12 and 14% of initial moisture content, at 120 rpm. Corn-rice instant gruels can be successfully produced by extrusion-cooking. Variable param- eters, like the initial moisture content of raw materials or screw speed during processing significantly affected the properties of the products. An understanding of the effects of processing conditions on some qualities of extruded instant gruels allows more desirable products to be created. Moreover, the various components can be used for extruded products for consumers on gluten-free diets. Functional additives incorporated in the recipe to improve the nutritional value of the extrudates, which will be investigated in our upcoming research. "
50,34577643,"Stability studies performed by the pharmaceutical industry are principally designed to fulfill licensing requirements. Thus, post-dilution or post-reconstitution stability data are frequently limited to 24 h only for bacteriological reasons, regardless of the true physicochemical stability which could, in many cases, be longer. In practice, the pharmacy-based centralized preparation may require preparation in advance for administration, for example, on weekends, holidays, or in general when pharmacies may be closed. We report an innovative strategy for storing resuspended solutions of azacitidine, a well-known chemotherapic agent, for which the manufacturer lists maximum stability of 22 h. By placing the syringe with the azacitidine reconstituted suspension between two refrigerant gel packs and storing it at 4 °C, we found that the concentration of azacitidine remained above 98% of the initial concentration for 48 h, and no change in color nor the physicochemical properties of the suspension were observed throughout the study period. The physicochemical and microbiological properties were evaluated by HPLC-UV and UHPLC-HRMS analysis, FTIR spectroscopy, pH determination, visual and subvisual examination, and sterility assay. The HPLC-UV method used for evaluating the chemical stability of azacitidine was validated according to ICH. Precise control of storage temperature was obtained by a digital data logger. Our study indicates that by changing the storage procedure of azacitidine reconstituted suspension, the usage window of the drug can be significantly extended to a time frame that better copes with its use in the clinical environment.

51,29062252,"Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is a picture of hemolysis which is caused by autoantibodies against red blood cell surface antigens. It is classified as primary, secondary or warm and cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia according to the temperature at which antibodies react. It is usually an acute and self-limiting condition. Here, we present a three-year-old male patient who presented with malaise, paleness, and dark-colored urine. His hemoglobin level was 5.8 g/dL, and increased indirect bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase levels and decreased haptoglobulin and reticulocyte levels were noted. A direct Coombs test was positive using anti-C3. Four erythrocyte suspension transfusions were given because the anemia was life-threatening. High-dose steroids (30 mg/kg/ day, methylprednisolone) and intravenous immunoglobulin (1 g/kg/day, two days) treatments were unresponsive. Plasmapheresis was performed and no further transfusions were needed after plasmapheresis. Plasmapheresis treatment can be effective in children with cold type autoimmune hemolytic anemia. "
52,21122997,"Deep burns often result in hypo-pigmentation, referred to as leucoderma which has a similar psychosocial impact on the patients as that of vitiligo. Several tissue grafting methods have been reported to treat post-burn leucoderma. A simple method consisting of harvesting a donor skin sample, preparation of an epidermal cell suspension and the transplantation of the cell suspension on to a dermabraded recipient area, was performed in a clean procedure room. No special laboratory set-up was used for the cell separation procedure. Patients were treated with 18 sessions of excimer laser starting 1 month post-operatively, to hasten the repigmentation. Of the 10 patients treated with MKTP, 3 were lost to follow-up. The remaining 7 patients showed repigmentation ranging from 90% to 100% with good color matching. MKTP is an effective method to treat post-burn leucoderma. No special precautions are required to treat any anatomical site or uneven scarred surface. "
53,28374129,"A dot immunoassay for simultaneous semiquantitative detection of IgG against tetanus toxoid (Ttx) and diphtheria toxoid (Dtx) and qualitative detection of anti-Bordetella pertussis IgGs in human blood serum using carbon nanoparticles functionalized with streptococcal protein G was developed. Inactivated B. pertussis cells in suspension form were used as an antigen in the immunoassay. Pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria antigens were separately spotted onto nitrocellulose strips, and then the immunostrips were successively incubated with blood sera and a suspension of carbon nanoparticles. The immunostrips were then scanned with a flatbed scanner, and the images obtained were processed with ImageJ. One hundred fifty-five venous blood serum samples from children vaccinated with diphtheria, tetanus, and whole-cell pertussis (DTwP) vaccine were tested in comparison with a conventional ELISA and agglutination test. The total time required for analysis of 32 serum samples was less than 3 h. Comparison between the results of the dot immunoassay and the corresponding ELISA/agglutination test revealed a high level of agreement (Cohen's kappa between 0.765 and 0.813). The lower limit of quantification was 0.06 IU/ml for anti-Ttx and anti-Dtx. The intra-assay coefficients of variation were less than 15% for anti-Ttx and anti-Dtx and less than 10% for anti-pertussis. The diagnostic sensitivity of detection of the antibody protection level was 93.5% for anti-Ttx [95% confidence interval (CI) 83.5-97.9%], 92.4% for anti-Dtx (95% CI 80.9297.5%), and 90.2% for anti-pertussis (95% CI 75.9-96.8%). The diagnostic specificity was 90.9% for anti-Ttx (95% CI 57.1-99.5%), 85% for anti-Dtx (95% CI 61.1-96.0%), and 89.3% for anti-pertussis (95%CI 80.8-94.5%). The dot immunoassay developed does not require expensive reading equipment, and allows detection of antibodies against three antigens in a single analysis.

54,21760836,"The association between childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and major depression disorder (MDD) gives reason to suspect that many mothers with postpartum depression (PPD) have a history of CSA. However, few studies have investigated how CSA and PPD are related. In this case study we explore how the experience of incest intertwines with the experience of postpartum depression. We focus on participant subject ""Nina,"" who has experienced both. We interviewed her three times and we analysed the interviews with Giorgi's phenomenological descriptive method to arrive at a contextualised meaning structure. Nina's intruding fantasies of men who abuse her children merge with her recollections of her own incest experiences. She may succeed in forcing these fantasies out of her consciousness, but they still alter her perceptions, thoughts, and emotions. She feels overwhelmed and succumbs to sadness, while she also is drawn towards information about CSA, which in turn feeds her fantasies. The psychodynamic concepts of repetition compulsion, transference, and projection may provide some explanation of Nina's actions, thoughts, and emotions through her past experiences. With our phenomenological stance, we aim to acknowledge Nina's descriptions of her everyday life here and now. With reference to Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, and Minkowski, we show that Nina's past is not a dated memory; rather it determines the structure of her consciousness that constitutes her past as her true present and future. Incest dominates Nina's world, and her possibilities for action are restricted by this perceived world. Any suspension of action implies anguish, and she resolves this by incest-structured action that in turn feeds and colours her expectations. Thus anxiety and depression are intertwined in the structure of this experience. "

Basé sur des entretiens avec des praticiens de la pratique de l'IECMHC, sa mise en place et son évaluation, une structure théorique a été créée afin d'articuler la manière dont on suppose que l'IECHHC affecte l'expulsion en réduisant d'abord l'influence des préjugés implicites sur les décisions disciplinaires. Des implications pour la pratique et la recherche sont présentées. Suspendierungsprävention: theoretischer Rahmen für die Rolle von Beratungen zur psychischen Gesundheit bei Säuglingen und Kleinkindern in Bezug auf die Bewältigung impliziter Vorurteile Kleinkinder of Color - insbesondere Jungen - sind einem unverhältnismäßigen Risiko ausgesetzt, suspendiert und aus Frühförderungs- und Bildungskontexten ausgeschlossen zu werden. Die Beratung zur psychischen Gesundheit von Säuglingen und Kleinkindern (Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health Consultation; IECMHC) ist ein Ansatz, der mit Suspendierungsraten assoziiert ist, die niedriger sind als die erwarteten Werte. Allerdings sind die Mechanismen unbekannt, welche einen Einfluss auf die Suspendierungen im Vorschulalter haben könnten. Diese Arbeit geht auf die Parallelen zwischen IECMHC und Interventionen zur Verringerung impliziter Vorurteile ein. Basierend auf Interviews mit Führungskräften in der Praxis, Implementierung und Evaluation von IECMHC wurde ein theoretischer Rahmen geschaffen, der eine Erklärung für den Einfluss von IECMHC auf die Suspendierungsraten darstellen soll. Es wird die Hypothese aufgestellt, dass der Einfluss impliziter Vorurteile auf Disziplinarentscheidungen verringert wird. Implikationen für Praxis und Forschung werden gegeben. 排除の予防:暗黙の裡に持っている偏見に対処する乳幼児精神保健コンサルテー ションの役割のための枠組み 有色人種の幼児−特に男児−は、幼児教育現場からの一時的登園停止及び排除の、相当なリスクにある。乳幼児精神保健コンサルテーション(IECMHC)は、予想される排除の割合より低くなることに関連した取り組みであるが、それが保育現場における排除に対し影響を及ぼしている仕組みは、わかっていない。本論文では、IECMHCと暗黙の裡に持っている偏見を減少させるために作り出された介入との間の類似点について熟考する。IECMHC の実践、実践の導入と評価を行う指導者たちへのインタビューをもとに、IECMHCが、最初に懲罰の決定に対する暗黙の裡に持っている偏見の影響を減少させることによって排除に影響を及ぼす、ということをいかに仮定されているかを明確に述べるために、理論的な枠組みが作られた。実践と研究における予測される結果を提供する。. 有色人种的孩子, 特别是男孩, 在早期看护和教育机构中被停学和开除的风险是很大的。婴幼儿心理健康咨询 (IECMHC) 是一种降低预期开除率的相关方法, 但其可能影响学前班开除率的机制尚不清楚。本文回顾了IECMHC与为减少内隐偏见而创建的干预措施之间的相似之处。基于对IECMHC实践、实施和评估中负责人的访谈, 本文建立了一个理论框架, 旨在阐明IECMHC是如何通过首先减少纪律决策上的内隐偏见的影响, 进而影响开除率的。这为今后的实践和研究提供了启示。. منع الطرد: إطار لدور استشارات الصحة النفسية للرضع والطفولة المبكرة في معالجة التحيزات الضمنية يتعرض الأطفال الصغار الملونون-وخاصه الصبيان-لخطر الإيقاف والطرد بنسب متفاوتة في سياقات التعليم و تقديم الرعاية في الطفولة المبكرة . ويعتبر منهج استشارات الرضع والطفولة المبكرة (ECMHC) أسلوب مقاربة مرتبط بمعدلات الطرد الأقل من المتوقع ، ولكن الآليات التي يمكن أن يؤثر من خلالها علي الطرد قبل المدرسي غير معروفة. تتناول هذه الورقة جوانب التوازي بين مبادرة (IECMHC) والتدخلات التي تم وضعها للحد من التحيز الضمني. واستنادا إلى المقابلات التي أجريت مع القادة في هذه المبادرة ، تم وضع اطار نظري لتوضيح الكيفية التي يفترض بها ان تؤثر علي الطرد عن طريق الحد أولا من تاثير التحيز الضمني علي القرارات التاديبيه. وتناقش الدراسة التطبيقات العملية في الممارسة والبحث.

57,23149007,"Administration of medications to pediatric patients is challenging because many drugs are not commercially available in appropriate dosage formulations and/or strengths. Consequently, these drugs are prepared extemporaneously as oral liquid (OL) formulations using marketed tablets or capsules. In many cases, the stability of these extemporaneous preparations, which may affect their tolerability, has not been documented. An alternative extemporaneous solid formulation, such as a fast-dispersing tablet (FDT), may offer enhanced stability as well as dosing flexibility because it may be administered as an orodispersible tablet or as a reconstituted suspension/solution. Although FDTs are available increasingly as patient-friendly oral dosage formulations, and their simple method of manufacture can be applied to extemporaneous formulations, such applications have not been explored to date. The use of extemporaneous captopril OL formulations in hospitals in Ireland was surveyed, and the stability of the most commonly used captopril formulation (reference) was investigated and compared with that of a newly available extemporaneous FDT formulation. The survey was carried out in 120 hospitals in the Republic of Ireland. The 56-day stability of the most commonly used formulation was compared with that of a newly available extemporaneous captopril FDT preparation. The captopril content of the formulations was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Formulations were also monitored for changes in appearance, including color; odor; and pH (OLs only). The survey showed that extemporaneously prepared captopril OLs were extensively used, particularly in specialist children's hospitals. The most commonly used preparation was a xanthan gum-based oral suspension. Analysis of these OL preparations showed the OLs to have been stable up to day 7, but that the captopril concentration decreased to 72% to 84% at day 14 and to 59% to 68% at day 56; this decrease was accompanied by a pungent odor suggestive of captopril oxidation. In contrast, FDT formulations demonstrated greater stability, with 96% of captopril present at day 56. The results of this study support only a 7-day stability for the currently dispensed captopril OL in hospitals in Ireland. In contrast, a stability of at least 56 days was shown with the FDTs. The FDTs may represent an alternative and convenient oral solid extemporaneous preparation of captopril and, potentially, other extemporaneous pediatric medications. "
58,19299374,"The stability of extemporaneously prepared moxifloxacin oral suspensions was studied. An oral suspension of moxifloxacin 20 mg/mL was prepared by thoroughly grinding three 400-mg tablets of moxifloxacin in a glass mortar. Thirty milliliters of Ora-Plus and 30 mL of either Ora-Sweet or Ora-Sweet SF were mixed and added to the powder to make a final volume of 60 mL. Three identical samples of each formulation were prepared and placed in 2-oz amber plastic bottles with child-resistant caps and were stored at room temperature (23-25 degrees C). A 1-mL sample was withdrawn from each of the six bottles with a micropipette immediately after preparation and at 7, 14, 28, 60, and 90 days. After further dilution to an expected concentration of 8 microg/ mL with sample diluent, the samples were assayed in duplicate by stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography. Stability was defined as the retention of at least 90% of the initial concentration. At least 99% of the initial moxifloxacin remained throughout the 90-day study period in both preparations. There were no detectable changes in color, odor, taste, and pH and no visible microbial growth in any sample. Extemporaneously compounded suspensions of moxifloxacin 20 mg/mL in a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Plus and Ora-Sweet or Ora-Sweet SF were stable for at least 90 days when stored in 2-oz amber plastic bottles at room temperature.

59,10486524,"Patients suffering from neuroblastic tumors are currently being classified into prognostic subsets based on different clinical and biologic features. In this study, a triple-color flow cytometric assay and a functional test were applied to neuroblastoma cell lines and patients with a neuroblastic tumor, and the value of P-glycoprotein expression and function as potential prognostic characteristics, was determined. Twenty-two single-cell suspensions prepared from tumors, and neuroblasts from four bone marrow samples were analyzed by triple-color flow cytometry. Neuroblasts were identified by NB84-positivity and absence of CD45. P-glycoprotein expression was evaluated using 4E3 and MRK16 antibodies. Eighteen samples were tested with a functional assay, based on accumulation and retention of rhodamine-123 with and without the inhibitor verapamil. Six neuroblastoma cell lines were also evaluated. P-glycoprotein expression was seen in 18 of 26 patient samples and in three of six cell lines. The highest expression levels were found in low stage neuroblastoma and well-differentiated tumors; whereas the highest activities were found in stage 4 neuroblastoma and the lowest in ganglioneuroblastoma and ganglioneuroma patients. In 10 of 17 samples, concordant results were found between the flow cytometric immunological test and immunocytochemistry. The described flow cytometric technique is a new, alternative approach to detect P-glycoprotein expression and function in neural crest tumors. Based on the expression level and the activity value, patients can be segregated into different phenotypic groups. In particular, those patients with high P-glycoprotein activity might benefit from treatment regimens containing reversal agents. "
60,25214658,"Dexamethasone is widely used to treat rheumatic and endocrine disorders and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. A palatable, alcohol-free liquid formulation, with a suitable concentration to allow reasonable administration volume, is available only via extemporaneous compounding. To evaluate the stability of dexamethasone suspensions in commercially available vehicles (Oral Mix and Oral Mix SF) in various types of containers after storage at 25°C and 4°C for up to 91 days. Dexamethasone suspensions (1 mg/mL) were prepared in Oral Mix and Oral Mix SF and then transferred to amber glass and plastic prescription bottles and plastic oral syringes. Suspensions in all 3 types of containers were stored at 25°C; suspensions in glass and plastic bottles were also stored at 4°C. Samples were collected weekly from each container up to 28 days and then every 2 weeks up to 91 days. The samples were analyzed by a validated, stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography - ultraviolet detection method. A suspension was considered stable if it maintained at least 90% of its initial dexamethasone concentration. Changes in colour, taste, odour, precipitation (and ease of resuspension), and pH were used to assess physical compatibility. All suspensions maintained at least 96% of the original concentration for up to 91 days with storage at 25°C or at 4°C. No notable changes in colour, taste, odour, precipitation, or pH were observed over the 91-day period. Dexamethasone suspensions (1 mg/mL) in Oral Mix and Oral Mix SF, stored in amber glass or plastic bottles or plastic syringes at 25°C or in amber glass or plastic bottles at 4°C can be expected to remain stable for up to 91 days. La dexaméthasone est couramment utilisée pour traiter les affections endocriniennes et rhumatismales ainsi que les nausées et vomissements causés par la chimiothérapie. Mais, une forme liquide sans alcool, au goût acceptable et d’une concentration suffisante pour permettre l’administration d’un volume acceptable de médicament ne peut être obtenue que par la réalisation d’une préparation extemporanée. Évaluer la stabilité de suspensions de dexaméthasone préparées dans des excipients disponibles sur le marché (Oral Mix et Oral Mix SF) et placées dans différents types de contenant après leur entreposage à 4 °C et à 25 °C pendant une période allant jusqu’à 91 jours. Des suspensions de dexaméthasone (1 mg/mL) ont été préparées dans des excipients Oral Mix et Oral Mix SF, puis transférées dans des seringues orales de plastique ambré et dans des flacons pour médicaments d’ordonnance en plastique et en verre ambrés. Des suspensions contenues dans les trois types de contenant ont été entreposées à 25 °C, alors que seules des préparations contenues dans des flacons de verre et de plastique ont aussi été entreposées à 4 °C. Des échantillons ont été prélevés de chaque contenant une fois par semaine jusqu’à 28 jours, puis toutes les deux semaines jusqu’à 91 jours. Les échantillons ont été analysés à l’aide d’une épreuve validée mesurant la stabilité par chromatographie liquide haute performance avec détection ultraviolette. Une suspension était jugée stable si elle conservait au moins 90 % de sa concentration initiale de dexaméthasone. Tout changement dans la couleur, le goût, l’odeur, le pH ainsi que la formation de précipité (et la facilité de remise en suspension) a servi à l’évaluation de la compatibilité physique. Toutes les suspensions ont conservé au moins 96 % de leur concentration initiale pendant une période allant jusqu’à 91 jours dans des conditions d’entreposage de 25 °C ou de 4 °C. Aucun changement notable de couleur, de goût, d’odeur, de formation de précipité ou de pH n’a été observé pendant la période de 91 jours. Les préparations de dexaméthasone en suspension (1 mg/mL) dans les bases Oral Mix et Oral Mix SF conservées dans des seringues de plastique ambré ou dans des flacons pour médicaments d’ordonnance en plastique ou en verre ambrés à 25 °C ainsi que celles conservées dans des flacons pour médicaments d’ordonnance en plastique ou en verre ambrés à 4 °C devraient demeurer stables pendant une période allant jusqu’à 91 jours.

61,17617502,"In an effort to minimize barriers to compliance and adherence and to improve the accuracy of dosage measurement, sugar-containing and sugar-free sodium phenylbutyrate suspensions were formulated, and the stability of these products over a 90-day period was determined. An oral suspension of sodium phenylbutyrate 200 mg/mL was prepared by thoroughly grinding 12 g of Sodium Phenylbutyrate Powder, USP, in a glass mortar. Thirty milliliters of Ora-Plus and 30 mL of either Ora-Sweet or Ora-Sweet SF were mixed and added to the powder to make a final volume of 60 mL. Three identical samples of each formulation were prepared and placed in 2-oz amber plastic bottles with child-resistant caps and were stored at room temperature. A 500-microL sample was withdrawn from each of the six bottles with a micropipette immediately after preparation and at 7, 14, 28, 60, and 90 days. After further dilution to an expected concentration of 100 microg/mL with the mobile phase, the samples were assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Stability was defined as the retention of at least 90% of the initial concentration. At least 95% of the initial sodium phenylbutyrate concentration remained throughout the 90-day study period in both preparations. There were no detectable changes in color, odor, taste, and pH and no visible microbial growth in any sample. Extemporaneously compounded suspensions of sodium phenylbutyrate, 200 mg/mL, in a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Plus and Ora-Sweet or Ora-Sweet SF were stable for at least 90 days when stored in 2-oz amber plastic bottles at room temperature.

62,15363498,"There is a great need for oral anti-malaria preparations especially for small children, which are easy to administer and keep their stability under tropical conditions. The purpose of this work was therefore to develop a dry suspension, containing one of the artemisinin derivatives, namely artesunate, artemether and dihydroartemisinin using fast wetting suspending agents, i.e. xanthan gum and Avicel CL611. For the optimisation of these two variables, namely the suspending agent's content, a Doehlert design was applied. Via preliminary tests on sedimentation behaviour, the limits of both products were determined, respectively 0.1-0.4% (w/v) and 1.0-2.5% (w/v). As responses, sedimentation as a function of time, viscosity and price of the suspension, were evaluated. The stability tests of the reconstituted suspensions showed bad results for artesunate, even when the pH was adapted. In contrast, dihydroartemisinin showed only 10% degradation within 10 days and artemether was stable at least 21 days. Practically the last one was able to foresee a chemically and physically stable suspension at least during the administration period (5 to 7 days) and was therefore selected for further optimisation concerning taste and appearance. Based on the results of selection tests for the colourant, sweetener and taste masking agent, the following composition was proposed for a suitable dry powder with artemether (AM) as active compound to prepare 100 ml reconstituted suspension: AM 300 mg, Avicel CL611 2 g, xanthan gum 200 mg, crystalline saccharose 35 g, citric acid monohydrate 150 mg, Nipagine 80 mg, Nipasol 20 mg, sodium saccharinate 250 mg, tutti-frutti 250 mg and Sunset yellow 10 mg.

63,9063785,"The management of pain and anxiety in pediatric patients with burns includes the challenge of striking a balance between inadequate versus excessive medication. Ketamine provides effective sedative, analgesic, and amnestic properties for children and has been used intravenously with good results. With its recent availability as an elixir, we speculated that ketamine given orally may provide effective analgesia and sedation during wound care procedures with a wide safety margin. To test this hypothesis, 19 pediatric patients with burns undergoing a wound care procedure were randomized to receive either ketamine oral suspension or 300 mg acetaminophen with codeine phosphate and diphenhydramine, our prior standard for analgesia and sedation. Intensity of pain was determined with use of a color slide algometer and demonstrated more than 400% reduction in pain with the use of ketamine (p < 0.05). The Ramsey scale was used to quantitate sedation and demonstrated that ketamine improved sedation by 360% (p < 0.05). These results substantiate improved analgesia and sedation with oral ketamine as compared to a commonly used narcotic and sedative in facilitating wound care procedures in pediatric patients with burns. These findings suggest that expanded use of ketamine oral suspension may be. "
64,33022335,"Wound infection in burn patients is common and has an impact on outcomes. There is no objective method to diagnose infection at point of care (PoC). Early diagnosis prevents progression to sepsis. Diagnostic subjectivity supports over-diagnosis, unnecessary hospitalization, and antibiotic overuse. This pilot study aimed to investigate the accuracy of a novel PoC wound infection diagnostic in burn patients. We produced, and in vitro tested, a PoC diagnostic for early wound infection diagnosis. The prototype SPaCE diagnostic uses a patented lipid vesicle suspension into which a clinical swab is placed. The diagnostic delivers a colour-response to Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida species and Enterococcus faecalis at toxin release. A pilot clinical diagnostic accuracy study was undertaken. The reference standard was a retrospective decision made by an expert clinical panel using routinely available data. Data was available from 33 of 34 patients. Of these, 52% were considered to have a wound infection, 42% not, and two (6%) were equivocal. The diagnostic results showed 24% were infected, 42% were not and 33% produced intermediate results. Agreement between clinical judgement and diagnostic result, assessed using a weighted Kappa, was 0.591 suggesting moderate agreement. If the intermediate results were excluded, 22 sets of data with definitive results achieved a Kappa statistic of 0.81 suggesting 'almost perfect' agreement. Sensitivity and specificity were 57% (8/14) and 71% (12/17), respectively. This pilot study provided evidence that the SPaCE diagnostic could provide valuable and timely data to support clinical decision-making at PoC for wound infection. "
65,27002537,"High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) technology is a physical method for inactivating tissue. We reported that nevus specimens were inactivated after HHP at 200 MPa and that the inactivated nevus could be used as autologous dermis for covering skin defects. In this study, we verified the inactivation of nevus specimens using a newly developed portable HHP device which will be used in a clinical trial. Nevus tissue specimens were obtained from 5 patients (mean age 7.2 years, range 1-19). We cultured fibroblasts and nevus cells from the tissue specimens and then evaluated their inactivation after HHP at 200 MPa by confirming the attachment of the suspensions and by the live/dead staining of the suspensions, through the dissociation of the cells on chamber slides and by the live/dead staining of the remaining cells. The cells were also quantitatively evaluated by WST-8 assay. We then confirmed the inactivation of the nevus specimens after HHP using explant culture. Our results indicated that fibroblasts and nevus cells were inactivated after HHP at 200 MPa, with the exception of a small percentage of green-colored cells, which reflected the remaining activity of the cellular esterases after HHP. No cells migrated from the nevus specimens after HHP at 200 MPa. We verified the inactivation of fibroblasts and nevus cells cultured from nevus specimens, and in the nevus samples themselves after pressurization at 200 MPa using this device. This device could be used in clinical trials for giant congenital melanocytic nevi and may thus become useful in various medical fields. "
66,11494787,"The short-term stability of Adderall in three extemporaneously compounded oral liquids was studied. Three suspensions of Adderall 1 mg/mL were prepared from commercially available 10-mg Adderall tablets with Ora-Sweet, Ora-Plus, and a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Sweet and Ora-Plus. Each suspension was stored in the dark in a stability chamber at 25 degrees C and 60% relative humidity for 30 days. The stability of the active drug (a mixture of levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine salts) in each of the three vehicles was determined immediately after preparation and at 10, 20, and 30 days by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS). No significant changes in concentrations of either amphetamine isomer occurred during the 30-day study period. Visual inspection of samples revealed no changes in color or odor. Extemporaneously compounded liquid oral formulations of Adderall 1 mg/mL in Ora-Sweet, Ora-Plus, or a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Sweet and Ora-Plus were stable for at least 30 days at 25 degrees C and 60% relative humidity.

67,22478950,"Prescribing of diclofenac for children usually involves a dose different from commercially available strengths. This drug is available only as tablets, which can be divided only so many times before the dose obtained becomes inaccurate. In addition, children may have difficulty swallowing tablets. For these reasons, a compounding formula for a liquid dosage form is essential to ensure effective delivery of the drug to pediatric patients. To develop a compounding formula for diclofenac sodium and to determine the extended physical and chemical stability of this compound when stored in amber polyvinyl chloride (PVC) prescription bottles under refrigeration and at room temperature. A suspension of diclofenac sodium (10 mg/mL) was prepared from commercially available diclofenac sodium tablets, with Ora-Blend as the suspending and flavouring agent. The suspension was packaged in 60-mL amber PVC prescription bottles and stored at either room temperature (23°C) or under refrigeration (5°C). Samples were collected on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 27, 56, and 93. Chemical stability was determined using a validated stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography method. At each sampling time, the suspensions were checked for changes in appearance (i.e., colour, layering, caking, ease of resuspension), odour, and pH. The diclofenac sodium suspensions were very stable, retaining at least 99.5% of the original concentration for up to 93 days, regardless of storage temperature. There were no apparent changes in the physical appearance of the suspensions, nor were there any substantial changes in odour or pH. Suspensions of diclofenac sodium (10 mg/mL) were quantitatively stable but difficult to prepare because of the enteric coating of the tablets. Therefore, it is recommended that diclofenac powder be used for the preparation of suspensions. For pediatric use, palatability is a consideration, and a masking agent should be added before administration. An expiry date of up to 93 days is suggested. La prescription de diclofénac aux enfants requiert généralement une dose qui ne correspond à aucun des dosages disponibles dans le commerce. Ce médicament n’existe que sous forme de comprimés qui ne peuvent être subdivisés que quelques fois sans compromettre l’exactitude de la dose obtenue. En outre, les enfants peuvent avoir du mal à avaler les comprimés. Pour ces raisons, il faut une recette pour la préparation d’une forme pharmaceutique liquide afin d’assurer l’administration effective du médicament aux patients en pédiatrie. Développer une recette pour la préparation de diclofénac sodique et déterminer la stabilité physique et chimique prolongée de cette préparation lorsqu’elle est conservée dans des flacons en polychlorure de vinyle (PVC) ambré pour médicaments d’ordonnance au réfrigérateur ou à la température ambiante. Une suspension de diclofénac sodique (10 mg/mL) a été préparée à partir de comprimés de diclofénac sodique commercialisés avec l’agent de suspension et aromatisant, Ora-Blend. La suspension a été conditionnée dans des flacons en PVC ambré de 60 mL pour médicaments d’ordonnance, puis entreposée à la température ambiante (23 °C) ou au réfrigérateur (5 °C). Des échantillons ont été prélevés aux jours 0, 7, 14, 21, 27, 56 et 93. La stabilité chimique a été déterminée à l’aide d’une épreuve validée par chromatographie liquide haute performance. À chaque prélèvement d’échantillon, les suspensions ont été inspectées visuellement pour déceler tout changement d’apparence (c.-à-d., couleur, stratification, agglutination et facilité de remise en suspension), d’odeur et de pH. Les suspensions de diclofénac sodique sont demeurées très stables, conservant plus de 99,5 % de la concentration initiale pendant une période allant jusqu’à 93 jours, peu importe les conditions d’entreposage. On n’a observé aucun changement évident dans l’apparence des suspensions ni de changement substantiel dans l’odeur ou le pH des suspensions. Les suspensions de diclofénac sodique (10 mg/mL) étaient quantitativement stables, mais difficiles à préparer à cause de l’enrobage entérosoluble des comprimés. Par conséquent, il est recommandé d’utiliser plutôt le diclofénac en poudre. La palatabilité étant un facteur dont il faut tenir compte en pédiatrie, on devrait ajouter un masquant du goût avant l’administration de la préparation. La durée de conservation suggérée est de 93 jours au maximum. [Traduction par l’éditeur] "

69,19208060,"The aims of this study were to develop and evaluate a shorter gestational age estimation method based on the Dubowitz scoring system (DSS) that could be taught easily to untrained health-care workers. Using the DSS, seven criteria were identified that explained 90% of the variance in gestational age estimation. Ventral suspension was excluded, skin texture was substituted for skin colour and ear bending was for ear firmness. The final six criteria comprise the short DSS (SDSS). The study population was 100 babies, 51 Caucasian, 34 Aboriginal. Birth weight ranged from 1351 to 5430 g. The gestational age range was 29.6-41.7 weeks. Three researchers (medical student 1 (MS1), medical student 2 (MS2) and a paediatrician) who were blind to other available gestational age estimations assessed babies within 72 h of birth using the DSS and SDSS. MS1 found the 95% limits of agreement (LOA) between SDSS and DSS to be -1.1 to 1.7 weeks. In the 27 babies who had first trimester foetal ultrasound (USS), the LOA between USS and SDSS were -1.9 to 1.4 weeks and -2.3 to 1.9 weeks, respectively. Using the SDSS, the LOA for the three researchers were within +/-2 weeks. The data presented suggest that the SDSS is approximately equivalent to the DSS in the relatively limited population studied, and within these limitations appears to be a simple alternative to the DSS. Further evaluation is needed before firm conclusions about the accuracy and clinical utility of the SDSS can be made. "
70,26675600,An infant presented with features suggestive of an anomalous left coronary artery was found to have normal origins of both coronary arteries. Echocardiography during episodes of ischaemia showed marked aortic regurgitation with retrograde coronary flow. The left coronary leaflet was mildly hypoplastic. Surgical re-suspension of this leaflet prevented aortic regurgitation and the patient had no further symptoms and recovered cardiac function. 
71,9298839,"Twenty-two fresh surgical specimens of human sarcomas (soft tissue and bone) from 20 patients were analyzed by flow cytometry for the expression of drug resistance-related P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and cellular daunorubicin (DNR) accumulation with or without the presence of DNR efflux blockers. Single-cell suspensions prepared from the tumor specimens were analyzed by dual-color flow cytometry after reaction with MRK-16 (anti-P-gp) and anti-CD45 (pan-leukocyte) antibodies. MRK-16 reactivity of tumor cells was evaluated after exclusion of CD45-positive cells by electronic gates. Parallel samples were incubated with DNR alone or in combination with DNR efflux blockers, verapamil (VPL), or dipyridamole (DPD) for determination of cellular DNR accumulation and the effect of the efflux blockers. Extensive heterogeneity was observed in both P-gp expression and DNR accumulation of the tumor specimens examined. Eight of the 22 tumor specimens had significant numbers of P-gp-positive cells. In three of the eight P-gp-positive tumors, cellular DNR accumulation was significantly increased by co-incubation with the efflux blockers VPL or DPD. These results indicate that both quantitative and functional analysis of P-gp expression may be essential in determining the cellular drug resistance phenotype of tumor cells and its correlation with therapeutic outcome.

72,7873389,"Diagnosis of platelet dense granule storage pool disease and release defects at present requires a combination of studies including lumiaggregometry, conventional platelet aggregation, radioactive serotonin uptake and release, and electron microscopy. Flow cytometric methods have been developed to study platelet activation, aggregation, and alpha-granule protein release. Here, we have investigated the use of flow cytometry for analysis of platelet dense granule content uptake and release using mepacrine as a fluorescent marker. Mepacrine (quinacrine) is rapidly taken up and localized in dense granules of platelets. For the assay, as little as 20 microliters of blood from a fingerstick collected without anticoagulant or venous blood collected in 3.8% sodium citrate were diluted 1:40 with 2 ml Hanks balanced salt solution (BSS). 300 microliters of this cell suspension were incubated with mepacrine alone, or simultaneously with a mouse monoclonal antibody to human platelet glycoprotein IIb (Tab), used as a platelet-specific marker. The bound monoclonal antibody was then indirectly labelled with the fluorochrome, RED670. 100 microliters of the sample were further diluted with Hanks BSS for one- or two-colour flow cytometric analysis. To verify that mepacrine uptake was related to platelet dense granule content, platelets of beige mice, a strain with dense granule deficiency, were examined. Their mepacrine uptake was substantially decreased compared to that of normal mice. Decreased mepacrine uptake also was demonstrated in platelets of a patient with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome in which a deficiency of platelet dense granules is characteristic. In both human and mouse platelets, mepacrine uptake was proportional to platelet size. Thrombin induced mepacrine release in a dose-dependent manner from 0.003 to 0.4 U/ml. Therefore both platelet uptake and release of mepacrine can be readily detected by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry provides an attractive alternative to aggregation and radioactive serotonin as methods to study defects in platelet dense granule function. "
73,12187247,"Contrast medium enhanced harmonic ultrasound is a recently developed ultrasound technique that improves the assessment of renal parenchymal vascularity. We performed a preliminary study to define the ability of contrast enhanced ultrasound with harmonic imaging to detect and localize renal scars in a porcine model of experimentally induced pyelonephritis. Vesicoureteral reflux was surgically induced in 10 pigs weighing 10 kg. with the contralateral kidney serving as a control. Approximately 4 weeks after the creation of vesicoureteral reflux cystography confirmed reflux. Infection was induced by placing a suspension of paraffin broth impregnated with Escherichia coli in the bladder of each pig. At 4 to 8 weeks (mean 6.5) after the induction of infection a radiologist blinded to the side of the previous procedure performed conventional gray scale ultrasound, color Doppler ultrasound and contrast enhanced ultrasound with harmonic power imaging. The animals were sacrificed; the kidneys were inspected and tissues from the upper, mid and lower poles were sent for culture and histological examination. Histology results were compared with the findings of the 3 ultrasound modalities. All 10 pigs survived the surgical procedures with no complications. Post-contrast harmonic ultrasound images were available in 9 pigs (18 renal units). Harmonic ultrasound revealed decreased blood flow in 11 renal units, including the upper pole in 7, lower pole in 3, and upper and lower poles in 2. Renal tissue cultures were positive in 11 renal units (6 refluxing units). Histological findings revealed fibrosis in 10 renal units (8 refluxing units). Harmonic ultrasound findings in these 10 renal units showed 9 with changes consistent with inflammation or scars. Using histological results as the gold standard for renal injury harmonic ultrasound was more sensitive than gray scale ultrasound for detecting renal injury with 90% sensitivity, 75% specificity, 81% positive predictive value and 85% negative predictive value. Preliminary results indicate that contrast enhanced ultrasound with harmonic imaging is a sensitive method for determining renal scarring without the need for radiation exposure. It may be prove to be a useful adjunct for evaluating children who present with urinary tract infection. "
74,11122020,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a clinically characteristic, chronic inflammatory skin disease of unknown origin. IgE-mediated uptake and antigen focusing of environmental allergens by dendritic cells (DCs) is assumed to be a central immunopathogenetic event. A so-called intrinsic type of AD (IAD) has been delineated from the more common extrinsic AD (EAD) by normal serum IgE levels, negative RAST tests and negative immediate-type skin reactions towards environmental allergens. The recently characterized human autoantigen Hom S 1 has been proposed to play a part in the pathogenesis of IAD. To compare clinical and laboratory data between patients with IAD and EAD, and to investigate potential differences in the inflammatory micromilieu of the epidermal compartment in IAD and EAD lesions. Epidermal DC phenotyping, a recently validated technique based on the three-colour flow cytometric analysis of Langerhans cells and the so-called inflammatory dendritic epidermal cells from epidermal single-cell suspensions, was performed on samples from 69 patients with AD (seven with IAD and 62 with EAD) and 94 controls. Patients with EAD tended to have an earlier onset of disease but similar disease duration and family history of atopic diseases. Quantitative analysis of CD36 expression on DCs as a marker of inflammation, as well as the percentage of inflammatory dendritic epidermal cells in the CD1a+ epidermal DC pool, indicated a comparable disease activity in IAD and EAD. EAD was characterized by a significantly higher FcepsilonRI expression on the CD1a+ epidermal DCs than IAD. Using the FcepsilonRI/FcgammaRII expression ratio as a disease marker for AD, values for IAD fell below the diagnostic cut-off level of 1.5 for this ratio. While IAD is clinically similar to EAD, the inflammatory microenvironment in this condition seems different from classical EAD and can be distinguished by phenotyping of epidermal DCs. "
75,16813711,"Apoptosis, one of the forms of programmed cell death, is a physiologic process of cell death that is central to normal development and occurs in response to a variety of physiologic and pathophysiologic stimuli. In the thyroid, abnormal apoptotic activity may be involved in a variety of diseases such as Hashimoto thyroiditis and Graves disease. The aim of this study was to estimate the expression of chosen apoptotic molecules CD95 (Fas) and CD95L (FasL) on the surface of thyroid follicular cells in application of mouse monoclonal antibodies #64 which recognized B antigen regions of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and infiltrating inflammatory cells. The investigation was performed on thyroid cells isolated from surgically treated thyroid tissues of 15 patients with Graves' disease (GD), 15 patients with a nontoxic multinodular goiter (NTMG) and 15 aspirates obtained by FNAB from patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT). The thyrocytes were identified by an indirect method: in the first stage we added mouse monoclonal autoantibodies specific for TPO (mAb #64) regions and in the second stage we conjugated this complex with rabbit anti-mouse antibodies IgG (Fab')2 with FITC. In the next step the cellular suspension was completed with suitably well-chosen two-colour monoclonal antibodies marked (PE or PerCP) (Becton Dickinson) directed against suitable apoptotic (Fas/FasL) molecules. All investigations were performed by flow cytometry using Coulter EPICS XL apparatus. The percentages of thyroid cells were estimated with expression of region B antigenic TPO in reference to individual apoptotic molecules. The analysis of Fas and FasL expression in thyroid tissues revealed significantly increased percentage of intrathyroidal T cells with CD95+ (p<0.005, p<0.001), CD95L+ (p<0.02, p<0.01) and both CD95/CD95L (ns, p<0.05) expression in comparison to percentages of T cells in patients with HT and NTMG. In addition, on the surface of thyroid follicular cells in patients with GD (p<0.01, p<0.01) and NTMG (p<0.001, p<0.004) we observed a lower percentage of thyrocytes with CD95 and CD95L molecules than in cases with HT. The expression of both apoptotic molecules on thyroid cells was higher (18%) in patients with HT in comparison to the percentages of positive cells in patients with GD (p<0.02, p<0.002) and NTMG, 8% and 1%, respectively. We conclude that alterations in the expression of death receptors and their ligands on the surface of thyroid follicular cells may play a role in the regulation of apoptosis in thyroid autoimmune disorders.

76,6578738,"14C-Carmoisine, a sulphonated azodye, 200 mg/kg b.w. (25 muCi), was administered to rats by gavage. Separation of radioactive compounds in faeces and urine of these animals was carried out by HPLC with a UV and a radioactivity detector. In addition to unmodified carmoisine, five radioactive compounds were present. The main peak showed both the retention time and the UV spectrum of naphtionic acid. Metabolic patterns similar to those observed ""in vivo"" were found by incubation of 14C-carmoisine under anaerobic conditions with a bacterial suspension isolated from human faeces and from the intestinal contents of rats. This procedure permits the preparation of amounts of unknown metabolites suitable for their identification. "
77,1150115,"Intestinal transit times in children less than 3 years old with gastroenteritis were measured using carmine suspension and radioopaque pellets. Carmine transit times were short as expected in the acute illness, and lengthened on recovery to the values found in children without diarrhoea. Pellet transit times of the sick children were the same as those of controls without bowel disease. Solid markers may thus be misleading in acute diarrhoeal illness of childhood. Possible mechanisms are discussed. "
78,12850377,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is associated with recurrent chromosomal abnormalities. The cryptic translocation t(12;21)(p13;q22), which leads to the TEL-AML1 fusion gene, is the most common abnormality in childhood B-cell ALL. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the incidence of TEL-AML1 fusion in childhood and adult B-cell ALL using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) and its association with additional changes. FISH, using dual-color extra-signal (ES) DNA probe specific for the TEL and AML1 genes, was performed either on blast cells suspensions stored in liquid nitrogen immediately after Ficoll or on leukemic cells preserved in fixative solution at -20 degrees C after short-term culture. No TEL-AML1 fusion was observed in the 26 ALL adults. The fusion was found among 19.6% of the 57 ALL children, additional changes being identified by conventional cytogenetics in 80% of the cases. A deletion of the untranslocated TEL was observed in 36.3% of the ALL with the TEL-AML1 fusion. The coexpression of myelocytic and B-lymphoid antigens was found in 3 of the 11 of TEL-AML1 fusion positive-ALL. Our results (frequency of TEL-AML1 fusion in children and of the deletion of the untranslocated TEL allele, mean age of the patients and white blood cell count) are within the range observed by others. Structural chromosomal abnormalities other than the t(12;21) are frequent and may play a role in the prognosis of these patients. "
79,226564,"Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has proven to be a useful assay system for the direct detection of infectious agents. However, when the usual color-producing substrates are employed, relatively large amounts of substrate must be hydrolyzed by the bound enzyme before detection can be achieved. We attempted to improve the sensitivity of ELISA by utilizing a substrate that yields a fluorescent product on enzyme action. The enzyme-linked fluorescence assay (ELFA) based on this principle was approximately 100 times more sensitive than the corresponding ELISA or radioimmunoassay for the detection of human rotavirus in a standard stool suspension. In addition, the ELFA for human rotavirus was capable of detecting antigen in six specimens that were negative by ELISA. Five of these specimens were obtained late in the course of confirmed rotavirus infections. ELFA provides a simple, reliable, ultrasensitive method for the rapid detection of viral antigen. "
80,2147370,Lymphocytes bearing the T cell receptor gamma delta (TCR-gamma delta) were searched for in human early milk lymphocyte suspensions by two colour cytofluorimetric analysis. It was found that the proportion of TCR-gamma delta+ cells was twofold greater in colostrum than in either autologous or heterologous blood samples. Additional studies are needed to determine whether this particular subset of lymphocytes is involved in the lactation transmission of cellular immunity. 
81,11699206,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of childhood has been cytogenetically well characterized, and approximately 25% of cases will have a high-hyperdiploid (51-68) chromosome complement. In a 5 year period a consecutive series of 152 presentation ALL's were karyotyped. In all cases a result was obtained and 138 (91%) had a detectable abnormal clone of which 44 (29%) were high-hyperdiploid. Within the high-hyperdiploidy group karyotypic cell to cell variation was observed in many cases. To provide further evidence of this phenomenon a dual-color fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) experiment was performed on stored fixed suspension from 14 ALL's with such a karyotype. In each case 4-6 probes were investigated, employing probes to centromeres of chromosomes X, 4, 6, 8, and 10 and a locus specific probe to chromosome 21q22. It was found that the FISH produced results that were generally in good agreement with the G-banding findings and supported the notion of karyotypic cell to cell variation. FISH further showed that most of cases would have two extra copies of chromosome 21 in the majority of leukemic cells and a single extra copy in the minority. A further finding was that fewer cells contained extra copies of chromosomes 6, 8 and 10 than was expected based on the comparison of the signal number of the other probes investigated. In contrast chromosomes X, 4, and 21 seldom displayed this feature. We have demonstrated that karyotypic instability as defined by karyotypic cell to cell variation is a feature of the high-hyperdiploid subgroup in childhood ALL. It is questioned whether the underlying defect resulting in the observed karyotypic instability of this subgroup is one of the primary causative events in the formation of the leukemia. "
82,568384,"The stability of liquid dosage forms of ethacrynic acid (1 mg/ml), indomethacin (2 mg/ml), methyldopate hydrochloride (25 mg/ml), prednisone (0.5 mg/ml) and spironolactone (2 mg/ml), which often are compounded extemporaneously, was studied. One or two liquid dosage forms of each of the five drugs was prepared with the pure drug or the powder from a commercial dosage form using aqueous sorbitol or simple syrup alone or with a 10% (v/v) solution of alcohol in water. The dosage forms were stored at 24 C in amber-colored bottles for 21-224 days and assayed by various methods. All solutions studied were stable for at least 84 days. A solution was considered stable if it retained 90% of its drug concentration. Except for the prednisone solution, all solutions were stable for at least 164 days; however, the solution of methyldopate hydrochloride prepared from the pure drug became discolored after 98 days. The liquid dosage forms studied have limited stability but can be used by the pharmacist when extemporaneous oral solutions of these drugs are needed. "
83,9162192,"Childhood endodermal sinus tumors (CESTs) are a unique category of germ cell tumors involving the testis and extragonadal region in children less than 4 years of age. Recent studies of CEST have shown recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities involving the short arm of chromosome 1, most commonly, a deletion of distal 1p. Experience with neuroblastomas has shown that cytogenetic analyses may underestimate the frequency of 1p deletion. To determine the frequency of deletion of Ip in CEST and to verify that 1p is, in fact, deleted and not translocated, we analyzed ten tumors by two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization on single-cell suspensions of interphase nuclei by using a cosmid probe from the PITSLRE kinase (p58) locus (previously mapped to 1p36) cohybridized with plasmid probe pUC1.77 (which recognizes the 1q heterochromatic region) to determine the copy number of chromosome 1. Eight of the ten tumors examined showed evidence of deletion of 1p36. Five of the eight tumors exhibited multiple subdones, and all subdones showed deletion of at least one copy of 1p36, indicating that the deletion probably occurred before the development of chromosome 1 aneusomy. We conclude that deletions of the short arm of chromosome 1, specifically 1p36, do occur in CEST and probably occur at a, higher incidence than that found in neuroblastoma Further studies are needed to determine the degree of overlap of the common area of deletion in CEST with that of neuroblastoma and to determine whether 1p deletion in CEST has prognostic significance. "
84,12115016,"In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, children with acute exacerbation of bronchial asthma between the ages of 1 and 12 years not responding to conventional therapy with bronchodilators and injectable steroids were enrolled. A total of 60 children (two groups of 30 each) was studied. The overall response to therapy was assessed based on the guidelines and recommendations of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. The efficacy parameters included respiratory and heart rates, degree of dyspnea, accessory muscle usage, color, wheeze, and degree of oxygen saturation. Children with moderate to severe exacerbation received either nimesulide suspension 1.5 mg/kg per dose or identical placebo orally as per random protocol. To assess the clinical progress, all the efficacy parameters were reassessed after 30 minutes and 1, 2, and 6 hours. A significant difference was observed in the overall assessment of response at 1, 2, and 6 hours in the two treatment groups. A greater number of children showed a good overall response in the nimesulide group compared with the placebo group at 1, 2, and 6 hours (P <.01). No side effects were reported in any of the patients in either group. None of the patients was withdrawn prematurely from either group. It is evident from the current study that nimesulide showed good efficacy and tolerability. Therefore, nimesulide could be administered to asthmatic patients whenever there is a need for such therapy. "
85,26932950,"Otic suspensions have a positive effect on the duration of otorrhea in children with a tympanostomy tube. It is still questionable how eardrops reach the middle ear. We hypothesized that otic suspensions do not pass the tympanostomy tube if the middle ear is dry but pass by diffusion when wet. The median concentration of Evans blue (colorant) in the middle ear was <15.6 mg/mL (lower limit of quantification) when diffusion was impossible but 45.3 µg/mL when diffusion was possible (P = .01). When the outward flow was increased to 0.1 mL/h, the concentration of Evans blue in the middle ear increased significantly (P = .03). With further-increasing outward flows, the concentration of Evans blue decreased linearly (β = -144, P < .001, R (2) = 0.44). We conclude that diffusion is the mechanism by which otic suspensions enter the middle ear in children with tympanostomy tubes and otorrhea. "
86,3048438,"We developed a Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) positive cell line, designated MR-87, from a 4-year-old boy with Ph+-acute leukemia. MR-87 cells grew in single cell suspensions with a doubling time of 120 to 144 hours. Both MR-87 and original leukemia cells were positive for myeloperoxidase (MPO) and myeloid antigen CD13. These cells exhibited the early B-cell phenotype, ie, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase+, Ia+, CD19+, and CD10+. Rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain was confirmed in both. Approximately 80% of MR-87 cells coexpressed CD13 and lymphoid antigens CD10 or CD19, as confirmed by a two-color analysis. Simultaneous expression of MPO and CD19 on a single MR-87 cell was demonstrated at ultrastructural level. Thus, MR-87 is a Ph+ leukemia cell line exhibiting a hybrid phenotype. The breakpoint cluster region (bcr) was not rearranged in the MR-87 cells and subsequent analysis using antisera revealed that these cells expressed a novel protein, P190c-abl, which was immunoprecipitated with anti-abl and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The MR-87 line will be most useful for investigating the biology and pathogenesis of Ph+ bcr- acute leukemia. "
87,2148719,"We describe a method of two-color immunofluorescence staining which allows the simultaneous analysis of both cytoplasmic antigens and cell entry into the S/G2/M cell cycle phases. This analysis was performed on CD3(-)-activated thymocytes obtained from either highly purified CD1-CD3-CD4-CD8- cells or fresh thymus cell suspensions, stimulated with low doses of phorbol-12 myristate-13 acetate (0.5 ng/ml) and interleukin-2. On the 14th day under these culture conditions about 90% of thymocytes did not express CD3 antigen on the cell surface. CD3- cells were further purified by cell sorting, fixed in paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with Nonidet-P40. Then these thymocytes were stained by indirect immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies identifying T cell-specific molecules (CD3, CD2, CD28, TCR alpha/beta, and TCR gamma/delta) and analyzed for DNA content. Interestingly, both CD3 and CD28 antigens were detectable in the cytoplasm of most cells (greater than 80%). Further, the majority of the thymocytes which had entered the S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle (20%) expressed intracellular CD3 and CD28 molecules and reacted with the anti-beta framework beta F1 monoclonal antibody. The relationship between the appearance of CD3 and other T cell markers in the cytoplasm, the cell cycle entry, and the thymocyte development is discussed. "
88,15901100,"To assess the effectiveness and safety of the treatment with oral anticholinergic agents (Oxybutin clorure) in patients under 1 year old, and who aree carriers of high risk bladder secondary to neurological illness as well as no neurological one. Since 1989, we have indicated treatment with anticholinergic agents to 16 patients: 9 patients had neurogenic bladder secondary to: myelomeningocele (n=7) and sacrocoxigeal teratoma (n=2). Others 7 patients had non neurogenic bladder secondary to: posterior urethral valvulas (n=1), valvula-like syndrome (n=4), post-surgery of neonatal giant bladder diverticulum (n=1) and Prune-Belly syndrome (n=1). The urodinamic study was performed during the first six months of life, being ""high risk bladder"" defined according to the parameters of compliance vesical and pressure of leak at point (PER). Five of the patients showed neonatal cronic renal failure (CRF), who were treated by cutaneus temporary derivation. All patients at treatment with anticholinergic agents at a 0.2 mg/kg/day dose was established; other early adjunctive treatment prior to the closure of the urinary derivation in children with CRF(n=5); or as a part of the conservative treatment (n=3), alone or associate to intermittent bladder catheterization (IBC) (n=8). During the treatment with anticholinergic agents, the cardiac frequency was controlled by EKG registration in 6 patients, being the rest of the children clinicaly controled (skin colour, mouth dryness, cardiac frequency and intestinal function). In all the cases, the minimum duration of the treatment was one year, until the functional stabilization of the urinary tract. It is to underline the absence of secondary complications which would have caused the suspension or the reduction of the treatment at long term. Conventional studies of urologicals image and urodinamic studies, showed the stabilization of the urinary tract and also the preservation of kidney function and not only was demonstrated in those patients with oral anticholinergic agent as their unique treatment, but also in those patients who had previously been derivated. The previous vesical stabilization allowed the optimum result of subsequent corrective surgeries in five patients (ureteroneocystostomy and vesiscotomy clousure. In cases with previous derivation, the treatment with oral anticholinergic agents made easier vesicostomic clousure in the forth quarter of the first year old wih the maintenance of the vesical stability. The use of oral anticholinergic agents at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day, has resulted to be safe as well as effective in the treatment of high risk bladder in infancy those with less than one year of life. In those patients with serious dysplasia by reflux, it contributes to the preservation of kidney function, it makes easier the early desderivation and it also stabilizes in a functional way the bladder as a previous step to subsequent reconstructive surgeries.

89,3604134,"A micromethod, developed for estimation of total lipids in lymphocytes, other blood cells and body tissues, involved extraction of lymphocyte suspension with chloroform-methanol mixture, elimination of non-lipid impurities by means of the extract washing, concentration of the lipid fraction and hydrolysis of dry pellet in minimal volume of concentrated H2SO4. After reaction of the hydrolyzate with phosphorus-vanilin reagent the colour intensity of the reaction products was measured. The procedure described was sensitive and enabled to estimate lipids in minimal volume of biological material; in the lymphocyte fraction isolated from 2 ml of peripheric blood total lipids were measured with accuracy of 1-2 mg.

90,8937007,"The surgical treatment for truncal valve regurgitation is still controversial in patients with truncus arteriosus. A two-year-old girl with complaints of low weight gain and tachypnea was referred for treatment of truncal valve regurgitation. She had undergone an emergency pulmonary artery banding for severe congestive heart failure due to truncus arteriosus-type I at six months of age. This anomaly had been corrected by Barbero-Marcial method at seven months of age. But the truncal valve regurgitation started appearing at sixteen months of age with the progression of the stenosis of the pulmonary artery orifice and the right ventricular outflow tract regurgitation. Echo cardiography and cineangiography revealed the truncal valve to be bicuspid, and the regurgitation severe, especially through the prolapsed left sided cusp. The truncal valve was repaired by commissural suspension method, and the right ventricular outflow tract reconstructed with patch angioplasty of the pulmonary artery orifice and Carpentier-Edwards pericardial Bioprosthesis (19 mm). The post-operative course was uneventful. One year after, truncal valve regurgitation is small by color Doppler study. We conclude that valvoplasty is to be considered as the first choice of treatment for truncal valve regurgitation. "
