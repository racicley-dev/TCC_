0,37490085,"The large overlap between symptoms of acute sinusitis and viral upper respiratory tract infection suggests that certain subgroups of children being diagnosed with acute sinusitis, and subsequently treated with antibiotics, derive little benefit from antibiotic use. To assess if antibiotic therapy could be appropriately withheld in prespecified subgroups. Randomized clinical trial including 515 children aged 2 to 11 years diagnosed with acute sinusitis based on clinical criteria. The trial was conducted between February 2016 and April 2022 at primary care offices affiliated with 6 US institutions and was designed to evaluate whether symptom burden differed in subgroups defined by nasopharyngeal Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis on bacterial culture and by the presence of colored nasal discharge. Oral amoxicillin (90 mg/kg/d) and clavulanate (6.4 mg/kg/d) (n = 254) or placebo (n = 256) for 10 days. The primary outcome was symptom burden based on daily symptom scores on a validated scale (range, 0-40) during the 10 days after diagnosis. Secondary outcomes included treatment failure, adverse events including clinically significant diarrhea, and resource use by families. Most of the 510 included children were aged 2 to 5 years (64%), male (54%), White (52%), and not Hispanic (89%). The mean symptom scores were significantly lower in children in the amoxicillin and clavulanate group (9.04 [95% CI, 8.71 to 9.37]) compared with those in the placebo group (10.60 [95% CI, 10.27 to 10.93]) (between-group difference, -1.69 [95% CI, -2.07 to -1.31]). The length of time to symptom resolution was significantly lower for children in the antibiotic group (7.0 days) than in the placebo group (9.0 days) (P = .003). Children without nasopharyngeal pathogens detected did not benefit from antibiotic treatment as much as those with pathogens detected; the between-group difference in mean symptom scores was -0.88 (95% CI, -1.63 to -0.12) in those without pathogens detected compared with -1.95 (95% CI, -2.40 to -1.51) in those with pathogens detected. Efficacy did not differ significantly according to whether colored nasal discharge was present (the between-group difference was -1.62 [95% CI, -2.09 to -1.16] for colored nasal discharge vs -1.70 [95% CI, -2.38 to -1.03] for clear nasal discharge; P = .52 for the interaction between treatment group and the presence of colored nasal discharge). In children with acute sinusitis, antibiotic treatment had minimal benefit for those without nasopharyngeal bacterial pathogens on presentation, and its effects did not depend on the color of nasal discharge. Testing for specific bacteria on presentation may represent a strategy to reduce antibiotic use in this condition. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02554383. "
1,14726904,"Treatment guidelines developed by the Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) were originally published in 2000. These guidelines were designed to: (1) educate clinicians and patients (or patients’ families) about the differences between viral and bacterial rhinosinusitis; (2) reduce the use of antibiotics for nonbacterial nasal/sinus disease; (3) provide recommendations for the diagnosis and optimal treatment of ABRS; (4) promote the use of appropriate antibiotic therapy when bacterial infection is likely; and (5) describe the current understanding of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics and how they relate to the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy. The original guidelines are updated here to include the most recent information on management principles, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, and therapeutic options. An estimated 20 million cases of ABRS occur annually in the United States. According to National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) data, sinusitis is the fifth most common diagnosis for which an antibiotic is prescribed. Sinusitis accounted for 9% and 21% of all pediatric and adult antibiotic prescriptions, respectively, written in 2002. The primary diagnosis of sinusitis results in expenditures of approximately $3.5 billion per year in the United States. ABRS is most often preceded by a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI). Allergy, trauma, dental infection, or other factors that lead to inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses may also predispose individuals to developing ABRS. Patients with a “common cold” (viral URI) usually report some combination of the following symptoms: sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, hyposmia/anosmia, facial pressure, postnasal drip, sore throat, cough, ear fullness, fever, and myalgia. A change in the color or the characteristic of the nasal discharge is not a specific sign of a bacterial infection. Bacterial superinfection may occur at any time during the course of a viral URI. The risk that bacterial superinfection has occurred is greater if the illness is still present after 10 days. Because there may be cases that fall out of the “norm” of this typical progression, practicing clinicians need to rely on their clinical judgment when using these guidelines. In general, however, a diagnosis of ABRS may be made in adults or children with symptoms of a viral URI that have not improved after 10 days or worsen after 5 to 7 days. There may be some or all of the following signs and symptoms: nasal drainage, nasal congestion, facial pressure/pain (especially when unilateral and focused in the region of a particular sinus), postnasal drainage, hyposmia/anosmia, fever, cough, fatigue, maxillary dental pain, and ear pressure/fullness. Physical examination provides limited information in the diagnosis of ABRS. While sometimes helpful, plain film radiographs, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging scans are not necessary for cases of ABRS. The most common bacterial species isolated from the maxillary sinuses of patients with ABRS are  The increasing prevalence of penicillin nonsusceptibility and resistance to other drug classes among  These guidelines apply to both adults and children. When selecting antibiotic therapy for ABRS, the clinician should consider the severity of the disease, the rate of progression of the disease, and recent antibiotic exposure. The guidelines now divide patients with ABRS into two general categories: (1) those with mild symptoms who have not received antibiotics within the past 4 to 6 weeks, and (2) those with mild disease who have received antibiotics within the past 4 to 6 weeks or those with moderate disease regardless of recent antibiotic exposure. The difference in severity of disease does not imply infection with a resistant pathogen. Rather, this terminology indicates the relative degree of acceptance of possible treatment failure and the likelihood of spontaneous resolution of symptoms—patients with more severe symptoms are less likely to resolve their disease spontaneously. The primary goal of antibiotic therapy is to eradicate bacteria from the site of infection, which, in turn, helps (1) return the sinuses back to health; (2) decrease the duration of symptoms to allow patients to resume daily activities more quickly; (3) prevent severe complications such as meningitis and brain abscess; and (4) decrease the development of chronic disease. Severe or life-threatening infections with or without complications are rare, and are not addressed in these guidelines. Prior antibiotic use is a major risk factor associated with the development of infection with antimicrobial-resistant strains. Because recent antimicrobial exposure increases the risk of carriage of and infection due to resistant organisms, antimicrobial therapy should be based upon the patient’s history of recent antibiotic use. The panel’s guidelines, therefore, stratify patients according to antibiotic exposure in the previous 4 to 6 weeks. Lack of response to therapy at ≥72 hours is an arbitrary time established to define treatment failures. Clinicians should monitor the response to antibiotic therapy, which may include instructing the patient to call the office or clinic if symptoms persist or worsen over the next few days. The predicted bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of antibiotics in adults and children has been determined according to mathematical modeling of ABRS developed by Michael Poole, MD, PhD, based on pathogen distribution, resolution rates without treatment, and in vitro microbiologic activity. Antibiotics can be placed into the following relative rank order of predicted clinical efficacy for adults: 90% to 92% = respiratory fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), ceftriaxone, high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (4 g/250 mg/day), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (1.75 g/250 mg/day); 83% to 88% = high-dose amoxicillin (4 g/day), amoxicillin (1.5 g/day), cefpodoxime proxetil, cefixime (based on  "
2,35884010,"The aim of the current study is to observe how different pediatric drugs and tooth brushing affect the color stability of different esthetic restorative materials. Three restorative materials (composite, compomer, and glass ionomer cement (GIC)) were each used to produce 72 specimens (10 mm × 2 mm). The specimens were divided into six groups and immersed in distilled water and five different pediatric drugs (amoxicillin, ibuprofen, ventolin, paracetamol, and multivitamins). Each group was divided into two subgroups (brushed and non-brushed). Over the course of two weeks, the specimens were agitated for one minute every eight hours. Color changes in all the specimens were evaluated using a spectrophotometer at 1 and 2 weeks. GIC showed a change in color that was significantly greater than that in all the other materials in each solution, except for those in amoxicillin. After a period of 1 to 2 weeks, the most noticeable change in color was detected in the amoxicillin composite and amoxicillin GIC unbrushed groups, and after 2 weeks, a significant difference was found in the ventolin GIC unbrushed group. The color stability of the restorative materials used in pediatric dentistry can be influenced by using popular liquid pediatric medications. GIC was the least color-stable material when subjected to liquid medications. "
3,38117645,"The long-term use of pediatric medications can lead to discoloration of dental restorations, which affects their durability and longevity. The present in vitro study evaluated the effects of commonly used pediatric medications on the color stability of a conventional and a bulk-fill composite resin. For this study, 80 disc-shaped specimens of each composite were prepared in molds with a diameter of 6 mm and thicknesses of 2 or 4 mm (n = 40 per thickness per material). A spectrophotometer was used to evaluate the baseline color of the specimens in the International Commission on Illumination L*a*b* color space. Each specimen was immersed separately in a container holding 1 of 8 liquid medications (n = 5 per thickness per medication): amoxicillin/clavulanate, clarithromycin, cephalexin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, levetiracetam, multivitamin, or albuterol. After the container was shaken for 2 minutes, the specimen was removed from the medication and stored in artificial saliva. The cycle was repeated every 8 hours for 1 week. The color measurements were repeated after 1 week of immersion cycles, and the overall color change (ΔE*) was calculated; a value of ΔE* > 3.3 was considered clinically perceptible. The data were analyzed with 1-way and 2-way analyses of variance as well as the Levene test and Games-Howell post hoc test (P < 0.05). All specimens displayed clinically perceptible color changes after exposure to medications commonly used by children. The mean color change in the 4-mm bulk-fill composite resin group was significantly greater than that in all other groups (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in color change based on the immersion drug for either of the composites (P > 0.05). The study findings show that exposure of composite resin to certain commonly used pediatric drugs causes color changes that are clinically perceptible. "
4,31249178,"Various liquid drug formulations are prescribed to the children. Frequent use of these drugs can result in staining of dental restorations, affecting their longevity and durability. This study aims to evaluate the effect of different pediatric drug formulations on color stability of various esthetic restorative materials. Three different restorative materials namely composite resin, Zirconomer Improved, and conventional glass ionomer cement (GIC) were used to prepare total 120 (40 from each) disc-shaped specimens having dimensions 12 mm × 1.5 mm. The specimens of each material were divided into five experimental groups (n = 8) through stratified random sampling technique and were immersed in five different liquid medications: Group 1 - amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, Group 2 - metronidazole, Group 3 - cephalexin, Group 4 - ibuprofen, and Group 5 - ibuprofen + paracetamol. All samples were agitated for 2 min and cycle was repeated eight hourly for 1 week with intermittent pH cycling to simulate conditions similar to the oral environment. Color stability of all specimens was evaluated using spectrophotometer. One-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc HSD test were used for statistical analysis. Results obtained revealed that Δ E* (color difference) elevation was significantly low with GIC (P < 0.001) and high with composite for all five groups. Amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and metronidazole group showed highest color stainability among all groups. GIC showed better color stability with all drug formulations. The highest color alteration was observed in composite resin, whereas zirconia reinforced GIC showed color stability lesser than GIC but better than composite. "
5,35262822,"Amelogenin (AMELX) and ameloblastin (AMBN) are crucial for enamel formation, and interruptions in the production of these proteins may cause enamel defects. We investigated how prenatal environmental factors (chronic stress, bisphenol A (BPA), amoxicillin, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) affect AMELX and AMBN production of ameloblasts. Fifteen pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four experimental groups and a control group. Chronic-stress group rats were exposed to a 12:12 light/light cycle (LL) from day E18 until delivery. BPA group rats were orally administered 5 μg/kg BPA daily from day E1 until delivery. Amoxicillin group rats were injected 100 mg/kg amoxicillin daily from day E18 until delivery. LPS-infection group rats were injected 125 μg/kg bacterial LPS once on day E18. Seven pups from the control group and ten pups from the experimental groups were euthanized on P10. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Gomori's one-step trichrome staining (GT) and incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to AMELX and AMBN, to evaluate staining intensity at ameloblast stages. The surface morphology was evaluated with a stereomicroscope. AMELX (p = 0.008, p = 0.0001, p = 0.009) and AMBN (p = 0.002, p = 0.001, p = 0.0001) staining of all groups were significantly lower than that of the control group in the secretory, transitional, and maturation stages. Abnormal enamel matrix formation was observed in the H&E and GT staining sections of all experimental groups. Yellowish coloration of the amoxicillin group was observed in morphologic evaluation. "
6,27147292,"♦ OBJECTIVES: Assess the stability of several antibiotics in peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions under common conditions of use in pediatrics, particularly in automated PD. ♦ METHODS: Amoxicillin, cefazolin, cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, cotrimoxazole, tobramycin, vancomycin, and the association of ceftazidime + vancomycin and ceftazidime + tobramycin, were tested in 3 different PD solutions: bicarbonate/lactate solution with 2 glucose concentrations (Physioneal 1.36 and 3.86%; Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, USA) and an icodextrin-containing solution (Extraneal; Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, USA). Concentrations were those recommended in guidelines for the treatment of peritonitis in pediatrics. Physioneal bags were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours, whereas Extraneal bags were stored 12 hours at room temperature (22 ± 2°C) and then 12 hours at 37°C. Drug concentrations were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Each measure was taken in triplicate. Stability of antibiotics was defined as less than 10% degradation of the drug over time. ♦ RESULTS: Cefazolin, cotrimoxazole, tobramycin, and vancomycin were stable under studied conditions. Ceftazidime was stable 24 hours in icodextrin, 12 hours in Physioneal 1.36% and 6 hours in Physioneal 3.86%. The association of tobramycin or vancomycin did not influence the stability of ceftazidime. Cefepime and amoxicillin were stable 6 h, 4 h, and 8 h in Physioneal 1.36%, 3.86% and Extraneal, respectively. The stability of imipenem was very low: 2 h in Physioneal and 6 h in Extraneal. Moreover, an increasingly yellow coloration was observed with the use of imipenem, whereas no color change or precipitation occurred in other bags. ♦ CONCLUSION: Cefazolin, tobramycin, cotrimoxazole, and vancomycin are stable in PD solutions up to 24 hours and can be administered in the PD bag for the treatment of peritonitis, even in automated PD under studied conditions. However, amoxicillin, cefepime, ceftazidime, and imipenem must be used with caution due to their lack of stability. "
7,2000275,"Even though a variety of adverse effects caused by sweeteners, flavorings, and dyes in susceptible individuals have been reported, there is no good single reference with information about these substances in pediatric antimicrobials. Data on sweeteners, flavorings, and dyes in 91 antimicrobial preparations were collected. Sucrose was present in 74 (85%) of 87 preparations, followed by saccharin in 30 (34%) preparations. Mannitol, lactose, and sorbitol were each present in 7 preparations. None of the preparations were free of sweeteners. Thirty-four (37%) of 91 preparations did not specify the flavoring content. While cherry was the most common flavoring used, there were 25 other flavorings. Thirteen different dyes and coloring agents were used in these antimicrobials. Red dye no. 40 was present in 45% of preparations. Tables detailing sweeteners, flavorings, and dyes in different groups of antimicrobials (amoxicillin, ampicillin, cephalosporins, erythromycin, penicillins, sulfonamides, and others) and adverse effects reported with these inert ingredients are presented. These tables should be helpful to physicians in selecting an antimicrobial containing a different sweetener and/or dye when an adverse reaction occurs. "
8,37736952,"Neonatal osteomyelitis (OM), although exceptionally rare, has been linked to detrimental sequel, as diagnosis in the early stages is challenging and any delay in treatment can lead to disturbance in skeletal growth. In pediatric OM the most commonly grown bacteria is Staphylococcus aureus followed by group A Streptococcus (GAS). Notwithstanding, sepsis-induced coagulopathy is a well-known entity in children and adults, still sepsis-associated thrombosis is sparsely observed. we present a case of a newborn with GAS associated OM and thrombosis. A term neonate on the 11th day of life was referred to our NICU due to right (R) lower limb edema, cyanosis and core temperature up to 39 °C. Late onset sepsis was suspected and started on vancomycin and amikacin. A colour Doppler scan showed thrombosis of the R common femoral vein. The neonate started on iv unfractionated heparin. Ampicillin was added given positive for GAS blood culture. An MRI on the 5th day of admission, showed evidence of thrombosis resolution. On the 14th day of admission, a bone Tc99 scan showed evidence of OM of R femur. Antibiotic treatment switched to amoxicillin per os. The management was restricted to anticoagulant therapy with low molecular weight heparin for 3 months and antibiotic therapy for 6 months without surgery intervention and the patient recovered and discharged at 42 days of age. Early diagnosis and treatment of neonatal osteomyelitis can prevent bone destruction. Sepsis-associated thrombosis is barely observed during osteomyelitis, yet it should be considered as an emerged case requiring prompt treatment. "
9,24862714,"Antibiotic pastes are used for disinfection in regenerative endodontic procedures. This study evaluated the crown discoloration induced by various antibiotic pastes including the mixture of metronidazole and ciprofloxacin with minocycline, doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefaclor. Seventy extracted bovine incisors were sectioned to obtain a standardized root length of 10 mm above the facial cementoenamel junction. After pulp tissue removal, irrigation with sodium hypochlorite and the placement of temporary filling material and cotton pellet were performed from the apical aspect. The specimens were then randomly divided into 7 groups (n = 10 for each group), and each group received the following antibiotic paste fillings: no filling (control group), calcium hydroxide, double antibiotic paste (DAP), triple antibiotic paste (TAP) with minocycline, TAP with doxycycline, TAP with amoxicillin, and TAP with cefaclor. Spectrophotometric readings were obtained on the buccal surfaces of the crown on day 1 to week 3 after filling, and the ΔE value was calculated. Data were analyzed with 2-way analysis of variance and the Tukey post hoc tests (P = .05), and the human perceptibility threshold was set to 3.7. TAP with minocycline, doxycycline, and cefaclor induced more coronal discoloration compared with the control group (P < .05). The control, calcium hydroxide, and DAP groups showed no color changes exceeding the perceptibility threshold at all time points. The results indicated that all antibiotic pastes, except DAP, induced crown discoloration. "
10,12728112,"Otitis media is 1 of the most frequent diseases of early infancy and childhood and 1 of the most common reasons for children to visit a physician. In the past 2 decades, there has been a substantial increase in the diagnosis of otitis media worldwide. In the United States, 93% of all children have had at least 1 episode of acute otitis media (AOM) by 7 years of age. Otalgia is the hallmark of AOM. Most affected children either complain of earache or manifest behavior that the parents interpret as indicating ear pain. Treatment of the ear pain early in the course of AOM decreases both parental anxiety and the child's discomfort and accelerates the healing process. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and tolerability of naturopathic versus traditional treatment for the management of otalgia commonly associated with AOM in children. The study was designed as a double-blind trial in an outpatient community clinic. A total of 171 children who were aged 5 to 18 years and had otalgia and clinical findings associated with middle-ear infection were studied. The children were randomly assigned to receive treatment with Naturopathic Herbal Extract Ear Drops (NHED) or anesthetic ear drops, with or without amoxicillin. On enrollment, the children were assigned by computer-numbered randomization to receive NHED (contents: allium sativum, verbascum thapsus, calendula flores, hypericum perfoliatum, lavender, and vitamin E in olive oil) 5 drops 3 times daily, alone (group A) or together with a topical anesthetic (amethocaine and phenazone in glycerin) 5 drops 3 times daily (group B), or oral amoxicillin 80 mg/kg/d (maximum 500 mg/dose) divided into 3 doses with either NHED 5 drops 3 times daily (group C) or topical anesthetic 5 drops 3 times daily (group D). A double-blind design was used, and all ear drops were placed in identical bottles. Treatment was initiated by the nurse in all cases. A single physician (M.S.) evaluated and treated all of the patients included in the study and recorded all of the data. The presence or absence of ear pain was assessed over 3 days with a visual analog scale. Ear pain was assessed by a specially devised observational instrument based on previous reports. One side of the instrument consisted of a linear numbered scale, from 1 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), and a corresponding color scale, ranging from blue to dark red. The reverse side contained a scale of 5 facial expressions, ranging from broad smile (no pain) to a sad and crying face (worst possible pain), and a corresponding color scale, ranging from blue to dark red. There were no significant between-group differences in patient age or gender, degree of fever, main symptoms, associated symptoms, and severity or laterality of acute otitis media. Each group had a statistically significant improvement in ear pain over the course of the 3 days. Patients who were given ear drops alone had a better response than patients who were given ear drops together with amoxicillin. Results were better in the NHED group than in the controls. Nevertheless, the findings indicated that the pain was mostly (80%) self-limited and could be explained simply by the time elapsed. The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines recommend topical medications as the first line of treatment for ear pain in the absence of systemic infection or serious underlying disease. Because no evidence was found that systemic antibiotics alone improved treatment outcome, if antibiotics do not change the natural course of otitis media, then the main goal of treatment, as in the present study, should be to alleviate the ear pain. The alternative, naturopathic herbal extract medications, may offer many new possibilities in the management of ear pain associated with AOM. Primary care physicians should be aware that at least 10% of their patients may have tried 1 or more forms of alternative/complementary medicine before presenting for consultation. As it was widely reported in the medical literature, these herb, these herbal extracts have the potential to meet all of the requirements of appropriate medication that could be routinely used in the pediatric patient, namely in vitro bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal activity against common pathogens, immunostimulation ability, antioxidant activity, and anti-inflammatory effects. They are also well-absorbed with good penetration into the tissue surrounding the tympanic membrane. They have been found to enhance local immunologic activity. Finally, herbal extracts are well-tolerated (owing to their long elimination time), easy to administer, and less expensive than the new antibiotics. There are no documented side effects. On the basis of our findings that the group with the most significant treatment effects (NHED with topical anesthetic) explained only 7.3% of the total pain reduction, we propose that sometimes the general practitioner or pediatrician needs to give the human body a chance to repair itself. Nevertheless, if the physician believes that there is an indication for some treatment, especially if the parents are anxious, then a local treatment such as one used in our study might be adequate. This study suggests that in cases of ear pain caused by AOM in children in which active treatment, besides a simple 2- to 3-day waiting period, is needed, an herbal extract solution may be beneficial. Concomitant antibiotic treatment is apparently not contributory. "
11,38664350,"Colour stability is important in the long-term aesthetic success of restorative materials and is affected by both internal and external factors. Internal discolourations are due to the properties of the restorative materials. External discolourations can be associated with frequent consumption of food and beverages and the use of suspensions or syrups containing colourants/additives. Fluoride varnish application has an important place in preventive dentistry. The purpose of the research was to examine the protective effect of fluoride varnish application on the colour change on polyacid-modified composite resin restorative materials caused by the use of various paediatric drugs. Two hundred ten discs were prepared from polyacid-modified composite resin material and divided into two groups: flouride varnish was applied to one group and flouride varnish was not applied to the other group. The groups were further divided into seven subgroups and the samples were kept in artificial saliva, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, cefuroxime axetil, clarithromycin, paracetamol, ibuprofen, and iron supplement drug solutions. The colour change values of the discs were measured using a spectrophotometer device before immersion in the drug solutions and on the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th days after the immersion. The obtained data were calculated and statistically evaluated using IBM SPSS V23 software. It was found that the application of fluoride varnish in the iron supplement drug group prevented the colour change of the polyacid-modified composite resins for 28 days. In the amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, cefuroxime axetil, and paracetamol groups, the fluoride varnish did not prevent colour change in the polyacid-modified composite resin restorative materials at the end of the 14th day. It is thought that fluoride varnish application may be beneficial as a preservative in the colour change of polyacid-modified composite resins due to the use of various paediatric drugs, and this protective feature may be effective for a specific period of time.

12,8745021,"During a 13-month period ending in January, 1995, we obtained 159 samples of middle ear exudate through tympanocentesis (n = 155) or acute spontaneous otorrhea (n = 4) from 151 children enrolled in therapeutic trials of acute otitis media in a pediatric practice in Northern Virginia. Their ages ranged from < 1 to > 6 years of age (mean, 35 months; median, 22 months). Precise diagnostic criteria for acute otitis media always included bulging outward of all or part of the eardrum, opacification of the eardrum regardless of color and impaired mobility to positive and negative pressure via the pneumatic otoscope. Bacterial pathogens were isolated from middle ear fluid in 95% of these children: Streptococcus pneumoniae was recovered from 61 (37%); Haemophilus influenzae from 45 (27%); Moraxella catarrhalis from 41 (25%); Group A streptococcus from 6 (4%); Staphylococcus aureus from 4 (2%); and no growth or microbes of uncertain significance from 8 (5%). Six of the patients had mixed bacterial cultures; 2 of the 6 had at least one ampicillin-resistant bacteria, and a third had 2 ampicillin-resistant bacteria. Eight patients who failed to improve with antimicrobial treatment had a second tympanocentesis performed or developed spontaneous drainage; on that follow-up culture 3 of 8 cultures had different microorganisms; and 5 of the 8 bacterial specimens were resistant to ampicillin or penicillin. Twenty-one percent of the S. pneumoniae strains recovered from the middle ear were resistant to penicillin. Sixty-two percent of the H. influenzae and 98% of the M. catarrhalis isolates were resistant to ampicillin. Overall bacteria resistant to penicillin or ampicillin were recovered in 54% of middle ear fluid from 46 patients who had received a beta-lactam antibiotic in the preceding month as well as in 57% of middle ear fluids from 105 patients who had not. The empiric use of amoxicillin for treatment of acute otitis media should be reexamined in our community particularly in those who appear ill, have a high fever or have severe unremitting otalgia. "
13,18447664,"Cefdinir is an extended-spectrum, third-generation cephalosporin that may be used for treatment of acute otitis media in patients allergic to penicillin. When administered with iron-containing products, including infant formulas, cefdinir or one of its metabolites may bind to ferric ions, forming a nonabsorbable complex that imparts a reddish color to the stool. We describe a 9-month-old infant with failure to thrive and acute otitis media who developed an erythematous maculopapular rash during treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate. His antibiotic therapy was changed to cefdinir. Five days into a 10-day course of therapy, the infant's mother brought him to the pediatric clinic and reported the appearance of red stools. He had no associated gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, abdominal pain, or diarrhea). His hematocrit and hemoglobin level were normal, and Clostridium difficile antigen studies and tests for species of Shigella, Salmonella, and Camphylobacter as well as ova and parasites were all negative. Cefdinir was discontinued, and his stools returned to normal within 48 hours. Three weeks later, he again received cefdinir for recurrent otitis media. Red stools reappeared 48 hours later, were determined to be guaiac negative, and resolved within hours of drug discontinuation. During both occurrences of red stools, the infant had been breastfed and was receiving supplemental feedings with an iron-containing infant formula. In the product labeling of cefdinir, this adverse event is described as a consequence of the drug-drug interaction; however, it is not listed in the adverse drug reaction section of the labeling. As such, one may miss the association between cefdinir and reddish stools when investigating this event as a potential adverse reaction to cefdinir. When using the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale to assess causality in our patient's case, this adverse drug reaction was determined as highly probable. As this infant had been breastfed, the use of a supplemental iron-containing infant formula was not identified as a potential contributing factor until the second occurrence of red stools. Health care professionals should review the entire product labeling, including the drug-drug interaction section, when investigating a potential adverse drug reaction. With the recent approval of generic formulations of cefdinir, clinicians should be aware of this drug-drug interaction with iron-containing products to prevent unnecessary alarm by parents and caregivers, as well as costly medical evaluations for gastrointestinal bleeding.

14,19530341,"A 5-year-old boy was admitted to our center with a major complaint of bilateral hearing loss for 2 days. He was diagnosed with acute immune thrombocytopenic purpura 3 months before the admission and treated with high-dose methylprednisolone 2 months ago. Physical examination revealed wet purpura in the oral mucosa, serous nasal discharge, multiple petechiae and ecchymosis of the lower lip. Otomicroscopic ear examination revealed the presence of bilateral hemotympanum. The patient denied head trauma, ear pain, fever, hypertension and medications, including salicylates. The patient received high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone because of low platelet count and wet purpura for 7 days and oral prophylactic amoxicillin-clavulanate for 14 days. The onset of the response to corticosteroids was rapid, and significant hematologic improvement was observed within a few days. The 2-week follow-up examination revealed intact tympanic membranes with normal color and mobility, and the patient restored normal hearing. In this patient, hemotympanum developed rapidly, and no predisposing cause other than immune thrombocytopenic purpura was found. However, presence of a serous nasal discharge may be a sign of viral upper respiratory tract infection. Therefore, it can be speculated that sneezing or coughing might have caused bilateral hemotympanum by increasing the middle ear pressure abruptly. We would like to emphasize that bleeding may occur in unusual sites and, unlike in healthy people, may cause bizarre symptoms in patients with bleeding diathesis. Hemotympanum can be considered among the indications to start treatment in patients with acute immune thrombocytopenic purpura. "
15,22295658,"We present a retrospective study of our paediatric patients affected by pilonidal disease over the last 5 years. In all cases a broad excision of the pilonidal tissue was made, without colour signing the different incision sites and primary closure of the defect with no drainage. Using this technique we treated 20 adolescents (15 girls and 5 boys) of ages between 12 and 15 years (average age 13.3 years) and body mass index between 17 and 33 (mean BMI 26.4 kg/m2). Mean hospitalisation time was 1.45 days. Preoperative antibiotherapy with Amoxicillin-clavulanic was administered to 55% of patients and continued over the first postoperative week. We had four cases with recurrence of the disease (25%) (two of these with two recurrences), which we treated with three primary closures on the midline and three by flattening the cleft. In 2 cases with dehiscence of the wound we allowed treatment by secondary intention. No flaps or marsupialisation were attempted in any case. In all cases the result was aesthetically satisfactory, with maintenance of the intergluteal fold. In our series we have succeeded in undertaking primary closure of the defect after pilonidal resection without any excessive tension. This treatment enables a rapid return to a normal routine. We considered it important to undertake surgery that maintained the intergluteal fold, especially in patients with a short-term evolution of the disease, reserving flattening the cleft, closure by secondary intention, or primary closure by inserting flaps only for cases of recurrent disease; those with long-term evolution; or patients with complex lesions prior to surgery. Nutritional support to reduce overweight is very important in many patients. "
