0,26677512,"Following dietary exposure to fructose, sucrose, or sorbitol, untreated hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is characterized by metabolic disturbances (hypoglycemia, lactic acidemia, hypophosphatemia, hyperuricemia, hypermagnesemia, hyperalaninemia) and clinical findings (nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distress; chronic growth restriction / failure to thrive). While untreated HFI typically first manifested when fructose- and sucrose-containing foods were introduced in the course of weaning young infants from breast milk, it is now presenting earlier, due to the addition of fructose-containing nutrients in infant formulas. If the infant ingests large quantities of fructose, the infant may acutely develop lethargy, seizures, and/or progressive coma. Untreated HFI may result in renal and hepatic failure. If identified and treated before permanent organ injury occurs, individuals with HFI can experience a normal quality of life and life expectancy. The diagnosis of HFI is established in a proband with suggestive metabolic disturbances and clinical findings following dietary exposure to fructose, sucrose, or sorbitol and either biallelic pathogenic variants in"
1,36471989,"There are many kinds of pharmaceutical preparations for children in China, which are generally divided into oral solid preparations and oral liquid preparations. Solid preparations, such as microtablets, pellets, dispersible tablets, and fine granules, have become the development trend of pediatric drugs. Liquid preparations mainly include syrup, suspension, oral solution, and drops. The poor taste and the treatment of drugs in children of different ages are the key factors affecting the efficacy, safety, and compliance of pediatric drugs. To reduce the risk caused by the fluctuation of blood concentration and improve the oral compliance of pediatric drugs, it is urgent to develop new techniques for granulation and flavor maskingto improve the poor taste of solid preparations. For liquid pre-parations with poor taste, the flavor correction technique should be used. This paper summarized the new pharmaceutical techniques for granulation and flavor masking, and it was found that sustained/controlled-releasegranules, fine granules, and chewing solid mini-tablets became the mainstream of oral solid preparations for children. Generally, multiparticle preparation, coating, microencapsulation, and other granulating techniques were involved in these preparations. Granulation and flavor masking are closely related and synergetic. Flavor masking techniques mask the bitter taste of Chinese medicine from four aspects, including confusing the brain taste, changing the compounds, reducing the exposure of bitter molecules to bitter receptors in the mouth, and numbing the taste cells to increase the threshold of bitter perception. At present, the main drugs for children on the market mainly inhibit the oral release of bitter drugs. "
2,15035653,"To compare the flavor and taste preference of two acid-inhibitory therapies in healthy children aged between 5-11 years. A single-site, single-blind, taste test trial was conducted in which 111 children participated after parental consent. One teaspoonful (5 mL) of lansoprazole delayed-release oral suspension (strawberry-flavored) and ranitidine oral syrup (peppermint-flavored) were provided to each child with a 10-minute break between samples. Children tasted the sample, swished it in their mouth for 10 seconds, and then expectorated the sample. Spring water and crackers were used to clear the palate between samples. After each sampling, children were observed for facial expressions and asked to rate their degree of liking of each sample based on a 5-point facial hedonic scale (5=like it very much, 1=dislike it very much). Likes, dislikes, and product preference were recorded. Of the 56 female and 54 male children who tasted both samples, 95% (105/110) preferred lansoprazole. Taste and flavor were the most often cited reasons for preferring lansoprazole (61 and 17 children, respectively) while three children preferred the flavor of ranitidine oral syrup. Lansoprazole received a higher mean liking rating compared with ranitidine (mean liking scores of 4.1 and 2.2, respectively). There was no significant difference in the preference for lansoprazole between age groups and gender with the degree of liking scores ranging between 3.5-4.4. Forty-two children disliked the texture of the lansoprazole oral suspension, citing the granules (31/110), thickness (7/110), or consistency/texture (4/110), specifically. After sampling both products, 95% of children preferred the flavor and taste of the strawberry-flavored lansoprazole delayed-release oral suspension compared with the peppermint-flavored ranitidine oral syrup.

3,31611144,"Taste is a crucial factor that determines the palatability of the oral dosage form and patient compliance. The aim of this work was to evaluate the organoleptic excipients in oral antibiotics for pediatric use marketed in Brazil. The information was obtained from the GuidetoPharmacy, a reference for the pharmaceutical trade. The analysis included dosage forms for oral administration and drugs and their combination with antibacterial action. After this survey, we identified the constitution of the flavoring, sweetening, and coloring agents of each medicine. The results are presented in a descriptive form. Twelve drugs or associations are distributed in 70medicines. Oral suspension was the most common pharmaceutical dosage form. Sweeteners were sucrose, sodium saccharin, and sodium cyclamate. All the coloring agents observed are synthetic and the most frequent ones were yellow twilight no. 6, yellow tartrazine no. 5, and red ponceau 4R. The presence of two or more types of flavorings per medicine was observed. Antibacterials use coloring agents, flavorings, and sweeteners to facilitate the administration of medicines for children, using up to six different substances per formulation. No natural coloring agent was observed, demonstrating an issue to be explored in the future. It is important to note that, although necessary, these excipients are responsible for a high incidence of allergic reactions in children. "
4,36634740,"Non-compliance, dosing inaccuracy, choking risk, flavour, and instability, are some of the issues associated with paediatric, oral dosage forms - tablets, capsules, solutions, and suspensions. Orally disintegrating drug carriers, a dosage form with growing interest, are thought to overcome several of the challenges associated with these conventional formulations by rapidly disintegrating within the buccal cavity without the need for water. This review serves as an up-to-date report on the various types of orodispersible delivery systems, currently being developed or commercialized, by detailing their characteristics, manufacturing processes, and applications in the paediatric population. Mentioned are orodispersible tablets, films, wafers and lyophilisates, mini-tablets, capsules, granules, electrospun fibers and webs. Also highlighted are the choice of excipients, quality control requirements, and expected pharmacokinetics of orally disintegrating drug carriers concerning the paediatric population. Overall, orodispersible formulations, particularly tablets, films, and lyophilisates/wafers, have shown to be a valuable addition to medication administration in minors, thus the execution of more targeted research and development activities is expected to lead to enhanced paediatric care and outcomes.

5,38345529,"Belumosudil is a selective rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 2 inhibitor in clinical use for the treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease. The current tablet formulation may be inappropriate for children or adults with dysphagia and/or upper gastrointestinal manifestations of chronic graft-versus-host disease. This study (NCT04735822) assessed the taste and palatability of oral suspensions of belumosudil, evaluated the relative bioavailability of an oral suspension versus the tablet formulation, and characterized the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of an oral suspension. Addition of sweetener and/or flavor vehicle improved the taste. Relative bioavailability of 200-mg doses of the oral suspension and tablet in the fed state was similar for belumosudil and its metabolites (KD025m1 and KD025m2), but absorption was faster with the oral suspension (median time to maximum concentration: 2 vs 3 hours). Administration of the oral suspension with food increased exposure compared with fasted administration, with maximum observed concentration being increased by 16% and area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last measurable concentration (AUC "

Amiodarone hydrochloride is an antiarrhythmic drug used to treat supraventricular tachycardia. However, there are currently no commercial pediatric forms available to treat young patients. Various oral formulations were previously reported in the literature, but the concentration was lower than the doses prescribed in clinical practice (a loading dose of 500 mg/m2/day for 7-10 days followed by a maintenance dose of 250 mg/m2/day). The objective of this study was to develop an oral liquid formulation of amiodarone hydrochloride at an optimal concentration for use in children and to evaluate its physicochemical and microbiological stability. No commercial suspension vehicle was used, allowing the choice of excipients. Compounding was performed using hydroxypropylmethylcellulose as thickener, potassium sorbate preservative, citric acid/sodium citrate buffer, sodium saccharin as a , and a strawberry flavoring agent. A concentration of 40 mg/mL was selected based on a 5-year compilation of prescribed doses. Analyses performed were the following: visual and microscopic inspection, testing for antimicrobial preservation, osmolality and pH measurements, quantification of amiodarone hydrochloride by a stability-indicating liquid chromatography method, and a microbiological count. At least 95% of the initial amiodarone hydrochloride remained stable during the 60-day study period under refrigeration. All other tested parameters remained stable at 5 °C. A targeted log reduction of the microorganism inoculum by day 14 and no microbial growth by day 28 were demonstrated in the test for antimicrobial preservation. The stability of 40 mg/mL amiodarone hydrochloride oral suspension was maintained under refrigeration for 60 days before opening bottles and for 1 month after opening bottles. "
7,3691011,"The palatability of five flavored and unflavored extemporaneous carbamazepine 20-mg/mL oral suspensions was tested, and the bioavailability of the unflavored suspension relative to that of the tablet used in its manufacture was determined in a randomized, crossover study of 12 healthy volunteers. Carbamazepine 400 mg was administered with a glass of water as either 20 mL of unflavored oral suspension (20 mg/mL) or two 200-mg tablets. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive first either the tablets or the suspension in crossover fashion on two days separated by at least two weeks. Blood samples were taken just before and at various times up to 72 hours after the carbamazepine dose. Serum samples were assayed for carbamazepine content by high-performance liquid chromatography. Of five flavored and unflavored carbamazepine suspensions tested in eight volunteers, the cherry-mint formulation was the least palatable. There was no trend in preference among the remaining suspensions (banana, tutti-frutti, grape, and unflavored). Mean values of maximum serum concentration and absorption rate constant were significantly greater for the unflavored suspension (5.7 mg/L [24 mumol/L] and 0.832 hr-1, respectively) than for the tablet (4.9 mg/L [20.8 mumol/L] and 0.266 hr-1, respectively). The mean time to maximum concentration was significantly shorter after suspension administration (3.87 hours) than after tablet administration (11.8 hours). There was no significant difference in the extent of absorption of the tablet and suspension formulation as reflected by the corrected values of the area under the serum concentration-versus-time curves. The mean (+/- S.D.) bioavailability of the suspension relative to the tablet was 94.46% +/- 20.42 (range 76.35-132.72%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) "
8,36528009,"There is considerable clinical evidence that topiramate (TPM) has a high potential in the treatment of refractory and super-refractory status epilepticus (RSE, SRSE). Because TPM is only approved for oral administration, it is applied as suspension via a nasogastric tube for SE treatment. However, this route of administration is impractical in an emergency setting and leads to variable absorption with unpredictable plasma levels and time to peak concentration. Thus, the development of an intravenous (i.v.) solution for TPM is highly desirable. Here we present data on two parenteral formulations of TPM that are currently being developed. One of these solutions is using sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin (SBE-β-CD; Captisol®) as an excipient. A 1% solution of TPM in 10% Captisol® has been reported to be well tolerated in safety studies in healthy volunteers and patients with epilepsy or migraine, but efficacy data are not available. The other solution uses the FDA- and EMA-approved excipient amino sugar meglumine. Meglumine is much more effective to dissolve TPM in water than Captisol®. A 1% solution of TPM can be achieved with 0.5-1% of meglumine. While the use of Captisol®-containing solutions is restricted in children and patients with renal impairment, such restrictions do not apply to meglumine. Recently, first-in-human data were reported for a meglumine-based solution of TPM, indicating safety and efficacy when used as a replacement for oral administration in a woman with epilepsy. Based on the multiple mechanisms of action of TPM that directly target the molecular neuronal alterations that are thought to underlie the loss of efficacy of benzodiazepines and other anti-seizure medications during prolonged SE and its rapid brain penetration after i.v. administration, we suggest that parenteral (i.v.) TPM is ideally suited for the treatment of RSE and SRSE. This paper was presented at the 8th London-Innsbruck Colloquium on Status Epilepticus and Acute Seizures held in September 2022. "

10,17090745,"The stability and viscosity of preparations of a commercially available, flavored, immediate-release powder for oral suspension (omeprazole-sodium bicarbonate) during refrigerator and room temperature storage were investigated. Omeprazole-sodium bicarbonate 20-mg packets were suspended to initial omeprazole concentrations of 0.6 and 2 mg/mL, and omeprazole-sodium bicarbonate 40-mg packets were suspended to initial omeprazole concentrations of 1.2, 2, 3, and 4 mg/mL. Suspensions were stored at 4 degrees C in darkness (refrigerated) or 22-25 degrees C (room temperature) in light for one week. A third set of suspensions was stored refrigerated for one month. Omeprazole's stability was quantified after 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 168 hours in one-week samples and after 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days in one-month samples using high-pressure liquid chromatography. Viscosities of refrigerated suspensions were measured after 0, 1, and 7 days. Refrigerated suspensions retained >98% and >96% of their initial omeprazole concentrations after one week and one month, respectively. Stability of room temperature suspensions was concentration dependent. After one week, the 0.6- and 1.2-mg/mL suspensions retained 87.2% and 93.1% of their respective initial omeprazole concentrations, whereas the 2-, 3-, and 4-mg/mL suspensions retained >97% of their initial omeprazole concentrations. Suspension viscosities varied 10-fold over the concentrations studied, but all were within the viscosity ranges of other commercially available oral suspensions. Prolonged refrigeration did not increase the suspensions' viscosities. Omeprazole-sodium bicarbonate suspensions of 0.6-4 mg/mL omeprazole were stored at 4 degrees C in darkness for up to 28 days. The viscosities of refrigerated suspensions did not increase over 7 days. Except for the 0.6 mg/mL preparations, suspensions stored at room temperature in the light retained >90% of their initial omeprazole content after 7 days, despite turning yellow. "
11,33418165,"We report our experience with topiramate rectal suspensions in a single center case series of three patients <1 year of age from 2017 to 2020 who received topiramate per rectum after being placed nil per os (NPO) status at a free standing children's hospital. The objective was to describe the compounding methods and clinical outcomes of three of the youngest patients to receive topiramate rectal suspensions. All three patients received topiramate per rectum for 2-4 days. No adverse effects or increase in seizure frequency were noted. For patients placed on NPO status, there is currently no alternative to oral topiramate. No studies describe per rectum topiramate use in pediatrics. Rectal administration of topiramate is not only useful in times when patients are NPO, but may also be useful when patients on topiramate experience status epilepticus. The formulation of topiramate suppositories should be explored in the future. Until further information is available, dose substitution should be done carefully with close supervision by a healthcare provider. "
12,36986818,"L-Methionine (Met) is an essential alpha-amino acid playing a key role in several metabolic pathways. Rare inherited metabolic diseases such as mutations affecting the MARS1 gene encoding methionine tRNA synthetase (MetRS) can cause severe lung and liver disease before the age of two years. Oral Met therapy has been shown to restore MetRS activity and improve clinical health in children. As a sulfur-containing compound, Met has a strongly unpleasant odor and taste. The objective of this study was to develop an optimized pediatric pharmaceutical formulation of Met powder, to be reconstituted with water, to obtain a stable oral suspension. Organoleptic characteristics and physicochemical stability of the powdered Met formulation and suspension were evaluated at three storage temperatures. Met quantification was assessed by a stability-indicating chromatographic method as well as microbial stability. The use of a specific fruit flavor (e.g., strawberry) with sweeteners (e.g., sucralose) was considered acceptable. No drug loss, pH changes, microbiological growth, or visual changes were observed at 23 ± 2 °C and 4 ± 2 °C with the powder formulation for 92 days, and the reconstituted suspension for at least 45 days. The developed formulation facilitates the preparation, administration, the dose adjustment and palatability of Met treatment in children. "
13,29737955,"Purpose To prospectively compare small bowel distention provided by, as well as patient acceptance of, two different neutral (negative) oral contrast materials used for cross-sectional enterography in a pediatric population. Materials and Methods In this noninferiority study, 66 pediatric patients undergoing clinical computed tomographic (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) enterography were randomized to receive either a flavored beverage for neutral abdominal and pelvic imaging (Breeza; Beekley Medical, Bristol, Conn) or a low-density barium sulfate suspension. Patients were blinded to the oral contrast material administered and were asked to rate taste, texture, and their perceived health state (where 0 was very bad and 10 was very good). Ingested volume of the prescribed weight-based oral contrast material preparation was recorded. Maximum small bowel diameter was measured in all four abdominal quadrants. Mean bowel diameter as well as taste, texture, and health state scores were compared between cohorts by using t tests; proportions were compared by using Fisher exact tests. Results Thirty-three patients each received Breeza and barium sulfate suspension, respectively. No difference was found in age (Breeza, 13.5 years ± 2.6 [standard deviation]; barium sulfate suspension, 13.9 years ± 2.8; P = .49), sex distribution (15 girls each; P > .99), or health state (P = .21) between cohorts. Twenty-eight of 33 (84.8%) and 17 of 33 (51.5%) patients completed the Breeza and barium sulfate suspension preparations, respectively (P = .007). Breeza received higher scores for taste (6.1 ± 2.5 vs 2.7 ± 2.5; P < .0001) and texture (7.3 ± 2.3 vs 3.6 ± 2.9; P < .0001). No difference was found in bowel distention between Breeza and barium sulfate suspension (1.63 cm ± 0.24 vs 1.69 cm ± 0.25; P = .44). Conclusion The neutral oral contrast materials Breeza and low-density barium sulfate suspension provide similar small bowel distention. Patients receiving Breeza are more likely to ingest the entire prescribed volume. "
14,17039647,"Although numerous taste studies have compared the palatability of antibiotic suspensions, few have compared the palatability of corticosteroid suspensions. Therefore, we compared the taste of 8 commonly prescribed liquid corticosteroid suspensions with the intent to help guide prescribing practices and improve patient compliance. We conducted a randomized, double-blind study using 31 adult volunteers ages 24 to 57. All volunteers were asked to sample 8 different pediatric corticosteroid suspensions and to rate the palatability of their taste and aftertaste. The mean scores for each sample were then compared. The 8 suspensions fell into 2 groups based on their taste scores: one group with relatively high scores or more acceptable tastes (Orapred, Pediapred, and a dexamethasone suspension) and a second group with relatively low scores or less acceptable tastes (a prednisone suspension and 4 cherry-flavored prednisolone suspensions). The results demonstrate a significant difference in palatability between corticosteroid suspensions. Not only will this new information help clinicians choose between otherwise equivalent corticosteroid suspensions but, given the importance children place on taste, may improve compliance as well. "
15,32619118,"Paracetamol is a common antipyretic and analgesic medicine used in childhood illness by parents and physicians worldwide. Paracetamol has a bitter taste that is considered as a significant barrier for drug administration. This study aimed to develop an oral dosage form that is palatable and easy to swallow by pediatric patients as well as to overcome the shortcomings of liquid formulations. The paracetamol was encapsulated in beads, which were prepared mainly from alginate and chitosan through electrospray technique. The paracetamol beads were sprinkled on the instant jelly prepared from glycine, ι-carrageenan and calcium lactate gluconate. The paracetamol instant jelly characteristics, in terms of physical appearance, texture, rheology,  The paracetamol instant jelly was easily reconstituted in 20 mL of water within 2 min to form jelly with acceptable consistency and texture. The jelly must be ingested within 30 min after reconstitution to avoid the bitter taste. The palatability assessment carried out on 12 human subjects established the similar palatability and texture of the paracetamol instant jelly dosage comparable to the commercial paracetamol suspension and was found to be even better in overcoming the aftertaste of paracetamol. Such findings indicate that paracetamol instant jelly will compensate for the use of sweetening and flavoring agents as well as develop pediatric dosage forms with limited undesired excipients. "
16,15478848,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is among the most common disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, with symptoms affecting a substantial proportion of the US population on a daily basis. Heartburn and related symptoms arise from a number of pathophysiologic mechanisms, including dilated intercellular spaces, increased duration of acid reflux, greater proximal extent of reflux, and esophageal sensitivity. Chronic reflux may result in serious complications, such as esophageal erosions or ulceration, stricture, and Barrett esophagus. The goals of GERD therapy are to relieve patients' symptoms and prevent complications. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) represent the most effective treatment option for GERD, relieving symptoms, healing erosions, and maintaining a healed mucosa. Differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics among the PPIs may result in differences in intragastric pH holding time as well as the onset of symptom relief. Lansoprazole and esomeprazole produce similar degrees and onset of symptom relief, with both providing greater symptom relief as compared with omeprazole. Although manufactured as capsules containing enteric-coated granules, lansoprazole, omeprazole, and esomeprazole maintain their high level of pharmacologic efficacy when the capsule contents are emptied into soft foods or various liquids. Lansoprazole and pantoprazole also are manufactured as intravenous formulations, and lansoprazole is available as strawberry-flavored granules for oral suspension and as an orally disintegrating tablet. These alternative routes of administration are particularly beneficial in the management of acid-related disorders in infants, children, the elderly, and patients of all ages who have difficulty swallowing or are unable to swallow intact capsules or tablets and those in the critical care setting. "
17,14725575,"The management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) continues to garner vast amounts of attention among physicians who care for adults. However, there is an increasing awareness of the fact that this disease, as well as several other lifelong digestive diseases (i.e. Crohn's disease) may actually have their origins in childhood. Paediatric gastro-oesophageal reflux (GER) is likely to share a similar pathophysiology to adult GER, and mounting evidence from published preliminary data suggests a genetic susceptibility to GERD. However, further studies will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis. In children, GER has a distinct presentation from that in adults, with the diagnostic work-up based upon the patient's age as well as their presenting signs and symptoms. Like their adult counterparts, the early detection and treatment of GER in children may result in a better long-term outcome, improved quality-of-life, and a reduction in overall healthcare burden. While the treatment of GER in infants tends to be conservative (i.e. positioning during feeding, smaller feedings), its management in older children parallels that of adults and includes lifestyle changes and pharmacological therapy. However, with persistent symptoms, acid suppression is the mainstay of GERD management in both children and adults. Several studies in children have verified that acid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor is superior to histamine-2 receptor antagonists. Among the proton pump inhibitors, both lansoprazole and omeprazole have been the subject of published adult and paediatric studies demonstrating their short and long-term safety, in addition to their efficacy in a variety of oesophageal and supra-oesophageal GERD related conditions. These two proton pump inhibitors are manufactured as capsules containing enteric-coated granules that can be emptied into soft foods or liquids without compromising their pharmacological effects or pharmacokinetic properties. Lansoprazole is also available as a strawberry-flavoured suspension that is acceptable to children and as an oral disintegrating tablet. "
18,31218388,"To evaluate the ability of pediatric patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease to ingest a new oral distending agent at CT or MR enterography (CTE/MRE), and to determine the impact on small bowel (SB) distension and diagnostic confidence. The study design is that of retrospective review of pediatric patients who underwent CTE or MRE from January 2014 to June 2016. Patients ingested low-concentration barium suspension or flavored beverage containing sorbitol and mannitol. The need for nasogastric tube (NGT) administration, amount ingested, emesis, distal extent of contrast, SB distension, terminal ileum (TI) transverse dimension, and diagnostic confidence in TI disease were assessed. Three radiologists each blindly reviewed a subset of the studies. Of the total 591 scans in 504 patients, 316 scans used low-concentration barium suspension and 275 scans flavored beverage. Nearly all consumed the entire amount (97% vs. 96%). Low-concentration barium suspension exams required NGT more often (7% [23/316] vs. 1% [3/275]; p < 0.0003), and tended to have more emesis (3% [9/316] vs. 1% [3/275]; p = 0.13). Diagnostic confidence score was nearly identical (p = 0.94). Qualitative and quantitative analyses showed no difference in SB distension, except for distension of mid-ileum (flavored beverage > low-concentration barium suspension; p = 0.02). Flavored beverage exams demonstrated a slight increase in distal extent of luminal distension (p = 0.02). A new flavored beverage distends small bowel as well as low-concentration barium suspension, with decreased requirement for NGT insertion and improved distal extent of luminal distension, and without any decrease in diagnostic confidence in the presence or the absence of TI disease.

19,20637962,"Children who experience adverse reactions to cow's milk or who have diseases predisposing them to low bone mass are often prescribed a supplementation of calcium and vitamin D(3), but adherence can be poor. Age-specific preferences for different formulations may exist and at least partially explain poor compliance. The aim of this study was to compare the preference of Swiss children at risk for low bone mass for either a single-serving sachet or a suspension containing calcium and vitamin D(3). Two different commercial formulations containing calcium and vitamin D(3), either as a lemon-flavored single-serving sachet or as a banana-flavored commercial suspension, were tested for preference by means of a 5-point facial hedonic scale in children aged 4 to 7 and 8 to 11 years. A concealed random allocation procedure was used. The investigator asking about preference was blinded to the sequence. A total of 40 Swiss children (13 boys and 7 girls aged 4-7 years; 11 boys and 9 girls aged 811 years) were assessed in this study. Low bone mass risks included adverse reactions to cow's milk (n = 25); cerebral palsy (4), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (4), cystic fibrosis (3), inflammatory bowel diseases (2), anorexia nervosa (1), and osteogenesis imperfecta (1). Two children (10%) aged 4 to 7 years were not able to express their preference. Twelve of the remaining 18 children (67%) aged 4 to 7 years preferred the suspension, 5 (28%) did not express a clear preference, and 1 (5%) preferred the sachet (P < 0.002). In children aged 8 to 11 years, 15 (75%) preferred the sachet, 4 (20%) did not express a clear preference, and 1 (5%) preferred the suspension (P < 0.001). The results were not significantly different between boys and girls or between children initially presented the suspension and those initially presented the sachet. In this small study, significantly more Swiss children aged 4 to 7 years who were prescribed a supplementation of calcium and vitamin D(3) preferred a banana-flavored suspension compared with those who preferred a lemon-flavored single-serving sachet. However, significantly more children aged 8 to 11 years prescribed the same supplementation preferred the single-serving sachet compared with the suspension. "
20,36191374,"Postpartum depression (PPD) is a serious mental health concern of new mothers worldwide. In view of the particularity of puerpera, the research on pathogenesis and drug development of PPD are highly dependent on animal models. Although both maternal separation (MS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) modeling approaches have been used in PPD studies, the characteristics of the two rodent models have not been compared to explain which is more advantageous in PPD research. In this study, we applied 21-day MS and CUMS paradigms to induce mouse model of PPD and compared their differences in behavior, physiology and gut microbiota. As a result, the two models exhibited significant increases of immobility time in forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST), whereas sucrose preference index and pup weight were significantly decreased. Both displayed depression-like behaviors, and CUMS was more obvious, which demonstrated by the lower levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and higher hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis related mRNA expression (corticotropin releasing hormone, corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1) in CMUS group than that in MS group. The gut microbiota in MS and CUMS groups were significantly different in terms of the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria. In conclusion, MS model and CUMS model have different performance in behavior and physiology. The CUMS model showed more obvious parameter changes, which may be more suitable for PPD induced by various social environmental factors. "
21,25747220,"Children generally reject taking medicine which does not have a favorable shape, taste, flavor, etc. However, if a child who needs to take a medicine, rejects taking it, he might never recover from his condition. When a child is unable to take medicine orally, it is intravenously administered, and he and his caregivers then may experience stress. Syrups and suspensions are considered as favorable types of dosage forms in which to orally administer medicine to infants and children. However, they may have disadvantages such as solubility, a bad taste, portability problems or required refrigerator storage. World Health Organization (WHO) currently favors that infants and children be treated with oral solid medicines. New oral solid tablets, such as a mini-tablet, instead of liquid medicines are proposed for this group, however, there are a few reports that mini-tablets are suitable for infants and children. Palatability is one of the main elements of patient acceptability of an oral pediatric medicine. Palatability is defined as the overall appreciation of an oral medicinal product in relation to its smell, taste, aftertaste and feeling in the mouth. Design of the formulation of an oral pediatric medicine should be considered together with its palatability. "
22,34716786,"A 28-kDa polysaccharide-peptide (PGL) with antidepressant-like activities was isolated from spores of the mushroom Ganoderma lucidum. It was unadsorbed on DEAE-cellulose. Its internal amino acid sequences manifested pronounced similarity with proteins from the mushrooms Lentinula edodes and Agaricus bisporus. The monosaccharides present in 28-kDa PGL comprised predominantly of glucose (over 90%) and much fewer galactose, mannose residues, and other residues. PGL manifested antidepressant-like activities as follows. It enhanced viability and DNA content in corticosterone-injured PC12 cells(a cell line derived from a pheochromocytoma of the rat adrenal medulla with an embryonic origin from the neural crest containing a mixture of neuroblastic cells and eosinophilic cells) and reduced LDH release. A single acute PGL treatment shortened the duration of immobility of mice in both tail suspension and forced swimming tests. PGL treatment enhanced sucrose preference and shortened the duration of immobility in mice exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Chronic PGL treatment reversed the decline in mouse brain serotonin and norepinephrine levels but did not affect dopamine levels. PGL decreased serum corticosterone levels and increased BDNF mRNA and protein levels and increased synapsin I and PSD95 levels in the prefrontal cortex. This effect was completely blocked by pretreatment with the BDNF antagonist K252a, indicating that PGL increased synaptic proteins in a BDNF-dependent manner.Key points• An antidepressive polysaccharide-peptide PGL was isolated from G. lucidum spores.• PGL protected PC12 nerve cells from the toxicity of corticosterone.• PGL upregulated BDNF expression and influenced key factors in the prefrontal cortex.

23,27036645,"Specific growth factors induce formation and differentiation of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and are essential for brain development and function. Fibroblast growth factor 22 (FGF22) is important for specifying excitatory synapses during development, including in the hippocampus. Mice with a genetic deletion of FGF22 (FGF22KO) during development subsequently have fewer hippocampal excitatory synapses in adulthood. As a result, FGF22KO mice are resistant to epileptic seizure induction. In addition to playing a key role in learning, the hippocampus is known to mediate mood and anxiety. Here, we explored whether loss of FGF22 alters affective, anxiety or social cognitive behaviors in mice. We found that relative to control mice, FGF22KO mice display longer duration of floating and decreased latency to float in the forced swim test, increased immobility in the tail suspension test, and decreased preference for sucrose in the sucrose preference test, which are all suggestive of a depressive-like phenotype. No differences were observed between control and FGF22KO mice in other behavioral assays, including motor, anxiety, or social cognitive tests. These results suggest a novel role for FGF22 specifically in affective behaviors. "
24,25784402,"To develop an extemporaneous 1% benznidazole (BNZ) suspension, with masked taste and adequate stability starting from available commercial tablets. The quality of compounding was evaluated through content uniformity measurement and physical and microbiological stability evaluation, under different storage conditions during 90 days. Six batches of 1% BNZ suspension were prepared using safe excipients currently available in a galenic area of Hospital Pharmacy and then stored at 5 and 25 °C for 90 days. The BNZ content was determined by UV spectrophotometry. Physical stability was defined as the absence of colour, odour and/or flavour changes and the re-suspension of solid phase by a reasonable amount of simple 15-s shaking. The compliance with microbiological attributes of non-sterile pharmaceutical products was also evaluated. An oral liquid suspension, containing 1% of BNZ, was developed from commercially available BNZ tablets. The formulations stored for 90 days were easily re-dispersed after a simple 15-s shaking, ensuring the pouring of a liquid volume containing the desired dose of BNZ. All samples were within the acceptable range of BNZ concentration with minimal standard deviations. There were no detectable changes in colour, odour, viscosity, pH and microbial growth, complying with official quality requirements. The quality attributes were not affected by storage, room or refrigeration conditions or by the frequent opening or closing of the multidose containers. Paediatric oral liquid suspension containing 1.0% of BNZ was easily prepared starting from commercial tablets, being an interesting alternative for optimising the paediatric treatment of Chagas disease.

25,8878244,"Azithromycin, the prototypical azalide antibiotic, has a wide spectrum of activity that is characterized by resistance to beta-lactamase-producing microbes and efficacy against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae. Tissue-directed pharmacokinetics include tissue concentrations up to 100-fold higher than those in plasma and a tissue half-life of up to 4 days. Pharmacokinetics of azithromycin permits a reduction in dosage frequency and duration while maintaining efficacy comparable to that of conventional 7- to 10-day three or four times daily regimens. Dosage interval, duration of treatment, side effects and palatability can affect compliance and thus clinical outcome. Compliance among children is important in light of the high incidence of community-acquired infections such as otitis media and streptococcal pharyngitis. To compare the flavor, taste acceptability and color preference of oral antibiotic suspensions given to children. The taste and acceptability of the oral suspension form of azithromycin vs. cefixime, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefprozil, clarithromycin or loracarbef were rated by children during blinded taste tests and with acceptability/ preference questionnaires. Analysis of the mean acceptability/ preference rating from 769 children demonstrated that the flavor of azithromycin was rated significantly higher than that of cefpodoxime (4.3 vs. 2.8), cefprozil (4.0 vs. 3.4) and clarithromycin (4.3 vs. 2.7) and was comparable to that of cefixime (4.0 vs. 4.2) and loracarbef (4.4 vs. 4.5). A greater percentage of children preferred the taste of azithromycin to that of cefpodoxime (90.0% vs. 5.2%), cefprozil (63.0% vs. 33.1%) and clarithromycin (89.0% vs. 11.0%). The taste of azithromycin was not preferred to that of cefixime (39.0% vs. 53.9%) or loracarbef (36% vs. 58.5%). The efficacy and safety of azithromycin in otitis media and streptococcal pharyngitis, the simple dosing regimen and a highly palatable oral suspension formulation should increase compliance among pediatric patients and thereby improve clinical outcomes.

26,24061605,"This in situ study aimed to investigate the effect of a sugar-free antibiotic suspension containing amoxicillin and clavulanic acid on enamel hardness of human primary teeth simulating different conditions of cariogenic challenge. A crossover, partially double-blind study was conducted in three phases of 14 days each, during which 11 volunteers wore palatal devices containing six dental enamel blocks covered with plastic meshes to allow biofilm formation. Dental blocks were extraorally submitted to treatment with a 20 % sucrose solution at three different daily frequencies of exposure (0, 3, and 8 times/day), and to the antibiotic suspension or its excipients at an 8-h time interval application regimen. On the 14th day of each phase, the blocks were removed for enamel analysis (surface and cross-sectional microhardness--SMH and CSMH). The antibiotic suspension showed significant higher SMH and CSMH values than the excipients (p < 0.05; Wilcoxon), regardless of the frequency of sucrose exposure. Sucrose exposure did not account for further enamel demineralization both for antibiotic and excipients (p > 0.05; Friedman). A protective effect of the antibiotic suspension on enamel demineralization was verified because its excipients alone promoted more pronounced surface and subsurface enamel demineralization, even in the absence of sucrose exposure. The use of a sugar-free amoxicillin/clavulanic acid suspension may promote a protective effect on primary enamel demineralization probably due to its topical effect on dental biofilm. "
27,15478849,"Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is a ubiquitous disorder in infants. Whereas infants typically outgrow regurgitation by 1 year of age, the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms in those aged 3 to >18 years ranges from 1.8% to 22%. The pathophysiology of GERD in children is similar to that in adults. However, children may present with gastroesophageal and extraesophageal symptoms distinct from classic heartburn. In addition to a growing awareness of the high prevalence of the disorder, increasing evidence supports GERD being a lifelong condition in some individuals that begins in childhood. Although the diagnostic workup in children compared with adults may differ, studies suggest that the early detection and treatment of GERD in childhood may result in better adult disease outcomes, improved quality of life, and decreased overall healthcare burden. Studies of proton pump inhibitor therapy in children confirm high rates of mucosal healing and GER symptom resolution, even in children whose symptoms did not respond to H2-receptor therapy or fundoplication procedures. Omeprazole, lansoprazole, and esomeprazole are formulated as capsules containing enteric-coated granules that can be sprinkled onto applesauce or other soft foods. Lansoprazole is also formulated as strawberry-flavored granules for suspension. These as well as other alternative dosing formulations expand the ability to administer these agents to children. Moreover, long-term studies in adults and in children demonstrate that these agents are safe and well tolerated, even at the higher milligram per kilogram doses that are often required in pediatric patients because of their greater hepatic metabolic capacity.

28,39245358,"This publication is the first to report current, global, pediatric oral extemporaneous compounding practices. Complete survey responses were received from 479 participants actively involved in compounding across all the World Health Organization (WHO) regions. The survey addressed oral formulation of extemporaneous liquids, including the use of commercial or in-house vehicles, flavoring excipients, source of formulation recipes, and beyond use dates (BUDs). Over 90% of the survey participants prepared oral liquids. Solid dosage forms, comprising capsules and powder papers (sachets), were also frequently prepared for children, albeit to a lesser extent. The top 20 active pharmaceutical ingredients compounded for children, globally, were: omeprazole, captopril, spironolactone, propranolol, furosemide, phenobarbital, hydrochlorothiazide, ursodeoxycholic acid, sildenafil, melatonin, clonidine, enalapril, dexamethasone, baclofen, caffeine, chloral hydrate, trimethoprim, atenolol, hydrocortisone, carvedilol and prednisolone. Diuretics, drugs for acid-related disorders, and beta-blockers were the top three most frequently compounded classes per the WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. The principal need identified for the practice of extemporaneous compounding for children was the development of an international, open-access formulary that includes validated formulations, as well as updated compounding literature and guidelines. Furthermore, improved access to data from stability studies to allow compounding of formulations with extended BUDs. "
29,22180553,"The short-term physical and chemical stability of an oral suspension of thalidomide 20 mg/mL was studied. An oral suspension of thalidomide 20 mg/mL was prepared by emptying the contents of 12 100-mg thalidomide capsules into a glass mortar; 30 mL of Ora-Plus and 30 mL of Ora-Sweet were mixed and added to the thalidomide powder to make a final volume of 60 mL. Three identical samples of the formulation were prepared and placed in 2-oz amber plastic bottles with child-resistant caps and stored under refrigeration (3-5 °C). A 1-mL sample was withdrawn from each of the three samples with a micropipette immediately after preparation and at 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days. After further dilution to an expected concentration of 20 μg/mL with acetonitrile-methanol and then dilution with mobile phase, the samples were assayed in duplicate using stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography. Stability was determined by evaluating the percentage of the initial concentration remaining at each time point; stability was defined as the retention of at least 90% of the initial concentration of thalidomide. At least 92% of the initial thalidomide concentration remained throughout the 35-day study period. There were no detectable changes in color, odor, or pH and no visible microbial growth in any sample. An extemporaneously prepared suspension of thalidomide 20 mg/mL in a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Plus and Ora-Sweet was stable for at least 35 days when stored in 2-oz amber plastic bottles under refrigeration.

30,11819866,"To observe the effects of Qiwei Baizhu Powder (QWBZP) on rotaviral gastroenteritis in children and in animal models. Enrolled patients were divided into two groups, and one group was treated with oral rehydration solution (ORS) and the other treated with oral liquid of QWBZP. Neonate mice were orally infected with 50 microL rotavirus suspension (4 X 10(8) PFU/mL) and treated with ORS or oral liquid of QWBZP, respectively. Eighty-three cases of rotaviral gastroenteritis treated with QWBZP revealed a better efficacy than that treated with ORS (X(2)=10.87, P < 0.05). The contents of sodium and glucose as well as number of patients with positive human rotavirus antigen in stool in QWBZP group were all less than that in ORS group. In animal models, QWBZP was found effective in treating rotavirus gastroenteritis in neonate NIH mice, as compared with control groups. In QWBZP group, the mortality of infected mice was decreased by 73.3%, the body weight of infected mice was increased, the contents of sodium and glucose as well as number of mice with positive rotavirus antigen in feces were significantly reduced, and the pathological changes such as damage of small intestinal mucosa and villi were also obviously alleviated. QWBZP has effects on improving the absorptive function of small intestine, shortening the duration of diarrhea and rotavirus shedding from stool and alleviating the pathological changes of small intestine induced by rotavirus.

31,3831381,"Activated charcoal-sorbitol mixture is used for the treatment of acute poisoning. Based on our experience with healthy adults, overdosed patients and published reports, we have devised a protocol for use of this mixture in different concentrations of sorbitol. The dose is based on the size of the patient, type of poison, and the clinical status. In seriously ill adult patients, we recommend the use of 1 g/kg of activated charcoal in 4.3 ml/kg body weight of 70% sorbitol every 4 hours until the first stool containing charcoal appears. In children and ambulatory adults, the same dose of activated charcoal may be administered in 4.3 ml/kg body weight of 35% sorbitol. Patients requiring multiple doses may be administered activated charcoal as aqueous and sorbitol suspensions alternately every 2-6 hours after the first charcoal stool has appeared. The patients on multiple dose regimen, especially children, should be closely monitored for any fluid or electrolyte imbalance or depletion of essential vitamins. "
32,2511611,"The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the taste of two formulations of phenoxymethylpenicillin suspension in children. The two suspensions, designated Test and Standard, differed only in their flavouring and sweetening agents. The secondary objectives were to study age-related differences in taste perception, to evaluate the acceptability of the suspensions, and to determine patient compliance. In 319 children with acute otitis media a taste description was recorded after a single therapeutic dose. The patient's own spontaneous verbal judgements, directly after the dose intake and also 3-4 minutes later, were recorded. The parents were asked about the child's acceptance of the suspension after finalized treatment. For 214 patients compliance was calculated from the remaining amount of suspension in the returned medication bottles. The study indicated that children aged 6 years or older considered the test formulation to be better-tasting than the standard formulation. The judgements by the parents also indicated that the test suspension was more acceptable. In children below 6 years there was no significant difference between the two suspensions with regard to taste or acceptance. A high patient compliance (greater than or equal to 90%) was obtained in 88% of the patients. "
33,20815879,"Efforts to ease administration and enhance acceptability of the oral anti-malarial artemether-lumefantrine (A-L) crushed tablet to infants and children triggered the development of a novel dispersible tablet of A-L. During early development of this new formulation, two studies were performed in healthy subjects, one to evaluate the palatability of three flavours of A-L, and a second one to compare the bioavailability of active principles between the dispersible tablet and the tablet (administered crushed and intact). Study 1 was performed in 48 healthy schoolchildren in Tanzania. Within 1 day, all subjects tasted a strawberry-, orange- and cherry-flavoured oral A-L suspension for 10 seconds (without swallowing) in a randomized, single-blind, crossover fashion. The palatability of each formulation was rated using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Study 2 was an open, randomized crossover trial in 48 healthy adults given single doses of A-L (80 mg artemether + 480 mg lumefantrine) with food. The objectives were to compare the bioavailability of artemether, dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and lumefantrine between the dispersible tablet and the tablet administered crushed (primary objective) and intact (secondary objective). Study 1 showed no statistically significant difference in VAS scores between the three flavours but cherry had the highest score in several ratings (particularly for overall liking). Study 2 demonstrated that the dispersible and crushed tablets delivered bioequivalent artemether, DHA and lumefantrine systemic exposure (area under the curve [AUC]); mean ± SD AUC0-tlast were 208 ± 113 vs 195 ± 93 h.ng/ml for artemether, 206 ± 81 vs 199 ± 84 h.ng/ml for DHA and 262 ± 107 vs 291 ± 106 h x μg/ml for lumefantrine. Bioequivalence was also shown for peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of DHA and lumefantrine. Compared with the intact tablet, the dispersible tablet resulted in bioequivalent lumefantrine exposure, but AUC and Cmax values of artemether and DHA were 20-35% lower. Considering that cherry was the preferred flavour, and that the novel A-L dispersible tablet demonstrated similar pharmacokinetic performances to the tablet administered crushed, a cherry-flavoured A-L dispersible tablet formulation was selected for further development and testing in a large efficacy and safety study in African children with malaria.

34,30852650,"Oral contrast preparation is fundamental to ensuring diagnostic examination quality for magnetic resonance enterography (MRE), yet little is known about the relative palatability and tolerability of various oral contrast agents in pediatric patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease. We prospectively compared three MRE oral preparations in pediatric patients with known or suspected Crohn disease with respect to patient-reported tolerability and radiologist-determined small-bowel distension and opacification. Seventy-five pediatric patients (mean age 14.8 years, 55% female) with known or suspected Crohn disease referred for MRE were randomized to an oral preparation with a sugar alcohol-based flavored beverage (Breeza), polyethylene glycol preparation (MiraLAX), or low-concentration barium sulfate suspension (VoLumen). Patients were instructed to consume oral contrast agent (using a weight-based protocol) beginning 60 min prior to MRE imaging. Following MRE, patients completed a questionnaire regarding their oral preparation solution including: taste (1-5 scale), feeling of well-being (1-5 scale) and willingness to consume again (yes/no). Two radiologists reviewed all MRE exams and rated exams for global features (active disease, overall small-bowel distention [1-4 scale]) and features specific to individual small-bowel segments (extent of distention, maximal luminal diameter, opacification, and susceptibility artifact). Statistical methods included one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey honest difference and Fisher exact tests. The overall rate of completion of the entire prescribed contrast volume was 53% (40/75), with a significantly higher rate of completion for MiraLAX than for VoLumen (70% vs. 30%, P=0.007). Crossover to a different preparation occurred in nine patients (12%) and was significantly more frequent when the initial preparation was VoLumen versus MiraLAX (29% vs. 0%, P=0.005). Mean subjective taste ratings for both MiraLAX (3.4, P<0.0001) and Breeza (2.8, P=0.006) were superior to those of VoLumen (1.9), which persisted in the subset of patients with MRE evidence of active Crohn disease. Patients who consumed MiraLAX were more likely to be willing to drink it again compared to those consuming VoLumen (82% vs. 46%, P=0.009). Overall small-bowel distention and bowel-segment-specific metrics (distention, maximal diameter, opacification and susceptibility) did not significantly differ among groups. In pediatric patients with known or suspected Crohn disease, MiraLAX and Breeza were rated as more palatable than VoLumen, and all three preparations achieved a similar degree of small-bowel distension and opacification on MRE. Imaging centers performing MRE should stock multiple oral contrast preparations because a sizable proportion of children require more than one agent to ingest the requisite oral contrast volume. "
35,28271493,"Prednisone is a widely used anti-inflammatory for a variety of conditions. While oral liquid formulations of prednisone enable weight-based dosing, children frequently find them to be objectionable due to bitter taste. This limitation of prednisone can adversely impact patient acceptance and may result in non-compliance. Efforts to mask flavours often result in poorly controlled, heterogeneous particle distributions and can provide ineffective taste masking. The present work utilized a novel drug delivery technology developed by Orbis Biosciences, Inc., to create an oral taste-masked formulation of prednisone. The study examined the palatability of Orbis' microsphere prednisone formulation in healthy young adults (n = 24). Four test articles were used in the study including a reference formulation (Roxanne Laboratories), a control and the test formulation (Orbis) prepared in two different ways. Study participants were randomized in a crossover design. Results indicated that the test prednisone formulation was indistinguishable from the control, and both were preferable to the reference formulation in every category of palatability assessed using a validated 9-point Hedonic Scale. The data also suggested that preparing the microsphere suspension immediately before administration results in the most ideal palatability properties. In conclusion, the novel microsphere formulation technology was effective in taste-masking prednisone. "
36,19246906,"Both Candida albicans and lactobacilli are common colonizers of carious lesions in children and adolescents. The purpose of this study is to compare the velocity of acid production between C. albicans and several Lactobacillus species at different pH levels and concentrations of glucose. Washed, pure resting-cell suspensions were obtained by culturing a total of 28 oral isolates comprising the species C. albicans, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus paracasei paracasei, Lactobacillus paracasei tolerans and Lactobacillus delbrueckii lactis. Acid production from glucose was determined at a constant pH of 7.0, 5.5, 5.0 and 4.0 by repeated titrations with NaOH in an automated pH-stat system. Acid formation rates of yeast and lactobacilli proved to be similar at both neutral and low pH, while in a moderately acidic environment C. albicans produced less acid than the lactobacilli. Ion chromatographic analysis of the cell-free medium after titration revealed pyruvate to be the predominant organic acid anion secreted by C. albicans. The proportion of organic acids to overall acid production by the yeast was below 10% at neutral conditions, in contrast to 42-66% at pH 4.0. Compared to lactobacilli, yeast required a concentration of glucose that was about 50 times higher to allow acid production at half the maximum speed. Considering the clinical data in the literature about the frequency and proportions of microorganisms present in early childhood caries lesions, the contribution of oral lactobacilli as well as C. albicans to overall microbial acid formation appears to be important.

37,16732449,"Growing evidence from clinical studies suggests that mothers using xylitol gums or lozenges have decreased levels of Streptococcus mutans (SM) and do not transmit these cariogenic bacteria as readily to their children. To begin to determine mechanisms for these clinical findings and to explore potential synergism of antimicrobial combinations, we studied the effect of multiple exposures of chlorhexidine (CHX) combined with copper gluconate (CG) or zinc gluconate (ZG) followed by xylitol (XYL) on the ability of SM to adhere and form biofilms. Cell suspensions of SM were exposed two times to CHX; CG; CHX plus CG; ZG; and CHX plus ZG, and then four times to XYL. Control cells were exposed six times to water or XYL or received no treatment. For biofilm assessment, glass slides were inoculated with treated cells, and numbers of bacteria were enumerated after 48 hours of incubation. To assess the ability of SM to adhere, microtiter plate wells coated with primary S. sanguinis biofilms grown in sucrose were inoculated with treated SM, and adhesion was determined. Cells exposed to CHX-XYL combinations exhibited significant but transient inhibition of growth. The multiple-exposure regimen groups showed significant decreases in the ability of SM to form biofilms (P < 0.05). However, the CHX-XYL group exhibited a much greater effect than the other treatment groups (P < 0.001). Adhesion studies revealed that none of the multiple-exposure regimens had a significant effect on adhesion of SM to primary biofilms of S. sanguinis. We concluded that significant inhibition of SM growth and subsequent inability to grow as biofilms in the presence of sucrose occurs after a staggered exposure regimen to CHX initially and then to XYL. This may help explain the clinical data showing the decreased levels of SM in mothers treated with CHX and XYL. "
38,22478950,"Prescribing of diclofenac for children usually involves a dose different from commercially available strengths. This drug is available only as tablets, which can be divided only so many times before the dose obtained becomes inaccurate. In addition, children may have difficulty swallowing tablets. For these reasons, a compounding formula for a liquid dosage form is essential to ensure effective delivery of the drug to pediatric patients. To develop a compounding formula for diclofenac sodium and to determine the extended physical and chemical stability of this compound when stored in amber polyvinyl chloride (PVC) prescription bottles under refrigeration and at room temperature. A suspension of diclofenac sodium (10 mg/mL) was prepared from commercially available diclofenac sodium tablets, with Ora-Blend as the suspending and flavouring agent. The suspension was packaged in 60-mL amber PVC prescription bottles and stored at either room temperature (23°C) or under refrigeration (5°C). Samples were collected on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 27, 56, and 93. Chemical stability was determined using a validated stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography method. At each sampling time, the suspensions were checked for changes in appearance (i.e., colour, layering, caking, ease of resuspension), odour, and pH. The diclofenac sodium suspensions were very stable, retaining at least 99.5% of the original concentration for up to 93 days, regardless of storage temperature. There were no apparent changes in the physical appearance of the suspensions, nor were there any substantial changes in odour or pH. Suspensions of diclofenac sodium (10 mg/mL) were quantitatively stable but difficult to prepare because of the enteric coating of the tablets. Therefore, it is recommended that diclofenac powder be used for the preparation of suspensions. For pediatric use, palatability is a consideration, and a masking agent should be added before administration. An expiry date of up to 93 days is suggested. La prescription de diclofénac aux enfants requiert généralement une dose qui ne correspond à aucun des dosages disponibles dans le commerce. Ce médicament n’existe que sous forme de comprimés qui ne peuvent être subdivisés que quelques fois sans compromettre l’exactitude de la dose obtenue. En outre, les enfants peuvent avoir du mal à avaler les comprimés. Pour ces raisons, il faut une recette pour la préparation d’une forme pharmaceutique liquide afin d’assurer l’administration effective du médicament aux patients en pédiatrie. Développer une recette pour la préparation de diclofénac sodique et déterminer la stabilité physique et chimique prolongée de cette préparation lorsqu’elle est conservée dans des flacons en polychlorure de vinyle (PVC) ambré pour médicaments d’ordonnance au réfrigérateur ou à la température ambiante. Une suspension de diclofénac sodique (10 mg/mL) a été préparée à partir de comprimés de diclofénac sodique commercialisés avec l’agent de suspension et aromatisant, Ora-Blend. La suspension a été conditionnée dans des flacons en PVC ambré de 60 mL pour médicaments d’ordonnance, puis entreposée à la température ambiante (23 °C) ou au réfrigérateur (5 °C). Des échantillons ont été prélevés aux jours 0, 7, 14, 21, 27, 56 et 93. La stabilité chimique a été déterminée à l’aide d’une épreuve validée par chromatographie liquide haute performance. À chaque prélèvement d’échantillon, les suspensions ont été inspectées visuellement pour déceler tout changement d’apparence (c.-à-d., couleur, stratification, agglutination et facilité de remise en suspension), d’odeur et de pH. Les suspensions de diclofénac sodique sont demeurées très stables, conservant plus de 99,5 % de la concentration initiale pendant une période allant jusqu’à 93 jours, peu importe les conditions d’entreposage. On n’a observé aucun changement évident dans l’apparence des suspensions ni de changement substantiel dans l’odeur ou le pH des suspensions. Les suspensions de diclofénac sodique (10 mg/mL) étaient quantitativement stables, mais difficiles à préparer à cause de l’enrobage entérosoluble des comprimés. Par conséquent, il est recommandé d’utiliser plutôt le diclofénac en poudre. La palatabilité étant un facteur dont il faut tenir compte en pédiatrie, on devrait ajouter un masquant du goût avant l’administration de la préparation. La durée de conservation suggérée est de 93 jours au maximum. [Traduction par l’éditeur] "
39,6594096,"Pure cultures of representative strains of cariogenic and non-cariogenic plaque bacteria were assessed for their ability to initiate and maintain growth in broths, adjusted to initial pH levels of 7.0, 5.5 or 5.0, and to produce lactic acid from sucrose or glucose in resting-cell suspensions at pH 6.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0. Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus casei and Streptococcus faecalis showed greater acid tolerance than strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis and Actinomyces viscosus. For all species, growth initiation in broth was more acid sensitive than lactic-acid production in resting-cell suspensions. These data confirm and extend previous observations that the species of plaque bacteria most closely associated with the initiation or progression of dental caries are more aciduric than non-cariogenic species.

40,26200148,"The role of antibiotics containing sucrose on the formation of dental caries is still controversial. This study aimed to investigate the effect of two antibiotics (amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate suspension), with and without sucrose, on human dental hardness and Streptococcus mutans counts in dental biofilm. Primary tooth fragments (n=72) were coated with nail varnish leaving a window of 2.25 mm diameter. Specimens were fixed in 24-well polystyrene plates, containing BHI medium. S. mutans (clinical strains) represented the inoculum to form biofilm on the fragments for 24 h. Twelve fragments were separated for the initial count of microorganisms (baseline). The other fragments were divided into 4 groups (n=12) of treatment: G1 (Clavulin(r)), G2 (Betamox(r)), G3 (chlorhexidine 0.12%), G4 (sucrose 10%). All specimens had their self-control area (covered area). The cross-sectional microhardness (CSMH) was evaluated for each specimen. All the treated groups had a loss of hardness compared to their self-controls (p<0.05). Both drugs inhibited the S. mutans growth and promoted no CSMH difference among them. Both antibiotics eliminated all formed biofilm and did not cause mineral loss from the enamel, regardless the presence of sucrose in its formulation. "
41,14522964,"Oscillations in citric acid cycle intermediates have never been previously reported in any type of cell. Here we show that adding pyruvate to isolated mitochondria from liver, pancreatic islets, and INS-1 insulinoma cells or adding glucose to intact INS-1 cells causes sustained oscillations in citrate levels. Other citric acid cycle intermediates measured either did not oscillate or possibly oscillated with a low amplitude. In INS-1 mitochondria citrate oscillations are in phase with NAD(P) oscillations, and in intact INS-1 cells citrate oscillations parallel oscillations in ATP, suggesting that these processes are co-regulated. Oscillations have been extensively studied in the pancreatic beta cell where oscillations in glycolysis, NAD(P)/NAD(P)H and ATP/ADP ratios, plasma membrane electrical activity, calcium levels, and insulin secretion have been well documented. Because the mitochondrion is the major site of ATP synthesis and NADH oxidation and the only site of citrate synthesis, mitochondria need to be synchronized for these factors to oscillate. In suspensions of mitochondria from various organs, most of the citrate is exported from the mitochondria. In addition, citrate inhibits its own synthesis. We propose that this enables citrate itself to act as one of the cellular messengers that synchronizes mitochondria. Furthermore, because citrate is a potent inhibitor of the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase, the pacemaker of glycolytic oscillations, citrate may act as a metabolic link between mitochondria and glycolysis. Citrate oscillations may coordinate oscillations in mitochondrial energy production and anaplerosis with glycolytic oscillations, which in the beta cell are known to parallel oscillations in insulin secretion.

Granulation experiments were performed incorporating PZQ either in the powder mixture, according to the traditional way, or in the liquid phase containing wetting agents. In the powder mixture several excipients were tested: Flowlac 100 as filler, Galeniq 721 (isomalt) and Neosorb P 100 T (D-sorbitol) as sweeteners and PVP K30 as binder; while in the liquid phase Lutrol F68, Cremophor RH 40 or Tween 80 as surfactants were investigated. Different formulations loaded with 10% w/w (batches 1-8) and 20% w/w of PZQ (batches 9-13) were produced The majority of granules displayed good flow properties and uniform drug content. X-ray powder diffraction showed that PZQ remained in its original crystalline state, while differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform-infrared analysis evidenced the formation of chemical interactions among the ingredients. The solubilisation test performed in non-sink condition to reproduce the actual condition in which a child of 4 years takes the medicine revealed that granules quickly formed a very fine suspension in water (dV90=39.9 μm). Although after the granulation process the solubility of raw PZQ was not increased, adding the aqueous suspension to 500 ml of buffer solution of pH 1.5, simulating the fasted state of a child, 50% of the drug was dissolved after 30 min. After granule manipulation with milk and fruit juices, no PZQ degradation was observed during time. Finally, the selected granule formulation provided evidence to be stable even at hot and very humid climate (30°C/75% RH), at least for the examined time. "

44,10904980,"To review current knowledge regarding the mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and the tolerance of topirimate (TPM) and describe the Spanish experience of the use of this drug in 224 patients of all ages. TPM is a new drug which affects practically all the mechanisms involved in the production of epileptic seizures, which means that it is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug. After reviewing the mechanisms of action and pharmacokinetic characteristics of TPM, we consider the efficacy of the drug in 224 patients of all ages with all types of epileptic seizures. In patients of all ages with uncontrolled epileptic seizures treated with TPM, the frequency of their seizures was reduced by over 50% in 78% of the patients and the seizures were abolished in 25% of the total cases. The drug was generally well tolerated. Side-effects leading to suspension of the drug occurred in only 5% of the cases. TPM is an effective drug which is well tolerated in patients of all ages and with all kinds of epilepsy. "

46,16508183,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the bitterness-suppressing effect of three jellies, all commercially available on the Japanese market as swallowing aids, on two dry syrups containing the macrolides clarithromycin (CAM) or azithromycin (AZM). The bitterness intensities of mixtures of the dry syrups and acidic jellies were significantly greater than those of water suspensions of the dry syrups in human gustatory sensation tests. On the other hand, the mixture with a chocolate jelly, which has a neutral pH, was less bitter than water suspensions of the dry syrups. The bitterness intensities predicted by the taste sensor output values correlated well with the observed bitterness intensities in human gustatory sensation tests. When the concentrations of CAM and AZM in solutions extracted from physical mixtures of dry syrup and jelly were determined by HPLC, concentrations in the solutions extracted from mixtures with acidic jellies were higher than those from mixtures with a neutral jelly (almost 90 times higher for CAM, and almost 7-10 times higher for AZM). Thus, bitterness suppression is correlated with the pH of the jelly. Finally, a drug dissolution test for dry syrup with and without jelly was performed using the paddle method. There was no significance difference in dissolution profile. It was concluded the appropriate choice of jelly with the right pH is essential for taste masking. Suitable jellies might be used to improve patient compliance, especially in children. The taste sensor may be used to predict the bitterness-suppressing effect of the jelly. "
47,885616,"Small specimens of cariogenic plaque (CP) and non-cariogenic plaque (NCP) from the same tooth were individually dispersed in buffer, divided equally, and incubated for 45 min with [(14)C]sucrose uniformly labeled either in the glucosyl moiety or the fructosyl moiety. Sucrose metabolism was analyzed periodically during an anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C. Radiochemical techniques were devised to analyze formation of lactic acid, soluble extracellular polysaccharide, total cell-bound and insoluble products, intracellular polysaccharide, lactic acid from intracellular polysaccharide catabolism, insoluble extracellular glucan, CO(2), total volatile acids, individual volatile acids, and rates of sucrose consumption. The contribution of the glucosyl and fructosyl moieties of sucrose to each metabolic by-product was determined. All of the metabolic data were adjusted to the size of the plaque specimens as determined by colony-forming units, Coulter counter particle counts, and fluorometric protein analyses. Both types of dental plaque transformed from 70 to 80% of the consumed sucrose into lactic acid and cell-bound and insoluble products, primarily intracellular polysaccharide and extracellular glucan. Volatile acids accounted for most of the remaining by-products. CP metabolized significantly more sucrose than NCP and consequently produced significantly higher levels of each metabolic by-product. High levels of Streptococcus mutans were found in CP (averaging 40% of colony-forming units), whereas it was virtually absent in NCP. Actinomyces and S. sanguis levels were distinctly higher in NCP. NCP harbored more anaerobes and dextranase-forming microorganisms than CP. "
48,38257156,"This study aimed to compare whether a super bolus (SB) is a more efficient strategy than a normal bolus (NB) for high glycemic index (h-GI) meals in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). A randomized, double-blind, crossover trial with an allocation ratio of 1:1, registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04019821). 72 children aged 10-18 years with T1D > 1 year, and on insulin pump therapy > 3 months were included. As an intervention, they ate a h-GI breakfast for the two following days and receive a prandial insulin bolus either in the form of SB or NB. The SB group had lower glucose values during the observation time and lower glucose levels in 90th min (primary end point). The median time in range was also higher after SB. At the same time, more hypoglycemic episodes and a higher time below range were noted in this group. Almost 90% of them were the threshold value for initiating treatment for hypoglycemia and occurred near the end of observation period. More hyperglycemic episodes and over twice as much time in hyperglycemia were noted after NB. Super bolus is an effective strategy to avoid postprandial hyperglycemia but the basal insulin suspension should be longer to avoid hypoglycemia (f.ex. 3 h). "
49,8777661,"A substance commercially described as 'sugar free,' used as a sweetener for paracetamol suspension, was evaluated on measures of neonatal pain. Sixty infants were randomly allocated to receive one of four solutions before heel stab blood sampling: sterile water (placebo); 25 or 50% sucrose (weight/volume); and the commercial sweet-tasting solution. There was a significant reduction in crying time and pain score 3 minutes after the painful stimulus in all groups compared with the controls. It is concluded that this sweet-tasting solution has analgesic effects as potent as those of concentrated sucrose solutions. "
50,27406122,"Topiramate, 2,3:4,5-bis-O-(1-methylethylidene)-β-d-fructopyranose, is an anticonvulsant drug indicated in the treatment and control of partial seizures and severe tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures in adults and children. An economic and rapid high-performance thin-layer chromatographic (HPTLC) method was developed and was validated for the quantitative determination of topiramate in plasma, brain homogenate and pharmaceutical formulation. The simple extraction method was used for the isolation of topiramate from formulation, plasma and brain homogenate samples. HPTLC separation was achieved on an aluminum-backed layer of silica gel 60F254 plates using toluene : acetone (5.0 : 2.0, v/v) as mobile phase. Spots of developed plates were visualized by spraying of reagent [3.0% phenol in the mixture of ethanol : sulfuric acid (95 : 5, v/v)]. Quantitation was achieved by densitometric analysis at 340 nm over the concentration range of 1,000-5,000 ng/spot. The method was found to give compact spot for the drug (Rf: 0.61 ± 0.018). The regression analysis data for the calibration plots showed good relationship with a correlation coefficient of 0.9983. The minimum detectable amount was found to be 165 ng/spot, whereas the limit of quantitation was found to be 500 ng/spot. Statistical analysis of the data showed that the method is precise, accurate, reproducible and selective for the analysis of topiramate. The developed method was successfully employed for the estimation of topiramate in samples of equilibrium solubility study, diffusion study, microemulsion formulation and suspension formulation (developed in-house), rat plasma and rat brain homogenate samples.

51,8792942,"To evaluate the palatability of four commonly prescribed antistaphylococcal antibiotics, cloxacillin, cephalexin, erythromycin, and fusidic acid, in volunteer children. A single-blind taste test of four flavored antibiotic suspensions commonly used in the treatment of skin infections in pediatric patients. University teaching hospital. Twenty healthy volunteer children with a mean age of 9.2 +/- 2.0 SD years (range 6-12). The taste of each antibiotic was rated by the children on a 10-cm visual analog scale incorporating a facial hedonic scale. The children were also asked which antibiotic they thought tasted the best and which tasted the worst. Taste scores were as follows: cloxacillin 1.4 +/- 1.8 cm, cephalexin 6.5 +/- 2.7 cm, erythromycin 6.8 +/- 3.0 cm, and fusidic acid 6.3 +/- 2.4 cm. The taste rating of cloxacillin was significantly lower compared with the other three antibiotics (p = 0.001). Cloxacillin was chosen as having the worst taste by a significant proportion of the children (18 of 20). None of the antibiotics was clearly best tasting. Given similar effectiveness, taste considerations may be important in the decision as to which antibiotic to prescribe. The perception that cloxacillin is poor tasting to children is supported by this study, which suggests that when compliance with oral medication is critical for successful treatment, prescription of cloxacillin suspension should be avoided. "
52,18245869,"Palatability is an important factor in medication compliance for children where the acceptability of a liquid medication and its ease of administration will be greatly affected by its taste. The objective of this study was to determine which, if any of two steroid preparations, oral dexamethasone or oral prednisolone, was more palatable to children requiring steroid treatment for asthma. A single-blind taste test of 2 different steroid suspensions, liquid prednisolone (1mg/ml) versus liquid dexamethasone (1mg/ml), was conducted in children aged 5-12 years, presenting to the pediatric emergency department with an exacerbation of asthma requiring steroid treatment. Children received 2.5mls of either prednisolone or dexamethasone and were asked to score their impression of taste on a 10 cm visual analog scale. After cleansing of the palate they were given the other steroid and scored its taste. Thirty-nine children (54% male) were enrolled in the study. The mean age was 7.1 years (SD=2.0). The median visual analog scale measurement for dexamethasone was 8.2 cm (IQR= 5.2) whilst the median measurement for prednisolone was 5.0 cm (IQR= 7.3), p=0.03. Male children were more likely to prefer dexamethasone than females with a median score of 9.9 cm (IQR=3.8) for males vs. 5.9 cm (IQR=9.3) for females, p=0.005. There was no gender preference for prednisolone. There was a statistically significant difference between the taste of dexamethasone and prednisolone, with dexamethasone being the preferred steroid among pediatric patients with asthma. Males were much more likely to prefer dexamethasone than females. "
53,3333125,"Fourteen patients between the ages of 9 months and 5 years with chronic diarrhea and giardiasis were studied. Ten were eutrophic and 4 undernourished. The parasitological diagnosis was based on stool examination, a trophozoite search in duodenal aspiration, mucus adhered to mucosa and parasite identification in the intestinal biopsy material. Functional intestinal absorption studies, IgA determination in intestinal secretions and immunofluorescence studies were made. After the tests, tinidazole in suspension was administered at 60-70 mg/kg in one single oral dose. Patients were clinically re-evaluated and tests were done again after 30 days. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the changes in the functional morphologic and immunologic studies and the therapeutic efficacy of the drug in a single dose. Nine patients had good clinical results, 2 fair and 3 were not evaluated due to celiac disease. All had negative results on the parasitological tests after treatment. There was no relationship between the number of parasites and the severity of symptoms. There was no significant difference between stool fat and d-xylose at the time of diagnosis and 30 days after the administration of tinidazole. The lactose tolerance test presented a significant difference (p less than 0.05) in the disaccharide absorption after treatment. The secretory IgA revealed significantly lower value (p less than 0.01) with respect to the normal values. The immunofluorescence showed productive IgA cells in all cases. The histologic changes were: mild enteropathy (grade I) in 6 patients; moderate (grade II) in 5; and severe (grade III-IV) in 3. Improvement of the mucosa was seen in 6 patients. "
54,22748970,"A sprinkle capsule formulation containing enteric-coated, delayed-release rabeprazole granules is being developed for the treatment of children with gastrointestinal reflux disease. The granules are designed to be mixed with vehicles that facilitate delivery to children, who may be unable to swallow solid formulations. The primary objective of this study-conducted on the sponsor's initiative-was to compare the bioavailability of rabeprazole granules when mixed with various dosing vehicles (small amount of soft food or infant formula) with that of a rabeprazole suspension with inactive vehicle granules (reference), to determine which dosing vehicle can be used to deliver rabeprazole in children. Tolerability was also assessed. This single-center, single-dose, randomized, open-label, 5-period crossover study was conducted in 35 healthy adult subjects. In a randomized sequence, fasting subjects received a single dose of 10-mg rabeprazole granules per treatment period, mixed with small amounts of 1 of 5 dosing vehicles (a strawberry-flavored suspension of rabeprazole granules with inactive vehicle granules reconstituted with water, yogurt [1 tablespoon], applesauce [1 tablespoon], or infant formula [5 mL], or a suspension of rabeprazole granules with inactive vehicle tablet reconstituted with water). Full plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of rabeprazole and its thioether metabolite were collected; concentrations were estimated via LC-MS/MS. PK properties were estimated using noncompartmental methods; 90% CIs around least squares mean test-to-reference ratios were calculated for C(max) and AUC values. All treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were recorded and assessed for severity (mild, moderate, or severe) and relationship to study drug. A total of 35 subjects were enrolled (mean age, 38 years; 54.3% female; 100% white; mean weight, 71.4 kg). Thirty-four subjects completed the study. Rabeprazole and rabeprazole thioether plasma PK properties were comparable between all of the dosing vehicles tested. Median T(max) was 2.5 to 3.0 hours, and mean elimination half-life was 1.27 to 1.43 hours. The 90%CIs for the least squares mean ratios for rabeprazole and rabeprazole thioether exposure were within the 80% to 125% bioequivalence limits for all relevant comparisons. All TEAEs were of mild or moderate intensity, with headache being the most commonly reported; 21 subjects (60%) experienced TEAEs during the study. No deaths or serious AEs were reported during the study; 1 subject experienced a TEAE (urinary tract infection) that led to the discontinuation of treatment. In these healthy adult subjects, the bioavailability of rabeprazole granules was comparable between all of the dosing vehicles tested, and rabeprazole was well tolerated. Soft food suitable for young children or infant formula may be appropriate for use as dosing vehicles for rabeprazole granules. "

56,8345001,"The pharmacokinetics of fusidic acid (Fucidine, Leo Laboratories) were studied in 10 children after single oral dosing with 20 mg/kg of a new banana-flavoured paediatric suspension (titrating at 50 mg/ml). Nine blood samples were drawn from each child at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h following dosing with the antibiotic. Serum fusidic acid levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A model-independent method was used for the pharmacokinetic analysis. Results were compared with those obtained after dosing eight healthy adult volunteers with 500 mg of sodium fusidate by parenteral administration (infusion) then per os. The acceptability of the single dose was good. The terminal elimination half-life t1/2 (h) and the mean residence time (MRT, h) of fusidate were similar to those determined in healthy adults after oral dosing, i.e. 16.0 +/- 14.5 versus 16.0 +/- 3.5 and 17.7 +/- 12.1 versus 17.7 +/- 2.5, respectively. In contrast, the oral bioavailability of the suspension (Fapprox., %) was relatively low: of the order of 22.5 versus 91.0% for tablets in the healthy adult, which justifies the use of a relatively higher dose in the child. This led to the calculation of an estimated total clearance (Clest., ml/min) significantly less than that in the healthy adults, while the estimated apparent volume of distribution (Vd, litre/kg) was significantly increased (10.4 +/- 9.1 versus 21.8 +/- 2.1 and 0.73 +/- 0.53 versus 0.30 +/- 0.04, respectively). Fusidic acid is normally excreted in metabolized form (98%). The decrease in clearance could be attributed to the almost immediate saturation of liver enzymes in immature infants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) "
57,3454614,"The relative high protein and oil content of amaranth grain and its relative high-protein quality are desirable characteristics to use it as a weaning food. Such a product was prepared with A. caudatus grain. Batches were processed without previous treatment of the grain, washed with water or with a bicarbonate solution. Processing consisted of cooking at atmospheric pressure for 10 min before passing the partially cooked grain through a double drum-drier heated with steam at 70 psi, and at a velocity of 3 rpm. Batches were also processed with the addition of strawberry flavor. All samples were analyzed for damaged starch and fluid characteristics using a 10% concentration, viscosity (by the Brabender amylograph), water absorption and retention, particle size, stability of the suspension, and soluble sugars. The different samples were organoleptically evaluated for acceptability, consistency, astringency, sweetness flavor and aroma, with a 20-member panel. A product with water or with milk and sugar was also evaluated. The results indicated that washing the grain prior to cooking increased the consistency of the product and eliminated the astringency of the grain. Washing also increased water absorption and retention, soluble sugars and the coefficient of consistency. all samples exhibited 100% damaged starch and had a pseudoplastic behavior. The raw grain flour gave a viscosity of 500 UB, while for the processed samples this value increased to 1,420 UB. In general, its acceptability on the part of the panelists was high. It was good for the product with strawberry flavor, but it was even better for the sample without flavor which had been previously washed. These results, as well as others reported on nutritive value, confirm the hypothesis regarding the use of processed whole grain amaranth as a weaning food. "
58,11127082,"Topiramate (TPM) is a new antiepileptic drug with numerous mechanisms of action and whose references are almost entirely based on the results of clinical trials in selected patients. To assess the efficacy and tolerability of TPM under the usual conditions of everyday clinical practice, in a multicentric study of unselected patients with all types of uncontrolled epilepsy. In 224 patients aged from 4 months to 85 years with uncontrolled epilepsy, we assessed the evolution of their seizures and the appearance of adverse effects when TPM was given. There was a response to treatment with TPM in 78% of the patients (reduction > 50% of the frequency of seizures) and suppression of seizures in 25% of the cases. The patients responding to treatment with TPM (reduction > 50% of their seizures) included 77% of the patients with partial epilepsy, 83% of those with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, 79% with multifocal epilepsy, 54% with West's syndrome and 69% of those with other types of epilepsy. Similarly seizures ceased in 31, 13, 15, 15 and 38% of the patients respectively. Although 34% of the patients had adverse effects, suspension of the drug was only necessary in 5% of the cases. TPM is a broad-spectrum drug, effective in patients with all types of seizures and epileptic syndromes. It is well tolerated when introduced gradually. "
59,1621355,"We hypothesized that sources of activated charcoal (AC) used as a form of gut decontamination in the treatment of drug overdose may deliver significantly less charcoal than expected because of retained charcoal and sorbitol (ACS) from the treatment of 50 consecutive overdose patients were collected. Health care personnel delivering the dose were unaware of the study hypothesis. A total of 82 containers were obtained in this manner. Each container was labelled to contain 25 g AC and 48 g sorbitol. Five unused containers of ACS were obtained as controls. Each container was thoroughly cleaned, and the contents vacuum filtered and washed with 1 L of tap water. The tared filter paper and charcoal was dried for 24 h and weighed. The average amount of charcoal retained in each used container (retained) was 0.549 g (range 0.318-1.637 g). This accounts for 2.2% of the 25 g dose expected to be delivered. The average amount of charcoal found in each unused container (actual) was 25.892 g. The delivered dose (actual minus retained) may be calculated as 101.4% of the expected 25 g dose. When using this formulation of ACS there is no significant difference between the amount of charcoal given to an overdose patient and the amount ordered for gut decontamination. Despite the poor suspension of charcoal in sorbitol and the less than ideal conditions under which it is given, the patient receives an adequate dosage of AC if it is ordered. "
60,28341,"The pH values of xylitol-containing plaque suspensions of persons who habitually used xylitol and sorbitol during 3.2 to 4.5 years did not significantly differ from those observed with suspensions containing no added carbohydrates. Sorbitol produced in 22-hour incubations pH values as low as 3.9 to 5.5. The activity of plaque xylitol dehydrogenase was almost nil, whereas sorbitol dehydrogenase activity was higher. The nonacidogenic nature of xylitol in relation to plaque did not change in prolonged use of xylitol. "
61,15641497,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the lactic acid concentration in supragingival plaque from caries-active pre-school children after a short-term use of either xylitol- or sorbitol-containing chewing gums. The investigation consisted of a prospective crossover design with 10 healthy children aged 2-4 years each with at least two caries lesions within the dentine (ds > or = 2). The children were instructed to chew 6 pieces of a test or a control gum every day for a 14-day period. The test gum contained 65% xylitol and the control gum was sweetened with sorbitol. At baseline and after 14 days, salivary mutans streptococci were enumerated with a chair-side test (Strip mutans) and dental plaque was collected from the upper maxillary incisors. After a washout period of 6 weeks, the same procedure was repeated with the corresponding test or control gum. Lactic acid was determined enzymatically in glucose-challenged plaque suspensions. The lactic acid concentration was significantly reduced (p<0.05) by 22% compared with baseline following the xylitol gum regimen but was unaltered after the control gum. The levels of salivary mutans streptococci were mainly unaffected by both chewing gums. A 14-day use of xylitol-containing chewing gums, corresponding to a daily amount of 5 grams of xylitol, could diminish glucose-initiated lactic acid formation in supragingival plaque in caries-active pre-school children.

62,16995647,"Previous studies have suggested that the addition of flavored acetaminophen suspension (for example, Children's Tylenol) in the drinking water of rats may not be effective in producing postoperative analgesia because of low levels of consumption. However, these investigations neither measured analgesia nor compared the consumption by rats that had undergone surgery with that by unmanipulated rats. The present study reports that although unmanipulated rats naive to the taste of flavored acetaminophen do indeed drink significantly less of this liquid than tap water, they drank sufficient amounts of the acetaminophen-containing solution to significantly raise pain thresholds, as measured by the hot-plate test. Moreover, rats that had undergone surgery drank significantly more acetaminophen solution than did those that had no surgery. These data suggest that oral self-administration of flavored acetaminophen by rats may be an appropriate means to reduce pain. "
63,7279470,"Cariogenicity of seven commonly prescribed liquid medications was studied. Sucrose content of the medications ranged from 0 to 70 gm/100 ml. Initial pH and buffering capacity were measured and found to vary widely among the medications. Intraoral microbial plaque pH changes were determined at intervals for 30 minutes following an oral rinse with each medication. These data were compared with plaque pH changes caused by rinsing with an established cariogenic challenge, 10% sucrose solution. Decreased plaque pH was caused by each medication tested. The extent and duration of the pH drop varied among the medications. Patterns of the pH curves are discussed in relation to sucrose content, endogenous pH, and buffering capacity of the medications. Intraoral pH response to several medications equaled or exceeded that seen when sucrose rinses alone were given. The findings are discussed in relation to dental caries-producing potential of long-term therapy with liquid medications, and two cases are presented that implicate liquid medications as a major etiologic factor leading to rampant dental decay. It is concluded that health practitioners should be aware of the sucrose content of pediatric medications. Patient education to ensure adequate oral clearance following each dose of medication is an essential first step in minimizing the risk of dental decay posed by long-term therapy with liquid medications.

Because of the hypodense intestinal contrasting images the artifacts of the images induced by the bordering surface could be reduced, the condition of fullness of the intestine and the judgement of the intestinal wall improved. The parenchymatous organs and points of abdominal lymph nodes could be defined and judged more easily through the hypodense contrasting images. On the whole the picture quality of the computed tomography of the young child could be increased with the hypodense solution of mannitol. "

Cell volume was measured electronically. Relative volume of cells (rel vol: cell vol/isotonic vol) within 1 min of L-Ala (20 mM) addition increased (1.10 +/- 0.03, P less than 0.005), but by 5 min there was no difference between cells in L-Ala or 20 mM D-Ala (0.95 +/- 0.02). Cell shrinkage after maximal swelling was greater with L-Ala than with D-Ala (14 +/- 4 vs. 2 +/- 1%, P less than 0.01). Initial swelling generated by L-Ala required extracellular Na+ (P less than 0.02). Volume increased 30 s after D-Glc (20 mM), and cells were larger than cells treated with L-Glc (1.04 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.95 +/- 0.01, P less than 0.001); subsequent cell shrinkage was complete in 2 min (8 +/- 2%, P less than 0.05). Swelling generated by methyl alpha-D-glucoside was prevented by 0.1 mM phloridzin (P less than 0.05). RVD after D-Glc swelling was prevented by inhibitors of K+ channels, 5 mM Ba2+ (P less than 0.001), 100 microM quinine (P less than 0.005), or 25 mM TEA (P less than 0.02), but the same inhibitors completely prevented L-Ala swelling.

67,7259258,"Five patients with sucrase-isomaltase deficiency, and one patient with primary glucose-galactose malabsorption had no increases in breath hydrogen excretion after oral sucrose or glucose. Anaerobic incubation with sugars of stool suspensions from 5 patients with primary sugar malabsorption produced by trace of hydrogen (17 microliter) in only one, while those from 13 or 14 controls produced a mean hydrogen volume of 640 microliter under similar conditions. Altered bacterial metabolism is a probable explanation. Breath hydrogen excretion did increase appreciably in 2 of these patients after oral lactulose showing that hydrogen excretion may vary according to the substrate. Therefore, observation of breath hydrogen excretion after lactulose is not recommended as a means of predicting false-negative breath tests with other sugars. The hydrogen breath test is not a reliable mean of diagnosing primary sugar malabsorption in children. "
68,3217851,The effect of lysozyme-inactivation on L(+)-lactic acid (LA) production in dental plaque suspensions was evaluated. From 10 children 24-h plaque was collected and lysozyme activity inhibited by addition of goat antiserum to human lysozyme. Acid production was stimulated by addition of glucose. The results showed significantly increased LA levels (50-150%) in lysozyme-inactivated plaque suspensions from 8 of the subjects compared to untreated controls. The increase in acid production activity was not related to plaque lysozyme levels. The findings indicate that the presence of lysozyme may be limiting on acid production in the early dental plaque.
