0,33248659,"Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in blood samples can be used as useful biomarkers to diagnose various human diseases. This study describes the potential of a paper-based sensor array for detecting leukemia using blood VOCs. Blood samples were collected from 59 new leukemia cases and 47 healthy cases as a control group. Each blood sample was divided into two parts; one for a laboratory test and the other was used in our study. Samples were mixed with heparin and then transferred to a sterile container, and a sensor was stacked on its cap. This sensor array contains 16 nanoparticles deposited on a sheet of hydrophobic paper in a 4 × 4 array format. Containers were stored in an oven at 60 °C for 4.5 h. Then, the image of sensors was recorded by a scanner and compared to the image before exposing the blood vapor. The sensor responses were subjected to different multivariate statistical methods to develop models that discriminate between control and leukemia samples. The interaction of nanoparticles with the volatile metabolome of blood caused aggregation and consequently changing in the color of nanoparticles. The color changes resulted in a specific pattern for blood samples with leukemia, which is different from those obtained from healthy specimens. The discrimination analysis was approved by pattern recognition methods such as principal component analysis with 97% accuracy. Among 59 patients, the mean age was 6.02 ± 4.55 years (range 1-16 y). The mean total response was 652.83 ± 117.02. The rock curve showed an accuracy of 96% for classifying patients from the control group. The logistic regression model showed that 93.6% of healthy and 93.2% of patients were classified correctly by using this method. These statistics agree with the classification results obtained by principal component analysis. For every 5000-unit increase in platelet count, the chance of leukemia decreased by 9%. Additionally, the chance of being categorized as a patient decreased by 10% for every 20-unit increase in total response. The electronic nose using VOC's of blood is a non-invasive and inexpensive tool for detecting new cases of leukemia with high sensitivity and specificity. Platelet count is an essential para-clinical parameter determining the total response of the sensors. Follow up studies with a larger sample size are warranted to elucidate its clinical applicability. "
1,31335589,"Large numbers of perinatally HIV-infected (PHIV) children are aging into adolescence. We examined cognitive and behavioral outcomes in a longitudinal cohort of Asian youth. We followed up 231 PHIV, 125 perinatally HIV-exposed, uninfected (HEU), and 138 HIV-unexposed, uninfected (HUU) adolescents (aged 10 years and older), matched by age/sex, in Thailand and Cambodia for 3 years. Executive function was assessed with Children's Color Trails Tests 1 and 2 (CCTT-1 and -2), the design fluency test, and the verbal fluency test. Working memory (Freedom from Distractibility Index) and processing speed index were assessed using WISC-III. Visual memory was assessed by design memory and design recognition subtests of the Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning (WRAML-2) and behavioral problems using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Generalized estimating equations examined adjusted odds ratios of cognitive impairment (Z-scores ≥2 SD below age-adjusted means of the HUU group) and CBCL T-scores in the borderline-clinical range (T-Scores ≥60) in PHIV and HEU versus HUU youth, adjusting for ethnicity, household income, and caregiver characteristics. The median age at enrollment was 13.8 years, with 58% women and 63% Thai participants. PHIV youth had >86% virological suppression and significantly higher impairment rates on CCTT-1 and -2 tests, design fluency test, verbal fluency tests, design memory, and CBCL internalizing and externalizing problems. Results were mostly similar between HEU and HUU groups, apart from higher impairment rates on CCTT-1 and internalizing problems in HEU. Asian adolescents with PHIV remain at risk of cognitive and mental health problems despite HIV treatment. Selective risks are observed among HEU youth. "
2,28254547,"Peripheral aneurysm and pseudoaneurysm of an artery is a well-recognized but rare phenomenon in children. We report a case of an axillary artery aneurysm in a 2-year-old boy with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. Definitive surgical treatment with left axillary artery aneurysm exclusion and bypass with greater saphenous vein graft were performed. To our knowledge, this is the only axillary artery aneurysm ever reported in a child. "
3,11029091,"Liver tumors are a relatively rare pathologic condition in children and young patients. The aim of the present study was to categorize the sonographic (US) and color Doppler results of liver tumors in these patients. We retrospectively reviewed the US findings of 23 such cases: malignant tumor (13 cases)-hepatoblastoma (four cases), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; four cases), and hepatic metastasis (five cases); benign tumor (10 cases)-hepatocellular adenoma (four cases), focal nodular hyperplasia (two cases), mesenchymal hamartoma (two cases), cystadenoma (one case), and hemangioendothelioma (one case). There was no specific US findings for each tumor type. HCC usually developed on a normal liver and was imaged as multiple nodules. Color Doppler US helped in differentiating multiple metastatic nodules (hypovascular) from multiple HCC nodules (hypervascular). Presence of intratumoral cystic areas was usually suggestive of benign tumors. Follow-up US was useful for detecting small nodules in high-risk groups (congenital biliary atresia, glycogen storage disease). Color Doppler US helped in diagnosing portal thrombus or intratumoral shunt. Although there were no highly specific findings, US and color Doppler results contributed, to a certain degree, to the diagnosis of liver tumors in children and young adults by showing intratumoral cystic areas or vascularity.

4,39116483,"The Chinese Haemophilia Individualized Prophylaxis Study (CHIPS), which was launched in 2016, reported a significant reduction in haemarthrosis over a one-year study. However, its long-term efficacy requires verification. This paper summarizes the clinical outcomes of 18 severe haemophilia A (SHA) patients who completed one year on the CHIPS and 3 more years of follow-up. Clinical follow-up was based on the CHIPS protocol (from July 2018 to July 2021). Escalation was based on index joint bleeding, and serial ultrasound (greyscale and colour Doppler) examinations of the index joints (both sides of the ankles, knees and elbows) were conducted every 6 months via a scoring system. A total of 18 SHA patients completed the 3-year study. Fifteen patients dropped out due to the financial crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. The median age was 5.4 (range 4.3-6.9) years. A significant reduction in haemarthrosis was achieved, with mean annual bleeding rates reduced from 18.9 ± 2.8 to 1.7 ± 0.4 (p < 0.001), annual joint bleeding rates from 3.1 ± 0.7 to1.2 ± 0.3 (p < 0.028). 5 out of 8 target joint resolved. Sixteen doses were escalated. At study exit, the heterogeneous treatment outcomes of the SHA boys were 5 at step 4 (20-25 lU/kg, every other day), 10 at step 3 (15-20 IU/kg, 3×/week), 2 at step 2 (10-15 lU/kg, 3×/week) and 1 at step 1 (10-15 lU/kg, 2×/week). The mean FVIII consumption was 2964 IU/kg/year, with savings. The quality of life improved, with Canadian Haemophilia Outcomes-Kids Life Assessment Tool (CHO-KLAT, Chinese Version 2.0) scores ranging from 68.8 to 78.8. There was no change in the ultrasound score. Our follow-up data on the 18 SHA boys after completing one year on the CHIPS verify the long-term efficacy of the CHIPS for haemarthrosis reduction, joint health preservation, improvement in the quality of life of the boys and cost savings.

5,34814111,"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global problem and a diagnostic challenge, especially in pediatrics. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical, microbiological, radiological, and histopathological data of TB in children. A 7-year retrospective and descriptive cohort study that included 127 patients under 18 years of age with diagnosis of active TB was conducted from 2011 to 2018 in a pediatric hospital. Tuberculosis was microbiologically confirmed using Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining, culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a total of 94 (74%) cases. Thirty-three cases were defined as probable TB based on tuberculin skin test result and epidemiological evaluation. The TB forms found were lymph node (39.3%), bone (15.7%), lung (13.6%), and meningeal TB (8.6%). The most common symptoms were fever (48.8%) and adenopathy (45.6%). History of contact was established in 34.6%. Positive ZN staining (sensitivity 30%) and culture (sensitivity 37%) were found in 29% and 37.7% of subjects, respectively. About 64.5% depicted abnormal chest X-ray. Xpert MTB/RIF® (PCR) was positive in 9.4% and biopsy was compatible in 52.7% of these samples. It is fundamental to have laboratory and epidemiological evaluation that support the diagnosis of the disease in children and thus, define its management; since, in most cases, early microbiologic confirmation is lacking.

6,21409475,"The Mulliken and Glowacki classification (1982) differentiated vascular anomalies into two groups based on their endothelial characteristics: hemangiomas and vascular malformations. Vascular anomalies are localized defects of the vasculature that affect a limited number of vessels in a restricted area of the body. These defects are secondary to errors in vascular morphogenesis. Depending on the type of vessel involved, the vascular malformation group was subdivided into high-flow (such as arteriovenous malformation and arteriovenous fistula) and low-flow lesions (such as venous and lymphatic malformations). Depending on the type of lesion, the location and degree of involvement and the clinical effect, different types of treatment would be required. For the purpose of this review, we concentrate solely on vascular malformations: the clinical features, genetics, diagnosis, and current treatment options. "
7,34431006,"Gray-scale and color/power Doppler ultrasound (US) are the first-line imaging modalities to evaluate the spleen, gallbladder and pancreas in children. The increasing use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) as a reliable and safe method to evaluate liver lesions in the pediatric population promises potential for imaging other internal organs. Although CEUS applications of the spleen, gallbladder and pancreas have been well described in adults, they have not been fully explored in children. In this manuscript, we present an overview of the applications of CEUS for normal variants and diseases affecting the spleen, gallbladder and pancreas. We highlight a variety of cases as examples of how CEUS can serve in the diagnosis and follow-up for such diseases in children. Our discussion includes specific examination techniques; presentation of the main imaging findings in various benign and malignant lesions of the spleen, gallbladder and pancreas in children; and acknowledgment of the limitations of CEUS for these organs.

8,32404362,"Sarah Jane Whiteling was accused of fatally poisoning her husband and two children in Philadelphia in 1888. The case prompted public outrage over the appearance that Ms. Whiteling's motive was to collect life insurance. It was evident, however, that she was disturbed, raising a question of culpability. Dr. Alice Bennett, the first female physician in charge of an asylum, provided the defense with expert testimony on the defendant's mental state. Dr. Bennett, who had little forensic but much clinical experience, proposed a physiological theory of insanity among women with reproduction-related derangements. At that time, cultural ideas about ""female poisoners"" colored popular and journalistic perceptions of Ms. Whiteling. Familicide was considered unconscionable because a mother's duty was to nurture and protect her family. When Ms. Whiteling was convicted and sentenced to death, Dr. Bennett undertook a campaign for commutation. Her unsuccessful efforts to reduce culpability were followed by Ms. Whiteling's hanging in 1889, the first execution of a woman in Philadelphia since colonial times. This article recounts the Whiteling case, Dr. Bennett's involvement in it, and how it relates to what is known about familicide. It is argued here that Dr. Bennett was a pioneer in applying medical expert testimony to effect individualized mitigation. "
9,32051369,"Cochineal dyes are used as additives in various foods for the purpose of red coloration. On the other hand, although it has been reported as a causative agent of immediate allergy, most of them are adult women. We report a case of an 8-year-old boy who developed a cochineal allergy.Current disease history: He has been suffering from atopic dermatitis, bronchial asthma, and food allergies since childhood. At the age of seven, he experienced an unknown anaphylaxis reaction twice. When he was 8 years old, he ate a frankfurter containing hypoallergenic cochineal for the first time; cold sweat, intraoral discomfort, respiratory distress, and urticaria appeared throughout the body. His skin prick tests were positive, with a result of 2+to frankfurter and cochineal dyes (color value 0.1 and 0.01). In the immunoblot assay, binding of IgE antibody was observed with CC38K (the main component of cochineal) and a protein of approximately 80-200 kDa in the high molecular weight region. We report a case of anaphylaxis with hypoallergenic cochineal onset in a school-age boy. "

11,38859621,"Color encoding plays a crucial role in painting, digital photography, and spectral analysis. Achieving accurate, target-responsive color encoding at the molecular level has the potential to revolutionize scientific research and technological innovation, but significant challenges persist. Here, we propose a multibit DNA self-assembly system based on computer-aided design (CAD) technology, enabling accurate, target-responsive, amplified color encoding at the molecular level, termed fluorescence encoding (FLUCO). As a model, we establish a quaternary FLUCO system using four-bit DNA self-assembly, which can accurately encode 51 colors, presenting immense potential in applications such as spatial proteomic imaging and multitarget analysis. Notably, FLUCO enables the simultaneous imaging of multiple targets exceeding the limitations of channels using conventional imaging equipment, and marks the integration of computer science for molecular encoding and decoding. Overall, our work paves the way for target-responsive, controllable molecular encoding, facilitating spatial omics analysis, exfoliated cell analysis, and high-throughput liquid biopsy. "
12,16951569,"We evaluated the integrity of the white matter tract using diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging in children with language impairments who exhibited a structurally normal brain on conventional magnetic resonance imaging, and compared it with age-matched normal children. After generating fractional anisotropy and color-coded vector maps, fractional anisotropy values of the major white matter tracts were measured in six locations and compared between the two groups. Compared with the normal control group, the fractional anisotropy values of children with language impairments showed a statistically significant reduction in the genu of the corpus callosum, which is rarely revealed on conventional magnetic resonance images. Our results suggest that delayed maturation of the white matter plays a partial role in the pathophysiological mechanisms of language impairments. "
13,25802156,"The Broselow tape is one method for rapid weight estimation in pediatric patients undergoing resuscitation, but it does not perform equally in all populations. To date, we are unaware of any study evaluating its use in a Latin American population. To investigate the accuracy of the Broselow tape in a Mexican emergency department (ED). We conducted a prospective, observational study of children presenting to a Mexican ED. Patient weight was estimated using the Broselow tape and the estimate compared to their weight measured on a scale. Researchers were blinded to scale weight and Broselow categories. For analysis, the Broselow tape's nine color zones were divided into three weight categories. Of 815 subjects, 356 (43.7%) were female. In children weighing <10 kg, the tape tended to underestimate weight, whereas it overestimated weight in the other two weight categories. The mean percentage difference between the actual weight and the Broselow tape-predicted weight was <3% in each category, although it differed significantly across the three weight categories. Accuracy of the predicted weight to within 10% of actual weight was lowest for children weighing <10 kg, at 46.2% (confidence interval [CI] ± 6.4%), and greatest for those in the 10-18-kg weight category, at 64.1% (CI ± 5.1%). However, the correlation of color zones predicted by both methods was highest for subjects <10 kg at 64.4% (CI ± 6.1%). It was significantly lower in the other weight categories at 54.5% (CI ± 5.3) for subjects weighing 10-18 kg, and 50.1% (CI ± 6.4%) for subjects weighing >18 kg. The percentage of children for whom the color code differed by two or more categories was <4% overall and for each weight category. The Broselow tape-estimated weight was different from the scale weight by more than 10% in a substantial percentage of Mexican children. Nevertheless, the mean percentage difference was <3%, and Broselow tape color zone estimation was accurate in the majority of subjects, suggesting its use would result in clinically appropriate dosing and equipment estimations. Further research is needed to validate its use in this clinical setting. "
14,39474604,"When it comes to the adverse reactions of linezolid, people always call to mind primarily nausea, vomiting, bone marrow suppression, and so on. Few people are aware of the rare adverse reaction of teeth discoloration. We describe the case of a child affected by bacterial meningitis. After admission, a combination of ceftriaxone and linezolid was administered for anti-infection, and dexamethasone was used to inhibit inflammatory reactions. On the 5th day of treatment with linezolid, the child's teeth appeared brownish color and could not be removed with normal oral hygiene. Upon reviewing the drug instructions and literature, it was found that the discoloration of teeth is a rare adverse reaction of linezolid, which is pseudo discoloration. After stopping the medication for 28 days or up to 5 months, the normal color can be restored. There is no significant impact on the life of the patient, therefore, continue to use linezolid to complete the anti-infection course. After 14 days of anti-infection treatment, the inflammatory indicators of the child decreased to normal, and the condition was close to recovery before discharge. After stopping the medication for 28 days, the color of the teeth returned to normal. This rare adverse reaction sheds light on a previously unreported side effect of this widely used antibiotic. In our case, the discoloration of the teeth occurred earlier, updating the latent period of the adverse reaction. "
15,9000360,"Portal hypertension is a relatively uncommon pathologic condition in children and young adults in contrast with older adults. The aim of this study is to evaluate the utility of sonography and color Doppler sonography in the diagnosis of portal hypertension in children and young patients and to evaluate the sonographic pattern of each disease. We reviewed 25 such patients who were younger than 30 years old and obtained the following sonographic findings: (1) liver cirrhosis: (a) multiple intrahepatic venovenous shunts in patients with primary Budd-Chiari syndrome and (b) intrahepatic vascular narrowing and nodular coarse parenchymal texture, with multiple very-high-echo spots along the portal vein in patients with Wilson disease; (2) congenital hepatic fibrosis: marked and developed collaterals, wide periportal echogenic band, and a heterogeneous parenchymal texture comprised of multiple high echoes but without portal thrombus; and (3) extrahepatic portal thrombosis: invisible portal lumen except as an echogenic band. Sonography and color Doppler sonography are very useful in diagnosing these portal hypertensive diseases. However, there are no specific sonographic findings, and the role of sonography is limited to follow-up observation of associated secondary hepatobiliary changes in patients with congenital biliary atresia.

16,26341607,"Left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD) provides an additive or potentially alternative treatment option for patients with life-threatening cardiac channelopathies/cardiomyopathies. We sought to examine the effects of LCSD on quality of life (QOL). From November 2005 to May 2013, 109 patients who underwent LCSD were subsequently sent postoperative QOL surveys. Of 109 patients, 8 (7%) could not be contacted. Of the remaining 101 patients, 62 returned surveys (response rate 61%). There were an average of 4.1 ± 1.8 self-reported side effects immediately after LCSD. The most common anticipated side effects included unilateral hand dryness, color or temperature variance between sides of the face, and abnormal sweating. Although parent-reported pediatric physical QOL scores were lower than national norms, there were no differences in psychosocial QOL or disability scores (P = .09 and .33, respectively). QOL scores for adult patients were not significantly different from a US normative sample. Adult LCSD patients reported less disability than a US normative sample (P < .01). There was no correlation between QOL scores and the presence of anticipated side effects. However, among the subset of pediatric patients who continued to receive ventricular fibrillation-terminating implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks after LCSD, there was a correlation between their disability scores and the number of reported shocks (Spearman correlation = 0.56). The majority of patients/parents reported that they were very or somewhat satisfied with their surgery (or their child's surgery) and would definitely or probably recommend LCSD to another patient. Despite the anticipated side effects associated with LCSD, patients are satisfied with their surgery and indicate that they would recommend the surgery to another patient. "
17,18382792,"To investigate the frequency of cryptosporidiosis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ELISA and microscopy and its relationship with diarrhea. The study was prospectively performed in the Parasitology Laboratory and Pediatric Outpatient Clinic of the Research Hospital, Yuzuncu Yil University, Van, Turkey between 2004 and 2006. Stool samples were obtained from a total of 2000 children with diarrhea, 870 females, and 1130 males aging 0-15 years as study group, and 100 children of the same age were randomly selected as a control group. The flotation method was firstly carried out for all stool samples in saturated zinc sulfate solution, then staining process by modified acid-fast staining. All samples were also tested for Cryptosporidium parvum antigen by ELISA. Native-Lugol and trichrome staining were used to identify other intestinal parasites. The antigen was determined in 97 4.9% of 2000 children by ELISA, however, the oocysts were only seen in 39 children 1.95% by microscopy. Cryptosporidium spp. were not detected in the control group either by ELISA or by microscopy. We found a significant p<0.001 relationship between diarrhea and cryptosporidiosis. Other intestinal parasites were detected in 713 35.7% of 2000 diarrheic children. Cryptosporidium spp. antigen searching by ELISA in stool samples should be included for diagnosis of the disease in all hospitals. "
18,33346418,"To study the ultrasonographic manifestations and clinical features of common pediatric testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) in children. We retrospectively analyzed the laboratory, ultrasonographic and clinical data on 92 children with TGCT diagnosed in Shanghai Children's Hospital from March 2013 to January 2019, and investigated the values of the serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level and maximum diameter of tumors in the diagnosis of benign and malignant tumors using the ROC curve. Of the 92 cases of pediatric TGCT, 64 (69.6%) were pathologically confirmed as benign tumors, including 40 cases of teratoma (62.5%), 18 cases of epidermoid cyst (28.1%) and 6 cases of dermoid cyst (9.4%), and the other 28 (30.4%) as malignant neoplasms, including 26 cases of yolk sac tumor (YST, 92.9%) and 2 cases of mixed germ cell tumor (MGCT, 7.1%). Ultrasonography showed that 62.5% of the teratomas were cystic-solid mixed (25/40) and 32.5% solid masses (12/40), that 33.3% of the epidermoid cysts exhibited a typical sign of ""onion ring"" (6/18) and 22.2% that of capsular calcification (4/18), and that 42.3% of the YSTs displayed isoechoic (11/26), 30.9% hypoechoic (8/26) solid masses without calcium and 26.9% cystic anechoic lesions (7/26). Color Doppler blood flow imaging manifested abundant blood flow signals in most of the YSTs (25/26, 96.2%) but none in either the epidermoid or the dermoid cysts. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the serum AFP value was 0.985, with an optimal cutoff value of 124.2 ng/ml, and the sensitivity and specificity of AFP in the diagnosis of benign and malignant tumors were 92.9% and 93.7%, respectively. The AUC of the maximum diameter of the tumors was 0.796, with an optimal cutoff value of 2.7 cm, and the sensitivity and specificity of the maximum diameter of the tumors in the diagnosis of benign and malignant neoplasms were 57.1% and 93.7%, respectively. Ultrasonographic images have different characteristic manifestations for different pathological types of pediatric TGCT. Pediatric TGCT has a good prognosis and radical orchiectomy should be considered for the treatment of the tumors with serum AFP ≥ 124.2 ng/ml and a diameter ≥ 2.7 cm. "

21,33369054,"Ciliopathy syndromes are a diverse spectrum of disease characterized by a combination of cystic kidney disease, hepatobiliary disease, retinopathy, skeletal dysplasia, developmental delay, and brain malformations. Though generally divided into distinct disease categories based on the pattern of system involvement, ciliopathy syndromes are known to display certain phenotypic overlap. We performed next-generation sequencing panel testing, clinical exome sequencing, and research-based exome sequencing reanalysis on patients with suspected ciliopathy syndromes with additional features. We identified biallelic pathogenic variants in BBS1 in a child with features of cranioectodermal dysplasia, and biallelic variants in BBS12 in a child with the clinical stigmata of Bardet-Biedl syndrome, but also with anal atresia. We additionally identified biallelic pathogenic variants in WDR35 and DYNC2H1 in children with predominant liver disease and ductal plate malformation without skeletal dysplasia. Our study highlights the phenotypic and genetic diversity of ciliopathy syndromes, the importance of considering ciliopathy syndromes as a disease-spectrum and screening for all associated complications in all patients, and describes exclusive extra-skeletal manifestations in two classical skeletal dysplasia syndromes.

22,31587463,"Color Doppler US is a readily available imaging modality for the evaluation of liver transplants. The aim of our study was to evaluate the temporal course of color Doppler US findings in children after LTX and to investigate the effect of resolving and persisting abnormalities during follow-up on long-term outcome. All children who underwent LTX during January 2000 until December 2003 (155 LTX in 137 patients, 75 male and 62 female; mean age at LTX 4.1 ± 4.8 years; range, 0.1-16.3 years) were retrospectively evaluated. Following a predefined ultrasound protocol with prospective documentation, intraoperative, post-operative, and follow-up examinations were evaluated for color Doppler abnormalities. The time of occurrence and temporal course of the findings were recorded. Graft survival rates and graft survival times were compared. Abnormal color Doppler US examinations were noted in 98 of 155 grafts during the entire observational period (63.2%). In 57 of 98 grafts (58.2%), abnormalities were limited to the perioperative period (<30 days after LTX). Survival of grafts with transient perioperative abnormalities was similar to transplantations with regular color Doppler US examinations (graft survival rates, 80.7% vs 84.2%, P = .622; mean graft survival time, 2596.92 vs 2511.40 days, P = .67). Grafts with persisting color Doppler US abnormalities in the follow-up period (>30 days after LTX; 37/98 LTX, 37.8%) showed reduced survival compared with regular courses (graft survival rate 62.2% vs 80.7%, P = .047), indicating underlying organ-specific alterations. Standardized longitudinal evaluation during the perioperative and the follow-up period can enhance the prognostic capabilities of color Doppler US in children following LTX. "
23,32067081,"Max Nonne, an internationally renowned German neurologist, acted from 1918 to 1924 as president of the (first) Society of German Neurologists (GDN). Appointed honorary president in 1925, he held this position in the (second) German Neurological Society (DGN) until his death. Since 1961, this association has honored 16 neurologists with a commemorative medal named after Nonne. His outstanding findings in various fields of neurology are uncontested and some of them live on as eponyms (Nonne-Apelt syndrome, Nonne-Froin syndrome, Nonne-Milroy-Meige syndrome); however, recent archival studies and an analysis of individual publications deeply darkened the image of the ""grey eminence"" of German neurology. Records kept at the Hamburg State Archive prove that in a memorandum from 1941/1942 following the example of Binding and Hoche, Nonne firmly approved the killing of ""life absolutely unworthy of living"". In a report addressed to the District Court of Hamburg he attested in 1946 that many physicians charged with manslaughter acted in accordance with the regulations governing ""child euthanasia"", resulting in the withdrawal of the accusation. In a further statement from 1949 he confirmed that the killing of children and the ""euthanasia program"" during the NS era were consistent with the state of medical science. An earlier book chapter authored by Nonne immediately after World War I suggested that his social-Darwinistically colored concept of mankind was developed clearly before the Nazi era. Notwithstanding the arrangement to which he came with the new powers after 1933 and his acceptance of tributes to him by them, he repeatedly stood up for his Jewish colleagues. He was never a Nazi, nevertheless, he engaged in activities that fostered NS ""euthanasia"" going far beyond a ""mentality of approval"". "
24,17912984,"Taiwan is currently nonendemic for hepatitis A infection, but sporadic cases are reported occasionally. The presenting symptoms of acute hepatitis A (AHA) infection in children are often nonspecific and may be easily misdiagnosed as general gastrointestinal illness. We conducted this study to identify the relevant presenting symptoms and laboratory findings of AHA in children. The medical records of all patients younger than 18 years old admitted to Kaohsiung Chang Gang Memorial Hospital from July 1986 to June 2004 under the diagnosis of AHA were reviewed. There were 29 pediatric patients admitted with the diagnosis of AHA, including 16 male patients and 13 female patients. Poor appetite, malaise, abdominal pain, vomiting and fever were the leading constitutional symptoms. Jaundice and tea-colored urine were the most relevant hepatobiliary presentations. Elevation of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, direct and indirect bilirubin was common, although other hematology and biochemistry examinations were within normal limits on most occasions. There was no mortality in our series. A slightly increasing prevalence of AHA was noted over the two decades of the study period, although it was not statistically significant. Our results found that children with AHA tended to present with non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms and acute liver function deterioration. Elevation of hepatic aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase with cholestasis was common. "

The study included 16 eyes of 16 patients (14 males). Age of presentation ranged from 7 to 56 years and presenting vision ranged from 6/6 to 6/24. On OCT, increased reflectivity and obliteration of hyporeflective ellipsoid zone (EZ) and interdigitation zone (IZ) at CR region were seen. Fovea and other retinal layers were spared. On MCI, white areas due to hyperreflectance corresponding to CR were noted on individual colour reflectance channels and on composite multicolour image. In all cases, foveal reflectance pattern was unaffected. The affection of the EZ and IZ at the CR on OCT was associated with increased reflectance on individual wavelength colour channels on MCI. Foveal sparing on MCI correlated with photoreceptor layer sparing at the fovea on OCT. In 6 (38%) cases with follow-up details, normal reflectivity of EZ and IZ was noted in the region of previous CR as early as 1-week post-presentation. White coloration on multicolour image showed resolution. Foveal sparing was common and rod-dominated areas were affected in CR. Corresponding changes on MCI showed hyperreflectance areas on individual wavelength colour channels. Studies combined with photoreceptor-specific electrophysiological tests, adaptive optics imaging and histological evidences would be required in future. "
26,23294472,"Vitiligo is a disease of color loss from skin and possibly also from hair. The presence of white hair follicles is known to be a bad prognostic sign. To evaluate the possibility of repigmentation of white hair follicles after epithelial grafting. Patients with recalcitrant vitiligo with loss of hair pigment were treated using Chinese cupping blisters or ultrathin Thiersch grafting after de-epithelialization of vitiliginous patches by dermabrasion. Phototherapy was used afterward to enhance success. Repigmentation of the skin surface was obtained with as little as 1 to 2 months of phototherapy, as expected, and further follow-up of cases revealed the re-coloring of hair follicles after 4 to 11 months. Re-coloring of poliosis with vitiligo is possible but was unexpected because of the difference in mechanism and signaling required between hair bulb melanization and the surface skin. One likely mechanism to explain this change is that melanocyte stem cells are stimulated and migrate to supply hair bulbs with new mature melanocytes. Epithelial grafting of vitiligo with poliosis in hairy areas should be a treatment of choice when white hair tufts cause cosmetic disfigurement. "
27,27356847,"Stunting is a measure of chronic undernutrition, and it affects approximately 160 million children worldwide. Cognitive development of stunted children is compromised, but evidence about the association between height gain in late childhood and adolescent cognitive capacity is scarce. We aimed to determine the association between height gains at different ages, including late childhood, and cognitive capacity at 15-years-of-age. We conducted a prospective cohort study in a rural African setting in Southern Malawi. The study cohort was enrolled between June 1995 and August 1996. It originally comprised mothers of 813 fetuses, and the number of children born live was 767. These children were followed up until the age of 15 years. The anthropometrics were measured at one and 24-months-of-age and 15-years-of-age, and cognitive capacity of participants was assessed at 15-years-of-age with Raven's Coloured Matrices score, mathematic test score, median reaction time (RT) (milliseconds) and RT lapses. The associations between growth and the outcome measures were assessed with linear regression. Raven's Coloured Matrices score was predicted by height gain between 24 months and 15-years-of-age (coefficient 0.85, P = 0.03) and (coefficient 0.69, P = 0.06), but not by earlier growth, when possible confounders were included in the model. The association weakened when school education was further added in the model (coefficient = 0.69, P = 0,060). In conclusion, in rural Malawi, better growth in late childhood is likely to lead to better cognitive capacity in adolescence, partly through more school education. In light of these results, growth promotion should not only be limited to early childhood. "
28,34329507,"The neural mechanisms underlying memory encoding have received much attention in the literature. Research in adults and school-age children suggest that the hippocampus and cortical regions in both frontal and parietal areas are involved in successful formation of memories. Overall, the hippocampus has been shown to interact with fronto-parietal regions to collaboratively support successful memory encoding for both individual items as well as item details (such as the source or color in which the item was originally encountered). To date, only one study has investigated neural regions engaged during memory encoding in children younger than 8 years of age, which is unfortunate since early childhood is a period of dramatic improvement in memory. This previous study indicated that both the hippocampus and cortical regions are involved during the encoding of subsequently remembered item details (i.e., sources). However, this study reported few interactions between these regions, and it did not explore item memory at a more general level. To fill these gaps, this article reanalyzed data from the previous report, aiming to examine the neural correlates of item memory during encoding in early childhood (4-8 years) and interactions between the hippocampus and fronto-parietal regions during encoding. Consistent with research in older individuals, both the hippocampus and fronto-parietal regions were found to participate in item memory encoding. Additionally, functional connectivity between hippocampus and fronto-parietal regions was significantly related to both subsequent item memory and subsequent source memory. Taken together, these findings suggest that not only the activation of individual brain regions (hippocampus and fronto-parietal regions) but also the functional connections between these regions are important for memory encoding. These data add to the growing literature providing insight into how the hippocampus and cortical regions interact to support memory during development. "
29,1946087,"Congenital vascular birthmarks, classified as either hemangioma or vascular malformations (portwine stains), can now be cleared successfully using certain lasers. Since their introduction into medicine in the mid-1960s, several types of lasers including the argon, carbon dioxide, neodymium yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) and pulsed tunable dye lasers have been used to treat benign cutaneous vascular lesions such as portwine stains. After extensive research examining the effects of specific laser parameters on tissue, a set of parameters was identified which together selectively destroyed blood vessels in the skin. Application of this laser technique for the treatment of benign cutaneous vascular lesions, such as portwine stains, meant that it was possible to destroy only the abnormally ectatic vessels which are inherent in these birthmarks. Because of the specificity of the laser injury, only the abnormal blood vessels are destroyed and healthy adjacent structures such as epidermal pigment and dermal collagen are left intact. Thus, unwanted adverse effects such as scar formation and pigmentary abnormalities at the laser-exposed site have been minimized. Skin treated using this combination of laser parameters normalizes in color, texture and its markings, and adnexae are maintained at the treated site. Not only has this new laser treatment provided a way of removing these disfiguring birthmarks with the return of normal-appearing skin at the treated site, but the lack of adverse effects following this treatment has meant that not only adults but children of all ages can now be treated using this technique.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) "

31,10584242,"Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a mitochondrial disorder, confirmed at a molecular level 10 years ago. This had permitted better understanding of the condition. Since 1998, the Instituto de Neurología y Neurocirugía has used these techniques for the study of mutations which are considered to be the origin of the disorder. We describe the characteristics of 14 cases from 10 families with LHON and the molecular confirmation found between 1994 and 1998 in the Instituto de Neurología Neurocirugía de Cuba. We also review the few cases seen in the previous 18 years. These were from only two families. They were diagnosed on clinical grounds and in view of maternal inheritance. In 80% of the families in which the presence of primary mutations was investigated there was A117789, and in 20% A3460G. The average age of appearance was 28 years. The ages of onset were within the limits of 11 years and 48 years. There were 43% women. Two cases were considered to be sporadic. The clinical features corresponded to those described in such cases, with severe visual defects, central scotomas, very reduced colour vision and severely altered visual evoked potentials, with normal diffuse light and pattern electroretinograms. An improvement in visual acuity of 0.2 was seen in two cases. Microangiopathy, described as characteristic of the early stages of this disorder was detected in five cases, in at least one eye. The others had different degrees of optic atrophy. Two generations of one complete family, all with mutation 3460, were studied. In several families with this mutation alterations were found in the colour vision test of Farnsworth Munsell Hue 100 and also microangiospathy of the retina. "

33,12003648,"Household food insecurity is a major determinant of undernutrition, yet there is little information on its prevalence in the South African population. This paper assesses household food insecurity in South Africa using a quantitative and objective measure, known as food poverty, and provides prevalence estimates by geographic area and socio-economic condition. Secondary data analysis combining two sources: Statistics South Africa's household-based 1995 Income and Expenditure Survey; and the University of Port Elizabeth's Household Subsistence Level series, a nationally-conducted, market-based survey. South Africa. A nationally representative sample of the entire country - stratified by race, province, and urban and non-urban areas - consisting of 28 704 households. A household is defined to be in food poverty when monthly food spending is less than the cost of a nutritionally adequate very low-cost diet. The prevalence of food poverty in South Africa in 1995 was 43%. Food poverty rates were highest among households headed by Africans, followed by coloureds, Indians and whites. Higher food poverty rates were found with decreasing income, increasing household size, and among households in rural areas or those headed by females. The widespread nature of household food insecurity in South Africa is documented here. Prevalence rates by geographic and socio-economic breakdown provide the means for targeting of nutritional interventions and for monitoring progress in this field. The corroboration of these findings with both internal validation measures and external sources suggests that food poverty is a useful, objective measure of household food insecurity. "
34,17985006,"The proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA), which is the zone of flow convergence appearing on the left ventricular septal surface where flow approaching the defect accelerates, allows quantitative estimation of ventricular septal defect (VSD) flow and defect area on colour Doppler imaging. In the present study, the clinical applicability and reliability of the PISA method in assessing the amount of left-to-right shunting in patients with VSDs were evaluated. Fifty-eight patients aged 0.25 to 15 years (mean age 4.3+/-4.4 years) with VSDs were prospectively studied. Maximum PISA radius in peak systole (r), peak velocity (V(max)) and velocity time integral (VTI(VSD)) of flow through the VSD were measured. In addition, peak VSD flow (2pir(2) Nyquist limit [NL]), amount of left-to-right shunting (Qp-Qs = heart rate x [2pir(2) x NL x VTI(VSD)]/V(max)) and defect area ([2pir(2) x NL]/V(max)) were calculated. There were significant positive correlations between Qp-Qs values calculated by PISA and other spectral Doppler methods using the cross-sectional area, as well as the VTI of pulmonary-aortic (r=0.73, P<0.001) or mitral-tricuspid (r=0.58, P<0.001) flows and cardiac catheterization (20 patients, r=0.82, P<0.001). PISA-derived left-to-right-shunting discriminated moderate to large defects from small defects, which were classified according to the catheter-derived Qp/Qs ratio (2 or greater versus less than 2; P=0.001) or clinical evaluation (P<0.001). The present study demonstrated that the PISA method is a reliable semiquantitative method to determine the amount of left-to-right shunting of VSDs and to discriminate moderate to large defects from small defects. Consequently, this method may serve as a simple and useful adjunct to conventional spectral Doppler methods in the noninvasive assessment of patients with VSDs. La surface d’isovélocité proximale (SIP), soit la zone de convergence du débit qui paraît à la surface interventriculaire gauche où le débit accélère à l’approche de la communication, permet une évaluation quantitative du débit de la communication interventriculaire (CIV) et de la zone de cette communication à l’imagerie Doppler couleur. Dans le cadre de la présente étude, les auteurs évaluent l’applicabilité et la fiabilité cliniques de la SIP pour établir l’importance du shunt gauchedroite chez les patients présentant une CIV. Cinquante-huit patients de 0,25 à 15 ans (moyenne de 4,3±4,4 ans) ayant une CIV ont fait l’objet d’une étude prospective. Les auteurs ont mesuré le rayon maximal de la SIP pendant la systole de pointe (r), la vélocité de pointe (V On remarque des corrélations positives importantes entre les valeurs Qp-Qs calculées au moyen de la SIP et d’autres méthodes Doppler spectrales, à l’aide de la zone transversale, ainsi que l’IVT des débits pulmonaire-aortique (r=0,73, p < 0,001) ou mitral-tricuspide (r=0,58, p < 0,001) et le cathétérisme cardiaque (20 patients, r=0,82, p < 0,001). Le shunt gauche-droite dérivé de la SIP permettait de distinguer les communications modérées à grandes des communications mineures, classées d’après le ratio Qp/Qs dérivé du cathéter (2 ou plus par rapport à moins de 2, P=0,001) ou l’évaluation clinique (p < 0,001). La présente étude démontre que la SIP est une méthode semi-quantitative fiable pour déterminer l’importance du shunt gauche-droite des CIV et distinguer les communications modérées à importantes des communications mineures.

36,6728348,"Maternal-child nurses are part of a growing number of Americans who have had the opportunity to visit China. An increased understanding of the history and of the health care practices of the Chinese people lends itself to an examination of American values and health practices. The insight developed may aid us as we seek to understand our own health care practices for women and children and to plan for the future in health care. Reporting on a professional exchange tour of American nurses in China, this discussion recounts what was learned about the Chinese health care system, nursing system, and maternal-child health, and focuses on some insights gained into the US health care system. Before 1949, the infant mortality rate was 20% during the 1st year of life; 30-40% of children died before age 5; vernereal disease, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis, typhus, cholera, and the plague were rampant; and traditional medicine had been outlawed. When the communists came to power, efforts were made at preventive health care but the results were not impressive until the Cultural Revolution of 1965. 4 main health objectives were stressed at that time: improving access to health care for the rural areas; emphasizing prevention; emphazing Chinese traditional medicine; and making health an individual and collective responsibility. Peasants were brought in to become the nurses or physicians with minimal or no preparation or education. Since then Western-trained physicians and nurses have been reintroduced into the health care system. Since 1965 the Chinese life expectancy has increased from 40 to 70 years. Infant mortality is now 1 of the lowest in the world. Veneral disease, drug addiction, and several other epidemic diseases have been almost totally eradicted, as has malnutrition. There is at least 1 barefoot doctor in each of these ""production teams"" of 30-50 families, often supported by traditional medical assistants, health aides, midwives, nurses, and public health workers. Patients can be referred to the commune hospital and can be further referred to county hospitals for more complicated problems. Free care is provided for many people. It is within this highly organized, prevention oriented, socially conscious context of health care that maternal-child health care is deelivered. Prenatal and postpartum care begins with home visits by traditional birth attendants or ffemale barefoot doctors. At the well baby clinics the walls are hung with colorful health education posters. Family planning is probably the number 1 health concern in China, and the government stresses late marriages, free use of contraceptives, and the 1 child family. Another insight gained was the idea of harnessing manpower rather than technological power for the purpose of health. "
37,25894624,"To assess the impact of the duration and intensity of episodes of increased intracranial pressure on 6-month neurological outcome in adult and paediatric traumatic brain injury. Analysis of prospectively collected minute-by-minute intracranial pressure and mean arterial blood pressure data of 261 adult and 99 paediatric traumatic brain injury patients from multiple European centres. The relationship of episodes of elevated intracranial pressure (defined as a pressure above a certain threshold during a certain time) with 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale was visualized in a colour-coded plot. The colour-coded plot illustrates the intuitive concept that episodes of higher intracranial pressure can only be tolerated for shorter durations: the curve that delineates the duration and intensity of those intracranial pressure episodes associated with worse outcome is an approximately exponential decay curve. In children, the curve resembles that of adults, but the delineation between episodes associated with worse outcome occurs at lower intracranial pressure thresholds. Intracranial pressures above 20 mmHg lasting longer than 37 min in adults, and longer than 8 min in children, are associated with worse outcomes. In a multivariate model, together with known baseline risk factors for outcome in severe traumatic brain injury, the cumulative intracranial pressure-time burden is independently associated with mortality. When cerebrovascular autoregulation, assessed with the low-frequency autoregulation index, is impaired, the ability to tolerate elevated intracranial pressures is reduced. When the cerebral perfusion pressure is below 50 mmHg, all intracranial pressure insults, regardless of duration, are associated with worse outcome. The intracranial pressure-time burden associated with worse outcome is visualised in a colour-coded plot. In children, secondary injury occurs at lower intracranial pressure thresholds as compared to adults. Impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation reduces the ability to tolerate intracranial pressure insults. Thus, 50 mmHg might be the lower acceptable threshold for cerebral perfusion pressure. "

39,35273126,"Moisture-associated skin damage occurs in 4% to 37% of the pediatric population. Commonly described treatments can be challenging to apply to small neonatal wounds, and concerns exist about absorption, cutaneous side effects, and use in certain populations (eg, preterm neonates). This single-center, retrospective case series evaluated the use of cyanoacrylate liquid skin protectant (CSP) to manage moisture-, friction-, and trauma-associated pediatric and neonatal wounds. Fifteen pediatric and neonatal patients with wounds of various etiologies were treated with 1 to 3 applications of CSP. The product is a purple-colored liquid that comes in a small-sized and large-sized applicator and immediately adheres to the skin, taking approximately 1 minute to dry. One to 2 coats were applied to the affected area. Subsequent applications were prescribed as needed, depending on the skin condition. Before CSP application, some patients underwent different treatments deemed necessary by the treating practitioners. There were 7 neonate patients (age range, 4 days-3 weeks), with a gestational age of 25 weeks to full term. Wounds included incontinence-associated dermatitis; peristomal, gastrostomy-associated, and tracheostomy-associated dermatitis; and skin tears. In the 8 older patients (age, 1-5 months; 10 years; 12 years; 16 years), wounds included gastrostomy and tracheostomy-associated dermatitis and granulation tissue, epidermal stripping from adhesive dressing removal, intertriginous dermatitis, and lesions resulting from graft-versus-host disease. Application of CSP facilitated the healing of dermatitis and peristomal excoriations as well as facilitated skin dryness, leading to increased wear time of a peristomal appliance. Peristomal dryness contributed to less friction and likely was the reason for granulation tissue recession. Cyanoacrylate liquid skin protectant can be considered in the management of pediatric moisture- and friction-associated cutaneous injuries, skin tears, and exudative wounds. It can be used as a stand-alone therapy or in combination with standard of care. "

41,32584469,"A validated tool for scoring bronchitis during flexible bronchoscopy (FB) is potentially useful for clinical practice and research. We aimed to develop a bronchoscopically defined bronchitis scoring system in children (BScore) based on our pilot study. Children undergoing FB were prospectively enrolled. Their FB was digitally recorded and assessed (two clinicians blinded to each other and clinical history) for six features: secretion amount (six-point scale), secretion color (BronkoTest, 0-8), mucosal oedema (0-3), ridging (0-3), erythema (0-3), and pallor (0-3) based on pre-determined criteria. We correlated (Spearman's rho) each feature with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) neutrophil percentage (neutrophil%). BScore was then derived using models with combinations of the six features that best related to airway BAL neutrophil%. The various models of BScore were plotted against BAL neutrophil% using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. We analyzed 142 out of 150 children enrolled. Eight children were excluded for unavailability of BAL cytology or FB recordings. Chronic/recurrent cough was the commonest indication for FB (75%). The median age was 3 years (IQR, 1.5-5.3 years). Secretion amount (r = 0.42) and color (r = 0.46), mucosal oedema (r = 0.42), and erythema (r = 0.30) significantly correlated with BAL neutrophil%, P < .0001. The highest area under ROC (aROC) was obtained by the addition of the scores of all features excluding pallor (aROC = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76-0.90) with airway neutrophilia (defined as BAL neutrophil% of >10%). This prospective study has developed the first validated bronchitis scoring tool in children based on bronchoscopic visual inspection of airways. Further validation in other cohorts is however required. "
42,34384239,"Echocardiographic screening can detect asymptomatic cases of rheumatic heart disease (RHD), facilitating access to treatment. Barriers to implementation of echocardiographic screening include the requirement for expensive equipment and expert practitioners. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of an abbreviated echocardiographic screening protocol (single parasternal-long-axis view with a sweep of the heart) performed by briefly trained, nonexpert practitioners using handheld ultrasound devices. Participants aged 5 to 20 years in Timor-Leste and the Northern Territory of Australia had 2 echocardiograms: one performed by an expert echocardiographer using a GE Vivid I or Vivid Q portable ultrasound device (reference test), and one performed by a nonexpert practitioner using a GE Vscan handheld ultrasound device (index test). The accuracy of the index test, compared with the reference test, for identifying cases with definite or borderline RHD was determined. There were 3111 enrolled participants; 2573 had both an index test and reference test. Median age was 12 years (interquartile range, 10-15); 58.2% were female. Proportion with definite or borderline RHD was 5.52% (95% CI, 4.70-6.47); proportion with definite RHD was 3.23% (95% CI, 2.61-3.98). Compared with the reference test, sensitivity of the index test for definite or borderline RHD was 70.4% (95% CI, 62.2-77.8), specificity was 78.1% (95% CI, 76.4-79.8). Nonexpert practitioners can be trained to perform single parasternal-long-axis view with a sweep of the heart echocardiography. However, the specificity and sensitivity are inadequate for echocardiographic screening. Improved training for nonexpert practitioners should be investigated. "
43,23999954,"The Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) and Color Analog Scale (CAS) are self-report pain scales commonly used in children but insufficiently validated in the emergency department setting. Our objectives were to determine the psychometric properties (convergent validity, discriminative validity, responsivity, and reliability) of the FPS-R and CAS, and to determine whether degree of validity varied based on age, sex, and ethnicity. We conducted a prospective, observational study of English- and Spanish-speaking children ages 4 to 17 years. Children with painful conditions indicated their pain severity on the FPS-R and CAS before and 30 minutes after analgesia. We assessed convergent validity (Pearson correlations, Bland-Altman method), discriminative validity (comparing pain scores in children with pain against those without pain), responsivity (comparing pain scores pre- and postanalgesia), and reliability (Pearson correlations, repeatability coefficient). Of 620 patients analyzed, mean age was 9.2 ± 3.8 years, 291(46.8%) children were girls, 341(55%) were Hispanic, and 313(50.5%) were in the younger age group (<8 years). Pearson correlation was 0.85, with higher correlation in older children and girls. Lower convergent validity was noted in children <7 years of age. All subgroups based on age, sex, and ethnicity demonstrated discriminative validity and responsivity for both scales. Reliability was acceptable for both the FPS-R and CAS. The FPS-R and CAS overall demonstrate strong psychometric properties in children ages 4 to 17 years, and between subgroups based on age, sex, and ethnicity. Convergent validity was questionable in children <7 years old. "
44,1856427,"Transesophageal echocardiography using Doppler color flow mapping with both single plane transverse and longitudinal pediatric probes was performed in 127 infants and children both intraoperatively and postoperatively. The 127 patients ranged in age from 1 day to 18 years (mean 37 months) and in weight from 2.4 to 45 kg (mean 13.2); 157 studies were successfully performed (100% of attempted) with no complications. Transesophageal two-dimensional echocardiography combined with pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound and color flow mapping provided detailed morphologic as well as physiologic information, with additional information provided overall in 56% of the cases. Typical limitations of single-plane transverse imaging were overcome using a prototype longitudinal-axis pediatric probe. Both left and right ventricular outflow tracts, distal pulmonary arteries and all of the interventricular and atrial septa were visualized. Assessment of surgical repair intraoperatively as well as assessment postoperatively for cardiac function, residual intracardiac shunts, residual valvular sequelae and other hemodynamic events was important and easily performed in an otherwise inaccessible patient. Transesophageal echocardiography in infants and in small children is a valuable ""noninvasive"" imaging technique that offers important additional and complementary information. "
45,35596620,"Nonadherence to antiseizure drugs is a significant problem in pediatric epilepsy and is linked to increased morbidity and mortality, clinically unnecessary medication changes, and increased health care costs. Family interventions can improve adherence. However, it is challenging to determine which families will struggle with nonadherence and require intervention. This study aims to identify specific parent, family, child, and medical factors that predict which families most need family-based adherence interventions. Families enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of a family-based adherence intervention completed measures assessing parent, family, child, and medical factors. Families also used an electronic adherence monitor. Adherence of ≥95% was considered high adherence (not requiring intervention), and <95% was considered suboptimal adherence (requiring intervention). We conducted a stepwise logistic regression analysis to assess demographic, medical, child, family, and parent predictors of membership to the suboptimal adherence group. Of the 200 families of children with new onset epilepsy who enrolled, 177 families completed the study. Of these families, 121 (68%) were in the high adherence group and 56 (32%) were in the suboptimal adherence group. Families with lower socioeconomic status (SES), children of color, lower general family functioning, and more parent distress were more likely to be in the suboptimal adherence group. We identified that parent and family factors, as well as sociodemographic characteristics, predicted membership in the suboptimal adherence group. It is critical to find creative and practical solutions for assessing and intervening upon key adherence predictors. These may include streamlined screening for parental distress and family functioning, as well as recognition that families of lower SES and communities of color may be at heightened risk for suboptimal adherence.

47,34848170,"To evaluate the effect of optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) on the recovery of visual function in pediatric patients with optic disc swelling owing to increased intracranial pressure. Retrospective case series. Medical chart review of all pediatric patients who underwent ONSF between 2009 and 2020 at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Visual function was assessed at pre and postoperative visits. The main outcome measures were visual acuity, color vision, extraocular motility, visual field mean deviation, retinal nerve fiber layer thickness measured by optical coherence tomography. Fourteen pediatric patients (10 females; mean ± SD age of 14 ± 2.6 years; range, 8.5-17.5 years) were included. Five patients underwent bilateral surgeries. Ten patients were diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Of the 10 idiopathic intracranial hypertension patients, 3 had a previous history of weight gain and 2 of systemic steroid treatment; these can be referred to as pseudotumor cerebri. The mean ± SD follow-up length was 16.4 ± 12.3 months. VA improved from 20/138 to 20/68 in the operated eye (P = .0003) and from 20/78 to 20/32 in the nonoperated eye (P = .02). Color vision improved in the operated eye (P = .04), extraocular motility improved in the operated and nonoperated eye (P = .002 and P = .04 respectively). Visual field mean deviation improved in the operated (-23.4 dB to -11.5 dB, P < .0001) and nonoperated eye (-19.8 dB to -6.8 dB, P = .02). Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness improved in the operated eye (349.1 to 66.2 µm; P < .0001). The postoperative improvement was observed as early as the postoperative day 1. ONSF produces a rapid and persistent vision improvement in both the operated eye and the nonoperated eye. In children and young adults with papilledema and elevated intracranial pressure causing vision loss that is severe at presentation or refractory to standard medical management, ONSF should be considered.

Stool frequency declined from a mean of 3.0 times/day (3rd centile 0.6, 97th centile 5.9) at 4 weeks to 1.3 times/day (0.6, 2.7) at 42 months. Stool consistency was soft in most babies with nearly half passing liquid or curdy stool at 4 weeks. 14% of babies usually passed a hard stool at 4 weeks, rising to 30% at 42 months. Stool colour was commonly yellow at 4 weeks and had changed to brown by 6 months. Black stools were extremely unusual at all ages. These data on the changes with age in the stool patterns of young children will be useful for clinicians. "
49,20825975,"The association between low blood lead levels (<5 μg/dL) and the inattention-hyperactivity symptoms and neurocognitive profiles of school-aged Korean children was investigated. We measured blood lead levels in 256 Korean children aged 8-10 years. Teachers completed the Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (T-ARS)-IV to assess inattentive and hyperactive symptoms. Parents completed the Korean version of the Learning Disability Evaluation Scale (K-LDES). Children performed neurocognitive tests [The Continuous Performance Test (CPT), the Children's Color Trails Test, and the Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT)]. A linear regression analysis indicated that the blood lead concentrations were associated with the inattention scores [B=4.8, S.E.=1.6, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5-8.0], the hyperactivity subscores (3.1, 1.4, 0.3-5.9), and the total score (7.9, 2.9, 2.1-13.6) on the T-ARS; the number of omission errors on the CPT (20.6, 7.1, 6.5-34.6); the listening (-1.4, 0.7, -2.8 to -0.1), reading (-2.1, 0.7, -3.4 to -0.7), writing (-2.0, 0.7, -3.4 to -0.6), spelling (-2.2, 0.7, -3.7 to -0.7), and calculating (-1.8, 0.7, -3.1 to -0.4) scores on the K-LDES; and the color-word score on the SCWT (-6.7, 3.4, -13.3 to -0.1). A logistic regression analysis indicated that the probability of inattentive and hyperactive symptoms was increased with higher blood lead levels in boys with an odds ratio of 2.768 [B=1.018, S.E.=0.487, p=0.036, 95% CI: 1.066-7.187]. This study suggests that even low blood lead levels (<5 μg/dL) are associated with inattentive and hyperactivity symptoms and learning difficulties in school-aged children. "
50,34708446,"Dermatology for pediatric skin of color is the application of dermatology to the genetically diverse and distinctive segment of the pediatric population that includes children of non-White racial and ethnic groups with increased pigmentation including individuals of Asian, Hispanic/LatinX, African, Native American, Pacific Island descent, indigenous people among others with overlap in particular individuals, and mixtures thereof. The discipline of pediatric skin of color can be challenging with difficulty in diagnosis of common conditions due to underlying pigmentation, variations in common hair styling practices, and differences in demographics of cutaneous disease. Whereas some conditions are more common in children of color, other conditions have nuances in clinical appearance and therapeutics with regard to skin color. This article, the second of the series, focuses on inflammatory skin disease nuances, melanocytic disorders, and hypopigmented mycosis fungoides. "
51,37819888,"Testosterone analysis in hair allows for retrospective evaluation of endogenous testosterone concentrations, but studies devoted to investigating confounders in hair testosterone analysis have hitherto been scarce. The current study examined the stability of testosterone concentrations between two hair samples collected three months apart and investigated two potential confounding factors: natural hair colour and cosmetic hair treatments. Testosterone was analysed with an in-house radioimmunoassay with a limit of detection adequate for the purpose. The testosterone concentrations from the two samplings, at baseline and three months later, had an intra-individual correlation of moderate strength (rho = 0.378, p<0.001, n = 146). Hair treatment, such as colouring or bleaching, seemed to increase testosterone concentrations (p = 0.051, n = 191, and in a paired analysis in a subset of the cohort p = 0.005, n = 24), while no effect of natural colour in untreated hair (p = 0.133) could be detected. The current results suggest that cosmetic hair treatments need to be considered in hair testosterone analyses and demonstrate the utility of a radioimmunoassay to reliably measure testosterone concentrations in small hair samples in women.

This is a case- and control-study with 6-10 year-old children; 58 were asthmatic and 117 were control, with a relation 2:1. Asthmatic patients were recruited from consult of immuno-allergies department and control patients, from familial medicine consult of Hospital de Especialidades 71, IMSS. Indirect (mother) and directed surveys were applied, they were of multiple option for exploring the most known in literature-risk factors. Statistical management was performed by odds ratio with confidence interval of 95%. The following variables were considered risk factors: ingestion of artificial colorants before having 1 year old (OR = 13.2), living in an urban area (OR = 7.74), maternal smoking during pregnancy (OR = 2.4), wool contact before having 1 year old (OR = 2.11), passive smoking exposure during pregnancy (OR = 1.486) and feeding with industrialized milk (OR = 1.2). Environmental risk factors are very important in our population, as well as early ablactation; however, ingestion before having 1 year old of allergens as egg, chocolate, orange and mango was not considered risk factor.

53,33587388,"Seizures occur in 10% to 40% of critically ill children. We describe a phenomenon seen on color density spectral array but not raw EEG associated with seizures and acquired brain injury in pediatric patients. We reviewed EEGs of 541 children admitted to an intensive care unit between October 2015 and August 2018. We identified 38 children (7%) with a periodic pattern on color density spectral array that oscillates every 2 to 5 minutes and was not apparent on the raw EEG tracing, termed macroperiodic oscillations (MOs). Internal validity measures and interrater agreement were assessed. We compared demographic and clinical data between those with and without MOs. Interrater reliability yielded a strong agreement for MOs identification (kappa: 0.778 [0.542-1.000]; P < 0.0001). There was a 76% overlap in the start and stop times of MOs among reviewers. All patients with MOs had seizures as opposed to 22.5% of the general intensive care unit monitoring population ( P < 0.0001). Macroperiodic oscillations occurred before or in the midst of recurrent seizures. Patients with MOs were younger (median of 8 vs. 208 days; P < 0.001), with indications for EEG monitoring more likely to be clinical seizures (42 vs. 16%; P < 0.001) or traumatic brain injury (16 vs. 5%, P < 0.01) and had fewer premorbid neurologic conditions (10.5 vs. 33%; P < 0.01). Macroperiodic oscillations are a slow periodic pattern occurring over a longer time scale than periodic discharges in pediatric intensive care unit patients. This pattern is associated with seizures in young patients with acquired brain injuries. "
54,36031052,"This study sought to examine how mental health diagnoses, health care utilization and foster care placement instability affect antipsychotic prescribing and how these factors may contribute to disproportionate antipsychotic prescribing among youth in foster care. This retrospective cohort study utilized EHR data that were linked to administrative child welfare data. Two outcome variables were analyzed: 1) any antipsychotic prescription documented and 2) number of antipsychotic prescriptions documented. Predictor variables included foster care status, number of unique mental health diagnoses, counts of health care encounters over the study period, and counts of foster care placements. Covariates included gender, persons of color, and age in years. Models were estimated using logistic regression for the dichotomous outcome and Poisson regression for the count outcome. Increased antipsychotic prescribing among children in foster care persists even after accounting for mental health diagnoses and health care utilization. However, the number of placements modified the effect of foster care involvement on antipsychotic prescribing such that after 2 placement changes, the odds of being prescribed an antipsychotic surpassed the effect of foster care involvement. More mental health diagnoses, more inpatient and emergency health care encounters, and more foster care placements were associated with an increased odds of being prescribed an antipsychotic and an increased count of antipsychotic prescriptions. Decreased primary care encounters were associated with increased odds of antipsychotic prescriptions, and decreased specialty encounters were associated with higher counts of antipsychotic prescriptions. Placement instability is associated with disproportionate antipsychotic prescribing among youth in foster care. "
55,13677947,"We investigated the clinical characteristics of 54 patients with childhood onset occipital lobe epilepsy (OLE). There were 25 patients of symptomatic OLE (cortical dysplasia, post encephalitis or encephalopathy, brain tumor and so on), and 29 cases of cryptogenic OLE. Eighteen patients had positive visual symptoms such as flash light, bright spots and sparks of light, 23 patients had negative ones such as scotoma, hemianopia and amaurosis and 10 patients had other complicated visual symptoms such as change of the shape or colors. Young children complained of simple visual phenomena. The youngest patient who could explain visual symptom was 3 years old. All 3 patients with visual field defects had cortical dysplasia in occipital lobe. Ictal SPECT study showed wide hyperperfusion areas in the temporo-parieto-occipital lobe in most of patients with abnormal MRI findings. CBZ and VPA were prescribed in most cases, and were effective in 65% and 60% of the patients, respectively. Seizure prognosis was relatively good. Seizures disappeared in 56% of the patients with symptomatic OLE and 79% of those with cryptogenic OLE. "
56,29575497,"Pediatric hypertension guidelines recommend Doppler renal ultrasonography as a screening study for the evaluation of possible renal artery stenosis (RAS) in normal-weight children ≥ 8 years of age who are suspected of having RAS and who will cooperate with the procedure. Obese children are excluded because of technical and vascular concerns. There are no data on RI in obese children. This is a retrospective review of children aged 1.5-18 who received Doppler imaging studies over a 10-year period. A total of 174 patients were studied. There was no significant difference between the RI values based on BMI. Of the 174 individuals in the study 22 obtained follow-up CT/MRA after abnormal Doppler ultrasounds. On advanced imaging 3 were confirmed to have RAS. Obesity does not seem to influence RI.RI alone should not be used as a screening tool for RAS. An approach toward diagnosis is suggested based on BMI, renin levels, and ultrasound. "
57,24590347,"Casts are used to treat clubfeet, developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), forearm fractures, and femur fractures. The ability of a cast to maintain a desired shape is termed moldability. Clinicians use plaster, fiberglass, and soft casts. To our knowledge the biomechanical molding characteristics of these 3 materials have never been reported. We hypothesized that moldability of plaster would be better than fiberglass and fiberglass would be better than soft cast. We compared 12.7 cm wide casts of plaster, fiberglass, and soft cast. Casts were 5 layers thick, prepared in 40°C water, and placed over 2 layers of cotton padding on 5.1 cm and 15.2 cm diameter foam cylinders. A loading device simulated loads applied by clinicians when molding casts for 4 conditions: clubfoot (thumb-shaped 50 N load on 5.1 cm model), DDH (thumb-shaped 100 N load on 15.2 cm model), forearm fracture (palm-shaped 50 N load on 5.1 cm model), and femur fracture (palm-shaped 100 N load on 15.2 cm model). The loading device applied molding for 7 minutes. Five casts of each material were made for each model. Casts were removed, photographed, and the area of maximal deformation was compared with an unmolded cast. A large area of maximal deformation meant that the deformation was spread out over a large area, less precise molding. In the clubfoot model, plaster was more precise than fiberglass (P=0.002) and soft cast (P<0.0001). In the DDH model, plaster was more precise than fiberglass (P<0.0001) and soft cast (P<0.0001) and fiberglass was more precise than soft cast (P<0.0001).In the femur fracture model, plaster was more precise than fiberglass (P=0.001) and soft cast (P=0.001). The moldability of plaster is better than fiberglass and soft cast and fiberglass is better than soft cast. If precise molding is required, plaster has the best moldability. In cases not requiring precise molding, fiberglass and soft cast are lightweight, waterproof, and available in child-friendly colors. "
58,37820704,"Race is a social construct and cannot be used as a biological proxy, inherently making race-based medicine racist. Given the history of slavery in the United States, there are deep-rooted racist laws and policies that have impacted the health of families and children of color for centuries. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has come to acknowledge its racist past and promised a more equitable future for children and its organization. White physicians from the days of slavery created false myths regarding biological differences between races to strengthen their argument for keeping the institution of slavery - some of which are still in use today. It is vital to the health of future generations of this country that there be a shift to practicing race-conscious medicine and addressing the social determinants of health that are responsible for inequitable care. Pediatricians can play a significant role in ensuring health care equity for children now and in the future.  "
59,35982030,"In 2019, just one-half of Americans received their influenza vaccine, despite it being safe, effective, and important in preventing serious infection, hospitalization, and death. Black children receive fewer influenza vaccines than their White counterparts. Vaccine hesitancy can hinder influenza vaccine uptake and is partially fueled by ongoing systemic racism and historical abuse leading to medical mistrust in communities of color. Building trust may enhance the transfer of reliable vaccine information and may move people along the spectrum of vaccine intention. We sought to partner with faith-based organizations through a community influenza vaccination event to increase vaccination rates. By leveraging the reach and expertise of trusted voices, such as church ""first ladies"" and local community leaders, we were able to administer 600 pediatric influenza vaccines between 2016 and 2019. In addition, this event served as a platform to assess whether youth attendees had a place for regular medical care (""medical home"") (>80% did in each year assessed) and to conduct preventive screenings. Most children, as reported by their caregivers, had recent medical check-ups (85% in 2016, 84% in 2017, and 82% in 2018). Of the children screened, more than one-third had an abnormal body mass index and one-half had abnormal dentition. By partnering with organizations that are well-embedded in the local community, such as faith-based organizations, health care groups may be able to maximize the impact of their health promotion campaigns.

60,38317184,"In Brazil, a country of continental dimensions, the health needs of each region have an impact. In this context and the name of the principle of equity, the SUS organizes actions especially aimed at social groups such as the elderly, children, pregnant women, and indigenous peoples. The concept of justice proposed by John Rawls is one of equity, which is essential to this country. This is an ecological, descriptive study, which analyzed hospital spending on cardiovascular diseases in the Unified Health System (SUS) among the indigenous elderly population and other ethnicities/colors in Brazil, between 2010 and 2019. Hospitalization costs and fatality rates for indigenous populations and other colors/ethnicities, between 2010 and 2019, were evaluated. A reduction in hospitalization costs for the indigenous population and an increase in other populations was observed throughout the historical series, while there was an increase in fatality rates for both groups. A comparison was made between hospitalization costs and the fatality rates of indigenous populations and other colors/ethnicities according to sex, between 2010 and 2019. It was observed that regardless of sex, there are significant differences (p<0.05) between hospitalization costs and fatality rates, with higher costs for patients of other colors/ethnicities and higher fatality rates for the indigenous population. Hospitalization costs due to cardiovascular diseases in elderly people from indigenous populations were lower compared to other ethnicities in most federative units, which may suggest an unequal allocation of resources or access for this indigenous population to the SUS. Although there is no strong correlation between spending on hospital admissions and fatality rates, it was found that these rates increased between 2010 and 2019, while spending was reduced. "
61,28521677,"Molluscum contagiosum is a viral cutaneous infection in childhood that occurs worldwide. Physicians should familiarize themselves with this common condition. To review in depth the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, complications and, in particular, treatment of molluscum contagiosum. A PubMed search was completed in Clinical Queries using the key term ""molluscum contagiosum"". Patents were searched using the key term ""molluscum contagiosum"" from www.google.com/patents, http: //espacenet.com, and www.freepatentsonline.com. Molluscum contagiosum is caused by a poxvirus of the Molluscipox genus. Preschool and elementary school-aged children are more commonly affected. The virus is transmitted by close physical contact, autoinoculation, and fomites. Typically, molluscum contagiosum presents as asymptomatic, discrete, smooth, flesh-colored, dome-shaped papules with central umbilication from which a plug of cheesy material can be expressed. Some authors suggest watchful waiting of the lesions.Many authors suggest active treatment of lesions for cosmetic reasons or concerns of transmission and autoinoculation. Active treatments may be mechanical (e.g. cryotherapy, curettage, pulsed dye laser therapy), chemical (e.g. cantharidin, potassium hydroxide, podophyllotoxin, benzoyl peroxide, tretinoin, trichloroacetic acid, lactic acid, glycolic acid, salicylic acid), immune-modulating (e.g. imiquimod, interferon-alpha, cimetidine) and anti-viral (e.g. cidofovir). Recent patents related to the management of molluscum contagiosum are also retrieved and discussed. These patents comprise of topical compositions and herbal Chinese medicine with limited documentation of their efficacy. The choice of treatment method should depend on the physician's comfort level with the various treatment options, the patient's age, the number and severity of lesions, location of lesions, and the preference of the child/parents. In general, physical destruction of the lesion, in particular, cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen and chemical destruction with cantharidin are the methods of choice for the majority of patients. "
62,38425208,"To validate the intracranial pressure (ICP) dose-response visualization plot for the first time in a novel prospectively collected pediatric traumatic brain injury (pTBI) data set from the multi-center, multi-national KidsBrainIT consortium. Prospectively collected minute-by-minute ICP and mean arterial blood pressure time series of 104 pTBI patients were categorized in ICP intensity-duration episodes. These episodes were correlated with the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) and displayed in a color-coded ICP dose-response plot. The influence of cerebrovascular reactivity and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were investigated. The generated ICP dose-response plot on the novel data set was similar to the previously published pediatric plot. This study confirmed that higher ICP episodes were tolerated for a shorter duration of time, with an approximately exponential decay curve delineating the positive and negative association zones. ICP above 20 mm Hg for any duration in time was associated with poor outcome in our patients. Cerebrovascular reactivity state did not influence their respective transition curves above 10 mm Hg ICP. CPP below 50 mm Hg was not tolerated, regardless of ICP and duration, and was associated with worse outcome. The ICP dose-response plot was reproduced in a novel and independent pTBI data set. ICP above 20 mm Hg and CPP below 50 mm Hg for any duration in time were associated with worse outcome. This highlighted a pressing need to reduce pediatric ICP therapeutic thresholds used at the bedside. "

Recent evidence suggests that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could complement ultrasonography (US) in the PAS diagnosis. Evaluate the incidence, risk factors, and maternal morbidity related to the MRI diagnosis of PAS in major PP. A 10-year retrospective cohort study. Tertiary care hospital. We report on patients with major PP who had cesarean delivery in Abha Maternity and Children's Hospital (AMCH) over a 10-year period (2012-2021). They were evaluated with ultrasonography (US) and color Doppler for evidence of PAS. Antenatal MRI was ordered either to confirm the diagnosis (if equivocal US) or to assess the depth of invasion/extra-uterine extension (if definitive US). Risk factors for PAS in major PP and maternal complications. 299 patients RESULTS: Among 299 patients, MRI confirmed the PAS diagnosis in 91/299 (30.5%) patients. The independent risk factors for MRI diagnosis of PAS in major PP included only repeated cesarean sections and advanced maternal age. The commonest maternal morbidity in major PP with PAS was significantly excessive intraoperative bleeding. MRI may be a valuable adjunct in the evaluation of PAS in major PP; as a complement, but not substitute US. MRI may be suitable in major PP/PAS patients who are older and have repeated cesarean deliveries with equivocal results or deep/extra-uterine extension on US. Single center, small sample size, lack of complete histopathological diagnosis. None. "
65,33574399,"While atypical sensory processing is one of the more ubiquitous symptoms in autism spectrum disorder, the exact nature of these sensory issues remains unclear, with different studies showing either enhanced or deficient sensory processing. Using a well-established continuous cued-recall task that assesses visual working memory, the current study provides novel evidence reconciling these apparently discrepant findings. Autistic children exhibited perceptual advantages in both likelihood of recall and recall precision relative to their typically-developed peers. When autistic children did make errors, however, they showed a higher probability of erroneously binding a given colour with the incorrect spatial location. These data align with neural-architecture models for feature binding in visual working memory, suggesting that atypical population-level neural noise in the report dimension (colour) and cue dimension (spatial location) may drive both the increase in probability of recall and precision of colour recall as well as the increase in proportion of binding errors when making an error, respectively. These changes are likely to impact core symptomatology associated with autism, as perceptual binding and working memory play significant roles in higher-order tasks, such as communication. "
66,14597015,"Skin lesions are encountered in all areas of medicine, and it is therefore important for physicians to understand the fundamentals of explaining and diagnosing common skin conditions. This article begins with a discussion of description and documentation of skin lesions based on color, size, morphology, and distribution. Pigmentation disorders such as vitiligo are depicted. Cutaneous growths that are found in the pediatric and adolescent population include acrochordons, dermatofibromas, keloids, milia, neurofibromas, and pyogenic granulomas. Treatment of these growths usually involves observation or curettage with electrodessication.Psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, poison ivy, and eczema are comprised of scaling patches and plaques; poison ivy and atopic dermatitis may also present with bullous and vesicular changes. Therapy typically consists of topical emollients and corticosteroids; phototherapy is reserved for refractory cases. Acne vulgaris is the most common skin disease of the pediatric and adolescent population. This condition can be psychologically debilitating and, therefore, proper treatment is of paramount importance. Therapeutic options include topical as well as oral antibiotics and retinoids. Extreme caution must be used when prescribing retinoids to post-pubescent females, as these agents are teratogenic. Vascular anomalies are most commonly exemplified as port wine stains and hemangiomas. Port wine stains may be treated with pulsed dye laser or may be observed if they are not of concern to the patient or physician. Hemangiomas typically spontaneously regress by age ten; however, there has been recent concern that certain cases may need to be treated. Dermal rashes may be localized or generalized. Treatment of generalized drug eruptions involves elimination of the inciting agent, topical antipruritics, and systemic corticosteroids for severe reactions. Infectious etiologic agents of skin disease include bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Many sexually transmitted diseases are bacterial or viral in origin and present as a rash or ulcer. Impetigo is a bacterial infection which may present as a bullous eruption or as an erosion with a honey colored crust. Other bacterial infections include erythema chronicum migrans, folliculitis, and cellulitis. Fungal infections include the various forms of tinea and are usually treated with topical antifungals; if the infection is located in a hair-bearing area, systemic antifungals are necessary. Viral infections include warts, varicella, molluscum contagiosum, and herpes. Treatment varies from observation or antivirals for varicella to cryosurgery and topical imiquimod for warts. Finally, scabies and lice are infectious agents that can be treated with permethrin and pyrethrin solutions. "
67,32166386,"Mongolian spots (MS) are congenital dermal conditions resulting from neural crest-derived melanocytes migration to the skin during embryogenesis. MS incidences are highly variable in different populations. Morphologically, MS present as hyperpigmented maculae of varying size and form, ranging from round spots of 1 cm in diameter to extensive discolorations covering predominantly the lower back and buttocks. Due to their coloring, which is also dependent on the skin type, MS may mimic hematoma thus posing a challenge on the physician conducting examinations of children in cases of suspected child abuse. In the present study, MS incidences and distribution, as well as skin types, were documented in a collective of 253 children examined on the basis of suspected child abuse. From these data, a classification scheme was derived to document MS and to help identify cases with a need for recurrent examination for unambiguous interpretation of initial findings alongside the main decisive factors for re-examination such as general circumstances of the initial examination (e. g., experience of the examiner, lighting conditions) and given dermatological conditions of the patient (e. g., diaper rash).

Mongolian spots were present in all newborns and disappeared slowly until 6 years of age when the rate of disappearance increased. At 10 years of age, none were found. The overall incidence regardless of age was 58% in boys and 53.3% in girls. The most frequent site of involvement was the sacrococcygeal area, followed by the gluteal and lumbar areas. Both sides were equally affected. In only 7.8% of boys and 3.3% of girls was the involved area greater than 15% of the body surface area. Most (63.8% of boys and 67.4% of girls) had less than 5% involved. The color of the Mongolian spots varied from gray to grayish blue to grayish black. In general, younger children had darker Mongolian spots. "

To investigate the clinical features and natural course of pediatric LM. Retrospective cohort analysis of pediatric patients (age ≤ 18 years) with LM. We examined 703 LM lesions in 381 children. Single, narrow, and homogeneously pigmented fingernail lesions were most frequently observed. Our results suggested that within 3, 4.5, and 9.5 years after onset, approximately 3%, 5%, and 10% of LM lesions, respectively, will completely regress and that single, left-sided, and homogeneously pigmented lesions are more likely to disappear completely. The age of onset, sex, finger/toe position, Hutchinson's sign, and nail dystrophy were not associated with complete regression. During follow-up, most cases demonstrated no change in color or width between the first and last visit, and early darkening/widening before stabilization or lightening/narrowing was common. The lightning of pigmentation was associated with complete regression, whereas change in width was not. Retrospective study at a tertiary center. Our results suggest that clinicians ought to follow pediatric patients with LM without intervention for several years even if lesions grow darker or wider. Single, left-sided, and homogeneously colored lesions are more likely to regress. "

This was a scale development and validation study with (1) construct and item generation and (2) evaluations of interrater reliability, acceptability, and content, ecological, and convergent validities. Children with special needs were recruited for the reliability (n = 32) and validity (n = 95) investigations. The construct and items were generated based on literature review and an expert panel. We constructed eight categories, namely visual reflex, ocular muscle balance, visual acuity, oculomotor, visual field, contrast sensitivity, colour/form vision, and visual attention. Both functional assessment and standardized tests were adopted. The reliabilities were high for the whole VFB-CSN (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.80-0.90) and good for the oculomotor, contrast sensitivity, and colour/form vision (ICC = 0.80-0.86, 95% CI = 0.50-0.93). Correlations between the VFB-CSN and the Functional Vision Questionnaire were strong and acceptable for the contrast sensitivity, acuity, and colour/form vision (r = 0.79, r = 0.69, r = 0.69, r = 0.70 respectively). The correlation between the VFB-CSN and standardized visual acuity test was acceptable (r = -0.72). The VFB-CSN is a reliable and valid multifaceted battery for children with special needs. Acceptable psychometric properties were also found for the acuity and contrast sensitivity. The Visual Function Battery for Children with Special Needs (VFB-CSN) can measure several types of visual function. The VFB-CSN also measures varying degrees of visual impairment in children with special needs. The VFB-CSN provides functional assessment and quantitative measurement for children with disability and difficulty in cooperating on standardized tests. "
72,38394968,"Food-grade titanium dioxide (E171), a white colourant widely used in ultra-processed food products, has been banned in the European Union. However, its usage is still permitted in medicines, and in several other countries. The estimated intake of E171 in children is higher than in adults, which led us to hypothesise that E171 induces differential effects depending on age, with adult mice being the most susceptible due to age, despite the lower dose. To evaluate the effects of oral administration of E171 on intestinal permeability, ileum, and colon histology, and how these effects impact anxious and depressive behaviour in young and adult mice of both sexes. Young and adult mice of both sexes C57BL/6 mice received 10 mg/kg E171 showed an amorphous shape, primary particles sized below 1 µm and anatase crystalline structure. Oral administration of E171 disrupted the intestinal permeability in adult male and female mice, but no effects were observed in young mice of both sexes. E171 promoted ileal adenoma formation in half of the adult female population, moreover hyperplastic crypts, and hyperplastic goblet cells at histological level in adult mice of both sexes. The colon presented hyperplastic goblet cells, hyperchromatic nuclei, increased proliferation and DNA damage in adult mice of both sexes. The anxiety and depressive behaviour were only altered in adult mice treated with E171, but no changes were detected in young animals of both sexes. Adult mice displayed higher susceptibility in all parameters analysed in this study compared to young mice of both sexes. "

In Mazanderan province, 2/20 blood films were diagnosed with only P. falciparum and 18/20 with only P. vivax. However, nested PCR detected 17/20, 2/20 and 1/20 with P. vivax only, P. falciparum only and mixed species respectively. The unexpected presence of P. falciparum urges prompt investigation and immediate treatment of malaria cases in this region. "
74,22480976,"The history of surgical treatment for hemispheric epilepsy is rich with colorful twists and turns. The authors trace the evolution of the surgical treatment of hemispheric epilepsy from radical anatomic resections to current less invasive disconnection procedures. Anatomic hemispherectomy (AH) was first described by Dandy in 1928 as a treatment for gliomas. The first report of this technique to control seizures was by McKenzie in 1938. AH gained wide popularity but began to fall out of favor after the description of superficial cerebral hemosiderosis in 1966. To reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with AH, Rasmussen introduced functional hemispherectomy in 1974. The technique of hemispherotomy was introduced in the 1990 s to minimize the extent of brain removal while maximizing the white matter disconnections. Thus, surgery for hemispheric epilepsy has undergone dramatic transformation since the technique was first introduced. Less invasive techniques have been developed to reduce surgical morbidity. Although optimal seizure control is best achieved with radical AH, the newer less invasive disconnection techniques appear to achieve near-comparable postoperative seizure control with a significantly lower rate of complications.

75,25939253,"To identify an immunohistochemical panel for paediatric malignant epithelial liver tumours. Forty-five hepatoblastomas (HBs), 13 paediatric hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and two hepatocellular malignant neoplasms not otherwise specified (NOS) were chosen for immunohistochemical staining of glypican 3 (GPC3), β-catenin, claudin-1, delta-like protein (DLK), and forkhead box protein G1 (FOXG1). Immunostaining was quantitatively analysed with NIH imagej software coupled with colour deconvolution. Different subtypes of HB and HCC showed distinct staining patterns of GPC3, β-catenin, and claudin-1. Moreover, GPC3, β-catenin and claudin-1 all showed higher expression in classic HCC and embryonal HB than in fetal HB; GPC3 showed complete negativity in small-cell undifferentiated (SCU) HB and fibrolamellar HCC (FLC); β-catenin showed the strongest expression in SCU HB but the weakest expression in FLC. A panel of these three immunomarkers was useful for the diagnosis of hepatocellular malignant neoplasms NOS. The expression of DLK and FOXG1 was inconstant among fetal and embryonal HB and classic HCC. A panel of GPC3, β-catenin and claudin-1 is helpful for differentiating HB subtypes and distinguishing HB from HCC. "
76,33577095,"During the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, an unusual outbreak of yellow-brown pigmentation on the skin of children was reported. Because of the restrictions on movement promulgated during the lockdown, most consultancies were performed using teledermatology. Data concerning personal care products and application of topical substances were collected, which revealed use of the same brand of wipes for all patients. A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was performed to compare the components of the wipes before and after the observation of the pigmentation, in order to detect the responsible substance. This analysis revealed a level about 10-fold higher than normal of ascorbic acid and its oxidation products (dehydroascorbic acid and L-threonic acid) in the wipes associated with the pigmentation. These 'colouring wipes' represent a peculiar but harmless phenomenon that highlights the importance of careful questioning about personal care products used by patients. "
77,11158659,"Acute appendicitis is the most common condition requiring emergent abdominal surgery in childhood. The clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis is often not straightforward because approximately one-third of children with the condition have atypical clinical findings. The delayed diagnosis of this condition has serious consequences, including appendiceal perforation, abscess formation, peritonitis, sepsis, bowel obstruction, and death. Cross-sectional imaging with ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT) have proved useful for the evaluation of suspected acute appendicitis. There has been a great deal of variability in the utilization of these modalities for such diagnosis in the pediatric population. The principal advantages of US are its lower cost, lack of ionizing radiation, and ability to assess vascularity through color Doppler techniques and to provide dynamic information through graded compression. The principal advantages of CT include less operator dependency than US, as reflected by a higher diagnostic accuracy, and enhanced delineation of disease extent in a perforated appendix. "
78,8581901,"To assess the safety and efficacy of the nitinol snare to aid in the delivery of a Gianturco coil in percutaneous occlusion of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Seventeen patients (mean age 8.2 years) underwent catheterization and coil occlusion of a PDA (mean minimum diameter 1.9 mm). A nitinol snare was used to deliver and position the coil in the ductus. A single Gianturco coil was placed successfully in all patients, resulting in complete ductal occlusion documented by aortic angiography. Color echocardiography documented a trivial residual shunt in one patient who had no audible cardiac murmurs following the procedure. There was no hemodynamic or echocardiographic evidence of left pulmonary artery obstruction. There were no complications and all patients were discharged within 24 hr following the procedure. Percutaneous coil occlusion of the PDA is safe and effective. Snare-controlled coil delivery eliminates the risk of coil dislodgement and optimizes coil position. "

80,9695661,"Combined assessment of three dimensional anatomical and functional images (SPECT, PET, MRI, CT) is useful to determine the nature and extent of lesions in many parts of the body. Physicians principally rely on their spatial sense to mentally re-orient and overlap images obtained with different imaging modalities. Objective methods that enable easy and intuitive image registration can help the physician arrive at more optimal diagnoses and better treatment decisions. This review describes a simple, intuitive and robust image registration approach developed in our laboratory. It differs from most other registration techniques in that it allows the user to incorporate all of the available information within the images in the registration process. This method takes full advantage of the ability of knowledgeable operators to achieve image registration and fusion using an intuitive interactive visual approach. It can register images accurately and quickly without the use of elaborate mathematical modeling or optimization techniques. The method provides the operator with tools to manipulate images in three dimensions, including visual feedback techniques to assess the accuracy of registration (grids, overlays, masks, and fusion of images in different colors). Its application is not limited to brain imaging and can be applied to images from any region in the body. The overall effect is a registration algorithm that is easy to implement and can achieve accuracy on the order of one pixel. "
81,34880094,"This study aims to determine the contributions of sun exposure and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure to risk of pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (MS). Children with MS and controls recruited from multiple centers in the United States were matched on sex and age. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to investigate the association of time spent outdoors daily in summer, use of sun protection, and ambient summer UVR dose in the year before birth and the year before diagnosis with MS risk, with adjustment for sex, age, race, birth season, child's skin color, mother's education, tobacco smoke exposure, being overweight, and Epstein-Barr virus infection. Three hundred thirty-two children with MS (median disease duration 7.3 months) and 534 controls were included after matching on sex and age. In a fully adjusted model, compared to spending <30 minutes outdoors daily during the most recent summer, greater time spent outdoors was associated with a marked reduction in the odds of developing MS, with evidence of dose-response (30 minutes-1 hour: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23-0.99,  If this is a causal association, spending more time in the sun during summer may be strongly protective against developing pediatric MS, as well as residing in a sunnier location.

82,30771559,"Improving children's tap water intake and reducing sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption is beneficial for health and health equity, particularly in low-income communities and communities of color. Existing community level interventions to improve the intake of tap water have predominantly occurred in schools and have focused on promoting water consumption in cafeterias during lunch or snack periods. The ""Hydrate Philly"" intervention was developed to target multiple environmental and social factors to improve tap water consumption in community recreation centers in low-income communities: replacing old and unappealing water fountains with appealing water-bottle-filling ""hydration stations"", conducting water safety testing and publicizing results, disseminating reusable water bottles, promoting tap water, and discouraging SSB consumption. Efficacy of the intervention will be tested through a group-randomized controlled trial (n = 28 centers) of the intervention's impact on center-level water fountain/station use as measured by flow meters during a youth summer camp program primarily for children aged 6-12 years. Intervention impact on the primary outcome (use of drinking water sources) will be examined with a difference-in-differences approach using an ordinary least squares regression model for analysis at the center level. Secondary outcomes include SSBs brought to summer camp, reusable and single-use bottled water use, program trash, and recreation center staff SSB consumption. Multilevel approaches are needed to increase tap water intake and decrease SSB consumption among low-income and minority youth beyond school and meal settings. The current study describes the Hydrate Philly intervention, the study design, and baseline characteristics of recreation centers participating in the study.

84,29713928,"We aim to determine parotid gland elasticity values from healthy children and adolescents using shear wave elastography (SWE). We also define the degree of vascularity using superb microvascular imaging (SMI), power Doppler (PD), and color Doppler (CD) and compare SMI with CD and PD. A total of 100 cases, comprising 50 girls and 50 boys, with ages ranging from 3 to 17 years were included in this prospective study. SWE, SMI, PD, and CD measurements were taken from both parotid glands, and the relationships with sex, age, and body mass index (BMI) were determined. The SMI was compared with the PD and CD. The median elasticity values measured with SWE were 8.37 ± 2.09 kPa and 1.68 ± 0.26 m/s on the right and 8.33 ± 2.04 kPa and 1.69 ± 0.26 m/s on the left. There were significant positive correlations present for those aged below and above 10 years and for BMI with elasticity values. The median vascular spot numbers measured using SMI, PD, and CD were 5 ± 1.70, 3.5 ± 1.45, and 2 ± 1.1 on the right and 4 ± 1.7, 4 ± 1.43, and 2 ± 1.05 on the left, respectively. The median values obtained with SMI were significantly higher than the median values obtained with both PD and CD. This study determined the reference SWE, SMI, PD, and CD values for normal parotid glands in healthy children and adolescents. Elasticity values were affected by age and BMI. There was no correlation between vascularity values and age, sex, or BMI. SMI provided more detailed information about vascularity compared with the other methods. "
85,2802855,"Despite improving survival rates after repair of atrioventricular septal defect, many patients require reoperation because of postoperative heart failure. We used intraoperative color flow mapping echocardiography to assess the results of surgical repair of atrioventricular septal defect in 19 consecutive patients and compared those findings with results three to five days and 3 to 11 months after repair. There was close correlation between intraoperative and postoperative color flow mapping echocardiography in estimating the presence and severity of left atrioventricular valve regurgitation. All patients survived surgical repair, but in 4 (21%), postoperative congestive heart failure due to left atrioventricular valve regurgitation developed. The need for reoperation was significantly correlated with the severity of left atrioventricular valve regurgitation (r = 0.68) as estimated by intraoperative echocardiography and preoperative aberrancies in the atrioventricular valve (r = 0.68). Age, weight, additional congenital heart disease, preoperative pulmonary vascular resistance, preoperative atrioventricular valve regurgitation, and postoperative mean pulmonary arterial or left atrial pressure were not significantly correlated with the need for reoperation. Intraoperative color flow mapping echocardiography can accurately predict the development of early postoperative heart failure and subsequent reoperation after surgical repair of atrioventricular septal defect.

86,33978794,"Ultrasound (US) is the first-line imaging tool for evaluating liver and kidney transplants during and after the surgical procedures. In most patients after organ transplantation, gray-scale US coupled with color/power and spectral Doppler techniques is used to evaluate the transplant organs, assess the patency of vascular structures, and identify potential complications. In technically difficult or inconclusive cases, however, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can provide prompt and accurate diagnostic information that is essential for management decisions. CEUS is indicated to evaluate for vascular complications including vascular stenosis or thrombosis, active bleeding, pseudoaneurysms and arteriovenous fistulas. Parenchymal indications for CEUS include evaluation for perfusion defects and focal inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions. When transplant rejection is suspected, CEUS can assist with prompt intervention by excluding potential underlying causes for organ dysfunction. Intracavitary CEUS applications can evaluate the biliary tract of a liver transplant (e.g., for biliary strictures, bile leak or intraductal stones) or the urinary tract of a renal transplant (e.g., for urinary obstruction, urine leak or vesicoureteral reflux) as well as the position and patency of hepatic, biliary and renal drains and catheters. The aim of this review is to present current experience regarding the use of CEUS to evaluate liver and renal transplants, focusing on the examination technique and interpretation of the main imaging findings, predominantly those related to vascular complications.

87,8596836,"To compare power Doppler ultrasonography (US) with standard color Doppler US in the evaluation of testicular and epididymal blood flow in children. Testicular and epididymal flow were analyzed retrospectively in 24 testes in 12 prepubertal boys (mean age, 4 years) and 49 testes in 25 postpubertal boys (mean age, 14 years) with color and power Doppler US. Absence of testicular abnormality was based on clinical follow-up or scintigraphy. Power Doppler US depicted flow in 22 of 24 prepubertal testes and in all 49 postpubertal testes. Color Doppler US depicted flow in 20 prepubertal testes and in all 49 postpubertal testes. Flow was detected in five and three postpubertal epididymides with power and color Doppler US, respectively. A greater mean number of vessels per 1 cm2 of testicular parenchyma were detected with power than with color Doppler US in pre- and postpubertal testes. Power Doppler US improves depiction of intratesticular vessels, but flow cannot be identified in all prepubertal testes. Detection of epididymal flow is infrequent in postpubertal patients but appears comparable with both techniques. "
88,36372698,"The aim of this study was to translate the patient reported experience measure (PREM) questionnaire""What do you think of the hospital? Help us to get better!"" into Danish used in outpatient clinics and to explore its face and content validity. The translation process followed WHO recommendations and included forward translation, expert panel evaluation, back translation, pre-testing and cognitive interviews with 23 children and adolescents. Children and adolescents were positive to using PREM as a way to express their experiences. The layout of the questionnaire was important as use of colours was more appealing and the topics of the questionnaire were better visualised. The concepts in the original questionnaire related to distinguishing between different rooms for examination and conversation are not used in a Danish context. Otherwise, only minor translation adjustments were needed to match the Danish target group. Children and adolescents found that the Danish version of the PREM questionnaire tool was easy to read and understand, and the layout emphasised that they are the target group. After pre-testing among 23 children and adolescents, the questionnaire is now ready for pilottest in a larger group. The present study provides a tool to generate knowledge and evaluate the experiences of children and adolescents in an outpatient clinic. Using the questionnaire, healthcare staff may monitor the quality of the experiences of children and adolescents and collect data for research purposes. Likewise, it will be possible to compare hospitals and organizations nationally. "
89,1554580,"This paper reviews the contribution of sonography in assessing common and some less common neonatal and pediatric disorders. The samples reflect the strength or currently perceived weaknesses of sonography and duplex Doppler studies in both neonates and children. Controversies, when present, are highlighted to provoke thought and remind us that many of the premises on which we base our research are, themselves, still shaky. Comments are provided to encourage complementary studies by other investigators or by the original authors. Because of their significance for the practice of pediatric radiology and sonography, two studies, one adult and one experimental, are incorporated. Since there is still plenty of room for improving sonographic techniques and technology and because new developments, such as the use of contrast agents, are in the horizon, the true limitations of sonography and duplex and color Doppler is yet unknown. Therefore, because of the well-known advantages of using sonography in children, we must exhaust all our efforts, ""tricks,"" and resources as a sonographer before we subject the child to more invasive, stressful, and expensive studies. Meanwhile, knowledge of the strength of other modalities should help us avoid undue bias and single-mindedness. "
90,35395740,"Research shows that ill-fitting shoes can negatively impact the development of the pediatric foot, in a very direct manner. The primary aim of the study was to determine if the dimensions of available prescribed school shoes fit the foot dimensions of habitually barefoot South African children and adolescents. A cross-sectional observational study was conducted where static standing foot measurements of children and adolescents from urban and rural schools were obtained with a mobile caliper. The maximum heel-toe-length and foot width with an added 10 mm toe- and width fit allowance to each participant, were compared to the corresponding school shoe length and shoe width available in retail. A mixed model ANOVA was used to compare foot dimensions between gender, age and side. Six hundred and ninety-eight school children (N = 698) (431 girls; 267 boys; average age 10.86 years, SD = 2.55) were participants. A total of seventy-seven (N = 77) black coloured prescribed school shoes currently available in retail ranging from different styles and brands were measured. Results show that, comparing the shoe length and maximum heel-toe-length of participants, as well as taking 10 mm toe allowance into account, fifty-nine percent (59%) of children wore shoes that were not the correct length. With regards to the shoe width and the added 10 mm of width fit allowance, ninety-eight percent (98%) of the shoes worn by participants were too narrow for their feet. Results confirmed that school shoes currently available in retail, are not suited for the habitually barefoot population studied. It is recommended that the shoe manufacturing industry should consider the shoe width of school shoes for children and adolescents in habitually barefoot populations to avoid the long-term negative effect of ill-fitting shoes on the pediatric foot.

91,10590818,"The A-not-B (AB) task has been hypothesized to measure executive/frontal lobe function; however, the developmental and measurement characteristics of this task have not been investigated. Performances on AB and comparison tasks adapted from developmental and neuroscience literature was examined in 117 preschool children (ages 23-66 months). Age significantly predicted performance on AB, Delayed Alternation, Spatial Reversal, Color Reversal, and Self-Control tasks. A four-factor analytic model best fit task performance data. AB task indices loaded on two factors with measures from the Self-Control and Delayed Alternation tasks, respectively. AB indices did not load with those from the reversal tasks despite similarities in task administration and presumed cognitive demand (working memory). These results indicate that AB is sensitive to individual differences in age-related performance in preschool children and suggest that AB performance is related to both working memory and inhibition processes in this age range.

92,26269296,"The purpose of this study was to define grayscale and color Doppler sonographic features of an ectopic intrathyroidal thymus and to differentiate it from other thyroid nodule etiologies. We retrospectively reviewed imaging findings from 30 children who had a diagnosis of an ectopic intrathyroidal thymus from November 2005 to January 2013. Nodular thyroid lesions that were enclosed by the thyroid parenchyma and showed a typical echo pattern consistent with the thymus were accepted as the enclosed form of an intrathyroidal ectopic thymus. Eleven of these 30 children had an intrathyroidal ectopic thymus enclosed by the thyroid parenchyma, and they were enrolled in the study. The recorded sonograms were reviewed according to side, location, size, shape, echo pattern, internal content, and vascularization. The enclosed forms of ectopic intrathyroidal thymuses were unilateral in all children and located in the mid portion (n = 10) or lower portion (n = 1). All lesions were well demarcated, and the most common shape was fusiform (n = 8). Nine lesions showed a typical hypoechoic echo pattern with internal linear and punctate echoes resembling a mediastinal thymus. On color Doppler imaging, 6 lesions showed hypovascularity compared to the thyroid parenchyma, and 5 lesions showed internal vascularity. Unique sonographic features of the enclosed form of an ectopic intrathyroidal thymus, including a hypoechoic echo pattern with multiple linear and punctate echoes, a fusiform shape, a well-demarcated contour, and a mid- or low-lying location with hypovascularity or internal vascularity, can help radiologists differentiate it from other thyroid nodule etiologies.

93,33570144,"Adolescents of color are underrepresented in behavioral health research. Study aims were to quantify the amount and types of outreach effort needed to recruit young Black adolescents with type 1 diabetes and their primary caregiver into a clinical trial evaluating a parenting intervention and to determine if degree of recruitment difficulty was related to demographic, diabetes-related, or family characteristics. Data were drawn from a multi-center clinical trial. Participants (N = 155) were recruited from seven pediatric diabetes clinics. Contact log data were used to quantify both number/type of contacts prior to study enrollment as well as length of time to enrollment. Families were coded as having expedited recruitment (ER) or prolonged recruitment (PR). Baseline study data were used to compare ER and PR families on sociodemographic factors, adolescent diabetes management and health status and family characteristics such as household organization and family conflict. Mean length of time to recruit was 6.6 months and mean number of recruitment contacts was 10.3. Thirty-nine percent of the sample were characterized as PR. These families required even higher levels of effort (mean of 9.9 months to recruit and 15.4 contacts). There were no significant between-group differences on any baseline variable for ER and PR families, with the exception of family income. Researchers need to make persistent efforts in order to successfully enroll adolescents of color and their caregivers into clinical trials. Social determinants of health such as family resources may differentiate families with prolonged recruitment within such samples. "
94,36191670,"Echocardiography-based screening for valvular disease in at-risk asymptomatic children can result in early diagnosis. These screening programs, however, are resource intensive and may not be feasible in many resource-limited settings. Automated echocardiographic diagnosis may enable more widespread echocardiographic screening, early diagnosis, and improved outcomes. In this feasibility study, the authors sought to build a machine learning model capable of identifying mitral regurgitation (MR) on echocardiography. Echocardiograms were labeled by clip for view and by frame for the presence of MR. The labeled data were used to build two convolutional neural networks to perform the stepwise tasks of classifying the clips (1) by view and (2) by the presence of any MR, including physiologic, in parasternal long-axis color Doppler views. The view classification model was developed using 66,330 frames, and model performance was evaluated using a hold-out testing data set with 45 echocardiograms (11,730 frames). The MR detection model was developed using 938 frames, and model performance was evaluated using a hold-out testing data set with 42 echocardiograms (182 frames). Metrics to evaluate model performance included accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score (average of precision and recall, ranging from 0 to 1, with 1 suggesting perfect precision and recall), and receiver operating characteristic analysis. For the parasternal long-axis view with color Doppler, the view classification convolutional neural network achieved an F1 score of 0.97. The MR detection convolutional neural network achieved testing accuracy of 0.86 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91. A machine learning model is capable of discerning MR on transthoracic echocardiography. This is an encouraging step toward machine learning-based diagnosis of valvular heart disease on pediatric echocardiography. "
95,37076215,"Understanding the longitudinal burden of health care expenditures and utilization after pediatric cardiac surgery is needed to counsel families, improve care, and reduce outcome inequities. The purpose of this study was to describe and identify predictors of health care expenditures and utilization for Medicaid-insured pediatric cardiac surgical patients. All Medicaid enrolled children age <18 years undergoing cardiac surgery in the New York State CHS-COLOUR database, from 2006 to 2019, were followed in Medicaid claims data through 2019. A matched cohort of children without cardiac surgical disease was identified as comparators. Expenditures and inpatient, primary care, subspecialist, and emergency department utilization were modeled using log-linear and Poisson regression models to assess associations between patient characteristics and outcomes. In 5,241 New York Medicaid-enrolled children, longitudinal health care expenditures and utilization for cardiac surgical patients exceeded noncardiac surgical comparators (cardiac surgical children: $15,500 ± $62,000 per month in year 1 and $1,600 ± $9,100 per month in year 5 vs noncardiac surgical children: $700 ± $6,600 per month in year 1 and $300 ± $2,200 per month in year 5). Children after cardiac surgery spent 52.9 days in hospitals and doctors' offices in the first postoperative year and 90.5 days over 5 years. Being Hispanic, compared with non-Hispanic White, was associated with having more emergency department visits, inpatient admissions, and subspecialist visits in years 2 to 5, but fewer primary care visits and greater 5-year mortality. Children after cardiac surgery have significant longitudinal health care needs, even among those with less severe cardiac disease. Health care utilization differed by race/ethnicity, although mechanisms driving disparities should be investigated further. "

97,34455524,"Brief resolved unexplained events (BRUE) are concerning episodes of short duration (typically < 1 min) characterized by a change in breathing, consciousness, muscle tone (hyper- or hypotonia), and/or skin color (cyanosis or pallor). The episodes occur in a normal-appearing infant in the first year of life, self-resolve, and have no readily identifiable explanation for the cause of the event. Previously called apparent life-threatening events (ALTE), the term BRUE was first defined by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in 2016. The criteria for BRUE carry greater specificity compared to that of ALTE and additionally are indicative of a diagnosis of exclusion. While most patients with BRUE will have a benign clinical course, important etiologies, including airway, cardiac, gastrointestinal, genetic, infectious, neurologic, and traumatic conditions (including nonaccidental), must be carefully considered. A BRUE is classified as either lower- or higher-risk based on patient age, corrected gestational age, event duration, number of events, and performance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation at the scene. The AAP clinical practice guideline provides recommendations for the management of lower-risk BRUEs, advocating against routine admission, blood testing, and imaging for infants with these events, though a short period of observation and/or an electrocardiogram may be advisable. While guidance exists for higher-risk BRUE, more data are required to better identify proportions and risk factors for serious outcomes among these patients. Conclusion: BRUE is a diagnosis with greater specificity relative to prior definitions and is now a diagnosis of exclusion. Additional research is needed, particularly in the evaluation of higher-risk events. Recent data suggest that the AAP guidelines for the management of lower-risk infants can be safely implemented.This review article summarizes the history, definitional changes, current guideline recommendations, and future research needs for BRUE. What is Known: • BRUE, first described in 2016, is a diagnosis used to describe a well-appearing infant who presents with change in breathing, consciousness, muscle tone (hyper- or hypotonia), and/or skin color (cyanosis or pallor). • BRUE can be divided into higher- and lower-risk events. Guidelines have been published for lower-risk events, with expert recommendations for higher-risk BRUE. What is New: • BRUE carries a low rate of serious diagnoses (< 5%), with the most common representing seizures and airway abnormalities. • Prior BRUE events are associated with serious diagnoses and episode recurrence.

98,38727682,"Hepatoblastoma and HCC are the most common malignant hepatocellular tumors seen in children. The aim of this study was to develop a liquid biopsy test for circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for these tumors that would be less invasive and provide real-time information about tumor response to therapy. For this test, we utilized indocyanine green (ICG), a far-red fluorescent dye used clinically to identify malignant liver cells during surgery. We assessed ICG accumulation in cell lines using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. For our CTC test, we developed a panel of liver tumor-specific markers, including ICG, Glypican-3, and DAPI, and tested it with cell lines and noncancer control blood samples. We then used this panel to analyze whole-blood samples for CTC burden with a cohort of 15 patients with hepatoblastoma and HCC and correlated with patient characteristics and outcomes. We showed that ICG accumulation is specific to liver cancer cells, compared to nonmalignant liver cells, non-liver solid tumor cells, and other nonmalignant cells, and can be used to identify liver tumor cells in a mixed population of cells. Experiments with the ICG/Glypican-3/DAPI panel showed that it specifically tagged malignant liver cells. Using patient samples, we found that CTC burden from sequential blood samples from the same patients mirrored the patients' responses to therapy. Our novel ICG-based liquid biopsy test for CTCs can be used to specifically detect and quantify CTCs in the blood of pediatric patients with liver cancer. "

100,30919993,"The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of the novel ""superb microvascular imaging"" (SMI) Doppler ultrasound technique to detect ovarian vascularity in healthy children and to compare it with the conventional Doppler ultrasound techniques. This prospective study included 140 girls, aged 3 to 18 years, for which an abdominal ultrasound study was requested in the pediatrics outpatient clinics for suspicion of nonovarian pathologies. Nineteen individuals were excluded from the study due to incomplete ultrasound scanning. For the remaining 121 cases, gray scale ultrasound evaluation was performed followed by color Doppler imaging, power Doppler imaging, advanced dynamic flow, color SMI, and monochrome SMI to detect the presence and degree of vascularity in the ovaries. Ultrasound scanning was performed for all participants by the same doctor by using curvilinear probe via the suprapubic approach, and the images were independently evaluated by 3 different observers. The images were assessed with regard to the degree of vascularity and the presence of artifacts. A total of 146 ovaries (42 right, 54 left, and 25 bilateral) were examined by sonography. The mean interrater agreement regarding the detection of vascularity was moderate for the color Doppler imaging, power Doppler imaging, advanced dynamic flow, and monochrome SMI techniques (κ = 0.514-0.551) and substantial for the color SMI technique (κ = 0.636) (P < .001). The techniques were found to be statistically significant for detecting vascularity: monochrome SMI > color SMI > power Doppler imaging > color Doppler imaging > advanced dynamic flow (P < .001). SMI is a promising tool that can detect ovarian vascularity more effectively than the conventional Doppler ultrasound techniques. "
101,35916968,"Subgaleal drainage is often being used in craniotomy procedures. It's not only offers advantages but also carries a risk of life-threatening complications. Here, we present a rare case of subgaleal hematoma and skin necrosis caused by placement of subgaleal drainage in a pediatric patient after a craniotomy procedure. We reported a 6-months-old child who came to our institution complaining of uncontrolled eye movements which occurred 4 months earlier. From the CT scan and MRI, it was found that the patient had a mass in his suprasellar region, which suggested a suprasellar tumor. She underwent a mass resection procedure, but unfortunately, 3 days after the surgical procedure, the wound appeared necrotic, with a blackish color around the drain. The necrotic wound was suspected due to vacuum subgaleal drain placement. The wound was cleaned and the suture removed, but the necrotic area was still there. Four days after the surgery, the patient clinical condition got worse. After 17 days of treatment with no significant improvement, unfortunately, the patient died. The mechanism of subgaleal hematoma and skin necrosis induced by the Redon drain possibly related to mechanical compression by the drain, which damage perforating vessels and subsequently disrupt skin vascularization, combined with vascular stasis as given by negative pressure of the drain. This induced skin ischemia lesion which later contributes the necrotic formation. The subgaleal hematoma and skin necrosis as a complication of subgaleal redon drain in pediatric are rare phenomenon and likely under reported. The possible underlying mechanism was that drain's negative pressure disrupt subgaleal tissue and induce necrotic formation. Even the complication is rare compared to older children, yet it has been linked to an increased risk for infection, morbidity, and mortality. "
102,17002736,"To explore Bambara language terminology and classification for locally available antimicrobial medicines in order to better target promotional messages and improve evaluation measures in Bougouni District, Mali. Mothers (n = 20) and drug vendors (n = 15) were asked to freelist medicines used to treat childhood illnesses, and to identify all medicines that corresponded to each of the listed terms from an array of medicines displayed with their packaging. Each Bambara language medicine term can refer to numerous modern medicines, and each modern medicine has several Bambara names. The term nivakini (Nivaquine), often translated as 'chloroquine', refers to a wide range of medicines commonly used to treat malaria, many with no antimalarial effect. Antibiotics were also identified as common treatments for malaria. Mothers and vendors used slightly different terminology when discussing treatments for malaria, and sometimes employed the same term to refer to different medicines. Neither mothers nor vendors clearly differentiated between antimalarial medicines. Colour, shape and packaging play a large role in their recognition, classification and use. Current household survey methods are likely to provide inaccurate estimates of appropriate treatment of febrile illness, and thus alternative approaches are recommended. In introducing new malaria treatments, malaria control programmes should differentiate recommended treatments from other medications through distinctive packaging, drug appearance and appropriate Bambara language terms.

103,38511581,"The phenotypical manifestations of asthma among children are diverse and exhibit varying responses to therapeutic interventions. There is a need to develop objective biomarkers to improve the characterization of allergic and inflammatory responses relevant to asthma to predict therapeutic treatment responses. We have previously investigated histamine iontophoresis with laser Doppler flowmetry (HILD) as a potential surrogate biomarker that characterizes histamine response and may be utilized to guide the treatment of allergic and inflammatory disease. We have identified intra-individual variability of HILD response type among children and adults with asthma and that HILD response type varied in association with racial classification. As laser Doppler flowimetry may be impacted by skin color, we aimed to further validate the HILD method by determining if skin color or tone is associated with observed HILD response type differences. We conducted an observational study utilizing quantification of skin color and tone obtained from photographs of the skin among participants during HILD assessments via the RGB color model. We compared RGB values across racial, ethnic, and HILD response type via the Kruskal-Wallis test and calculated Kendall rank correlation coefficient to evaluate the relationship between RGB composite scores and HILD pharmacodynamic measures. We observed that RGB scores differed among racial groups and histamine response phenotypes (p < 0.05). However, there was a lack of correlation between the RGB composite score and HILD pharmacodynamic measures (r values 0.1, p > 0.05). These findings suggest that skin color may not impact HILD response variations, necessitating further research to understand previously observed differences across identified racial groups. "
104,14982289,"Recent technical improvements in cross-sectional echocardiography have made it possible to detect even mild organic regurgitation of the mitral and aortic valves in patients with acute rheumatic fever. To determine the prevalence and prognosis of subclinical valvitis, we have analyzed 104 patients with acute rheumatic fever referred to our institution. Of 53 patients who had no murmur, 22 of them with polyarthritis, 29 with chorea, and 2 with polyarthritis and chorea, 23 (43.4%) had subclinical valvitis. Isolated mitral regurgitation was the most common valvar lesion, seen in 82.6% of the patients. Isolated aortic regurgitation was detected in 4.4% of the cases, and combined mitral and aortic regurgitation in the remaining 13%. During follow-up, the degree of mitral regurgitation improved in 59.1%, decreased in 18.2%, and increased or remained unchanged in 22.7% according to the length of colour jet. According to criterions of velocity, mitral regurgitation improved in 86.4% of the patients, and increased or unchanged in the remaining 13.6%. Mitral regurgitation disappeared completely in 6 of the patients (27.3%) as judged according to both the length of colour jet and the velocity of regurgitation. Aortic regurgitation improved in all the patients with this problem, disappearing completely in two of the four. Based on this experience, we suggest that not only the disappearance of regurgitation, but also improvements in the echocardiographic diagnostic criterions of regurgitation, such as the length of the colour jet less than 1 cm, or velocity less than 2.5 m/s, or indicative of regurgitation that is either intermittent or of short duration, should also be considered as criterions indicating improvement in valvar regurgitation in patients with subclinical rheumatic valvitis.

105,1902531,"Retrospective analysis of 45 patients (33 females, 12 males) with cytologically-proven malignant ascites is presented. Abdominal pain was the most frequent symptom (69%). Fiftythree percent cases had low serum albumin. Ascitic fluid was haemorrhagic or serosanguinous in 48% cases, in the rest it was clear or straw-coloured. Peritoneal effusion was exudative in 84% cases. Mean glucose content of ascitic fluid was 95 mg/dl and the mean white cell count of 919 cells/cmm. Vast majority (82%) of the cases had metastatic adenocarcinomas. Primary malignancy was mostly ovarian (47%) followed by non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (11%) and gall bladder carcinoma (9%). Primary site could not be identified in 13% cases. Sixty-two percent patients received systemic chemotherapy for the underlying malignancy, of these 43% had complete or partial resolution of the ascites.

106,28651802,"Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a rare condition that can be difficult to diagnose by echocardiography alone. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical and echocardiographic presentation of ALCAPA, create a set of critical echocardiographic diagnostic criteria, and report outcomes. A retrospective review was conducted of all patients diagnosed with isolated ALCAPA at two major cardiac centers between 1990 and 2015. Of the 37 patients identified, only 54% presented in infancy. The anomalous coronary artery (CA) origin was clearly imaged in only 54% of echocardiographic examinations. However, other consistently identified echocardiographic markers were found, including left CA flow reversal (91%), collateral CA flow (85%), right CA dilation (81%), abnormal pulmonary artery flow (79%), mitral regurgitation (74%), left ventricular dysfunction (66%) and endocardial fibroelastosis (57%). Presenting echocardiograms had five of seven markers in 85% of patients. Left ventricular dysfunction was the most common marker in infants (89% vs 38%, P = .005); older children were more likely to have collateral formation visualized by color Doppler (100% vs 75%, P = .04). Following surgery, there were no early surgical deaths. The median follow-up duration was 10.3 years. At last follow-up, 92% had normal left ventricular function, 3% had moderate or worse mitral regurgitation, and 17% had required reintervention. Echocardiographic markers can reliably identify ALCAPA; these markers vary with the age of presentation. Surgical outcomes are excellent, and most patients will recover left ventricular and mitral valve function. "
107,38408647,"Firearms are now the number one killer of children and adolescents in the United States. Firearm homicides among Black male youth are the driver of this increase. Prevention requires a multi-faceted life course approach. Academic achievement has been identified as a protective factor. Early childhood education, which is linked to later achievement, is thus an intervention area of interest. Conceptualizing the potential links between early childhood education and reduced risk for youth firearm homicide is important for guiding policy advocacy and informing future research. This paper presents a conceptual model linking early childhood education to reduced risk for firearm homicide. Each link in the model is discussed, and a corresponding review of the literature is presented. The need for anti-racist policies to strengthen the impact of early childhood education is highlighted. Early education and firearm homicide research are each well-established but largely disconnected. There are clear immediate benefits of early childhood education; however, these effects wane with time, particularly for youth of color. At the same time, juvenile delinquency-a major risk factor for firearm homicide-is influenced by educational inequities. Effective interventions to reduce firearm homicides among Black male youth in the United States are needed. Early childhood education shows promise as an intervention. However, to have an impact, this education needs to be accessible and affordable for all, particularly families of color and low income. Societal structures and policies must also better support the positive gains seen through early childhood education to avoid dissipation. "
108,26563852,"This study sought to compare findings from institutional echocardiographic reports with imaging core laboratory (ICL) review of corresponding echocardiographic images and operative reports in 159 patients with anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery (AAOCA). The study also sought to develop a ""best practice"" protocol for imaging and interpreting images in establishing the diagnosis of AAOCA. AAOCA is associated with sudden death in the young. Underlying anatomic risk factors that can cause ischemia-related events include coronary arterial ostial stenosis, intramural course of the proximal coronary within the aortic wall, interarterial course, and potential compression between the great arteries. Consistent protocols for diagnosing and evaluating these features are lacking, potentially precluding the ability to risk stratify patients based on evidence and plan surgical strategy. For a prescribed set of anatomic AAOCA features, percentages of missing data in institutional echocardiographic reports were calculated. For each feature, agreement among institutional echocardiographic reports, ICL review of images, and surgical reports was evaluated using the weighted kappa statistic. An echocardiographic imaging protocol was developed heuristically to reduce differences between institutional reports and ICL review. A total of 13%, 33%, and 62% of echocardiograms were missing images enabling diagnosis of intra-arterial course, proximal intramural course, and high ostial takeoff, respectively. There was poor agreement between institutional reports and ICL review for diagnosis of origin of coronary artery, interarterial course, intramural course, and acute angle takeoff (kappa = 0.74, 0.11, -0.03, 0.13, respectively). Surgical findings were also significantly different from those of reports, and to a lesser extent ICL reviews. The resulting protocol contains technical recommendations for imaging each of these features. Poor agreement between institutional reports and ICL review for AAOCA suggests need for an imaging protocol to permit evidence-based risk stratification and surgical planning. Even then, delineation of echocardiographic details in AAOCA will remain imperfect. "
109,16585282,"Family history of skin cancer is an important determinant of skin cancer risk for offspring. No previous study of the effect of personal or family history of skin cancer on the sun protection behaviors of the offspring has been published. A retrospective study was conducted of the sun protection behaviors of the adolescent participants in the Growing Up Today Study (GUTS), who were offspring of mothers from the Nurses Health Study II. Adolescents' surveys were matched with their mothers' reports of a personal or family history of skin cancer and compared with adolescents whose mothers did not report a personal or family history of skin cancer. The outcome measures were (1) occurrence of frequent sunburns during the past summer, (2) use of a tanning bed during the past year, and (3) routine use of sunscreen. Frequent sunburns were defined as the report of > or = 3 sunburns during the past summer. We compared those who reported having used a tanning bed in the past year at least once with those who reported no tanning bed use in the past year. Routine use of sunscreen was defined as a respondent who replied that he or she ""always"" or ""often"" used sunscreen with sun protection factor of 15 or more when he or she was outside for > 15 minutes on a sunny day during the past summer. General estimating equations were used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals adjusted for gender, age, color of untanned skin, and number of friends who were tanned. We also conducted an additional analysis restricted to children whose mothers had received a diagnosis of skin cancer in which we assessed sun protection behaviors according to the child's age and mother's age at the time of the mother's diagnosis and the number of years that had passed since the diagnosis of the mother's skin cancer. In 1999, 9943 children reported their sun protection behaviors; 8697 of their mothers had not received a diagnosis of skin cancer or reported a family history of melanoma, 463 participants' mothers had received a diagnosis of skin cancer, and 783 participants' mothers reported a family history of melanoma. Between 1989 and 1999, 371 mothers of GUTS participants received a diagnosis of skin cancer: melanoma (n = 44), squamous cell (n = 39), and basal cell cancer (n = 311); 23 mothers received a diagnosis of > 1 type of skin cancer. Because GUTS includes siblings from the same family, the 371 mothers with skin cancer had 463 offspring in GUTS. Offspring of mothers with skin cancer were slightly more likely to report frequent sunburns in the past year compared with those with neither maternal diagnosis nor family history (39% vs 36%). Tanning bed use was not significantly different among those with either a maternal diagnosis of skin cancer or family history of melanoma as compared with nonaffected adolescents (8% vs 9% vs 10%). Sunscreen use among offspring of mothers with skin cancer was higher than among those whose mothers had a family history of melanoma or mothers with no personal history of skin cancer (42% vs 33% vs 34%). Tan-promoting attitudes were also similar across all groups. Only 25% thought that a natural skin color was most attractive, and on average, 25% in each group agreed that it was worth burning to get a tan. Children of mothers who had received a diagnosis > 2 years in the past were less likely to use sunscreen, more likely to sunburn, and more likely to use tanning beds than children of mothers with a more recent diagnosis, although the results did not reach statistical significance. Frequent sunburns, suboptimal sunscreen use, and high rates of tanning bed use are commonplace even among the children of health professionals who are at risk for developing skin cancer themselves as a result of personal or family history. With new information on family risk, pediatricians can use the potential of a teachable moment to ensure optimal sun protection for children who are at risk. "

112,10431617,"The aim of the present retrospective study was to observe the clinical and radiographic performances of a compomer (Dyract) in proximal restorations of primary molars as compared to amalgam restorations. The study was performed at the principal investigator's office. Children between three to eleven years old, who had at least two primary molars with a small to moderate approximal caries lesion were included in the study. The assessed material consisted of 107 proximal restorations (63 Dyract and 44 amalgam) placed in primary molars during the years 1994 to 1997 in forty-two children who were available for follow-up examinations. All the evaluated restorations were clinically acceptable, with smooth surface appearance, satisfactory color match, neither secondary caries nor fracture. The margins of two Dyract restorations presented minimal stain. Of the 63 Dyract restorations evaluated radiographically, two presented with bubbles, one with an overhang, and nine had pooling at the tooth-restoration interface. Minimal overhangs were disclosed in six amalgam restorations, and neither bubbles nor defects were seen at the tooth-restoration interface. These differences were statistically significant (p < 0.001). Based on the clinical performance of the material and on the radiographic findings, the authors conclude that Dyract can be a suitable alternative for restoring primary teeth that need to be retained up to two years. More extensive follow-up is needed to assess longer-term performance. "

114,34622880,"Pharmaceutical poisoning in children is almost unintentional and there are various types of drug out of curiosity. Understanding the attractive features and formulation of drugs related to poisoning in younger children may be helpful in treatment and prevention of poisoning. To investigate the impact of drug formulation on outcomes of pharmaceutical poisoning in young children.We retrospectively reviewed the data of pharmaceutical exposures among children who were registered in a Korean 23-center, emergency department (ED) based registry from 2011 to 2016. Our study was conducted on preschool children aged 0 to 7 years. According to the formulation and category of the ingested drugs, the exposures were divided into the ""tablet and capsule (TAC)"" and ""syrup"" groups. In the TAC group, we additionally recorded data on the shape, color, and size of the drugs. The ED outcomes, such as hospitalization and length of stay, were compared between the 2 groups.Among the 970 enrolled exposures, 674 (69.5%) were classified into the TAC group. In this group, hormones/hormone antagonists (18.5%) were the most commonly ingested, followed by central nervous system drugs (17.1%). In the syrup group, antihistamines (28.4%) were the most commonly ingested, followed by respiratory drugs (24.3%). The TAC group showed a higher hospitalization and transfer rate to tertiary centers than the counterpart (TAC, 18.0% vs syrup, 11.5%, P = .03) without a significant difference in the length of stay (TAC, 173.5 minutes [interquartile range, 95.0-304.0] vs syrup, 152.5 [77.5-272.0]; P = .08). No in-hospital mortality occurred in the exposures. Round-shaped and chromatic TACs, accounting for 91.7% (618) and 56.1% (378), respectively, were more commonly ingested. The median size of the TACs was less than 1.0 cm.Young children who visited the ED ingested TACs more frequently than syrups, particularly small, round-shaped, or chromatic drugs, leading to a higher hospitalization rate. Our findings can contribute to prevention strategies and safety education on childhood drug poisoning. "

Treating children of color is a unique skill set within the field of pediatric dermatology, requiring knowledge and sensitivity. The discipline of pediatric skin of color can be challenging. Difficulty in diagnosis of common conditions stems from underlying pigmentation, variations in common hairstyling practices, and differences in demographics of cutaneous disease, whereas some conditions are more common in children of color, other conditions have nuances in clinical appearance and/or therapeutics with regard to skin color. This article is the first in a series of two articles looking at recently published skin-related issues of high concern in children of color. Conditions reviewed in Part 1 include (1) hairstyling hair-related concerns (traction alopecia, central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, endocrine disruption), (2) autoimmune concerns (cutaneous lupus, vitiligo), and (3) infections (tinea capitis, progressive macular hypomelanosis).

117,11860907,"To assay the effect of green and yellow vegetables on serum carotenoid concentration and its relation to serum retinol level in children. A ten-week green and yellow vegetable intervention study was conducted in children aged 5.3 to 6.4 years of two classes in a kindergarten in Tai'an City of Shandong Province in early September 1996, one class of light-colored vegetable supplemented with daily 193 grams of light colored vegetables, such as cabbage, Chinese cabbage, potato, cucumber, cauliflower and turnip, and 56 grams of yellow-green vegetables, such as spinach, Chinese chive, carrots and red yams; and the other one of yellow-green vegetables with daily 238 grams of yellow-green vegetables and 34 grams of light colored vegetables, both without change in regular diet. Venous blood specimens were collected before and after the experiment from each of the subjects. Serum retinol and carotenoid were determined with high performance liquid chromatography. Serum level of carotenoid, including all-trans-beta-carotene, cis-beta-carotene, cryptoxanthin and lutein were significantly higher after intervention in yellow-green vegetable group, as compared to their baseline levels. However, in the light-colored vegetable group, all those components, including all-trans-beta-carotene, 13-cis-beta-carotene and lutein, decreased significantly after intervention, as compared with those at their baseline levels. Serum carotene level correlated significantly with that of retinol, and their coefficient of correlation was greater in the winter than in the autumn. Carotenoid nutrition status can be improved by supplementation of green and yellow vegetables. "
118,25875844,"Acupuncture has been shown to treat various medical conditions, including acute and chronic pain, and there is limited evidence that acupuncture produces anti-inflammatory effects. This pilot study evaluated the use of acupuncture to treat pain and determine if acupuncture can reduce the inflammatory response in pediatric patients diagnosed with acute appendicitis. This pilot study used convenience sampling and was conducted in the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) of an urban tertiary care children's hospital. Patients conventionally evaluated and definitively diagnosed with appendicitis were eligible to voluntarily participate. The diagnostic homogeneity of the target population allowed for a standardized intervention protocol. A licensed acupuncturist performed a specific form of Japanese acupuncture known as the Kiiko Matsumoto Style on all study patients. Subjective pain was assessed immediately before the intervention and 20 minutes postintervention, using 3 measures: Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R), colored analog scale (CAS), and visual analog scale (VAS). Evidence of inflammation was assessed using two biomarkers: white blood cell (WBC) count and C-reactive protein (CRP). WBC and CRP were drawn and recorded 3 times: before the intervention, 2 minutes before removal of needles, and 30 minutes after needling. Six Latino/Hispanic patients (4 males, 2 females, median age=15 years) with no previous acupuncture experience participated in the study. Median pre/postacupuncture pain scores were as follows: FPS-R, 5 vs. 4; CAS, 6.1 vs. 4.8; VAS, 46 vs. 32. Median WBC (10(3)/μL) and CRP (mg/dL) across time were as follows: WBC, 13.2, 11.8, and 11.4; CRP, 4.5, 4.9, and 5.1. Median acupuncture duration was 28.5 minutes (range 22-32) and no complications were observed. Pilot data suggest that acupuncture may be a feasible and effective treatment modality for decreasing subjective pain and inflammation as measured by WBC. Acupuncture may be a useful nonpharmacological PED intervention for treating patients with acute appendicitis pain. "
119,20658930,"There are few studies of the developmental changes in B-cell subsets in children. Recent data from adult populations demonstrate that alterations to B-cell subsets have functional consequences and can be helpful diagnostically. Comparable studies in children have been hindered by the lack of normative data and by significant changes with age. This study evaluated B-cell subsets by 4-color flow cytometry in 47 children of different ages. The use of a 4-color platform is compatible with broad use in clinical laboratories. We found that there are rapid changes in the B-cell compartment in infancy and early childhood. Total B-cell numbers decline early in life, and this correlates with a decline in transitional B cells and naïve B cells. The decline is most rapid between 1 and 5 years of age, with a slower decline later in childhood. In contrast, nonswitched and switched memory B cells both increase during the 1st 5 years of life. The decline in B-cell numbers did not occur until after 1 year of age, suggesting that the period after birth is a unique developmental window. These data provide a reference set for further studies on B-cell dysfunction in pediatric disorders. The changes occurring in early childhood document the need for age-related assessments and serve to underscore the B-cell-specific kinetics of immunologic development in humans. "
120,26176297,"Painometer is a mobile application that includes four pain intensity scales: the Numerical Rating Scale, the Faces Pain Scale-Revised, the mechanical visual analogue scale and the Colored Analogue Scale. The aim of this study was to analyze the validity and agreement of the intensity reports provided by these scales and their traditional counterparts. Participants were 180 young people (mean age = 14.88; SD= 1.64; age range: 12-19). They were asked to report the maximum intensity of their most frequent pain in the previous three months using traditional and electronic versions of the scales. They also reported their level of fatigue and pain catastrophizing. Construct validity was evaluated by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and by convergent and discriminant validity. Criterion validity was assessed as concurrent validity. Agreement was calculated using the Bland and Altman method. Analyses were conducted for two confidence intervals (CI): 95% and 80%. CFA demonstrated that the four electronic versions of the scales measure a single factor. All the scales showed a) moderate to high convergent validity, b) adequate discriminant validity with fatigue ratings, and c) adequate concurrent validity with pain catastrophizing ratings. Results also show that traditional and electronic versions of the four scales are in agreement, at least at the 80% CI. Our results demonstrate that pain intensity scores reported with the scales in Painometer are valid, and concordant with their traditional counterparts. "

In all cases, operative findings were consistent with malrotation of the small bowel with or without evidence of midgut volvulus. "
122,35546925,"Experiences of stress and adversity, such as intimate partner violence, confer risk for psychiatric problems across the life span. The effects of these risks are disproportionately borne by women and their offspring-particularly those from communities of color. The prenatal period is an especially vulnerable period of fetal development, during which time women's experiences of stress can have long-lasting implications for offspring mental health. Importantly, there is a lack of focus on women's capacity for resilience and potential postnatal protective factors that might mitigate these intergenerational risks and inform intervention efforts. The present study examined intergenerational associations between women's prenatal stressors and child executive functioning and externalizing problems, testing maternal parenting quality and child sex as moderators, using a large, prospective, sociodemographically diverse cohort. We used data from 1,034 mother-child dyads (64% Black, 30% White) from the Conditions Affecting Neurocognitive Development and Learning in Early Childhood (CANDLE) pregnancy cohort within the ECHO PATHWAYS consortium. Women's prenatal stressors included stressful life events (pSLE) and intimate partner violence (pIPV). Measures of child psychopathology at age 4-6 included executive functioning and externalizing problems. Parenting behaviors were assessed by trained observers, averaged across two sessions of mother-child interactions. Linear regression models were used to estimate associations between women's prenatal stressors and child psychopathology, adjusting for confounders and assessing moderation effects by maternal parenting quality and child sex. Women's exposures to pSLE and pIPV were independently associated with child executive functioning problems and externalizing problems in fully-adjusted models. Maternal parenting quality moderated associations between pSLE and both outcomes, such that higher parenting quality was protective for the associations between women's pSLE and child executive functioning and externalizing problems. No moderation by child sex was found. Findings from this large, sociodemographically diverse cohort suggest women's exposures to interpersonal violence and major stressful events-common for women during pregnancy-may prenatally program her child's executive functioning and externalizing problems. Women's capacity to provide high quality parenting can buffer this intergenerational risk. Implications for universal and targeted prevention and early intervention efforts to support women's and children's wellbeing are discussed. "
123,26880232,"Body shape and size are typically described using measures such as body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference, which predict disease risks in adults. However, this approach may underestimate the true variability in childhood body shape and size. To use a comprehensive three-dimensional photonic scan approach to describe variation in childhood body shape and size. At age 6 years, 3350 children from the population-based 2004 Pelotas birth cohort study were assessed by three-dimensional photonic scanner, traditional anthropometry and dual X-ray absorptiometry. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on height and 24 photonic scan variables (circumferences, lengths/widths, volumes and surface areas). PCA identified four independent components of children's body shape and size, which we termed: Corpulence, Central:peripheral ratio, Height and arm lengths, and Shoulder diameter. Corpulence showed strong correlations with traditional anthropometric and body composition measures (r>0.90 with weight, BMI, waist circumference and fat mass; r>0.70 with height, lean mass and bone mass); in contrast, the other three components showed weak or moderate correlations with those measures (all r<0.45). There was no sex difference in Corpulence, but boys had higher Central:peripheral ratio, Height and arm lengths and Shoulder diameter values than girls. Furthermore, children with low birth weight had lower Corpulence and Height and arm lengths but higher Central:peripheral ratio and Shoulder diameter than other children. Children from high socio-economic position (SEP) families had higher Corpulence and Height and arm lengths than other children. Finally, white children had higher Corpulence and Central:peripheral ratio than mixed or black children. Comprehensive assessment by three-dimensional photonic scanning identified components of childhood body shape and size not captured by traditional anthropometry or body composition measures. Differences in these novel components by sex, birth weight, SEP and skin colour may indicate their potential relevance to disease risks. "

Diagnosis relies upon culture, acid-fast bacilli (AFB) staining, chest radiograph, purified protein derivative (PPD) test, and clinical features. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may provide valuable information in the work-up of children with cervical masses. We reviewed 11 CT and 5 MR studies of children with a clinical diagnosis of NTM infection. Specific findings included stranding of the subcutaneous fat, thickening and enhancement of the overlying skin, obliteration of the tissue palnes, and multichambered masses. One patient had calcifications within the mass. MR with contrast better demonstrated the soft tissues and is our recommended imaging modality, although CT is more likely to detect calcifications within the neck mass. "

This study performed a post hoc analysis of data from a 30-month randomized trial of atropine 0.01% versus placebo in children 5 to <13 years old with baseline spherical equivalent refractive error (SER) of -1.00 to -6.00 D, astigmatism of ≤1.50 D, and anisometropia of <1.00 D SER. Data from atropine 0.01% and placebo groups were pooled given outcomes were similar. Baseline factors of age, SER, axial length, race, sex, parental myopia, and iris color were evaluated for association with changes in SER and with changes in axial length at 30 months (24 months on treatment and then 6 months off) using backward model selection. Among 187 randomized participants, 175 (94%) completed 30 months of follow-up. The mean change in SER was greater among younger children (-0.19 D per 1 year younger; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.25 to -0.14 D; p<0.001) and children with higher myopia (-0.14 D per 1 D more myopia at baseline; 95% CI, -0.23 to -0.05 D; p=0.002). The mean change in axial length was also greater among younger children (0.13 mm per 1 year younger; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.15 mm; p<0.001) and children with higher baseline myopia (0.04 mm per 1 D more myopia; 95% CI, 0.002 to 0.08; p=0.04). Younger children with higher myopia had greater myopic progression and axial elongation over 30 months than older children with lower myopia. Developing effective treatments to slow the faster myopic progression in younger children should be a target of further research. "
127,38819316,"Following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), children show reduced processing speed (PS). Evidence suggests that slowed PS after TBI is associated with working memory deficits. Our aim was to investigate several forms of PS and to examine its impact on working and episodic memory performance in children after mTBI. We included data of 64 children after mTBI and 57 healthy control children aged 8-16 years. PS (Color Naming, Coding, Symbol Search, Alertness) was compared between groups 1 week (T1) and 3-6 months (T2) after the injury; working and episodic memory outcome was compared between groups at T2. Alertness at T1 and Color Naming at T1 and T2 were significantly reduced following mTBI compared to controls, although most group differences in PS disappeared when patients with previous impairments and mTBI were excluded. PS was predictive for episodic and working memory performance 3-6 months after injury, whereas group was a significant predictor of working memory. Compared to healthy controls, children after mTBI showed reduced performance in verbal PS, which was associated with working memory. In children who are symptomatic after mTBI, diagnostic screening of PS could be helpful in identifying patients that could profit from speed-improving strategies. "
128,26932497,"Photographing injuries in the acute setting allows for improved documentation as well as assessment by clinicians and others who have not personally examined a patient. This tool is important, particularly for telemedicine, tracking of wound healing, the evaluation of potential abuse, and injury research. Despite this, protocols to ensure standardization of photography in clinical practice, forensics, or research have not been published. In preparation for a study of injury patterns in elder abuse and geriatric falls, our goal was to develop and evaluate a protocol for standardized photography of injuries that may be broadly applied. We conducted a literature review for techniques and standards in medical, forensic, and legal photography. We developed a novel protocol describing types of photographs and body positioning for eight body regions, including instructional diagrams. We revised it iteratively in consultation with experts in medical photography; forensics; and elder, child, and domestic abuse. The resulting protocol requires a minimum of four photos of each injury at multiple distances with and without a ruler/color guide. To evaluate the protocol's efficacy, multiple research assistants without previous photography experience photographed injuries from a convenience sample of elderly patients presenting to a single large, urban, academic emergency department. A selection of these patients' images were then evaluated in a blinded fashion by four nontreating emergency medicine physicians and the inter-rater reliability between these physicians was calculated. Among the 131 injuries, from 53 patients, photographed by 18 photographers using this protocol, photographs of 25 injuries (10 bruises, seven lacerations, and eight abrasions) were used to assess characterization of the injury. Physicians' characterizations of the injuries were reliable for the size of the injury (κ = 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.77 to 1.00), side of the body (κ = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.88 to 1.00), precise location of the injury (κ = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.63 = 0.81), and type of abrasion (κ = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.45 to 1.00). The exact shape of the injury (κ = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.17 to 0.51), and the primary color of bruises (κ = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.25 to 0.48) were not as reliably characterized. Standardizing the documentation of injuries with photographs for clinical and research assessment can be conducted by nonprofessional photographers. A photography protocol will ensure that this important mechanism for documentation is optimized. "
129,36646659,"Women are particularly susceptible to mental health challenges during the perinatal period. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, much concern was raised about the impact that the associated isolation, uncertainty, grief, loss and economic upheaval would have on mental health. Women experienced a disproportionate amount of environmental strain during this time, including economic stress and challenges associated with being essential workers; stressors were perhaps most prevalent in communities of color and immigrant groups. For women who were pregnant during the height of the pandemic, it is clear that stress, anxiety, and depression were increased due to changes in medical care and decreases in social support. Increased mental health challenges in the perinatal period have been shown to impact social-emotional, cognitive and behavioral health in infants and children, so the potential consequences of the COVID-19 era are great. This paper discusses these potential impacts and describes important pathways for future research. "
130,24725835,"Autograft dilatation (AD) and aortic insufficiency (AI) after the Ross procedure are the most common causes of late autograft failure. The purpose of this study was to examine the results of valve-sparing root replacement (modified David) and composite root replacement. We performed a retrospective review of all children (n=78) undergoing a Ross procedure at our Center from 1993 to 2011. Median follow-up was 10 years (1to 18 years). Freedom from autograft reoperation was 94% at 5 years, and 65% at 15 years. Freedom from greater than 2+ autograft AI was 93% at 5 years and 76% at 15 years. Autograft reoperation was necessary in 22 patients, at a median interval of 8.7 years after the original procedure. Indications for reoperation were AI with autograft dilatation in 15 patients, AI without dilatation in 2 patients, and AD without AI in 5 patients. Surgical procedures used at reoperation included valve-sparing root replacement in 14 patients, root replacement either mechanical or biologic valved conduit in 6 patients, and valve replacement in 2 patients. At a mean follow-up of 5.8 years after reoperation, 4 patients from the valve-sparing group underwent second reoperation (valve replacement). Freedom from second autograft reoperation was 71% for patients after a valve sparing procedure and 100% for patients after an aortic valve or root replacement (Bentall procedure) at 5 years. Autograft valve-sparing root replacement and composite aortic root replacement are effective treatments for aortic root dilation and AI after the Ross procedure. The potential of late autograft insufficiency after valve-sparing root replacement warrants annual follow-up. "
131,20596701,"Initial experience of dual-source dual-energy (DE) lung perfusion CT in children is described. In addition to traditional identification of pulmonary emboli, the assessment of lung perfusion is technically feasible with dual-source DE CT in children with acceptable radiation dose. This article describes how to perform dual-source DE lung perfusion CT in children, including the optimization of intravenous injection method and CT dose parameters. How to produce weighted-average CT images for the assessment of pulmonary emboli and colour-coded perfusion maps for the assessment of regional lung perfusion is also detailed. Lung perfusion status can then be evaluated on perfusion maps by means of either qualitative or quantitative analysis. Potential advantages and disadvantages of this emerging CT technique compared to lung perfusion scintigraphy and cardiac MRI are discussed. "
132,27539806,"The poor health of South Africans is known to be associated with a quadruple disease burden. In the second National Burden of Disease (NBD) study, we aimed to analyse cause of death data for 1997-2012 and develop national, population group, and provincial estimates of the levels and causes of mortality. We used underlying cause of death data from death notifications for 1997-2012 obtained from Statistics South Africa. These data were adjusted for completeness using indirect demographic techniques for adults and comparison with survey and census estimates for child mortality. A regression approach was used to estimate misclassified HIV/AIDS deaths and so-called garbage codes were proportionally redistributed by age, sex, and population group population group (black African, Indian or Asian descent, white [European descent], and coloured [of mixed ancestry according to the preceding categories]). Injury deaths were estimated from additional data sources. Age-standardised death rates were calculated with mid-year population estimates and the WHO age standard. Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation Global Burden of Disease (IHME GBD) estimates for South Africa were obtained from the IHME GHDx website for comparison. All-cause age-standardised death rates increased rapidly since 1997, peaked in 2006 and then declined, driven by changes in HIV/AIDS. Mortality from tuberculosis, non-communicable diseases, and injuries decreased slightly. In 2012, HIV/AIDS caused the most deaths (29·1%) followed by cerebrovascular disease (7·5%) and lower respiratory infections (4·9%). All-cause age-standardised death rates were 1·7 times higher in the province with the highest death rate compared to the province with the lowest death rate, 2·2 times higher in black Africans compared to whites, and 1·4 times higher in males compared with females. Comparison with the IHME GBD estimates for South Africa revealed substantial differences for estimated deaths from all causes, particularly HIV/AIDS and interpersonal violence. This study shows the reversal of HIV/AIDS, non-communicable disease, and injury mortality trends in South Africa during the study period. Mortality differentials show the importance of social determinants, raise concerns about the quality of health services, and provide relevant information to policy makers for addressing inequalities. Differences between GBD estimates for South Africa and this study emphasise the need for more careful calibration of global models with local data.

133,29573458,"A variety of local and systemic processes caused exogenous and endogenous pigmentation of the oral mucosa. Solitary melanotic pigmentation is rare, hence the scarce number of studies in children and adolescents. Clinical and histopathologic features of 10 Latin American children with solitary pigmented lesions of the oral mucosa were reviewed. The area most affected was the gingiva, followed by the palate. All lesions were flat and <1 cm in diameter. A brown color was observed in oral melanocytic macules and nevi. The exogenously pigmented lesion was bluish gray. Histopathology showed that the biopsied lesions corresponded to melanotic macules, junctional nevus, blue nevus, and exogenous pigmentation. Solitary pigmented lesions on the oral mucosa of children, from melanin pigment or exogenous pigment, may have a similar clinical presentation, but melanotic lesions such as oral melanotic macules and nevi can be differentiated from one another only with histopathologic examination.

134,21395672,"Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a promising approach to improve cardiac function in children in heart failure with cardiomyopathy. Cardiac timing measures in pediatrics are typically based on age and heart rate. However, pediatric CRT studies to date have used adult based timing cutoff values. We investigated the applicability of using these adult standards in pediatric patients with normal hearts. We studied 88 outpatients referred for cardiac evaluation who had a normal cardiac evaluation. Subjects had 12 lead EKG and normal echocardiogram. Patients with known heart disease or abnormal rhythms were excluded. 2D echo and Doppler including color tissue Doppler imaging (TDI, Vivid 7 GE Ultrasound, Norway) were obtained. TDI was performed on three standard apical views (four chamber, two chamber, and long axis). Longitudinal dyssynchrony was determined from (1) Yu index--standard deviation of differences in timing of peak TDI velocity of all 12 basal and mid LV wall segments, adult cutoff >32 ms and (2) opposing wall difference (OWD) in timing of peak TDI velocity of 12 LV wall segments, adult cutoff >65 ms. Radial dyssynchrony was determined from differences in timing of peak radial strain between anterior-septal and posterior LV segments from speckle tracking of 2D LV views, adult cutoff >130 ms. Median age was 11.5 years; median heart rate was 74.5. Longitudinal dyssynchrony was present in 40% of normals based on Yu index, and in 43% based on OWD. No child had Radial dyssynchrony. This pilot study of children with normal hearts suggests that current adult CRT dyssynchrony cutoff values are inappropriate in the pediatric population. "
135,36970005,"Endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) is a diffuse endocardial collagen and elastin hyperplasia disease of unknown etiology, which may be accompanied by myocardial degenerative changes leading to acute or chronic heart failure. However, acute heart failure (AHF) without obvious associated triggers is rare. Prior to the report of endomyocardial biopsy, the diagnosis and treatment of EFE are highly susceptible to being confounded with other primary cardiomyopathies. Here, we report a case of pediatric AHF caused by EFE mimicking dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), with the aim of providing a valuable reference for clinicians to early identify and diagnose EFE-induced AHF. A 13-mo-old female child was admitted to hospital with retching. Chest X-ray demonstrated enhanced texture in both lungs and an enlarged heart shadow. Color doppler echocardiography showed an enlarged left heart with ventricular wall hypokinesis and decreased left heart function. Abdominal color ultrasonography revealed a markedly enlarged liver. Pending the result of the endomyocardial biopsy report, the child was treated with a variety of resuscitative measures including nasal cannula for oxygen, intramuscular sedation with chlorpromazine and promethazine, cedilanid for cardiac contractility enhancement, and diuretic treatment with furosemide. Subsequently, the child's endomyocardial biopsy report result was confirmed as EFE. After the above early interventions, the child's condition gradually stabilized and improved. One week later, the child was discharged. During a 9-mo follow-up period, the child took intermittent low-dose oral digoxin with no signs of recurrence or exacerbation of the heart failure. Our report suggests that EFE-induced pediatric AHF may present in children over 1 year of age without any apparent precipitants, and that the associated clinical presentations are grossly similar to that of pediatric DCM. Nonetheless, it is still possible to be diagnosed effectively on the basis of the comprehensive analysis of auxiliary inspection findings before the result of the endomyocardial biopsy is reported. "
136,37748334,"The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical potential of immune microenvironment in peripheral blood for the severity and therapeutic efficacy of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). A total of 200 newly diagnosed children with LCH during 10 years was enrolled for analysis in this study. Peripheral blood samples were acquired from patients before treatment in our hospital and immune indicators were detected by a four-color flow cytometer. The levels of CD3 + CD8 + T cell, CD3 + CD4 + HLA-DR + T cell, CD3 + CD8 + HLA-DR + T cell, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-γ in peripheral blood were markedly elevated in LCH patients vs. healthy controls. Patients with multiple system with risk organ involvement (MS-RO + ) exhibited higher levels in IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-γ, CD3 + CD4 + HLA-DR + T cell and CD3 + CD8 + HLA-DR + T cell, compared to those in patients without risk organ involvement (RO-). Patients who responded effectively to initial chemotherapy showed significantly lower levels of IL-4, IL-10, IFN-γ, CD3 + CD4 + HLA-DR + T cell and CD3 + CD8 + HLA-DR + T cell in peripheral blood, compared to those in patients who did not respond to initial chemotherapy. Furthermore, univariate analyses were performed that the higher levels of CD3 + CD4 + HLA-DR + T cells, CD3 + CD8 + HLA-DR + T cells and IL-10 in peripheral blood were related to non-response in LCH after initial chemotherapy. Immune microenvironment in peripheral blood may be associated with the severity and treatment response of LCH. The levels of CD3 + CD4 + HLA-DR + T cells, CD3 + CD8 + HLA-DR + T cells and IL-10 may be biomarkers to predict treatment response of LCH patients. "
137,32726279,"Pulmonary hypertension, associated with high mortality in pediatric patients, is traditionally screened for by trained professionals by measuring a tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRJV). Our objective was to test the feasibility of novice physician sonographers (NPS) to perform echocardiograms of adequate quality to exclude pathology (defined as TRJV > 2.5 meters per second). We conducted a cross-sectional study of NPS to assess TRJV by echocardiogram in an urban pediatric emergency department. NPS completed an educational course consisting of a didactic curriculum and hands-on workshop. NPS enrolled a convenience sample of patients aged 7-21 years. Our primary outcome was the proportion of echocardiograms with images of adequate quality to exclude pathology. Our secondary outcome was NPS performance on four image elements. We present descriptive statistics, binomial proportions, kappa coefficients, and logistic regression analysis. Eight NPS completed 80 echocardiograms. We found 82.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 74.2-90.8) of echocardiograms had images of adequate quality to exclude pathology. Among image elements, NPS obtained a satisfactory, apical 4-chamber view in 85% (95% CI, 77.1-92.9); positioned the color box accurately 65% (95% CI, 54.5-75.5); optimized TRJV color signal 78.7% (95% CI, 69.8-87.7); and optimized continuous-wave Doppler in 55% (95% CI, 44.1-66.0) of echocardiograms. NPS obtained images of adequate quality to exclude pathology in a majority of studies; however, optimized acquisition of specific image elements varied. This work establishes the basis for future study of NPS assessment of TRJV pathology when elevated pulmonary pressures are of clinical concern. "
138,12632895,"This paper presents the echocardiographic assessment of early and midterm results of transcatheter closure of a narrow patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in children using Jackson and Gianturco coils. The preliminary criterion for qualifying patients for the procedure was the PDA diameter (< or = 4 mm) at the narrowest site, as assessed echocardiographically. The criterion was met by 22 of 116 children with PDA treated at the Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Faculty of Medicine, Jagiellonian University, between January 1, 1996 and December 31, 2000. Angiography revealed, that in one case, the PDA diameter was larger (6.5 mm) and the patient required two Gianturco coils. Of 22 patients (8 males and 14 females) aged 2.7-16 years (x = 6.5 +/- 3.8), the procedure was successful in 21 children (95.5%). One patient with PDA was referred to the surgical department due to complications (the coil was displaced to the periphery of the left pulmonary artery and required removal by an Amplatzer device). The analysis of the follow-up echocardiography performed within 48 hours after the procedure and 1, 6, 12, 24 and 48 months later, revealed immediate total PDA closure in 29% of children. In 33% of patients, the PDA closed within 24 months. One child did not report to follow-up, however, the others are asymptomatic and show residual negligible shunts. The authors determined that the incidence and time of closure of residual shunts is dependent on the magnitude of the left-to-right shunt before the procedure. "
139,25439303,"To describe an ophthalmic phenotype in children at relatively early stages of Wolfram syndrome. Quantitative ophthalmic testing of visual acuity, color vision, automated visual field sensitivity, optic nerve pallor and cupping, and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed in 18 subjects 5-25 years of age. Subjects were also examined for presence or absence of afferent pupillary defects, cataracts, nystagmus, and strabismus. Subnormal visual acuity was detected in 89% of subjects, color vision deficits in 94%, visual field defects in 100%, optic disk pallor in 94%, abnormally large optic nerve cup:disk ratio in 33%, thinned RNFL in 100%, afferent pupillary defects in 61%, cataracts in 22%, nystagmus in 39%, and strabismus in 39% of subjects. RNFL thinning (P < 0.001), afferent pupillary defects (P = 0.01), strabismus (P = 0.04), and nystagmus (P = 0.04) were associated with more severe disease using the Wolfram United Rating Scale. Children and adolescents with Wolfram syndrome have multiple ophthalmic markers that correlate with overall disease severity. RNFL thickness measured by OCT may be the most reliable early marker. "
140,38748631,"Since European settlement, the United States has controlled the reproduction of communities of color through tactics ranging from forced pregnancies, sterilizations, and abortions to immigration policies and policies that separate children from their families. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (or questioning), asexual, intersex, and gender diverse people (LGBTQIA+) have been persecuted for sexual behavior and gender expression, and also restricted from having children. In response, women of color and LGBTQIA+ communities have organized for Reproductive Justice (RJ) and liberation. The Reproductive Justice framework, conceived in 1994 by the Women of African Descent for Reproductive Justice, addresses the reproductive health needs of Black women and communities from a broad human rights perspective. Since then, the framework has expanded with an intersectional approach to include all communities of color and LGBTQIA+ communities. Notwithstanding, reproductive injustice negatively impacts the health of already marginalized and oppressed communities, which is reflected in higher rates of maternal mortality, infant mortality, infertility, preterm births, and poorer health outcomes associated with race-based stress. While the impact of racial injustice on disparate health outcomes is increasingly addressed in family medicine, Reproductive Justice has not been universally incorporated into care provision or education. Including the RJ framework in family medicine education is critical to understanding how structural, economic, and political factors influence health outcomes to improve health care delivery from a justice and human rights perspective. This commentary describes how an RJ framework can enhance medical education and care provision, and subsequently identifies strategies for incorporating Reproductive Justice teaching into family medicine education.

141,38169242,"Childhood cognitive abilities are a predictor of health outcomes and adult income potential. Identifying factors associated with childhood intelligence and their interactions is essential in behavioral research. We assessed the impact of genetic variants and early child stimulation (ECS) on child intelligence and examined their possible interaction as potential modifiers of IQ in a population-based longitudinal study. Participants of the 2004 Pelotas Birth Cohort study (N = 4231) underwent intelligent quotient (IQ) by WISC-III assessment at 6 years of age. At 24 and 48-months, mothers answered five ECS marker questions, whose sum was used to create a score. The polygenic score for intelligence (IQ-PGS) was constructed from the GWAS-weighted estimate of cognition. Association was assessed using multiple linear regression models adjusted for maternal, family, and child confounding variables. To explore the possible influence of skin color and ethnoracial classification, the regression models were stratified according to the skin color variable, as a sensitivity analysis. In the adjusted analysis, IQ-PGS (β = 0.79, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.26;1.31) as well as ECS (β = 2.34; 95% CI: 1.76;2.92) were associated with IQ in this sample. The association between IQ-PGS and IQ was significant only in the white Brazilian group in the sensitivity analysis. However, there was no interaction between IQ-PGS and ECS on IQ (p ECS did not modify the impact of genetic potential on intellectual development during childhood, suggesting that genetic factors and ECS exert independent effects on the IQ levels of children.

142,33057592,"Optic neuritis (ON) in children is uncommon. There are limited prospective data for visual acuity (VA) outcomes, associated diseases, and neuroimaging findings. Prospective data from a large sample would be useful for counseling families on treatment decisions and prognosis. To prospectively study children with a first episode of ON, describe VA after 6 months, and ascertain the network's (Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group and Neuro-Ophthalmology Research Disease Investigator Consortium) ability to enroll pediatric patients with ON prospectively. This nonrandomized cohort study was conducted from September 20, 2016, to July 20, 2018, at 23 sites in the United States and Canada in pediatric ophthalmology or neuro-ophthalmology clinics. A total of 44 children (aged 3-15 years) presented with a first episode of ON (visual loss, pain on eye movements, or both) within 2 weeks of symptom onset and at least 1 of the following in the affected eye: a distance high-contrast VA (HCVA) deficit of at least 0.2 logMAR below age-based norms, diminished color vision, abnormal visual field, or optic disc swelling. Exclusion criteria included preexisting ocular abnormalities or a previous episode of ON. Primary outcomes were monocular HCVA and low-contrast VA at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were neuroimaging, associated diagnoses, and antibodies for neuromyelitis optica and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein. A total of 44 children (mean age [SD], 10.2 [3.5] years; 26 boys [59%]; 23 White individuals [52%]; 54 eyes) were enrolled in the study. Sixteen patients (36%) had bilateral ON. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed white matter lesions in 23 children (52%). Of these children, 8 had myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-associated demyelination (18%), 7 had acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (16%), 5 had multiple sclerosis (11%), and 3 had neuromyelitis optica (7%). The baseline mean HCVA was 0.95 logMAR (20/200), which improved by a mean 0.76 logMAR (95% CI, 0.54-0.99; range, -0.70 to 1.80) to 0.12 logMAR (20/25) at 6 months. The baseline mean distance low-contrast VA was 1.49 logMAR (20/640) and improved by a mean 0.72 logMAR (95% CI, 0.54-0.89; range, -0.20 to 1.50) to 0.73 logMAR (20/100) at 6 months. Baseline HCVA was worse in younger participants (aged <10 years) with associated neurologic autoimmune diagnoses, white matter lesions, and in those of non-White race and non-Hispanic ethnicity. The data did not suggest a statistically significant association between baseline factors and improvement in HCVA. The study network did not reach its targeted enrollment of 100 pediatric patients with ON over 2 years. This indicates that future treatment trials may need to use different inclusion criteria or plan a longer enrollment period to account for the rarity of the disease. Despite poor VA at presentation, most children had marked improvement by 6 months. Associated neurologic autoimmune diagnoses were common. These findings can be used to counsel families about the disease. "
143,29019750,"Ultrasonography (US) is often the first line of imaging for the examination of children suspected of having liver lesions. However, gray-scale US with color Doppler imaging has limitations. The use of US contrast agents has recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Compared with other imaging modalities, contrast material-enhanced US (CEUS) enables the assessment of contrast enhancement patterns with a higher temporal resolution and is therefore becoming a valuable alternative imaging technique. CEUS is advantageous owing to its high safety profile; lower cost, compared with the costs of conventional contrast-enhanced computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging examinations; reliability; and reproducibility. Furthermore, US examinations obviate the use of sedation, ionizing radiation, and iodinated or gadolinium-based contrast agents. All of these are desirable attributes for an imaging examination for children, the most vulnerable of patients. Focal liver lesions in children are commonly discovered incidentally, and this can pose a dilemma in terms of diagnosis and management. Owing to the FDA's recent approval of the use of a specific US contrast agent for evaluation of focal liver lesions in pediatric patients, CEUS can now be used as a problem-solving tool that complements conventional imaging examinations and aids in the follow-up of lesions. The temporal resolution with CEUS enables US images to readily depict the real-time internal vascularity of a lesion. The characterization of a lesion during different phases of enhancement improves diagnostic confidence and treatment. In this article, the authors review the composition, physiologic properties, and safety profile of CEUS; describe the technique for performing CEUS; and highlight the utility of this examination in the assessment of common focal liver lesions in children. Online supplemental material is available for this article.  "
144,30537889,"This study provides observed base rates of low executive functioning test scores among healthy children and adolescents, stratifies those base rates by narrow intellectual functioning and age groupings, and provides normative classification ranges to aid the interpretation of performances on the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) in clinical practice and research. Participants included 875 children and adolescents between 8 and 19 years old from the D-KEFS normative sample (48% male; 52% female). Among these participants, 838 had complete data and were included in the current study. The racial/ethnic composition of the sample was: White (73.7%), African American (12.4%), Hispanic (11.1%), and other racial/ethnic backgrounds (2.7%). The Overall Test Battery Mean (OTBM) and the prevalence of low scores at various clinical cut-offs were calculated for the 13 primary scores from the D-KEFS Trail Making Test, Verbal Fluency Test, and Color-Word Interference Test. The OTBM and base rates were also calculated separately for those scores reflecting executive functioning (n = 7) and processing speed (n = 6). Healthy children and adolescents commonly obtained low scores on the D-KEFS tests considered here. Younger age, lower estimated full-scale intelligence quotient, and more test scores interpreted were associated with a greater frequency of low scores. Clinicians and researchers are encouraged to consider these multivariate base rates when assessing and attempting to identify executive functioning impairment among children and adolescents with the D-KEFS.

145,30783756,"To investigate the potential toxic effects of levetiracetam monotherapy on ocular tissues in cases of pediatric epilepsy using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Thirty epileptic children (group 1) receiving levetiracetam monotherapy at a dosage of 20-40 mg/kg/day for at least 1 year with a first diagnosis of epilepsy and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy children (group 2) were included in the study. In addition to a detailed eye examination, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness, foveal thickness (FT), and central corneal thickness (CCT) were measured in all children by means of spectral domain OCT. The data obtained from the two groups were then subjected to statistical analysis. The mean age of both groups was 12 ± 3.64 years [1-12]. The mean duration of levetiracetam in group 1 was 24.07 ± 12.82 months. Mean RNFL values in groups 1 and 2 were 106.1 ± 10.42 and 104.98 ± 10.04 μm, mean GCC values were 94.72 ± 6.26 and 94.4 ± 6 μm, mean FT values were 240.73 ± 17.94 and 240.77 ± 15.97 μm, and mean CCT values were 555.1 ± 44.88 and 540.97 ± 32.65 μm, respectively. No significant difference was determined between the two groups in terms of any parameter. Best corrected visual acuity values of the subjects in both groups were 10/10, and no color vision or visual field deficit was determined. Levetiracetam monotherapy causes no significant function or morphological change in ocular tissues in pediatric epilepsies. "
146,19473495,"Efforts to redress racial and gender inequalities in the training of medical specialists has been a central part of a dedicated programme in the Faculty of Health Sciences at the University of Cape Town (UCT). This study aimed to describe trends in race and gender profiles of postgraduate students in medical specialties (registrars) from 1999 to 2006 and to identify factors affecting recruitment and retention of black and female trainees. Review of faculty databases for race and gender data from 1999 to 2006. Distribution of an anonymous self-administered questionnaire to all registrars in 2005/2006. The percentage of African registrars doubled from 10% to 19% from 1999 to beyond 2002. The percentages of Africans, Coloureds and Indians rose steadily from 26% to 46% from 1999 to 2005, as did that of women from 27% to 44%. The institution's perceived good reputation, being an alumnus and originating from Cape Town were common reasons for choosing UCT for training. A quarter of respondents reported knowledge of a friend who decided against studying at UCT for reasons which included anticipated racial discrimination. Black respondents (23%), particularly African (50%), were more likely to describe registrarship at UCT as unwelcoming than white respondents (12%). Specific instances of personal experience of discrimination were uncommon and not associated with respondents' race or gender. Registrars who had had a child during registrarship and those reporting discrimination were more likely to rate the learning and research environment as poor (Odds Ratio, 4.01; 95% CI 0.98 - 16.47 and 1.99 95% CI 0.57 - 6.97, respectively). The proportion of black and female registrars at the University of Cape Town has increased steadily from 1999 to 2006, most likely a result of systematic equity policies and procedures adopted in the faculty during this period. The data point to a need for policies to make the institution more welcoming to diversity and for strategies to address institutional culture and mentorship, with an aim to develop examples of best practices to share within and between institutions.

148,3957510,"Socio-medical indicators developed by WHO for monitoring progress towards Health-for-All have been adapted to reveal, clearly and objectively, the devastating impact of state planning based on an outmoded immoral and unscientific philosophy of race superiority in South Africa on the health of the disenfranchised majority within the context of social and economic discrimination; Health policy indicators confirm that the government is committed to three options (Bantustans, A New Constitution, and A Health Services Facilities Plan) all of which are inconsistent with the attainment of Health-for-All; Social and economic indicators reveal gross disparities between African, Coloured, Indian, and White living and working conditions; Provision of health care indicators show the overwhelming dominance of high technology curative medical care consuming about 97 percent of the health budget with only minor shifts towards community-based comprehensive care; and Health status indicators illustrate the close nexus between privilege, dispossession and disease with Whites falling prey to health problems related to affluence and lifestyle, while Africans, Coloureds, and Indians suffer from disease due to poverty. All four categories of the indicator system reveal discrepancies which exist between Black and White, rich and poor, urban and rural. To achieve the social goal of Health-for-All requires a greater measure of political commitment from the state. We conclude that it is debatable whether a system which maintains race discrimination and exploitation can in fact be adapted to provide Health-for-All. This report evaluates the effects of race discrimination on the health status of South Africa using a socio-medical indicator system derived by WHO. The indicator system consists of 4 categories: health policy indicators, social and economic indicators related to health, indicators of provision of health care, and health status indicators. Political commitment is essential for the attainment of health for the population; the government of South Africa is committed to 3 different options influencing health, all described in detail. Budget allocation is an objective measure of commitment; 3.2% of the GNP was spent on health in 1981, and only 2.2% of the total health budget is devoted to preventive medicine. Absence of democratic structures for all to express needs and demands results in racially biased allocation and distribution of health services. Social and economic indicators relating to health include rate of population increase, gross national product, income distribution, work conditions, literacy rates, housing needs, and food availability. Indicators of basic health status include nutritional status, child mortality rates (15.6/1000 for Africans, 1.1 for whites) and life expectancy at birth (for black males 45.0 yrs and for black females 47.3, for white males 65.5 and white females 71.9). In order to achieve health for all, action is needed at the political level to eliminate apartheid, and at policy and decision making levels, to improve living and health conditions. "
149,10829950,"The clinical disappearance of the murmur of rheumatic mitral regurgitation after period of time has been documented by many researchers. However no studies have related the disappearance of the murmur with the functional or anatomical state of the mitral valve. This study was done to elucidate the mitral valve status using doppler and color coded echocardiography among those children who have lost their apical pansystolic murmur on auscultation following a documented attack of rheumatic fever. The study sample consisted of 51 patients including 31 patients in whom the murmur has disappeared (group I), and 20 patients with persistent isolated mitral regurgitation (group II). Patients of group I had significantly lower grades of murmur intensity, lower incidence of cardiomegaly, and had no heart failure in the initial attack. They were more compliant with prophylaxis and had less recurrences than patients of group II. The murmur disappeared in patients of group I from 1/2 to 14 years after the initial attack. Echocardiography revealed that such patients had a normal mitral valve apparatus, and a normal heart size and function. Only 5 patients of this group had a significant regurgitant jet demonstrated by colour doppler. We concluded that recovery of the mitral valve and return of cardiac functions to normal is possible in patients who had mitral regurgitation following rheumatic fever. Some of them may still have an inaudible mild regurgitation. Patients who have lost their murmur may be allowed to exercise freely, yet penicillin prophylaxis should not be discontinued. "
150,34636503,"School-aged children born very preterm have been suggested to have worse cognitive and behavioral outcomes than children born full-term. Executive function (EF) is a higher level of cognitive function related to academic achievement. The present study aimed to evaluate the cognitive (including EF) and behavioral outcomes of Korean children born extremely preterm (EP) and to analyze any biological or socioeconomic risk factors for poor cognitive outcomes in this population. A total of 71 infants weighing < 1,000 g at birth or born before 30 weeks of gestation (EP group) who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit from 2008 to 2009 were included in this study and compared with 40 term-birth controls. The Korean Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition, Advanced Test of Attention (ATA), Stroop test, Children's Color Trails Test (CCTT), and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) were used. Additionally, the Korean Child Behavior Checklist (K-CBCL) and Korean ADHD Rating Scale (K-ARS) were completed. Perinatal and demographic data were collected and analyzed. The mean full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) score in the EP group was significantly lower than that of the term control group (89.1 ± 18.3 vs. 107.1 ± 12.7;  This is the first Korean study to investigate the cognitive and behavioral outcomes of school-aged children born EP. In the study cohort, EP children exhibited significantly lower FSIQ scores and EF than their full-term peers, and 37% of them had cognitive problems. Nonetheless, except for social immaturity, the behavioral problems were not different in EP children. Severe ROP and low discharge weight Z-score were identified as independent risk factors for low FSIQ score after adjusting for birth weight. "

152,36754165,"To evaluate for disparities in peripartum toxicology testing among maternal-infant dyads across a hospital network and subsequent child protective services (CPS) involvement. Retrospective chart review of 59,425 deliveries at 5 hospitals in Massachusetts between 2016 and 2020. We evaluated associations between maternal characteristics, toxicology testing, and child welfare involvement with disproportionality risk ratios and hierarchical logistical regression. Toxicology testing was performed on 1959 (3.3%) dyads. Younger individuals and individuals of color were more likely to be tested for cannabis use or maternal medical complications compared to white non-Hispanic individuals. Among those without a substance use disorder, age <25 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.43-3.26), race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic Black (aOR 1.80; 95% CI, 1.52-2.13), Hispanic (aOR 1.23; 95% CI, 1.05-1.45), mixed race/other (aOR 1.40; 95% CI, 1.04, 1.87), unavailable race (aOR 1.92; 95% CI, 1.32-2.79), and public insurance (Medicaid [aOR 2.61; 95% CI, 2.27-3.00], Medicare [aOR 13.76; 95% CI, 9.99-18.91]) had increased odds of toxicology testing compared to older, white non-Hispanic, and privately insured individuals. The disproportionality ratios in testing were greater than 1.0 for individuals under 25 years old (3.8), Hispanic individuals (1.6), non-Hispanic Black individuals (1.8), individuals of other race (1.2), unavailable race (1.8), and individuals with public insurance (Medicaid 2.6; Medicare 10.6). Among dyads tested, race and ethnicity was not associated with CPS involvement. Peripartum toxicology testing is disproportionately performed on non-white, younger, and poorer individuals and their infants, with cannabis use and medical complications prompting testing more often for patients of color than for white non-Hispanic individuals.

153,28293777,"A robust literature documents the impact of poverty on child development and lifelong health, well-being and productivity. Racial and ethnic minority children continue to bear the burden of poverty disproportionately. Evidence-based parenting interventions in early childhood have the potential to attenuate risk attributable to poverty and stress. To reduce racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in the USA, parenting interventions must be accessible, engaging, and effective for low-income families of color living in large urban centers. This paper describes the initial development of ParentCorps and ongoing improvements to realize that vision. Initial development focused on creating a parenting intervention that places culture at the center and effectively embedding it in schools. ParentCorps includes core components found in nearly all effective parenting interventions with a culturally informed approach to engaging families and supporting behavior change. As the intervention is implemented at scale in increasingly diverse communities, improvement efforts include augmenting professional development to increase racial consciousness among all staff (evaluators, coaches, and school-based facilitators) and applying an implementation science framework to study and more fully support schools' use of a package of engagement strategies.

154,31289909,"Ultrasonography might be an important imaging method for assessing the pediatric enthesis. To diagnose pathology, knowledge of physiological findings is essential but limited. To provide a detailed ultrasonographic assessment of four lower-extremity entheses in healthy adolescents as a reference for the correct interpretation of findings in children with rheumatic diseases. The quadriceps tendon, proximal and distal patella tendon, and Achilles enthesis were examined in B-mode, Power and color Doppler in 41 boys and girls ages 11-14 years in neutral position and 30° flexion. We assessed Doppler signals at various distances from the enthesis and analyzed the data using a marginal logistic regression model with generalized estimating equation. We assessed agreement between observers using weighted kappa and we determined agreement on repeat scans using prevalence- and bias-adjusted kappa. Doppler signals were predominantly in the quadriceps and distal patella tendon with odds ratios of 50.85 and 21.35 (P<0.001) compared to the Achilles tendon. They were within 2 mm or 5 mm of the enthesis (odds ratios [ORs] of 4.58 and 4.24, P<0.001), without significant difference between flexion and neutral position and between the right and the left legs. Agreement between first and second assessment was good, with aggregate kappas from 0.79 to 0.90. The inter-reader agreement was also good, with aggregate kappas ranging from 0.75 to 0.95. We found a differential Doppler pattern in lower-extremity entheses, with signals present mostly in the quadriceps and distal patella entheses. "

156,32115769,"Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a common skin infection in the pediatric age group. The infection is self-limited and manifests as discrete, umbilicated skin-colored papules on any skin surface of the body. At times, complications such as local dermatitis and swelling, erythema, and pus formation may appear. These signs of inflammation are commonly presumed to represent bacterial infection. This multicenter study was a retrospective analysis of data collected on all patients diagnosed with inflamed lesions secondary to MC and treated at the Hadassah Medical Centers and Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem, Israel, from 1/1/2008 to 1/07/2018. Characteristics of children with positive cultures were compared to those with negative cultures and those with contaminants. A total of 56 cases were reviewed; the mean age at presentation was 4.6 years. Fever was reported in 12.5%, and 62.5% received systemic antibiotics because of their inflamed MC prior to admission. Fifty-five percent had sterile cultures or cultures growing only contaminants. Only seven had positive cultures with the common cutaneous pathogens. No statistical difference was observed between the patients with pathogenic isolates and patients with sterile or non-pathogenic cultures in terms of demographics, lesion characteristics, inflammatory markers, or length of hospitalization. The findings suggest that most cases of suspected MC-related secondary infection can be attributed to inflammation rather than to bacterial infection. However, in some cases, true bacterial infection should be suspected and treated accordingly. "
157,12728112,"Otitis media is 1 of the most frequent diseases of early infancy and childhood and 1 of the most common reasons for children to visit a physician. In the past 2 decades, there has been a substantial increase in the diagnosis of otitis media worldwide. In the United States, 93% of all children have had at least 1 episode of acute otitis media (AOM) by 7 years of age. Otalgia is the hallmark of AOM. Most affected children either complain of earache or manifest behavior that the parents interpret as indicating ear pain. Treatment of the ear pain early in the course of AOM decreases both parental anxiety and the child's discomfort and accelerates the healing process. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and tolerability of naturopathic versus traditional treatment for the management of otalgia commonly associated with AOM in children. The study was designed as a double-blind trial in an outpatient community clinic. A total of 171 children who were aged 5 to 18 years and had otalgia and clinical findings associated with middle-ear infection were studied. The children were randomly assigned to receive treatment with Naturopathic Herbal Extract Ear Drops (NHED) or anesthetic ear drops, with or without amoxicillin. On enrollment, the children were assigned by computer-numbered randomization to receive NHED (contents: allium sativum, verbascum thapsus, calendula flores, hypericum perfoliatum, lavender, and vitamin E in olive oil) 5 drops 3 times daily, alone (group A) or together with a topical anesthetic (amethocaine and phenazone in glycerin) 5 drops 3 times daily (group B), or oral amoxicillin 80 mg/kg/d (maximum 500 mg/dose) divided into 3 doses with either NHED 5 drops 3 times daily (group C) or topical anesthetic 5 drops 3 times daily (group D). A double-blind design was used, and all ear drops were placed in identical bottles. Treatment was initiated by the nurse in all cases. A single physician (M.S.) evaluated and treated all of the patients included in the study and recorded all of the data. The presence or absence of ear pain was assessed over 3 days with a visual analog scale. Ear pain was assessed by a specially devised observational instrument based on previous reports. One side of the instrument consisted of a linear numbered scale, from 1 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), and a corresponding color scale, ranging from blue to dark red. The reverse side contained a scale of 5 facial expressions, ranging from broad smile (no pain) to a sad and crying face (worst possible pain), and a corresponding color scale, ranging from blue to dark red. There were no significant between-group differences in patient age or gender, degree of fever, main symptoms, associated symptoms, and severity or laterality of acute otitis media. Each group had a statistically significant improvement in ear pain over the course of the 3 days. Patients who were given ear drops alone had a better response than patients who were given ear drops together with amoxicillin. Results were better in the NHED group than in the controls. Nevertheless, the findings indicated that the pain was mostly (80%) self-limited and could be explained simply by the time elapsed. The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines recommend topical medications as the first line of treatment for ear pain in the absence of systemic infection or serious underlying disease. Because no evidence was found that systemic antibiotics alone improved treatment outcome, if antibiotics do not change the natural course of otitis media, then the main goal of treatment, as in the present study, should be to alleviate the ear pain. The alternative, naturopathic herbal extract medications, may offer many new possibilities in the management of ear pain associated with AOM. Primary care physicians should be aware that at least 10% of their patients may have tried 1 or more forms of alternative/complementary medicine before presenting for consultation. As it was widely reported in the medical literature, these herb, these herbal extracts have the potential to meet all of the requirements of appropriate medication that could be routinely used in the pediatric patient, namely in vitro bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal activity against common pathogens, immunostimulation ability, antioxidant activity, and anti-inflammatory effects. They are also well-absorbed with good penetration into the tissue surrounding the tympanic membrane. They have been found to enhance local immunologic activity. Finally, herbal extracts are well-tolerated (owing to their long elimination time), easy to administer, and less expensive than the new antibiotics. There are no documented side effects. On the basis of our findings that the group with the most significant treatment effects (NHED with topical anesthetic) explained only 7.3% of the total pain reduction, we propose that sometimes the general practitioner or pediatrician needs to give the human body a chance to repair itself. Nevertheless, if the physician believes that there is an indication for some treatment, especially if the parents are anxious, then a local treatment such as one used in our study might be adequate. This study suggests that in cases of ear pain caused by AOM in children in which active treatment, besides a simple 2- to 3-day waiting period, is needed, an herbal extract solution may be beneficial. Concomitant antibiotic treatment is apparently not contributory. "
158,14510981,"One determining factor of skin colour is the distribution pattern of melanosomes within keratinocytes. Melanosomes in keratinocytes of light skin as in Caucasians are distributed as membrane-bound clusters, whereas the melanosomes in keratinocytes of dark skin as in African/American individuals tend to be larger and distributed individually. It has been shown that melanin content, melanin composition and the size of melanosomes in the human epidermis vary considerably with both ethnicity and chronic sun exposure. To assess quantitatively the distribution pattern of melanosomes that have been transferred to keratinocytes in the photoprotected (volar forearm) skin from normal Asian individuals and to compare these data with those from light-skinned Caucasian and dark-skinned African/American individuals. Electron microscopy was used. We have demonstrated that melanosomes within keratinocytes of Asian skin are distributed as a combination of individual and clustered melanosomes with a proportion of 62.6% vs. 37.4%, respectively. This contrasts with dark and light skin keratinocytes where melanosomes are predominantly individual (88.9%) and clustered (84.5%), respectively. Analysis of mean +/- SD melanosome size also revealed a progressive variation in size with ethnicity, melanosomes in dark skin being the largest (1.44 +/- 0.67 microm(2) x 10-2) followed in turn by those in Asian skin (1.36 +/- 0.15 microm(2) x 10-2) and Caucasian skin (0.94 +/- 0.48 microm(2) x 10-2). In addition, it was shown that the melanosomes that are individually distributed tend to have a larger size than the clustered melanosomes. The present data indicate that there may be a size gradient of melanosomes encompassing the global complexion coloration and that the melanosome distribution in keratinocytes of Asian skin is intermediate between that in light Caucasian and dark African/American skin.

159,2718759,The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of brushing with chewing sticks in removing plaque and to evaluate whether toothpaste has any additional effect on the removal of established dental plaque. Kenyan schoolchildren had their plaque deposits disclosed by means of disclosing tablets and subsequently recorded on four buccal sites of all permanent teeth. The children were then allocated to two groups in a crossover design; in one group the children brushed with chewing sticks and toothpaste; the other group brushed with chewing sticks only. Substantial amounts of plaque were recorded at base line in most children. Brushing with a chewing stick for 5 min resulted in a net reduction of the proportion of plaque deposit sites per child. Toothpaste resulted in no additional effect. 
160,35883036,"There are many inequalities in terms of prevention and treatment for pregnant women with HIV and exposed children in low and middle-income countries. The Brazilian protocol for prenatal care includes rapid diagnostic testing for HIV, compulsory notification, and monitoring by the epidemiological surveillance of children exposed to HIV until 18 months after delivery. The case is closed after HIV serology results are obtained. Lost to follow-up is defined as a child who was not located at the end of the case, and, therefore, did not have a laboratory diagnosis. Lost to follow-up is a current problem and has been documented in other countries. This study analyzed factors associated with loss to follow-up among HIV-exposed children, including sociodemographic, behavioral, and health variables of mothers of children lost to follow-up. This historical cohort study included information on mothers of children exposed to HIV, born in Porto Alegre, from 2000 to 2017. The research outcome was the classification at the end of the child's follow-up (lost to follow-up or not). Factors associated with loss to follow-up were investigated using the Poisson regression model. Relative Risk calculations were performed. The significance level of 5% was adopted for variables in the adjusted model. Of 6,836 children exposed to HIV, 1,763 (25.8%) were classified as lost to follow-up. The factors associated were: maternal age of up to 22 years (aRR 1.25, 95% CI: 1.09-1.43), the mother's self-declared race/color being black or mixed (aRR 1.13, 95% CI: 1.03-1.25), up to three years of schooling (aRR 1.45, 95% CI: 1.26-1.67), between four and seven years of schooling (aRR 1.14, 95% CI: 1.02-1.28), intravenous drug use (aRR 1.29, 95% CI: 1.12-1.50), and HIV diagnosis during prenatal care or at delivery (aRR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.24-1.52). Variables related to individual vulnerability, such as race, age, schooling, and variables related to social and programmatic vulnerability, remain central to reducing loss to follow-up among HIV-exposed children.

161,36411550,"Roseola infantum is a common viral disease that occurs during childhood worldwide. The purpose of this article is to familiarize pediatricians with the clinical manifestations, evaluation, diagnosis, and management of roseola infantum. A search was conducted in April, 2022, in PubMed Clinical Queries using the key terms ""roseola infantum"" OR ""exanthem subitum"" OR ""sixth disease"". The search strategy included all clinical trials, observational studies, and reviews published within the past 10 years. Only papers published in the English literature were included in this review. The information retrieved from the above search was used in the compilation of the present article. Roseola infantum is a viral illness characterized by high fever that lasts 3 to 4 days, followed by the sudden appearance of rash at defervescence. The disease occurs most frequently in children between 6 months and 2 years of age. Human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) is the major cause of roseola infantum, followed by HHV-7. Transmission of the infection most likely results from the asymptomatic shedding of the virus in the saliva of the caregivers or other close contacts. Characteristically, the rash is discrete, rose-pink in color, circular or elliptical, macular or maculopapular, measuring 2 to 3 mm in diameter. The eruption is first seen on the trunk. It then spreads to the neck and proximal extremities. Typically, the rash blanches on pressure and subsides in 2 to 4 days without sequelae. Most children look well otherwise and appear to be happy, active, alert, and playful. The diagnosis is mainly clinical. Febrile seizures occur in 10 to 15 % of children with roseola infantum during the febrile period. In general, serious complications are rare and occur more often in individuals who are immunocompromised. There is no specific treatment. An antipyretic may be used to reduce fever and discomfort. Roseola infantum is generally a benign and self-limited disease. Failure to recognize this condition may result in undue parental fear, unnecessary investigations, delay in treatment for conditions that mimic roseola infantum and complications from roseola infantum, unnecessary treatment of roseola infantum per se, and misuse of healthcare expenditure.

162,9833787,"To evaluate selective embolization for management of post-traumatic priapism and colour Doppler sonography for the diagnosis of the causative lesion and for planning embolization. Six male patients with post-traumatic priapism underwent selective angiography and embolization. Colour Doppler sonography with grey-scale was performed in all six patients before angiography. Selective angiography showed intracavernosal arteriovenous fistulas in all patients and pseudoaneurysm of the cavernosal artery (or common penile artery) in three patients. After successful embolization, detumescence was achieved in all patients. Colour Doppler sonography enabled localization and characterization of the lesion causing priapism in four patients. Grey-scale ultrasonography showed the dilated cavernosal sinuses in all patients. Angiography with selective embolization is safe and effective method to correct post-traumatic priapism. Colour Doppler sonography with grey scale is a useful preangiographic study, as it allows for characterization and localization of the causative lesion except lesions at the proximal cavernosal or distal penile artery near the symphysis pubis.

163,21435067,"Children with cerebral palsy (CP) are at greater risk for a limited intellectual development than typically developing children. Little information is available which children with CP are most at risk. This study aimed to describe the development of non-verbal intellectual capacity of school-age children with CP and to examine the association between the development of non-verbal intellectual capacity and the severity of CP. A longitudinal analysis in a cohort study was performed with a clinic-based sample of children with CP. Forty-two children were assessed at 5, 6 and 7 years of age, and 49 children were assessed at 7, 8 and 9 years of age. Non-verbal intellectual capacity was assessed by Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (RCPM). Severity of CP was classified by the Gross Motor Function Classification System, type of motor impairment and limb distribution. manova for repeated measurements was used to analyse time effects and time × group effects on both RCPM raw scores and RCPM intelligence quotient scores. The development of non-verbal intellectual capacity was characterised by a statistically significant increase in RCPM raw scores but no significant change in RCPM intelligence quotient scores. The development of RCPM raw scores was significantly associated with the severity of CP. Children with higher levels of gross motor functioning and children with spastic CP showed greater increase in raw scores than children with lower levels of gross motor functioning and children with dyskinetic CP. Children with CP aged between 5 and 9 years show different developmental trajectories for non-verbal intellectual capacity, which are associated with the severity of CP. The development of non-verbal intellectual capacity in children with less severe CP seems to resemble that of typically developing children, while children with more severe CP show a limited intellectual development compared to typically developing children.

164,26270999,"Evidence on the associations of dietary patterns with cognition in children is limited. Therefore, we investigated the associations of the Baltic Sea Diet Score (BSDS) and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score with cognition in children. The present cross-sectional study sample included 428 children aged 6-8 years (216 boys and 212 girls). The BSDS and the DASH score were calculated using data from 4 d food records, higher scores indicating better diet quality. Cognition was assessed by the Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (CPM) score, a higher score indicating better cognition. Among all children, the BSDS (standardised regression coefficient β = 0·122, P =0·012) and the DASH score (β = 0·121, P =0·015) were directly associated with the Raven's CPM score. Among boys, a lower BSDS (β = 0·244, P< 0·001) and a lower DASH score (β = 0·202, P= 0·003) were related to a lower Raven's CPM score. Boys in the lowest quartile of the BSDS (22·5 v. 25·3, P= 0·029) and the DASH score (22·4 v. 25·7, P= 0·008) had a lower Raven's CPM score than those in the highest quartile of the corresponding score. Among girls, the BSDS or the DASH score were not associated with cognition. In conclusion, a poorer diet quality was associated with worse cognition in children, and the relationship was stronger in boys than in girls. "
165,31593080,"Soft-tissue defects overlying the Achilles tendon are common complications after bicycle or motorcycle spoke injuries in children and usually require surgical management by various flaps. There is no apparent consensus on the optimal choice of flaps for these injuries. We designed a novel step-advanced rectangular flap to reconstruct small to moderate soft-tissue defects around the Achilles tendon. This study was performed to review our experience and evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the step-advanced rectangular flap.From May, 2014 to September, 2016, 12 consecutive children with soft-tissue defects overlying the Achilles tendon caused by spoke injuries were treated with the step-advanced rectangular flap. The patients' general information, surgical details, and postoperative complications were recorded. The Mazur evaluation system was used to assess clinical outcomes.All patients were followed up for ≥12 months (range 12-38 months). All flaps survived completely. Superficial infection occurred in 2 patients and healed by second intention after dressing changes; the other patients' surgical wounds healed by primary intention. The scars around the flaps in 2 patients were remarkable, and all others showed good results in terms of flap color and texture. Ankle function was normal, and satisfactory results were obtained in all cases. According to the Mazur evaluation system, the results were excellent in 9 patients and good in 3, with an excellent and good rate of 100% at 12 months postoperatively.The rectangular advancement flap appears to be a simple and reliable method for small to moderate soft tissue defects overlying the Achilles tendon in children.

166,34836664,"Addressing bias and disparities in counseling and care requires that we contend with dehumanizing attitudes, stereotypes, and beliefs that our society and profession holds towards people of color, broadly, and Black birthing people in particular. It also necessitates an accounting of the historically informed, racist ideologies that shape present-day implicit biases. These biases operate in a distinctly complex and damaging manner in the context of end-of-life care, which centers around questions related to human pain, suffering, and value. Therefore, this paper aims to trace biases and disparities that operate in periviable care, where end-of-life decisions are made at the very beginning of life. We start from a historical context to situate racist ideologies into present day stereotypes and tropes that dehumanize and disadvantage Black birthing people and Black neonates in perinatal care. Here, we review the literature, address historical incidents and consider their impact on our ability to deliver patient-centered periviable care. "
167,2380648,"To assess the limitations of 2 Dimensional Color Doppler Echocardiography in the evaluation of cardiac anatomy in children with congenital heart disease. 2DCDE were performed in 140 infants and children before cardiac catheterization and/or operation or autopsy. The segmental echocardiographic analysis included determination of intracardiac, great artery, systemic venous and pulmonary venous anatomy. Among 140 patients there were 270 separate cardiovascular abnormalities of which 215 (80%) were identified by 2D echo. There were 55 (20%) false negative diagnosis by 2DE. Small VSD, unusual location of PDA, stenosis of pulmonary arterial and venous system, intra pulmonary arterio-venous fistula and pseudotruncus were the lesions most likely to be misdiagnosed by 2DE. Color Doppler was useful to detect abnormal flow of valvular regurgitation or left to right shunt. Doppler is useful to detect abnormal flow from obstruction or regurgitation or left to right shunt and may be used to predict the pressure in the chambers of the heart and great artery. General limitation of 2DCDE to diagnose CHD include; obesity and emphysematous child, some inherent limitation in each instrument and also inexperienced echocardiographer. "
168,9875105,"To present the short and intermediate term results of coil occlusion of persistent ductus arteriosus and the results of radiographic measurements of spring coils implanted to treat patent ducts. 22 children underwent coil occlusion. Their ages ranged from 2 years 9 months to 12 years 10 months (mean (SD) age, 6.5 (3.6) years). The duct diameter ranged from 1.0 to 3.5 mm at the narrowest point (mean 2.6 (0.7) mm). In 11 of the children regular coils were implanted using the non-attached system, while in the other 11 the detachable coil embolisation system was used. 12 children (55%) had no significant residual leaks immediately after procedures involving a single coil delivery. The remaining 10 (45%) had residual leaks immediately after the procedure, although no patient with a large duct showed residual leakage 18 months after the procedure. Radiographic measurement of the coils showed that all implanted coils retracted to 65-85% of their original size immediately after occlusion. This retraction was more evident in patients showing spontaneous closure of the residual shunt or having a coil 8 mm in diameter. Coil embolisation is an acceptable method for occluding persistent ductus arteriosus. Retraction of implanted coils is common in the follow up period. Such retraction may be related to spontaneous closure of residual shunt after embolisation. "
169,36652041,"To evaluate the role of visual electrodiagnostic testing in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) despite improved accessibility to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The records from 39 children (78 eyes, 15 boys, 24 girls, average age at last visit of 11.5 ± 4.3 years, average follow-up time of 7.8 ± 3.9 years) with genetically confirmed NF1 were retrospectively analysed. They all underwent a thorough ophthalmological investigation, including age-appropriate visual acuity testing, anterior segment evaluation for Lisch nodules and a dilated fundus examination. If children were cooperative enough, colour vision was tested using the Hardy-Rand-Rittler test, visual fields were evaluated with Goldmann perimetry. All performed MRI of the brain and orbits as part of the standard of care protocol. Visual electrodiagnostics included electroretinography (ERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP) using a standard protocol in older children, whereas with less cooperative children a modified protocol according to the Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH protocol) was used. The average visual acuity was 0.8 ± 0.3, colour vision was abnormal in 6%, perimetry in 8%, Lisch nodules were present in 62%, and the optic disc was pale in 66% of all eyes. Plexiform neurofibroma of the eyelid/orbit was present in 4%. Optic pathway glioma (OPG) was detected with MRI in 22 (57%) and in 6/22 treatment was indicated. Other intracranial NF1-related lesions were documented in 70% of children. VEP were abnormal in 16/39 of all children with NF1 (41%) comprising 14/22 (65%) of children with confirmed OPG and 2/17 (12%) of children without OPG. All full-field and pattern ERG responses were within normal limits. All individual VEP results are described and three cases from this cohort of children are presented in detail to illustrate the importance of VEP testing. In Case 1, VEP abnormality suggested subsequent MRI of the brain under general anaesthesia, which was otherwise contraindicated according to normal clinical findings and his young age. In Cases 2 and 3, VEP provided more precise functional information during the follow-up of OPG, while other psychophysical tests remained unchanged. Electrodiagnostics has multifactorial role and importance in children with NF1, either when visual pathway function is impaired in young children, even before MRI under general anaesthesia and other psychophysical tests can be performed, as well as for a more precise monitoring of the visual pathway function before potential treatment of OPG, or after it, to evaluate its success.

170,34077897,"Epidemiological studies mostly focus on single environmental exposures. This study aims to systematically assess associations between a wide range of prenatal and childhood environmental exposures and cognition. The study sample included data of 1298 mother-child pairs, children were 6-11 years-old, from six European birth cohorts. We measured 87 exposures during pregnancy and 122 cross-sectionally during childhood, including air pollution, built environment, meteorology, natural spaces, traffic, noise, chemicals and life styles. The measured cognitive domains were fluid intelligence (Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices test, CPM), attention (Attention Network Test, ANT) and working memory (N-Back task). We used two statistical approaches to assess associations between exposure and child cognition: the exposome-wide association study (ExWAS) considering each exposure independently, and the deletion-substitution-addition algorithm (DSA) considering all exposures simultaneously to build a final multiexposure model. Based on this multiexposure model that included the exposure variables selected by ExWAS and DSA models, child organic food intake was associated with higher fluid intelligence (CPM) scores (beta = 1.18; 95% CI = 0.50, 1.87) and higher working memory (N-Back) scores (0.23; 0.05, 0.41), and child fast food intake (-1.25; -2.10, -0.40), house crowding (-0.39; -0.62, -0.16), and child environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) (-0.89; -1.42, -0.35), were all associated with lower CPM scores.

171,23098746,"Unintended hyperinflation of the cuff of a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) may be associated with increased airway morbidity and postoperative pain. While the manufacturers recommend a cuff pressure of ≤ 60 cmH(2)O, in usual clinical practice, there is no method used to determine the intracuff pressure. The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the accuracy of a newly designed LMA with a built in pressure gauge intended to alert the clinician to elevated intracuff pressures. The pressure gauge has a color code system intended to reflect the intracuff pressure with green being 40-60 cmH(2)O. There was no change dictated in clinical practice for these patients. Per our usual practice, the LMA was removed from the package and inserted with the cuff partially inflated. Additional air was added to the cuff using a syringe as needed to ensure a seal during positive pressure ventilation to a peak inflating pressure (peak ventilating pressure) of 20-25 cmH(2)O. The clinicians placing the LMA did not use the pressure gauge for clinical feedback during cuff inflation. Immediately after LMA placement, the pressure in the cuff of the LMA was measured using a hand held manometer by an independent reviewer not part of the patient's anesthetic management. The color indicated on the pressure gauge (yellow, green or red) was recorded prior to pressure sampling. Additional data collected included the patient's demographic data (age, weight, and gender), the size of the LMA, and whether air was added to the cuff. The study cohort included 100 children, ranging in age from 3 months to 19 years and in weight from 5.4 to 80.1 kg. One patient was excluded due to malfunction of the pressure gauge and pilot balloon of the LMA. The intracuff pressure as measured by manometer correlated appropriately with the color coding of the pressure gauge in 94 of the 99 (95%) of the LMA's tested. Given the potential association of excessive intracuff pressures with postoperative sore throat and the inability to ensure acceptable intracuff pressures using clinical judgment, this new LMA may allow a simple means of achieving this goal without the use of costly devices (manometers) in every operating room. In 95% of the LMA's tested, the color reading correlated appropriately with the intracuff pressure. "
172,26614208,"Recently, a fiber visualization method for high-angular resolution diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data was proposed using a multiple-kernel line integral convolution (LIC) algorithm and an anisotropic spot pattern. This processing routine leads to high contrast color-coded LIC maps that are capable of visualizing local anisotropy information and regional fiber architecture. In this paper, we evaluate and validate this method by applying it to simulated datasets and to in vivo diffusion MRI data of children and adults with different disease conditions and healthy volunteers. Compared to routine clinical fiber visualization (color-coded fractional anisotropy, FA maps, and fiber tractography), it has the advantage of visualizing complex local fiber architecture in a fully automated way. The results indicate that this method is capable of reliably delineating normal fiber architecture and fibers infiltrated, displaced, or disrupted by lesions and is therefore a promising tool in the clinical context.

173,15181186,"Pediatric cardiology, as a discipline, arose from early descriptive studies of congenital cardiac defects. The development of the stethoscope allowed some clinical diagnoses to be made during life. Cardiology as a medical specialty was limited, mainly, to internists. When Robert Gross ligated a patent ductus in 1938, pediatric cardiology, as a discipline, was born. Physiologic studies, angiography, and the development of extracorporeal circulation allowed congenital cardiac lesions previously considered a curiosity to be diagnosed and treated successfully. The few pediatricians who were interested in cardiology taught themselves, and soon pediatric cardiology training programs developed. By 1961, pediatric cardiology became the first subspecialty board in pediatrics. The past 60 y has brought enormous progress. Cardiac ultrasound, color-flow Doppler, and magnetic resonance imaging have made diagnostic cardiac catheterization almost unnecessary. Instead, interventional cardiac catheterization rapidly developed and is already able to replace surgery in the treatment of a number of cardiac defects. The first 50 y of cardiology has been focused on patient care, education, and clinical research, but the last 10 y has added exciting, basic research discoveries, which are elucidating the cause of cardiac defects with hope for prevention in the future. As a discipline, pediatric cardiology has always required a team-pathologists, physiologists, cardiologists, surgeons, intensivists, interventionists, and anesthesiologists-all playing an important role in the treatment of children with cardiac problems. Today the geneticists, molecular biologists, and other basic scientists are joining the team to ensure an exciting future for pediatric cardiology and the children yet to be born. "
174,36049595,"View classification is a key step toward building a fully automated system for interpretation of echocardiograms. However, compared with adult echocardiograms, creating a view classification model for pediatric echocardiograms poses additional challenges, such as greater variation in anatomy, structure size, and views. The aim of this study was to develop a computer vision model to autonomously perform view classification on pediatric echocardiographic images. Using a training set of 12,067 echocardiographic images from patients aged 0 to 19 years, a convolutional neural network model was trained to identify 27 preselected standard pediatric echocardiographic views which included anatomic sweeps, color Doppler, and Doppler tracings. A validation set of 6,197 images was used for parameter tuning and model selection. A test set of 9,684 images from 100 different patients was then used to evaluate model accuracy. The model was also evaluated on a per study basis using a second test set consisting of 524 echocardiograms from children with leukemia to identify six preselected views pertinent to cardiac dysfunction surveillance. The model identified the 27 preselected views with 90.3% accuracy. Accuracy was similar across age groups (89.3% for 0-4 years, 90.8% for 4-9 years, 90.0% for 9-14 years, and 91.2% for 14-19 years; P = .12). Examining the view subtypes, accuracy was 78.3% for the cine one location, 90.5% for sweeps with color Doppler, 82.2% for sweeps without color Doppler, and 91.1% for Doppler tracings. Among the leukemia cohort, the model identified the six preselected views on a per study basis with a positive predictive value of 98.7% to 99.2% and sensitivity of 76.9% to 94.8%. A convolutional neural network model was constructed for view classification of pediatric echocardiograms that was accurate across the spectrum of ages and view types. This work lays the foundation for automated quantitative analysis and diagnostic support to promote efficient, accurate, and scalable analysis of pediatric echocardiograms. "
175,22065796,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of three diagnostic sonographic methods, greyscale sonography (GSS), colour Doppler sonography (CDS) and spectral Doppler (SPD), in differentiating between benign and malignant salivary gland (SG) tumours. 44 patients with SG masses were examined using GSS, CDS and SPD. The morphological features of each tumour were evaluated using GSS, the distribution and number of detected blood vessels were assessed using CDS, and peak systolic velocity (PSV), resistive index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) were measured on SPD. All cases underwent excisional biopsy and a definite tissue diagnosis was obtained. Histopathological examination revealed that 28 of the 44 tumours were benign and 16 were malignant. GSS showed that malignant SG tumours had a significantly higher incidence of ill-defined borders and lymph node involvement than benign tumours, but there was no significant difference between benign and malignant SG tumours regarding echogenicity, homogeneity or sonographic shape. CDS demonstrated malignant tumours with significantly higher vascularity and a scattered distribution. Using SPD, malignant tumours had significantly higher PSV, RI and PI compared with benign tumours. RI values above 0.7, PI values above 1.2, PSV values above 44.3 cm s(-1), ill-defined borders, lymph node involvement, Grade 2 or 3 vascularity and hilar distribution of blood vessels should alert the clinician to suspect a malignant SG tumour. After consensus on the threshold values of PSV, RI and PI in differentiating benign from malignant SG tumours, these numbers should be incorporated into the software of ultrasound machines to guide the sonographer in his or her analysis.

Chloe is apprehensive about the visit and frequently hides behind her mother.Her parents first noticed Chloe becoming angry and more emotional 3 years ago, which her parents did not initially understand. However, over the past year, she has started to have more worries and unusual behavior.Chloe and her mother report that when she walks through doorways, she will almost always go back and walks through again. At home, she will walk through doorways multiple times and at school, she will pretend she forgot something so her friends do not notice. She often will not walk downstairs and occasionally her mother has to carry her. Clothes are problematic for Chloe. If her father touches something of a specific color and then touches Chloe, she will have to change her clothes or take a shower. Sometimes, she will never be able to wear those clothes again. She had a recent episode where she could not stop tapping a red paper, because if she stopped, she said it would burst into flame. During the 2 weeks before the pediatric visit, symptoms increased to the point that she is now refusing to go to school. When she stays home, she lays in 1 place all day.Chloe is a fourth grade student. The family does not report academic concerns. She has friends. She denies any appetite or sleep problems. She endorses periods of sadness, lack of energy, and decreased interest in social activities, mostly because she worries and is embarrassed. She kept her behaviors hidden from her 5 siblings for the past year, and she talked only to her mother about them. She is worried her friends might discover her behaviors.The family history is notable for multiple paternal family members with anxiety and bipolar disorder and depression on mother's side. A few months ago, Chloe's family adopted a 7-year-old child with special needs from China.Her growth, vital signs, and physical examination are unremarkable.

177,12050604,"Doppler tissue imaging allows the measurement of tissue motion velocity in real time. However, tissue velocities are affected by translational motion and by the angle of Doppler interrogation. The myocardial velocity gradient and myocardial wall thickening velocity, determined by color Doppler tissue imaging, can be used to evaluate regional wall thickening and thinning motion independent of translational motion. To determine the control values for myocardial velocity gradient and myocardial wall thickening velocity for the interventricular septum and posterior wall, we studied 120 healthy children (mean age: 7.8 +/- 5.0 years). Peak values of myocardial velocity gradient and myocardial wall thickening velocity at each cardiac phase were measured: systole, early diastole, and atrial contraction. The peak values of myocardial velocity gradient and myocardial wall thickening velocity were higher in the posterior wall than those in the interventricular septum, suggesting that thickening and thinning are more dynamic in the posterior wall. Linear regression analysis demonstrated that absolute values of myocardial velocity gradient at systole, early diastole, and atrial contraction, and wall thickening velocity at atrial contraction decreased with body surface area (BSA). On the other hand, absolute values of myocardial wall thickening velocity at systole and early diastole increased with BSA, and myocardial wall thickening velocity at early diastole in interventricular septum did not change. Myocardial velocity gradient at systole and early diastole, and myocardial wall thickening velocity at systole were strongly related to BSA. In contrast, myocardial velocity gradient and myocardial wall thickening velocity at atrial contraction strongly correlated with time interval between 2 consecutive QRS complexes. Because myocardial wall thickening velocity at early diastole in the interventricular septum did not correlate with BSA or time interval between 2 consecutive QRS complexes, it might evaluate diastolic function of interventricular septum independent of body size or heart rate.

178,3143448,"Assessment of vision in schoolchildren is routinely performed, but the effectiveness of the screening programmes has not been reviewed. A survey of health district screening programmes for vision in schools was performed at the end of 1984. The response rate from districts in England and Wales was 81%. All 165 of the districts that responded screened for loss of distant visual acuity; 96% screened for loss of colour vision, 73% for squint, and 67% for loss of near visual acuity. The frequency with which districts screened varied considerably. Some districts screened yearly, and various different types of tests were used. In many districts children were screened in unsuitable places, such as corridors, assembly halls, and toilets. Criteria for referral varied from one district to another, and few districts collected data appropriate for monitoring their screening programmes. Many districts screened more intensively than could be justified on the basis of the conditions tested for and the likely benefit of remedial treatment. "
179,4008683,"The clinicopathologic spectrum of angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (ALHE) is reported through a study of 116 cases (67 male and 49 female) submitted to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. The lesions are most common in the head-neck region and are characterized by single or multiple smooth-top papules or plaques of varying color. Microscopically, ALHE consists of anomalous vascular proliferations and varying degrees of nodular and diffuse lymphocytic infiltrates with eosinophils at all levels of the corium and subcutaneous tissue. In fifty-three cases an arterial structure, confirmed by the presence of an internal elastic lamina, was observed in close association with venular structures or was the site of endothelial cell proliferation. ALHE comprises a spectrum of unusual vascular proliferation with inflammation, encompassing such entities as inflammatory angiomatous nodules, pseudo or atypical pyogenic granuloma, histiocytoid hemangioma, epithelioid hemangioma, and Kimura's disease. The existence of arterial structures among venules and endothelial cell proliferations suggests the presence of arteriovenous (AV) shunts, which may help explain the pathogenesis and biologic behavior of this condition.

180,32603724,"High-flow vascular stains (HFVS) are lesions that have the appearance of capillary malformations/port wine stains but are associated with increased arterial flow. To identify features of HFVS that differentiate them from typical ""slow-flow"" port wine stains. Retrospective multicenter cohort study of HFVS evaluated across 7 centers was conducted. HFVS were characterized by clinical features (warmth, thrill, rapid capillary refill), radiologic findings (fast flow), or mutations associated with capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome. Investigators reviewed photographs. The study reviewed 70 patients with HFVS (47 multifocal and 23 solitary). Most were flat (77%), warm to the touch (60%), and red or pink-red in color (35%), with heterogeneous color saturation (73%) and well-defined borders (71%). Regional soft tissue swelling/overgrowth was common (47%). Head and neck location was most common (38%). Among 34 HFVS with photographic review over time, all demonstrated changes in appearance. Retrospective design, recall bias, lack of standardized time points or visual analog scale, and image variability. Heterogeneity of stain color saturation, warmth to touch, peripheral pallor, and overgrowth/soft tissue swelling help distinguish HFVS from port wine stains. Darkening of color and increased border demarcation may develop over time. These findings raise suspicion for HFVS and provide an indication to assess for extracutaneous involvement. "

182,27914108,"Lichen aureus (LA) is a variant of pigmented purpuric dermatosis that is characterized clinically by rust macules, papules or plaques, mainly on the legs. In some cases, LA can be difficult to be distinguished from nummular eczema (NE) with the naked eye. Dermoscopy can be applied to skin lesions, revealing additional features that can be highly valuable for correct diagnosis. This study was conducted to investigate characteristic dermoscopic findings of LA and to identify distinctive features that can differentiate it from NE. Fourteen LA patients and 14 NE patients diagnosed by skin biopsy were enrolled. Skin lesions were evaluated via polarized dermoscopy. On dermoscopy, ""coppery orange diffuse coloration of background"", ""round to oval red globules"", ""gray dots"", and ""networks of brownish to gray interconnected lines"" were more commonly seen in LA (100%, 92.9%, 42.9% and 64.3%, respectively) compared with NE. ""Scales"", ""shiny yellow clods"" and ""irregularly distributed brownish-red globules"" were more commonly seen in NE (100%, 85.7% and 57.1%, respectively) compared with LA. Dermoscopy provides valuable information for diagnosis of LA and aids in differentiating it from NE. "
183,36977985,"Anesthesiologists need to appreciate the impact of preoperative anxiety in children. The present study aimed to explore whether interactive multimedia-based home-initiated interventions could effectively relieve preoperative anxiety in pediatric patients. In this prospective study, we compared preoperative anxiety between two groups of children aged 4-9 years. Children in the control group received a question-and-answer (Q&A) introduction, and children in the intervention group received multimedia-based home-initiated preoperative education using comic booklets, videos, and coloring game books. Differences in anxiety between the two groups were evaluated by the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale-Short Form (mYPAS-SF) at four time points: in the ophthalmology outpatient clinic before intervention as the baseline (T0); in the preoperative waiting area (T1); at the time of separating from their parents and moving to the operating room (T2); and at the time of anesthesia induction (T3). Parental anxiety was assessed by the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at T0 and T2. Other related information was collected by questionnaire. Eighty-four children who underwent pediatric strabismus in our center between November 2020 and July 2021 were included in this study. An intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was performed on data from 78 enrolled children. Children in the intervention group exhibited lower m-YPAS-SF scores at T1, T2, and T3 than those in the control group (all p < 0.001). By using a mixed-effect model with repeated measurement (MMRM) after adjusting the m-YPAS score at T0 as a covariate, the interventional effect in terms of themYPAS-SF score was also significant over time (p < 0.001). The percentage of children with perfect induction compliance (ICC = 0) in the intervention group was significantly higher than that in the control group [18.4% vs. 7.5%], and poor induction compliance (ICC>4) was lower (2.6% vs. 17.5%, p = 0.048). The mean parental VAS score at T2 in the intervention group was significantly lower than that in the control group (p = 0.021). Interactive multimedia-based home-initiated intervention could reduce preoperative anxiety in children and improve the quality of anesthesia induction based on ICC scores, which may in turn impose a positive impact on parental anxiety.

184,27935010,"This study documents the perspectives of Australian dermatologists on the adequacy of teaching and training in skin of colour (SOC), and their confidence in diagnosing and treating common medical, surgical and cosmetic issues in SOC and to gauge their desire for further training in this area. Surveys were distributed to Australasian Dermatologists during their annual scientific meeting in Melbourne, Australia in 2014. Completed surveys from dermatologists nationwide were collected and evaluated. Altogether 270 surveys were distributed. In total, 140 surveys were completed and returned. Four surveys were excluded as they were completed by dermatologists who were not practicing in Australia. Thus, 136 surveys were deemed appropriate for analysis. While 75% of participants were confident in managing common medical issues in SOC 85% were not confident in managing common cosmetic issues in SOC and 75% were not confident performing procedures on SOC. Over 80% stated they would have liked more teaching in SOC during their training and over 50% of those surveyed believe they had enough time to undertake further training in this area. We propose here the first analysis of issues relating to SOC dermatology among Australian dermatologists in the context of the changing patient demographic in the country. The findings of this survey clearly demonstrate there is a need and desire for more training in medical, cosmetic and procedural aspects of SOC dermatology and that most of the Australian dermatologists surveyed have the desire and time to undertake such training.

185,39178693,"No definitive management guidelines exist for Spitz-type lesions; recommendations in the UK favour a 'safe' approach with a low threshold for excision. We aimed to describe Spitz-type lesions in children to further clarify the clinical features and outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study in Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK, and reviewed all patients aged ≤18 years with histologically confirmed Spitz-type lesions from November 2014 to September 2020. Information collected included patient demographics, lesion details, follow-up, outcomes and recurrence. Ninety-one children (male: female 42: 49; mean age at diagnosis: 9.4 years, SD: 4.6 years) were identified. Among them, 64 (70.3%) had classic Spitz or spitzoid naevi, 26 (28.6%) atypical Spitz tumours and 1 (1.1%) had spitzoid malignant melanoma based on histological features. On assessing the clinical features, where documented, we found that 22.0% (20/91) had amelanosis, 44.0% (40/91) had a raised bump, 12.1% (11/91) displayed bleeding, 25.0% (20/80) had non-uniform colour, 96.7% (88/91) were de novo lesions, 55.1% (43/78) were evolving in size and 35.9% (28/78) were evolving in colour. Fifty-nine patients (64.8%) were discharged without the need for follow-up, and the other 32 had a median follow-up time of 4 months. After confirmed excision, no incidences of local recurrence, distant metastases or mortality have been reported to date in all patients. The outcomes for paediatric Spitz-type lesions continue to be exceptionally good, remaining a low-risk lesion, which is more likely to be benign in children. Hence, we do not advocate aggressive management strategies for paediatric patients with clinically banal Spitz-type lesions. "

A prospective cross-sectional study of all sick children presenting to the emergency department of a government referral hospital in Eldoret, Kenya, was performed. Measured weight was compared with predicted weights according to the Broselow tape and commonly used advanced pediatric life support (APLS) and Nelson's age-based formulas. A Bland-Altman analysis was used to determine agreement between each method and actual weight. The method for weight prediction was determined a priori to be equivalent to the actual weight if the 95% confidence interval for the mean percentage difference between the predicted and actual weight was less than 10%. Nine hundred sixty-seven children were included in analysis. The overall mean percentage difference for the actual weight and Broselow predicted weight was -2.2%, whereas APLS and Nelson's predictions were -5.2% and -10.4%, respectively. The overall agreement between Broselow color zone and actual weight was 65.5%, with overestimate typically occurring by only 1 color zone. The Broselow tape and APLS formula predict the weights of children in western Kenya. According to its better performance, ease of use, and provision of drug dosing and equipment size, the Broselow tape is superior to age-based formulas for estimation of weight in Kenyan children. "
187,35490281,"An 8-year-old boy with asthma presented with prolonged fever, malaise, extremity weakness, polyarthralgias, malar rash, and subcutaneous nodules. Physical examination was remarkable for a faint malar rash, flesh-colored papules on the dorsal aspect of the fingers, arthritis of multiple joints in the hands, and subcutaneous nodules. The nodules were firm, nontender, and distributed over multiple extremities and the trunk. The patient was admitted to expedite workup. Initial laboratory test results revealed leukopenia, mild elevation of the aminotransferases, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and normal level of creatine kinase. His echocardiogram was normal. Infectious disease studies were negative. Additional examination revealed dilated capillaries in his nail beds and bilateral hip weakness. MRI of his extremities was negative for myositis or calcification of the nodules. We obtained a biopsy of the subcutaneous nodules, and because the patient remained afebrile during the hospitalization, we discharged him from the hospital with outpatient follow-up. Our expert panel reviews the course of the patient's evaluation and investigation, as well as the implications of his diagnosis based on the tissue pathology from the nodule biopsy. "
188,29197362,"In many countries, access to general health and eye care is related to an individual's socioeconomic status (SES). We aimed to examine the prevalence of oculo-visual disorders in children in Istanbul Turkey, drawn from schools at SES extremes but geographically nearby. Three school-based vision screenings (presenting distance visual acuity, cover test, eye assessment history, colour vision, gross stereopsis and non-cycloplegic autorefraction) were conducted on 81% of a potential 1014 primary-school children aged 4-10 years from two private (high SES) schools and a nearby government (low SES) school in central Istanbul. Prevalence of refractive errors and school-based differences were analysed using parametric statistics (ANOVA). The remaining oculo-visual aspects were compared using non-parametric tests. Of the 823 children with mean age 6.7 ± 2.2 years, approximately 10% were referred for a full eye examination (8.2% and 16.3% of private/government schools respectively). Vision had not been previously examined in nearly 22% of private school children and 65% of government school children. Of all children, 94.5% were able to accurately identify the 6/9.5 [LogMAR 0.2] line of letters/shapes with each eye and 86.6% the 6/6 line [LogMAR 0], while 7.9% presented wearing spectacles, 3.8% had impaired colour vision, 1.5% had grossly impaired stereo-vision, 1.5% exhibited strabismus, 1.8% were suspected to have amblyopia and 0.5% had reduced acuity of likely organic origin. Of the 804 without strabismus, amblyopia or organic conditions, 6.0% were myopic ≤ - 0.50DS, 0.6% hyperopic ≥ + 2.00DS, 7.7% astigmatic ≥1.00 DC and 6.2% anisometropic ≥1.00DS. The results highlight the need for general vision screenings for all children prior to school entry given the varied and different pattern of visual problems associated with lifestyle differences in two populations raised in the same urban locale but drawn from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

189,19222458,"Atopic dermatitis is a disease of skin barrier dysfunction and outside stimuli can cross the skin barrier. To examine a new method for evaluating the outside to inside skin transparency with a colorimeter and yellow dyes. In study 1, a total of 28 volunteer subjects (24 normal and four with atopic dermatitis) participated. After provocation with yellow dye, the skin colour of all the subjects was measured using a colorimeter. The skin transparency index was calculated by the changes of the skin colour to yellow. Other variables of skin function, including transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and stratum corneum hydration, were also measured. In study 2, the skin transparency index was evaluated for a cohort of 38 patients with atopic dermatitis, 27 subjects with dry skin and 29 healthy controls. In study 1, the measurement of skin colour (b*) using tartrazine showed good results. There was a significant relationship between the skin transparency index with tartrazine and the atopic dermatitis score (P = 0.014). No other measurements of skin function, including the TEWL, were correlated. In study 2, the skin transparency index score obtained with tartrazine in the patients with atopic dermatitis was significantly higher than that of the controls and those with dry skin (P < 0.001 and P = 0.022, respectively). However, the TEWL in patients with atopic dermatitis was not significantly higher than that of patients with dry skin and the TEWL in subjects with dry skin was not higher than that of the controls. This method, which used a colorimeter and food dye, is noninvasive, safe and reliable for the evaluation of out-in skin transparency and can demonstrate the characteristic dysfunction in the skin barrier in patients with atopic dermatitis.

While the histologic findings of BFH may be observed in a variety of clinical settings, familial multiple BFH represents a distinct clinical entity characterized by tiny flesh-colored papules scattered predominantly over the face. We present two sisters with this rare condition and review the clinical and histologic differential diagnosis of familial multiple BFH. "
191,8921487,"Although most epidemiological data are gathered by interviews, few studies ascertain their reliability. This study quantified inter-observer reliability of environmental, biological and health characteristics of underprivileged children, in a southern Brazilian state. Five health care professionals who had received extensive standardized interview and observation training interviewed mothers and observed the home environments of a random sample of 102 children. A second interview was conducted by a sixth health professional who had received separate but identical training without the initial interviewer knowing a follow-up interview would be conducted. Data from the two independent interviews and observations were compared for agreement using the kappa statistic. There was excellent agreement (kappa > 0.75) for most of the household characteristics, such as type of walls, ceiling, floor and windows in spite of the diversity of buildings. Presence of the parents, number of people in the house-hold, age of the mother and health assistance were reliable as well. However, information about skin colour of the mother and the number of cracks in the house only reached fair agreement. These results showed that data gathered by observation and interviews generate accurate information about environmental, biological and health care characteristics. Those based on written information, such as birth date, were highly concordant. In Brazil, data from a case control study of risk factors for pneumonia among low-income children less than 24 months old were used to quantify the reliability of inter-observer information about environmental, biological, and health characteristics of these children. Five experienced field workers who underwent training in role play, classroom lectures, discussions, and closely-supervised field practice interviewed the mothers of 102 children and observed their home environments. Another experienced professional, unknown to the other field workers, who received the same instructions as the others but independently of them conducted a second independent assessment three weeks after the initial assessment. All the interviewers were blind to the objective of this study. Even though the dwellings were quite diverse, the researchers found excellent agreement (kappa statistic 75) for most household characteristics (type of walls, presence and type of ceiling, type of floor, and presence, type, and number of windows in child's bedroom). Agreement was also good to excellent for presence of parents, number of people in the household, age of the mother, and history of previous pneumonia, hospitalization, and immunization. Agreement was relatively good when the number of cracks in the wall was 0 (0.76) or more than 20 (0.65) but not when it ranged from 1 to 19 (0.3-0.38). Agreement on skin color was more reliable when skin color was White or Black (0.77 and 0.78, respectively) than it was for mixed (0.63). Data based on written information yielded the most concordance while observation of sensitive risk factors (i.e., skin color and number of cracks [indicator for poor housing]) yielded the lowest concordance. These findings show that observation- and interview-collected data yield accurate information about environmental, biological, and health care characteristics. "
192,38108513,"The United States holds the distinction of being the developed country with the worst perinatal outcomes despite spending the most per capita on health care. Black women are three to four times more likely than White women to experience adverse birth outcomes. These outcomes persist despite access to prenatal care, insurance, and college education. A long overdue racial reckoning has arrived, beginning with acknowledging the fallacy of race-based medicine and the role of enduring systemic racism as foundational to obstetric racism in the reproductive lives of Black women. Centering voices of Black women and honoring their lived experiences are essential to providing respectful maternity care. Naming micro- and macroaggressions experienced by Black women allows for dismantling of systemic barriers which perpetuate inequitable outcomes and enable substandard care. Racial concordance (shared racial identity) is one tool to consider in creating safe health care spaces for Black women. Improving diversity of the nursing workforce specifically, and the health care workforce in general, is necessary to affect racial concordance. Application of skills in cultural humility can mitigate challenges associated with adverse patient encounters for Black women as diversity pipeline strategies are explored. Histories of foundational fallacy, their impact on care and outcomes, and patient-driven indicators for improving pregnancy care experiences for women of color are explored through the lens of a Black physician and the collective reproductive health workforce.

193,30439844,"Music therapy and attachment is an expanding field and the number of studies addressing the theoretical work is slowly growing. There are both qualitative and quantitative approaches to studying the effect of regular music therapy sessions on parent-child interactions and these cover a range of patient populations including: children at risk of neglect, parents with a trauma history, children coping with bereavement and a large number addressing the disability population, including autism spectrum disorder. These studies suggest that music therapy benefits the parent-child relationship through the improvement communication, especially non-verbal communication, and so increased the feeling of closeness and understanding. Following a review of the available literature, a pilot study is described using transcripts of video recordings of music therapy sessions, and subsequent colour coding and conversion of the data into pie charts provides a potential method of analysis that produces an ""interaction profile"" of each parent-child dyad. Preliminary results of this method of analysis suggest that music therapy sessions might be able to improve interactions through therapists addressing the power dynamics within a relationship. The new method developed in this pilot study to visualise and study the parent-child relationship in music therapy sessions was effective and could be used and developed by music therapy researchers in the future.

194,2003937,"Technologic advances in echocardiography (e.g., better spatial resolution, Doppler, and color flow mapping) have improved our ability to demonstrate anatomy and physiology in previously problematic conditions, precluding catheterization and angiography in some instances. However, diagnostic catheterization remains necessary in other instances. The aims of this study were to determine whether echocardiography alone was sufficient to delineate the anatomic and flow abnormalities in patients subsequently selected to undergo catheterization and, if not, under what circumstances was echocardiography unable to establish the definitive diagnosis. Echocardiograms of 252 infants and children who underwent catheterization during a 14-month interval were analyzed retrospectively to determine whether the echographic assessment was nondiscrepant (group 1) or discrepant (group 2) with the catheterization assessment. Any deviation in the complete accurate assessment constituted a discrepancy; identification of more than one discrepancy in a single patient was possible. Independent variables included patient's age, weight, operative status, use of color flow mapping, echocardiograph operator, and interval between echocardiogram and catheterization. To determine whether the discrepancies were clinically significant, data from patients in group 2 were reviewed independently by three cardiologists to determine whether patient management would have changed given the added data provided by catheterization. Echocardiographic evaluations were discrepant in 155 instances. In 54 of 155 instances (35%), discrepancies were judged to be clinically significant (group 3). Twenty-three of 54 cases (43%) involved extracardiac lesions (i.e., aortic arch, pulmonary arterial, bronchial collateral, and pulmonary venous anomalies), 20 of 54 (37%) involved pressure gradients, 7 of 54 (13%) involved intracardiac lesions, and 4 of 54 (7%) involved coronary arterial lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) "
195,30031872,"To assess functional vision in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with a cognitive visual function battery in addition to standard ophthalmic examinations. Subjects were recruited from a school for children with ASD. In addition to a comprehensive ophthalmic examination, all children underwent cognitive vision assessment at a tertiary ophthalmological care center in India. A total of 30 children were included. The distribution of the number of children with mild to moderate versus severe ASD was nearly equal based on CARS autism scores. The majority of subjects had normal color vision (16/18), contrast (24), shape discrimination (26), and perception of directionality (28). Most were not able to identify optical illusions or differentiate tests of emotions. Ocular pursuits, saccades, and recognition of size differences were often abnormal. Poor visual closure was noted in (11) subjects. The duration of fixation to Heidi face target was inversely proportional to the severity of ASD. The study further established that cognitive visual impairment was present in children with ASD irrespective of their severity of ASD. All subjects had some form of cognitive visual impairment independent of ASD severity. "

197,33029745,"This retrospective cohort observational study evaluated marginal integrity, gingival health and aesthetics of zirconia crowns (ZC) placed on primary maxillary anterior teeth at 6- to over 30-month follow-up visits. Two independent raters evaluated radiographic and photographic findings in 131 ZC placed in 36 children aged 24.8-62.2 months (median = 40.6) who had at least one recall visit 6 months after placement. Follow-up periods were stratified into three levels: long, intermediate and short. Associations between crown performance and crown brands, follow-up periods, treatment performed under general anaesthesia or sedation and previous pulpotomy were investigated by ordinal logistic regression. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 33.8 months (average: 13.5 months). Marginal integrity was highly rated in 82.4% of the teeth. No gingivitis was found in 35% of the teeth, 58% showed mild gingivitis and 7% showed moderate gingivitis (p = 0.06). Colour match and crown contour were rated very high in 55% of the cases. Marginal integrity and periodontal health differed between cases performed under general anaesthesia and those performed under sedation (p = 0.03 and p = 0.003, respectively). Pulpotomized teeth showed worse colour matching with the adjacent teeth than non-pulpotomized teeth (p = 0.03). Our findings suggest that ZC comprise a satisfactory treatment option for carious primary maxillary incisors, presenting good overall marginal integrity, gingival health, and aesthetics. "
198,35053627,"Little is known about parent and family well-being after acute neonatal seizures. In thus study, we aimed to characterize parent mental health and family coping over the first two years after their child's neonatal seizures. Parents of 303 children with acute neonatal seizures from nine pediatric hospitals completed surveys at discharge and 12-, 18- and 24-months corrected age. Outcomes included parental anxiety, depression, quality of life, impact on the family, post-traumatic stress and post-traumatic growth. We used linear mixed effect regression models and multivariate analysis to examine relationships among predictors and outcomes. At the two-year timepoint, parents reported clinically significant anxiety (31.5%), depression (11.7%) and post-traumatic stress (23.7%). Parents reported moderately high quality of life and positive personal change over time despite ongoing challenges to family coping. Families of children with longer neonatal hospitalization, functional impairment, post-neonatal epilepsy, receiving developmental support services and families of color reported poorer parental mental health and family coping. Parents of color were more likely to report symptoms of post-traumatic stress and positive personal change. Clinicians caring for children with neonatal seizures should be aware of lasting risks to parent mental health and family coping. Universal screening would enable timely referral for support services to mitigate further risk to family well-being and child development. "
199,14580669,"Two functionally and neurally distinct cognitive selection mechanisms involve the prefrontal lobes: those based on internal representations (context dependent) and those involving exploratory processing of novel situations (context independent). We used a cognitive bias task (CBT) representing contextual reasoning to correlate lateralization with age in the frontal lobes. Subjects included 37 healthy right-handed male children and adolescents (age range, 5-18 years). Controls were 19 right-handed men from 20 to 30 years old. A computer-presented version of the original card-choice task simplified, modified for children was used (modified CBT; mCBT). Simple visual stimuli differed dichotomously in shape, color, number, and shading. A target object presented alone was followed by two choices from which subjects selected according to preference. Considering all four characteristics, similarity between target and subject choice was scored for 30 trials. A high score implied a context-dependent response selection bias and a low score, a context-independent bias. Similarity increased significantly with age. The youngest children (5-7 years) scored lower than ages from 11 years to adulthood. Between 7 and 9 years, scores began to increase with age to reach an adult level by age 13-16. Young children showed context-independent responses representing right frontal lobe function, while adolescents and adults showed context-dependent responses implicating left frontal lobe function. The locus of frontal cortical control in right-handed male subjects thus shifts from right to left as cognitive contextual reasoning develops. "
200,36922154,"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a complex chronic autoimmune disease disproportionally afflicting women and, in particular, American Indian/Alaska Native, Black, and Hispanic women. These groups of women have significantly worse SLE-related health outcomes which are partially attributable to their exposure to marginalizing and interconnecting social issues like racism, sexism, economic inequality, and more. Although these groups of women have higher rates of SLE and though it is well known that they are at risk of exposure to marginalizing social phenomena, relatively little SLE literature explicitly links and addresses the relationship between marginalizing social issues and poor SLE-health outcomes among these women. Therefore, we developed a community-engaged partnership with two childhood-SLE diagnosed women of color to identify their perspectives on which systemic issues impacted on their SLE health-related outcomes. Afterward, we used Cochrane guidelines to conduct a rapid review associated with these identified issues and original SLE research. Then, we adapted an ecological model to illustrate the connection between systems issues and SLE health outcomes. Finally, we provided recommendations for ways to research and clinically mitigate SLE health inequities. "
201,36195171,"The psychosocial burden of food allergy (FA) can significantly affect the lives of pediatric patients and their families. A comprehensive understanding of the state of the literature on psychosocial functioning is imperative to identify gaps that may affect clinical care and future research. This review characterizes the current literature on psychosocial functioning in pediatric patients with FA and their caregivers, siblings, and families. A literature search of 5 databases (PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Embase) was conducted to identify original research articles and abstracts on psychosocial functioning of patients with FA who were aged 0 to 18 years and their caregivers, siblings, and families. A total of 257 studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority of studies examined child or caregiver psychosocial functioning, with child and caregiver quality of life examined most frequently. Most studies utilized quantitative and cross-sectional methods and inconsistently reported participant race and ethnicity. Existing research on psychosocial functioning in pediatric FA may not be generalizable to patients of color and families and siblings. Future research should diversify recruited samples regarding race, ethnicity, and country of origin; examine psychosocial functioning longitudinally; examine constructs beyond quality of life; and adopt a biopsychosocial approach by considering the interplay among psychosocial functioning, disease burden, and social contexts.

The average age of the children was (6.3 ± 0.3) months, 22 of them were boys (18.0%) and 100 were girls (82.0%). An erythometry and ultrasound examination were performed to determine the depth of the neoplasm, to assess its blood flow, and the presence and diameter of the supply vessels. Studies of these indicators were conducted for patients before and after the treatment. Laser treatment was performed on 109 patients with 119 hemangiomas. A total of 81 superficial hemangiomas underwent a short course of laser therapy (2-5 procedures) and remaining patients with 38 combined hemangiomas received a long course of laser treatment, consisting of 6 to 10 procedures. Restoration of normal color, skin relief, and the absence of scars were noted in post-treatment sample on evaluation. After the course of treatment, erythometry readings corresponded to the values of normal skin and decreased to 110 to 80 cu. Ultrasound examination showed vascular formation and feed vessels were not visualized. "
204,8050203,"In order to clarify the T-cell abnormalities present in minimal-change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS), lymphocyte subsets were studied using two-color flow cytometry in children with MCNS and nephrotic syndrome caused by other types of glomerular disease, and normal healthy children. In MCNS, CD4+Leu8+ (suppressor-inducer) and CD3+CD25+ (IL-2 receptor positive T) cells were significantly increased, and CD4+Leu8- (helper-inducer), CD8+CD11+ (suppressor), CD3+HLA-DR+ (DR positive T) and CD4+HLA-DR+ (activated helper/inducer) cells were significantly decreased in comparison with normal healthy children. The same abnormalities were also found in nephrotic syndrome caused by other types of glomerular disease. These findings indicate that abnormalities of lymphocyte subsets are present in MCNS and nephrotic syndrome due to a variety of glomerular diseases, and suggest that such abnormalities are a consequence of nephrotic syndrome.

205,12205283,"To determine the construct, content, and convergent validity of 2 self-report pain scales for use in the untrained child in the emergency department (ED). A prospective study was conducted of all children who presented to an urban ED between 5 and 16 years of age inclusive after written informed consent was obtained. Children were excluded if they were intoxicated, had altered sensorium, were clinically unstable, did not speak English, or had developmental delays. Children marked their current pain severity on a standardized Color Analog Scale (CAS) and a 7-point Faces Pain Scale (FPS). They were then asked whether their pain was mild, moderate, or severe. Children were then administered an analgesic at the discretion of the attending physician and asked to repeat these measurements. For assessing content validity, the scales were also administered to age- and gender-matched children in the ED for nonpainful conditions. Convergent validity was assessed by determining the Spearman correlation coefficient between the 2 pain scales. A total of 60 children were enrolled, 30 with pain and 30 without, with a mean age of 9.3 +/- 3.3 years. Boys accounted for 38 of the enrollees (63.3%). The median score before analgesic administration was 6.0 cm (interquartile range [IQR]: 4.0-8.0) on the CAS and 3.0 faces (IQR: 2.0-5.0) on the FPS; after analgesic administration, the median scores decreased to 3.1 cm (IQR: 1.1-4.3) and 2.0 faces (IQR: 1.0-3.0), respectively. As the reported pain intensity increased, so did the scores on the 2 pain scales. The 30 children with no pain had a median score on the CAS of 0.0 (IQR: 0.0-1.0) and on the FPS of 0.0 (IQR: 0.0-1.0), whereas the 13 children with severe pain had a median CAS of 7.0 (IQR: 6.0-8.0) and a median FPS of 5.0 (IQR: 4.0-6.0). The Spearman correlation coefficient between the CAS and the FPS was positive and strong (r = 0.894). The CAS and the FPS exhibit construct, content, and convergent validity in the measurement of acute pain in children in the ED. "

208,18071280,"A hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma is an uncommon benign tumor in children and little is known about the spectrum of its radiological features. The purpose of this study is to describe the spectrum of radiological features of a hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma in children. Thirteen children with a pathologically confirmed hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma (M:F = 7:6; mean age, 3 years 2 months) were included in our study. Ultrasonography (US) was performed in nine patients including color and power Doppler US (n = 7). CT scans were performed in all patients. We evaluated the imaging findings of the hepatic mesenchymal hamartomas and the corresponding pathological features. Each patient had a single tumor (mean diameter: 13 cm [1.8-20 cm]). On CT and/or US, four patients (31%) had a ""multiseptated cystic tumor"", five patients (38%) had a ""mixed solid and cystic tumor"", and four patients (31%) had a ""solid tumor."" The septa of the cystic portion were thin in the multiseptated cystic tumors and irregularly thick in the mixed solid and cystic tumors as seen on US. On a post-contrast CT scan, solid portions or thick septa of the tumors showed heterogeneous enhancement. The amount of hepatocytes was significantly different among the three tumor groups according to the imaging spectrum (p = 0.042). A hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma in children can show a wide spectrum of radiological features, from a multiseptated cystic tumor to a mixed solid and cystic tumor, and even a solid tumor. "

210,38189745,"The supracondylar humeral fracture (SCHF) is the most common fracture seen in children, forming up to 70% of all pediatric elbow fractures. The decision to surgically explore the brachial artery in a well-perfused, pulseless arm remains a controversial one among vascular and orthopedic surgeons and is something we seek to explore in this article. We reviewed the literature from electronic databases such as PubMed and Embase for studies focusing on the management of the pink pulseless hand (PPH) following SCHF. We gathered a total of 23 articles to be analyzed in this review. We found 336 PPH postreduction and evaluated the management as well as the follow-up and complications of the PPH involved. Most recent articles have cited the close observation strategy as the most reliable strategy. It is clear that the management of a SCHF requires immediate reduction and fixation. In the management of a postoperatively pulseless pink humerus, we do agree with the latest conclusion of Delionitis et al . who advocate the traditional dogma of watchful waiting in the case of a PPH postreduction and fixation as long as no signs of vascular deterioration appear. However, the outcome of this study also advocates for the monitoring of up to 24-48 h postreduction and the use of noninvasive tools such as ultrasound Doppler, Color flow duplex Ultrasound and pulse oximetry to monitor perfusion as they all have had good outcomes in the articles cited in this review. Still, in the event of vascular deterioration or development of complications of the hand, immediate vascular exploration is still indicated. "
211,8846750,"During a ten year observation period it was found that scar formation after thoracic surgery is influenced by various factors: metabolism, operative technique and factors of a general nature.

Before and during the six-month treatment period, both macromorphology and scar colour were assessed; furthermore, a global evaluation of the therapeutic result was made. Additionally, the scars were characterized after a six-month treatment-free follow-up period. The results of 38 Contractubex-treated and 27 untreated patients were compared. In the treated scars, the global evaluation of the therapeutic result was better than in the untreated scars. In the Contractubex group, the rating was ""good"" and ""very good"" in 84% of cases, as compared to 59% of the untreated cases. In the treated group, the increase in scar size was markedly lower than in the untreated patients. The treated scars showed a tendency towards quicker paling than the untreated scars. In the treated group, the conversion of primary physiological scars to unphysiological scars (hypertrophic or keloidal scars) was less frequent than in the untreated group. The tolerability of the product was very good in 37 of the 38 treated patients, and good in one patient. All scar-specific effects of Contractubex continued to persist after the end of treatment. "

The children were allocated to a combined dietary and PA intervention group (n = 237) or a control group (n = 160) without blinding. The children and their parents allocated to the intervention group had six dietary counseling sessions of 30-45 min and six PA counseling sessions of 30-45 min during the 2-year intervention period. The children were also encouraged to participate in after-school exercise clubs. Cognition was assessed by the Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices. We assessed dietary factors by 4 days food records and computed the Baltic Sea Diet Score (BSDS) as a measure of diet quality. PA and ST were assessed by a combined heart rate and body movement monitor, types of PA and SB by a questionnaire. The intervention had no effect on cognition. Increased BSDS and consumption of low-fat milk and decreased consumption of red meat and sausages were associated with improved cognition over 2 years. Increased organized sports, ST, and reading were positively, while unsupervised PA, computer use, and writing were negatively associated with cognition. Combined dietary and PA intervention had no effect on cognition. Improved diet quality and increased organized sports and reading were associated with improved cognition. "
213,29072218,"Context (Background): Lips prints are unique and are a tool for personal identification. Indian population can be divided into different ethno-racial groups. In this study, we aimed at finding the most and the least prevalent lip print patterns in these groups and also to observe any similarities or differences that may exist in these groups in terms of lip print patterns. Lip prints in 755 individuals categorized into different ethno-racial groups were studied. Brown- and pink-colored lipsticks, cellophane tape, and magnifying lens were used to record and study the lip prints. Among all the three ethno-racial groups, Type I was the most prevalent lip print pattern observed. The least prevalent lip print pattern in all the three groups was Type IV. Inference/Conclusion: Lip prints hold potential as supplementary tools for identification where they can be recorded with ease. The observation and classification of lip print patterns in different ethno-racial groups not only provide some useful data but also open a new window to a field that can contribute extensively to criminal investigation and identification.

214,37556664,"To evaluate the quality of information on gestational syphilis (GS) and congenital syphilis (CS) on the Sistema de Informação de Agravos de Notificação (SINAN-Syphilis Brazil - Notifiable Diseases Information System) by compiling and validating completeness indicators between 2007 and 2018. Overall, care, and socioeconomic completeness scores were compiled based on selected variables, by using ad hoc weights assigned by experts. The completeness scores were analysed, considering the region and area of residence, the pregnant woman's race/colour, and the year of case notification. Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to validate the scores obtained by the weighted average method, compared with the values obtained by principal component analysis (PCA). Most selected variables presented a good or excellent degree of completeness for GS and CS, except for clinical classification, pregnant woman's level of education, partner's treatment, and child's race/colour, which were classified as poor or very poor. The overall (89.93% versus 89.69%) and socioeconomic (88.71% versus 88.24%) completeness scores for GS and CS, respectively, were classified as regular, whereas the care score (GS-90.88%, and CS-90.72%) was good, despite improvements over time. Differences in the overall, care and socioeconomic completeness scores according to region, area of residence, and ethnic-racial groups were reported for syphilis notifications. The completeness scores estimated by the weighted average method and PCA showed a strong linear correlation (> 0.90). The completeness of GS and CS notifications has been improving in recent years, highlighting the variables that form the care score, compared with the socioeconomic scores, despite differences between regions, area of residence, and ethnic-racial groups. The weighted average was a viable methodological alternative easily operationalised to estimate data completeness scores, allowing routine monitoring of the completeness of gestational and congenital syphilis records.

215,38233229,"Race-based and skin pigmentation-related inaccuracies in pulse oximetry have recently been highlighted in several large electronic health record-based retrospective cohort studies across diverse patient populations and healthcare settings. Overestimation of oxygen saturation by pulse oximeters, particularly in hypoxic states, is disparately higher in Black compared to other racial groups. Compared to adult literature, pediatric studies are relatively few and mostly reliant on birth certificates or maternal race-based classification of comparison groups. Neonates, infants, and young children are particularly susceptible to the adverse life-long consequences of hypoxia and hyperoxia. Successful neonatal resuscitation, precise monitoring of preterm and term neonates with predominantly lung pathology, screening for congenital heart defects, and critical decisions on home oxygen, ventilator support and medication therapies, are only a few examples of situations that are highly reliant on the accuracy of pulse oximetry. Undetected hypoxia, especially if systematically different in certain racial groups may delay appropriate therapies and may further perpetuate health care disparities. The role of biological factors that may differ between racial groups, particularly skin pigmentation that may contribute to biased pulse oximeter readings needs further evaluation. Developmental and maturational changes in skin physiology and pigmentation, and its interaction with the operating principles of pulse oximetry need further study. Importantly, clinicians should recognize the limitations of pulse oximetry and use additional objective measures of oxygenation (like co-oximetry measured arterial oxygen saturation) where hypoxia is a concern.

216,34077582,"Malnutrition is a major public health issue that has been associated with high susceptibility for impaired brain development and mental functioning. However, to date studies on this topic have not been collated and appraised. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the association between malnutrition and cognitive development. We searched the MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, Embase PsycINFO and Cochrane Library databases in English up to 8 December 2020. All studies reporting an association between nutritional status and cognitive development were included. p values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant and the results are reported as standardised mean differences (SMD), 95% confidence intervals (95%) and I We included 12 studies comprising 7,607 participants aged 1 to 12 years. Children with malnutrition had worse scores than controls for the Wechsler Intelligence Scale (SMD -0.40; 95% CI -0.60 to -0.20; p < 0.0001; I Normal cognitive development requires access to good and safe nutrition.

217,24916386,The aim of this study was to develop a low-cost antifilarial immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 detection kit for the diagnosis of lymphatic filariasis. The kit was designed to be used by minimally trained personnel without the constraints of expensive laboratory equipment. We provide a description of the development and validation of a single-serum-dilution based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit with ready-to-use reagents for measuring antifilarial IgG4 antibodies. The kit was tested on residents in Brugia malayi-endemic areas in southern Thailand. Detection was performed by naked-eye observation of the resultant colour of the immunological reactivity. The coefficient of variation (CV) was used to assess the reproducibility of the results. Long-term stability was measured over a 6-month period. Sensitivity of the test kit was 97% when compared with microfilariae detection in thick blood smears. Specificity was 98.7% based on the sera of 57 patients living outside the endemic areas who were infected with other parasites and 100 parasite-free subjects. All positive CVs were < 10%. The test kit was remarkably stable over 6 months. Field validation was performed by the detection of antifilarial IgG4 in 4365 serum samples collected from residents of brugian filariasis-endemic areas and compared with outcome colours of the test samples by the naked eye. Subsequent ELISA evaluation of these results using an ELISA reader indicated high agreement by the kappa statistic. These results demonstrate that the test kit is efficient and useful for public health laboratories as an alternative tool for the diagnosis of lymphatic filarial infection. 
218,34588126,"To explore age-related cerebral hemodynamic characteristics before and after pediatric cardiac surgery. Prospective observational study. Single-center study based at a tertiary care center in Shanghai, China. Fifty-three children with congenital heart disease (CHD) aged zero-to-six years undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were enrolled, and 44 children finally were analyzed. Cerebral hemodynamics were measured by transcranial color-coded duplex sonography in the right temporal window before and after surgery. The resistance index (RI), pulsatility index (PI), and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV), including time average maximum flow velocity (V RI and PI decreased exponentially with age before and after cardiac surgery. While PI remained unchanged after cardiac surgery, RI was significantly reduced. Furthermore, RI reduction after cardiac surgery was more significant in children >18 months compared to those ≤18 months. CBFV of the right MCA also showed exponential increase with age, but rScO Age-related cerebral hemodynamic changes exist in children with CHD. Cardiopulmonary bypass surgery led to greater cerebrovascular dilation in children aged ≤18 months than those >18 months. "
219,39150064,"In Brazil, ethnic-racial inequalities exist in all fields, obstructing access to goods, services, and opportunities, including healthcare services. However, there are no apparent studies that assess, at a national level, ethnic-racial disparities in poisoning cases, emphasizing skin color as a determining factor. The study aimed to examine the relationship between race/ethnicity and general poisoning cases, by medications, pesticides, and drug of abuse in Brazilian states. Poisoning cases data were extracted for the years 2017, 2018, and 2019. Notification data for general poisoning cases and toxic agents were collected: medications, pesticides, and drugs of abuse. Data were categorized between whites and non-whites (blacks, browns, and indigenous) and without information on skin color/ethnicity. Rates of poisonings amongst ethnic-racial groups and cases of not declared skin color as well as relative risk (RR) of poisoning among non-whites were calculated. All states in the North, Northeast (states with the worst Human Development Index), Midwest, and 2 states in the Southeast exhibited higher rates of poisoning cases per 100,000 inhabitants among non-whites. The RR values for nonwhite individuals were higher in the North and Northeast regions for all types of poisonings. The type of poisoning cases that presented the highest RR for non-whites over the 3 years was drugs of abuse (2-2.44), when compared to other types of poisonings from pesticides (2-2.33) and medications (1.5-1.91). The spatial distribution of poisoning cases rates and RR of nonwhite population support public policies to reduce socioeconomic and environmental inequalities. "
220,23169209,"Prevalence and causes of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) in children vary with time and geographical area. This study aimed to determine the relevant allergens causing ACD in children and the relation between ACD and atopic dermatitis (AD). A cohort study on 349 children (0-15 years old) patch tested over a 7-year period was conducted. Patch test results were positive for at least 1 allergen in 69.3% of patients and were relevant in 69.8%. The highest sensitization rate (76.7%) was observed in children who are 0 to 5 years old (n = 86, 64% females), followed by the group of 6- to 10-year olds (70%, n = 157, 47.8% females), whereas 62.3% of 11- to 15-year-old children (n = 106, 59.4%) were sensitized. The most frequent allergens were nickel (16.3%), cobalt (6.9%), Kathon CG (5.4%), potassium dichromate (5.1%), fragrance mix (4.3%), and neomycin (4.3%). Body areas mostly affected were upper limbs and hands (31%). Approximately one third of children also had AD. Allergic contact dermatitis was more widespread in children with AD. Patch tests resulted positive in 55.3% (50% relevant) of AD compared with 76.9% (77.5% relevant) of the children without AD. Sensitizers were similar to children without AD. Very young children showed a high rate of relevant positive patch test reactions to common haptens. Allergic contact dermatitis may easily coexist with AD. "
221,28871935,"Dear Editor, Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a very common skin infection caused by a molluscipox virus gene of the poxvirus family. It usually occurs in young children, sexually active adults, and immunocompromised individuals. The typical clinical picture of this infection is characterized by asymptomatic flesh-colored, single or multiple papules, measuring 2-6 mm in diameter with a central umbilication that occur on the skin and the mucous membranes. In adults, the skin lesions are predominantly located in the genital region, whereas in children they are found on the trunk, the extremities, and the face. MC is generally regarded as a self-limited disease; however, its treatment is usually advisable considering its potentially protracted course and the risk of superinfection, scarring, autoinoculation, and transmission to other members of the community. A large number of approaches to the treatment of MC have been used so far (none of them approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)) including ablative regimens (curettage, electrodessication, cryotherapy, laser therapy) and topical or systemic pharmacologic agents (tretinoin, cantharidin, trichloroacetic and salicylic acid, potassium hydroxide, interferon-alfa, and cimetidine). Imiquimod is a topically applicable Toll-like receptor (TLR)-7/8 agonist, which is capable of stimulating the innate cutaneous immunity and the cellular arm of the adaptive immune response and of exerting potent anti-viral, anti-tumor and immunoregulatory effects (1). Originally approved for the treatment of external genital and perianal warts in adults, imiquimod was later approved for the therapy of basal cell carcinomas and actinic keratoses and has also been used in the management of several off-label indications including cutaneous infections and neoplasms. Our group has successfully used topical imiquimod in the treatment of a variety of dermatoses including granuloma annulare, pyogenic granuloma, herpes labialis, and lichen striatus (2-6). Moreover, we have examined the topical application of imiquimod over the last twelve years in the treatment of 23 children with MC, the demographic data and the therapeutic response of which are summarized in Table 1. Seventeen out of 23 children (73.91%) treated with topical imiquimod once daily under occlusion (including two cases with disseminated lesions) showed a complete remission within 3 to 8 weeks of treatment. Furthermore, 6 other children who switched to other forms of treatment showed a partial remission (55.55%-84.61%) after 10 to 12 weeks of therapy. The only cutaneous adverse reaction to topical imiquimod was a mild to moderate irritation in the application area that was observed in all treated children, whereas no systemic side effects could be seen. Our findings are compatible with those of other groups, who also demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy and safety of topical imiquimod in MC. Interestingly, in two very similar subsequent papers Katz and Swetman (7) and Katz (8,9) expressed the view that ""imiquimod is neither efficacious nor safe in the treatment of MC in children"". This view was not the result of the author's clinical experience but was exclusively based on the findings of two randomized clinical trials (RCTs). These were carried out in 2006 upon request of the FDA from the drug's original manufacturer (3M) and ""definitely showed that imiquimod does not effectively treat MC in children"". Surprisingly, today, 10 years after their completion, these RCTs still remain unpublished, whereas the corresponding FDA site provides no information with regard to the researchers, the centers in which these trials were conducted, their research protocol, and the demographic data of the enrolled patients. In a very recent review on childhood skin infections, Rush and Dinulos (10), exclusively based on Dr. Katz's paper, fully adopted this view and stated that ""imiquimod is neither efficacious nor safe in the treatment of MC"", although they admit that the RCTs cited by the latter still remain unpublished. In contrast to these authors, we reject Dr Katz's inexplicable request to the medical community to fully ignore all articles published in peer-reviewed journals that demonstrate the efficacy and safety of imiquimod in MC. We do not claim that imiquimod is a panacea. However, based on our clinical experience and that of other groups, we are convinced that this compound represents a very useful and painless tool in the dermatologic arsenal for the treatment of MC, an otherwise difficult to manage dermatosis, particularly in children.

222,39227897,"Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) is an antimicrobial agent and alternative treatment option that can be used to arrest dental decay. While there is optimism with SDF with regard to caries management, there is no true consensus on the number and frequency of applications for children. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of 38% SDF to arrest early childhood caries (ECC) at three different application regimen intervals. Children with teeth that met International Caries Detection and Assessment System codes 5 or 6 criteria were recruited from community dental clinics into an open-label, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial from October 2019 to June 2021. Participants were randomized to one of three groups using sealed envelopes that were prepared with one of three regimens inside: visits one month, four months, or six months apart. Participants received applications of 38% SDF, along with 5% sodium fluoride varnish (NaFV), at the first two visits to treat cavitated carious lesions. Lesions were followed and arrest rates were calculated. Lesions were considered arrested if they were hard on probing and black in colour. Statistics included descriptive and bivariate analyses (Kruskal one-way analysis of variance and Pearson's Chi-squared test). A p-value of ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Eighty-four children participated in the study (49 males and 35 females, mean age: 44.4 ± 14.2 months). Treatment groups were well matched with 28 participants per group. A total of 374 teeth and 505 lesions were followed. Posterior lesions represented only 40.6% of affected surfaces. Almost all SDF treated lesions were arrested for the one-month (192/196, 98%) and four-month (159/166, 95.8%) interval groups at the final visit. The six-month group experienced the lowest arrest rates; only 72% (103/143) of lesions were arrested (p < 0.001). The duration of application intervals was inversely associated with improvements in arrest rates for all lesions. Two applications of 38% SDF and 5% NaFV in one-month and four-month intervals were comparable and very effective in arresting ECC. Applications six months apart were less effective and could be considered inferior treatment. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04054635 (first registered 13/08/2019). "
223,16547670,"This study was carried out to investigate the risk factors contributing to hepatic artery thrombosis in living-donor liver transplantation. Two hundred and twenty-two recipients (113 adults and 109 children) of living-donor liver transplantation were the subjects of this study. The diagnosis of hepatic artery thrombosis was made by color-Doppler ultrasonography and/or hepatic angiography. Parameters for this study were: (1) donor sex, age, and body weight; (2) recipient sex, age, body weight, liver disease, preoperative prothrombin time, and type of arterial reconstruction; and (3) previous liver transplantation. Hepatic artery thrombosis occurred in 12 patients (5.4%) at 3 to 15 days posttransplant. Recipient female sex and metabolic disorder as the original disease were found to be significantly associated with hepatic artery thrombosis. The 5-year patient survival rate in recipients with hepatic artery thrombosis (58.3%) was significantly lower than that in recipients without this complication (84.4%). Female sex and metabolic disease may be factors contributing to hepatic artery thrombosis after living-donor liver transplantation. More intensive anticoagulation therapy for this patient population might decrease the incidence of hepatic artery thrombosis and, thus, posttransplant recipient mortality. "
224,26124497,"Minimal residual disease (MRD) is highly prognostic in pediatric B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). In Children's Oncology Group high-risk B-ALL study AALL0232, we investigated MRD in subjects randomized in a 2 × 2 factorial design to receive either high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) or Capizzi methotrexate (C-MTX) during interim maintenance (IM) or prednisone or dexamethasone during induction. Subjects with end-induction MRD ≥0.1% or those with morphologic slow early response were nonrandomly assigned to receive a second IM and delayed intensification phase. MRD was measured by 6-color flow cytometry in 1 of 2 reference labs, with excellent agreement between the two. Subjects with end-induction MRD <0.01% had a 5-year event-free survival (EFS) of 87% ± 1% vs 74% ± 4% for those with MRD 0.01% to 0.1%; increasing MRD amounts was associated with progressively worse outcome. Subjects converting from MRD positive to negative by end consolidation had a relatively favorable 79% ± 5% 5-year disease-free survival vs 39% ± 7% for those with MRD ≥0.01%. Although HD-MTX was superior to C-MTX, MRD retained prognostic significance in both groups (86% ± 2% vs 58% ± 4% for MRD-negative vs positive C-MTX subjects; 88% ± 2% vs 68% ± 4% for HD-MTX subjects). Intensified therapy given to subjects with MRD >0.1% did not improve either 5-year EFS or overall survival (OS). However, these subjects showed an early relapse rate similar to that seen in MRD-negative ones, with EFS/OS curves for patients with 0.1% to 1% MRD crossing those with 0.01% to 0.1% MRD at 3 and 4 years, thus suggesting that the intensified therapy altered the disease course of MRD-positive subjects. Additional interventions targeted at the MRD-positive group may further improve outcome. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00075725. "
225,21858392,"To prove that the difference in human skin color can be used as a new fingerprint. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in the Faculty of Medicine, The National Ribat University, Khartoum, Sudan between January and June 2010. The study consists of 139 subjects, which includes 41 Sudanese identical twins (82 subjects), 50 subjects from the general population, and 7 Chinese. All subjects were free of skin lesions. Based on reflectance spectrophotometry, the skin color has been read for all subjects from the inner upper arm using the Medisun skin check. Visual judgment on color differences was carried out directly with 3 normal observers, and through digital photos. Skin color was found to be different in all subjects under the study depending on visual judgment, digital photos, and skin color readings. Differences in skin color were also found between different parts of the body (color map). Color intensity reading in the first twin was 4.010 +/- 0.5, and in the second twin was 3.89 +/- 0.44 with a significant difference (p=0.001). The general population sample showed significant differences in skin color from each other, and from the Chinese group (p=0.002). In this study, we found that skin color between identical twins is different, as well as in the whole population, and could be a new personal identification method, which needs further international studies.

226,32593509,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients develop severe lung disease including chronic airway infections, neutrophilic inflammation, and progressive fibrotic remodeling in airways. However, cellular and molecular processes that regulate excessive collagen deposition in airways in these patients remain unclear. Fibrocytes are bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal cells that express the hematopoietic cell marker CD45, and mesenchymal cell markers and implicated in collagen deposition in several fibrotic diseases. It is unknown whether fibrocytes accumulate in the lungs of CF patients, so the current study evaluates the presence of fibrocytes in the fibrotic lesions of airways in explanted CF lungs compared to non-CF unused donor lungs (control). We used immunofluorescence staining to determine if fibrocytes accumulate in explanted CF lungs compared to healthy donor lungs. Simultaneously, we evaluated cells collected by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in CF patients using multi-color flow cytometry. Finally, we analyzed transcripts differentially expressed in fibrocytes isolated from the explanted CF lungs compared to control to assess fibrocyte-specific pro-fibrotic gene networks. Our findings demonstrate fibrocyte accumulation in CF lungs compared to non-CF lungs. Additionally, fibrocytes were detected in the BAL of all CF children. Transcriptomic analysis of fibrocytes identified dysregulated genes associated with fibrotic remodeling in CF lungs. With significantly increased fibrocytes that show increased expression of pro-fibrotic gene transcripts compared to control, our findings suggest an intervention for fibrotic remodeling as a potential therapeutic target in CF.

227,15364769,"To determine the effect of feeding tube position (gastric vs small bowel) on adequacy of nutrient delivery and feeding complications, including microaspiration, in critically ill children. Randomized controlled trial. Pediatric ICU in a university teaching hospital. Seventy-four critically ill patients < 18 years of age receiving mechanical ventilation were randomized to receive gastric or small-bowel feeding. All feeding tubes were inserted at the bedside. Color, pH, and bilirubin concentration of the feeding tube aspirates were used to guide placement. Final tube position was confirmed radiographically. Continuous feedings were advanced to achieve a caloric goal based on age and body weight. Tracheal secretions were collected daily and tested for gastric pepsin by immunoassay. Thirty-two patients were randomized to the gastric group, and 42 patients were randomized to the small-bowel group. Twelve patients exited the study because a small-bowel tube could not be placed at the bedside, leaving 30 patients in the small-bowel group. Gastric and small-bowel groups were similar at baseline in age, sex, percentage of ideal body weight, serum prealbumin concentration, and pediatric risk of mortality score. The percentage of daily caloric goal achieved was less in the gastric group compared to the small-bowel group (30 +/- 23% vs 47 +/- 22%, p < 0.01). No difference was found in the proportion of tracheal aspirates positive for pepsin between the gastric and small-bowel groups (50 of 146 aspirates vs 50 of 172 aspirates, respectively; p = 0.3). No differences were found in the frequency of feeding tube displacement, abdominal distension, vomiting, or diarrhea between groups. Small-bowel feeds allow a greater amount of nutrition to be successfully delivered to critically ill children. Small-bowel feeds do not prevent aspiration of gastric contents. "
228,31160592,"The senses play critical roles in helping animals evaluate foods, including fruits that can change both in colour and scent during ripening to attract frugivores. Although numerous studies have assessed the impact of colour on fruit selection, comparatively little is known about fruit scent and how olfactory and visual data are integrated during foraging. We combine 25 months of behavioural data on 75 wild, white-faced capuchins (Cebus imitator) with measurements of fruit colours and scents from 18 dietary plant species. We show that frequency of fruit-directed olfactory behaviour is positively correlated with increases in the volume of fruit odours produced during ripening. Monkeys with red-green colour blindness sniffed fruits more often, indicating that increased reliance on olfaction is a behavioural strategy that mitigates decreased capacity to detect red-green colour contrast. These results demonstrate a complex interaction among fruit traits, sensory capacities and foraging strategies, which help explain variation in primate behaviour. "

The PICOT question was: P: in primary molar proximal lesions; I: does the use of 1 material (GIC, RmGIC, CR, or PAMCR); C: compared with the remaining materials; O (Outcome): result in higher success rates; T: when followed for at least 1 year? Relevant articles (256) were identified from databases then sieved by titles, abstracts, and full texts. Following exclusions, 36 dinical trials-including 25 randomized clinical trials (RCTs)-remained. Extracted data were meta-analyzed. GIC restorations had a significantly (P<.05) lower likelihood of success than RmGIC and CR restorations. Overall success rates were: (1) GIC (691 restorations)=75%; (2) RmGIC (276)=89%; (3) CR (620)=83%; (4) PAMCR (596)=87%. Mean success rates did not differ significantly (P>.05): (1) GIC (6 studies)=65+/-34%; (2) RmGIC (3 studies)=93+/-7%; (3) CR (7 studies)=85+/-12%; and (4) PAMCR (8 studies)=90+/-10%. Few articles were available to determine the best material. Recognizing material improvements since 1990, earlier data may be noncomparable. RmGIC had the highest success rates, but fewest studies and fewest restorations; only one product was assessable. Prospective RCTs should be of at least 5 years' duration to determine correctly the success rate of Class II restorations in primary molars. "
231,38112802,"Point-of-care brain ultrasound and transcranial doppler or color-coded doppler is being increasingly used as an essential diagnostic and monitoring tool at the bedside of critically ill neonates and children. Brain ultrasound has already established as a cornerstone of daily practice in the management of the critically ill newborn for diagnosis and follow-up of the most common brain diseases, considering the easiness to insonate the brain through transfontanellar window. In critically ill children, doppler based techniques are used to assess cerebral hemodynamics in acute brain injury and recommended for screening patients suffering from sickle cell disease at risk for stroke. However, more evidence is needed regarding the accuracy of doppler based techniques for non-invasive estimation of cerebral perfusion pressure and intracranial pressure, as well as regarding the accuracy of brain ultrasound for diagnosis and monitoring of acute brain parenchyma alterations in children. This review is aimed at providing a comprehensive overview for clinicians of the technical, anatomical, and physiological basics for brain ultrasonography and transcranial doppler or color-coded doppler, and of the current status and future perspectives of their clinical applications in critically ill neonates and children. In critically ill neonates, brain ultrasound for diagnosis and follow-up of the most common cerebral pathologies of the neonatal period may be considered the standard of care. Data are needed about the possible role of doppler techniques for the assessment of cerebral perfusion and vasoreactivity of the critically ill neonate with open fontanelles. In pediatric critical care, doppler based techniques should be routinely adopted to assess and monitor cerebral hemodynamics. New technologies and more evidence are needed to improve the accuracy of brain ultrasound for the assessment of brain parenchyma of critically ill children with fibrous fontanelles. • In critically ill neonates, brain ultrasound for early diagnosis and follow-up of the most common cerebral and neurovascular pathologies of the neonatal period is a cornerstone of daily practice. In critically ill children, doppler-based techniques are more routinely used to assess cerebral hemodynamics and autoregulation after acute brain injury and to screen patients at risk for vasospasm or stroke (e.g., sickle cell diseases, right-to-left shunts). • In critically ill neonates, research is currently focusing on the use of novel high frequency probes, even higher than 10 MHz, especially for extremely preterm babies. Furthermore, data are needed about the role of doppler based techniques for the assessment of cerebral perfusion and vasoreactivity of the critically ill neonate with open fontanelles, also integrated with a non-invasive assessment of brain oxygenation. In pediatric critical care, new technologies should be developed to improve the accuracy of brain ultrasound for the assessment of brain parenchyma of critically ill children with fibrous fontanelles. Furthermore, large multicenter studies are needed to clarify role and accuracy of doppler-based techniques to assess cerebral perfusion pressure and its changes after treatment interventions. "
232,37980654,"Rapid evolution of ultrasound technology has allowed widespread use of handheld ultrasound devices (HHUDs) for many possible applications. Along with the adult population, the use of HHUDs for Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS) in pediatric medicine has been increasing over the last few years. However, pediatric-specific literature is still scarce on mobile vascular ultrasound. To evaluate diagnostic capabilities of Vscan Air™ in comparison with high-end ultrasound for the assessment of the internal jugular vein in children and adolescents. 42 Internal Jugular Veins (IJVs) of 21 pediatric patients were scanned by an experienced examiner using a WLAN-supported handheld ultrasound device (Vscan Air™) and high-end cart-based ultrasound (LOGIQ E9) as reference. B-Mode and Color-coded Doppler (CCDS) were performed and compared. Image quality was assessed using a score of 0 to 5 and statistically analyzed. Results were interpreted independently by two readers in consensus. 21 patients (2-17 years; mean 11,00±4,5 years; female n = 11, male n = 10) were examined. The rating score never dropped below 3 for both devices. The median score evaluation of B-Mode and CCDS for the high-end device was 5.00, of Vscan Air™ 5.00 for B-Mode and 4.00 for CCDS. A significant difference was shown between the two devices in the evaluation of CCDS.

233,21210231,"This study aims to evaluate left ventricular (LV) structure and function and inflammation in a paediatric population with sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and in control subjects. Forty-nine children with SDB and 21 healthy, age-matched subjects were enrolled. The diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) was confirmed by the laboratory polysomnography, showing an obstructive apnoea/hypopnoea index of more than one per hour, according to the criteria of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and modified for paediatric population. Fasting blood samples for the biochemical evaluation (including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were drawn in the morning, after the polysomnographic examination in all patients with SDB and in the control group. All children underwent a two-dimensional colour Doppler cardiac examination with LV mass assessment and systolic and diastolic function evaluation. Higher hsCRP levels were observed in subjects with OSAS than in children with primary snoring and in controls (0.8 ± 0.7 vs 0.3 ± 0.1 ng/dl, p = 0.001, and 0.4 ± 0.2 ng/dl, p = 0.01, respectively). The LV diastolic dysfunction was significantly more frequent in patients with severe OSAS and higher hsCRP levels than in control group. This study shows that OSAS in children is associated with higher LV mass, early LV diastolic dysfunction and a pro-inflammatory state (high CRP levels). These findings might help to explain the higher incidence of cardiovascular morbidity in patients with OSAS. "
234,7983952,"Queensland, Australia, has the highest rates of melanoma in the world and Queensland children have the greatest numbers of melanocytic naevi, the strongest risk factor for melanoma. Although both melanoma and naevi are broadly related to sun exposure in childhood, the relation to individual exposure early in life is difficult to study retrospectively in adults. We surveyed 506 children aged 1-6 years who had been born in Townsville, North Queensland. Sun exposure was assessed by questionnaire and melanocytic naevi were counted using a standard international protocol. Very high counts (upper quarter) of melanocytic naevi were significantly associated with sun exposure of more than 4 hours per day (adjusted relative risk ratio 3.29; 95% Cl 1.12-9.69), and with a history of sunburn (1.89; 1.11-3.21). Melanocytic naevus counts increased with age, light skin reflectance, and freckling. With exposure to intense ultraviolet light in Townsville, children develop melanocytic naevi early in life and in large numbers. We found that both acute and chronic exposure to sun are associated with their development. "
235,31318849,"BACKGROUND This study aimed to evaluate superb microvascular imaging (SMI) as an adjunctive imaging method to evaluate mesenteric lymph nodes in children with mesenteric lymphadenitis compared with healthy children. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective study compared children with mesenteric lymphadenitis (n=27) and healthy children (n=30). Lymph node size was determined using grayscale ultrasonography and parameters of lymph node vascularity were compared using color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) and SMI. The diagnostic performance of ultrasound (US), US combined with SMI, and US combined with CDFI were compared. RESULTS Lymph nodes from children with mesenteric lymphadenitis (n=77) and normal lymph nodes (n=84) were evaluated by SMI, which showed that the least diameter of lymph nodes in cases of mesenteric lymphadenitis was 0.58±0.15 mm and of normal mesenteric lymph nodes was 0.47±0.08 mm (p<0.001). SMI identified 92.6% of abnormal mesenteric lymph nodes while CDFI detected 85.2%. US combined with SMI had the highest sensitivity (81.5%), and specificity (78.9%) compared with US alone (sensitivity, 63.0%; specificity, 64.9%), and compared with US combined with CDFI (sensitivity, 74.1%; specificity, 75.4%). US combined with SMI and US combined with CDFI achieved the same specificity (76.7%), which was higher than that of US alone (66.7%). CONCLUSIONS SMI was superior to color Doppler flow imaging in evaluating the microvasculature in lymphadenopathy in mesenteric lymphadenitis. SMI may be used as an adjunct to grayscale ultrasonography to assist in identifying mesenteric lymphadenopathy in pediatric patients. "
236,28187514,"Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry (FCM) is a worldwide mainstay in leukemia diagnostics. For concordant multicentric application, however, a gap exists between available classification systems, technologic standardization, and clinical needs. The AIEOP-BFM consortium induced an extensive standardization and validation effort between its nine national reference laboratories collaborating in immunophenotyping of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We elaborated common guidelines which take advantage of the possibilities of multi-color FCM: marker panel requirements, immunological blast gating, in-sample controls, tri-partite antigen expression rating (negative vs. weak or strong positive) with capturing of blast cell heterogeneities and subclone formation, refined ALL subclassification, and a dominant lineage assignment algorithm able to distinguish ""simple"" from bilineal/""complex"" mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) cases, which is essential for choice of treatment. These guidelines are a first step toward necessary inter-laboratory standardization of pediatric leukemia immunophenotyping for a concordant multicentric application. © 2017 International Clinical Cytometry Society.

237,10842391,"Recent reports suggest reopening of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) after complete occlusion with three-loop Gianturco coils. We hypothesize that five-loop coils may produce a larger thrombus than three-loop coils, which will result in no or less probability of recanalization of PDA during follow-up. This study is designed to test this hypothesis. Follow-up echocardiographic and Doppler data of 30 patients who underwent five-loop coil occlusion of small to medium-sized PDA during a 33-month period ending December 1998 were examined. Thirty patients had no residual shunt on echo Doppler study on the day following the procedure and were followed for 6 to 30 months (median, 12) after coil implantation. At the last follow-up study, none of the patients had a residual shunt and left atrial size decreased. Careful pulsed, continuous wave, and color Doppler interrogation of left/main pulmonary artery junction and proximal descending aorta did not reveal any evidence for obstruction. The follow-up data suggest that complete occlusion of small- to medium-sized PDAs is feasible with five-loop coils without evidence for recanalization at a mean follow-up of 12 months. Much longer (2 to 5 years) follow-up data may be necessary to confirm these observations. We speculate that a greater degree of thrombosis is produced within the ductus by the five-loop coils, which in turn may be responsible for lack of shunt recurrence. We recommend use of five-loop instead of three-loop coils for transcatheter occlusion of small- to medium-sized PDAs. "
238,25658329,"To determine the effect of 1% cyclopentolate on the refractive status of children aged 4 to 18 years. Using a random cluster sampling in a cross-sectional school-based study design, children with an age of 4-18 years were selected from kindergardens, primary schools, junior and senior high schools in a rural county and a city. Auto-refractometry was performed before and after inducing cycloplegia which was achieved by 1% cyclopentolate eye drops. Out of 6364 eligible children, data of 5999 (94.3%) children were included in the statistical analysis. Mean age was 10.0±3.3 years (range: 4-18 years). Mean difference between cycloplegic and non-cycloplegic refractive error (DIFF) was 0.78±0.79D (median: 0.50D; range: -1.00D to +10.75D). In univariate analysis, DIFF decreased significantly with older age (P<0.001;correlation coefficient r:-0.24), more hyperopic non-cycloplegic refractive error (P<0.001;r = 0.13) and more hyperopic cycloplegic refractive error (P<0.001;r = 0.49). In multivariate analysis, higher DIFF was associated with higher cycloplegic refractive error (P<0.001; standardized regression coefficient beta:0.50; regression coefficient B: 0.19; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.18, 0.20), followed by lower intraocular pressure (P<0.001; beta: -0.06; B: -0.02; 95%CI: -0.03, -0.01), rural region of habitation (P = 0.001; beta: -0.04; B: -0.07; 95%CI: -0.11, -0.03), and, to a minor degree, with age (P = 0.006; beta: 0.04; B: 0.009; 95%CI: 0.003, 0.016). 66.4% of all eyes with non-cycloplegic myopia (≤-0.50D) remained myopic after cycloplegia while the remaining 33.6% of eyes became emmetropic (18.0%) or hyperopic (15.7%) under cycloplegia. Prevalence of emmetropia decreased from 37.5% before cycloplegia to 19.8% after cycloplegia while the remaining eyes became hyperopic under cycloplegia. The error committed by using non-cycloplegic versus cycloplegic refractometry in children with mid to dark-brown iris color decreased with older age, and in parallel manner, with more myopic cycloplegic refractive error. Non-cycloplegic refractometric measures lead to a misclassification of refractive error in a significant proportion of children. "
239,31971950,"Young children with brain tumours are at high risk of developing treatment-related sequelae. We aimed to assess neuropsychological outcomes 5 years after treatment. This cross-sectional study included children under 4 years of age with medulloblastoma (MB) or ependymoma (EP) enrolled in the German brain tumour trials HIT2000 and HIT-REZ2005. Testing was performed using the validated Wuerzburg Intelligence Diagnostics (WUEP-D), which includes Kaufman-Assessment-Battery, Coloured Progressive Matrices, Visual-Motor Integration, finger tapping ""Speed"", and the Continuous Performance Test. Of 104 patients in 47 centres, 72 were eligible for analyses. We assessed whether IQ was impacted by disease extent, disease location, patient age, gender, age at surgery, and treatment (chemotherapy with our without craniospinal irradiation [CSI] or local radiotherapy [LRT]). Median age at surgery was 2.3 years. Testing was performed at a median of 4.9 years after surgery. Patients with infratentorial EPs (treated with LRT) scored highest in fluid intelligence (CPM 100.9±16.9, mean±SD); second best scores were achieved by patients with MB without metastasis treated with chemotherapy alone (CPM 93.9±13.2), followed by patients with supratentorial EPs treated with LRT. In contrast, lowest scores were achieved by patients that received chemotherapy and CSI, which included children with metastasised MB and those with relapsed MB M0 (CPM 71.7±8.0 and 73.2±21.8, respectively). Fine motor skills were reduced in all groups. Multivariable analysis revealed that type of treatment had an impact on IQ, but essentially not age at surgery, time since surgery or gender. Our results confirm previous reports on the detrimental effects of CSI in a larger cohort of children. Comparable IQ scores in children with MB treated only with chemotherapy and in children with EP suggest that this treatment strategy represents an attractive option for children who have a high chance to avoid application of CSI. Longitudinal follow-up examinations are warranted to assess long-term neuropsychological outcomes. "

241,15467415,"To describe the sonographic (US) and clinical features of spontaneously reduced small bowel intussusception, and to discuss the management options for small bowel intussusception based on US findings with clinical correlation. During a five years of period, 34 small bowel intussusceptions were diagnosed on US in 32 infants and children. The clinical presentations and imaging findings of the patients were reviewed. The clinical presentations included abdominal pain or irritability (n = 25), vomiting (n = 5), diarrhea (n = 3), bloody stool (n = 1), and abdominal distension (n = 1), in combination or alone. US showed multi-layered round masses of small (mean, 1.5+/-0.3 cm) diameters and with thin (mean, 3.5+/-1 mm) outer rims along the course of the small bowel. The mean length was 1.8+/-0.5 cm and peristalsis was seen on the video records. There were no visible lead points. The vascular flow signal appeared on color Doppler images in all 21 patients examined. Spontaneous reduction was confirmed by combinations of US (n = 28), small bowel series (n = 6), CT scan (n = 3), and surgical exploration (n = 2). All patients discharged with improved condition. Typical US findings of the transient small bowel intussusception included 1) small size without wall swelling, 2) short segment, 3) preserved wall motion, and 4) absence of the lead point. Conservative management with US monitoring rather than an immediate operation is recommended for those patient with typical transient small bowel intussusceptions. Atypical US findings or clinical deterioration of the patient with persistent intussusception warrant surgical exploration. "
242,18320507,"Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is frequently associated with early onset glaucoma in the eye on the same side as the facial angioma. The exact cause of glaucoma in SWS is poorly understood and difficult to treat. The purpose of this study is to investigate the ocular hemodynamics of children with SWS-associated glaucoma using color Doppler imaging techniques. This is a prospective study of 10 pediatric patients with unilateral SWS-associated glaucoma. Color Doppler imaging was used to measure the peak systolic velocity and the end diastolic velocity of both the ophthalmic and central retinal arteries in the glaucomatous eye compared to the fellow healthy eye. Twenty eyes of 10 children with SWS (6 boys) with unilateral glaucoma were included in the prospective study. The mean age of the 10 participants was 5.5 years. When compared to their contralateral normal eyes, the glaucomatous eyes had greater CDR (p<0.001) and a myopic shift (p=0.04). No significant differences were found in the measurements of ocular blood flow velocities of the ophthalmic and central retinal arteries. Vascular pathology has been proposed to play a role in SWS glaucoma etiology. The authors did not find arterial retrobulbar blood flow differences between the glaucomatous and the fellow normal eye. Since the primary vascular anomaly in patients with SWS is in the venous plexus, a bigger prospective trial is warranted in order to better understand and treat children with SWS glaucoma. "
243,7887776,"Gastroesophageal reflux with aspiration of feedings in infants and young children may be involved in the development of chronic lung damage. Our laboratory has utilized tracheal aspirates stained with oil red O to identify and quantitate lipid-laden alveolar macrophages as a marker of such aspiration. During the last 10 years, we have evaluated 244 tracheal aspiration smears in children. Although a few patients were up to 3 years old, the vast majority were infants. The cytologist looked for the presence of and the number of oil red O-positive macrophages on tracheal aspirate smears. The specimens were easily assigned grades of absent (grade = 0), low positive (grade 1: 1-25 lipid-laden macrophages), moderate positive (grade 2: 26-50 lipid-laden macrophages), and high positive (grade 3: > 50 lipid-laden macrophages). The grade was then correlated with the positive or negative clinical diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux with aspiration. We believe the cytologic evaluation and grading of oil red O-stained tracheal aspirates for lipid-laden macrophages is valuable in identifying these patients with gastroesophageal reflux and aspiration.

244,25361777,"We evaluated the relationship of optical coherence tomography (OCT)-measured ganglion cell layer (GCL) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness to other functional measures of afferent visual pathway competence including high-contrast visual acuity (HCVA) and low-contrast visual acuity (LCVA), visual field sensitivity, and color vision perception in a pediatric population with demyelinating disorders. This was a cross-sectional evaluation of 37 children, aged 8-18 years, with pediatric demyelinating disorders (n = 74 eyes), and 18 healthy controls (n = 36 eyes), who were recruited from the University of Toronto, Hospital for Sick Children and the University of Calgary, Alberta Children's Hospital, Canada. A standardized visual battery, including spectral-domain OCT, visual fields, LCVA, and HCVA, was performed in all subjects. Mean RNFL thickness was 26 µm (25.6%) lower in patients with demyelination (76.2 μm [3.7]) compared to controls (102.4 μm [2.1]) (p < 0.0001). Mean GCL thickness was 20% lower in patients as compared to controls (p < 0.0001). Mean GCL and RNFL thickness were strongly correlated (r = 0.89; p < 0.0001), yet in contrast to RNFL thickness, no differences in GCL thickness were noted between optic neuritis (ON) eyes and non-ON eyes of patients. HCVA and LCVA and visual field mean deviation scores decreased linearly with lower RNFL thickness. GCL thickness was decreased in patients regardless of history of ON. The retina may be a site of primary neuronal injury in pediatric demyelination. "

246,10647601,"Conflicting opinions have been expressed regarding reproducibility in 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) planar renal image interpretation. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the level of interobserver variability among a large group of Belgian nuclear medicine physicians who evaluated a randomly selected series of DMSA planar scintigraphic examinations performed on children and adults. All Belgian nuclear medicine centers (n = 82) were invited to participate in a reproducibility study on 99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy. 99mTc-DMSA scans obtained on 10 adults and 40 children were randomly selected from the databases of 2 hospitals. Those participating in this investigation (65 centers = 79%) received a series of computer disks containing 50 99mTc-DMSA studies. To avoid potential problems related to unfamiliar display, the disks were formatted to be interpretable using the participants' own computer systems. Each participant was then free to use his or her usual display (hard copies, contrast enhancement, color scale, gray scale, and so forth). For each kidney, the observers had to choose between the following answers: normal, abnormal, equivocal, and lack of quality. Forty-two responses were obtained from a wide variety of institutions and from observers with different levels of experience in interpreting 99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy. Altogether, the following data were obtained: 60.8% normal, 25.2% abnormal, 7.0% equivocal, and 3.2% lack of quality. The median percentage of agreement (overall reproducibility) for the 42 observers was 92%. When the results of all 42 observers were compared, the median agreements on normality and abnormality were 93.5% and 90.5%, respectively. In a small number (n = 4) of kidneys, reproducibility was poor and ranged from 51% to 70%. Except for 2 outliers, all observers had almost the same level of performance. A large number of Belgian nuclear medicine physicians participated in evaluating a large randomly selected sample of 99mTc-DMSA studies, and excellent interobserver agreement was found. "

248,28301824,"Mild traumatic brain injury (or concussion) is a prevalent yet understudied health concern in children and youth. This injury can cause dysfunction in both motor and cognitive domains; however, most literature focuses on single-task neuropsychological tests which only assess cognition. Although dual-task research on concussed children and youth is needed as many daily activities require both motor and cognitive domains, we must first investigate whether performing simultaneous motor and cognitive tasks of varied complexity impact these domains in healthy children and youth. Data collected from 106 healthy children and youth (5-18 years) created a normative dataset. Participants performed motor (postural stability) and cognitive (visual attention) tasks under single- and dual-task conditions. The cognitive task difficulty remained constant while the motor task had four conditions of increasing difficulty. The relationship between the number of correct responses (cognitive performance) and sway index (motor performance) was determined using two repeated measures ANOVAs (p<0.05). Dual-task conditions resulted in reduced postural stability, with greater differences on the foam surface (F Postural stability decreased under dual-task conditions, but attention was maintained or improved. Consequently, attention took precedence over postural control when performing tasks concurrently, demonstrating the ability for dual-task methodology to isolate specific processes. This study provides a normative dataset to be used during clinical management to identify functional deficits following concussion and acts as a starting point to explore dual-task protocols in children and youth following concussion.

249,24629862,"Color Doppler Ultrasounds (CDU) and Thyroid Scanning (TS) have much improved in recent years and offer a likely diagnosis of the disorder and its main subtypes. This especially applies when diagnosing permanent or transient causes of congenital hypothyroidism (CH), where dual imaging has proven to be more informative than single scanning. Though both isotopes have acceptable performances, the use of (123)I appears more advisable, since it more accurately identifies the various aetiologies of CH and probably has better dosimetric characteristics than (99m)Tc. Detailed dual imaging patterns are presented in connection with most of the underlying mechanisms explaining CH, thyroid dysgenesis (75%) and dyshormonogenesis (20%). Imaging of thyroid autoimmunity, of immunogenic thyrotoxicosis and of thyroid autonomy, is helped by CDU but most often requires a quantified (123)I-TS (molecular imaging). We finally show the interest of CDU to sort suspicious nodule and present the new TIRADS scoring system. "

A total of 45 medication-free children with ADHD and 43 controls aged 8-12 years were enrolled in this study. The serum levels of visfatin, UCP1, and irisin were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. As a result, in our study, a statistically significant difference was found in UCP1 in the ADHD group compared with the control group, but no significant difference was found in visfatin and irisin levels. An analysis of covariance was also performed for the whole sample, and when controlling for potential confounders, including body mass index, age, and gender, the results did not change. In addition, it was determined that adipokines did not correlate with neuropsychological tests. These findings suggest that UCP1 might be associated with childhood ADHD. "

Unfortunately, youngsters are rarely informed about the results of their PROMs or, when they are, it is in an insufficient manner. Therefore, a web application was developed-together with youngsters-aimed at giving them feedback about their PROMs. The aim of this study is to describe the development process of the application. An expert panel consisting of youngsters, web designers and researchers, as well as a representative from a client organisation, developed the e-health application INK (short for 'I Need to Know') in an iterative process based on the Centre for eHealth Research roadmap (CeHRes roadmap). Youngsters prefer, among other aspects, a simple, easy-to-use e-health application with a colourful appearance and want to be able to compare their results across different time points and informants. The INK tool provides youngsters with insight into their PROM results. Based on the youngsters' preferences, INK users can choose which feedback information is visible. INK facilitates youngsters' active participation in their treatment as well as shared decision-making with their professional caregivers. "

This multidisciplinary scoping review examines the public health implications of the ""clean"" label trend and the legal and policy landscape for regulation. We report on findings from case law and legal research generated through the Westlaw database and from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) enforcement actions and website documents to discuss options for federal- and state-level intervention to mitigate harm. One feasible avenue for change is for the FDA to provide industry guidance, disseminate public statements to debunk myths, and enforce labeling statutes to police deceptive ""clean"" labeling claims. We also suggest consumer-protection litigation and state-level litigation via attorneys general as alternative actions to combat the abundant misinformation associated with ""clean"" diets and labels. Although the FDA has taken some enforcement actions, these efforts are insufficient given the proliferation of ""clean"" label products in the marketplace and the potential for adverse impacts on public health including increased risk for disordered eating. The current unregulated, undefined landscape for ""clean"" dietary labels thus requires urgent action by federal authorities and state attorneys general. "
255,37021379,"The study aim was to co-design new pediatric procedure room prototypes with children, caregivers, and healthcare providers (HCPs). Medical procedures can cause pain and anxiety for children and their families. If spaces are not designed for patients' needs, procedures may take longer, require sedation, and result in an inferior care experience. Involving HCPs in co-designing optimal spaces can result in more efficient and safer environments. co-designing spaces with patients and their families can inform psychologically safer and less traumatic environments. We followed human-centered design methodology. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews, field observations, and two multidisciplinary design workshops with patients, caregivers, and HCPs. Themes from the data were extracted using a content analysis and used to make evidence-informed recommendations for design features. The study took place from October 2021 to February 2022. Patients, families, and HCPs reported similar needs: (1) control over the environment, including the ability to adjust lighting, temperature, and sound; (2) space that supports patient privacy; (3) the use of evidence-based pain reduction and distraction methods; (4) attention to the sensory environment, including visual (light, color), tactile (textures of furniture and equipment), auditory, and olfactory stimuli; (5) human factors organization of the space and equipment; (6) accessible and equitable spatial design; and (7) the significance of the journey leading up to and after the procedure. It is feasible to co-design procedure rooms that support evidence-based psychological, physical, and pharmacological interventions that are known to minimize pain for children. "
256,1754670,"The role of foods in the exacerbation of atopic eczema was studied by offering a food elimination diet and subsequent random order, double-blind food challenges to 91 eczematous patients, [49 males and 42 females, median age 4.5 years (range 0.5-15)]. Eczema improved in 49 of 66 (74 per cent) (skin score fall greater than or equal to 3) after stopping cows' milk, eggs and various other foods, with significant decreases in erythema, excoriation, lichenification and extent of eczema. One hundred and ninety-four food challenges were given to 64 patients who had shown objective or subjective improvement. Eczema and associated symptoms were significantly worse after cows' milk and tomato compared with placebo. Egg did not worsen eczema, but 48 per cent of 44 challenges were incomplete, mainly due to hypersensitivity reactions and challenge refusal. The longer a food had been avoided, the less likely was the chance of a positive food reaction. Clinical history did not predict response to dietary manipulation. A standard elimination diet avoiding cows' milk, egg, tomatoes and possibly colours and preservatives should help up to three-quarters of patients, and is easy to implement with the help of a dietician. This diet may be considered in all children with moderate or severe eczema. "
257,17143644,"The lipoblastoma is a rare benign pediatric neoplasm that derives from embryonic white fat cells. However, this tumor with spinal invasion in children is extremely rare. We report a case of a 3-year-old boy who had lipoblastoma with massive invasion into the lower lumbosacral spinal canal. A 3-year-old boy had suffered from progressive urinary incontinence and uncontrolled defecation during past 3 months. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans showed that a large lobulated pelvic cavity mass had invaded the lumbosacral spinal canal. The mass was located over the epidural space from L4 to the lower sacral spinal canal, resulting in the compression of the thecal sac. After total laminectomy from L4 to S3 with flavectomy, a subtotal mass removal for the intraspinal canal mass was done. Histopathologic diagnosis confirmed the lipoblastoma. Lipoblastoma is a rare benign neoplasm and lumbosacral invasion is unique. Complete surgical excision is the treatment of choice. If an incomplete surgical excision is performed, close observation and clinical follow-up must be done because a recurrence is possible. "
258,36364754,"The goal of this work was to examine whether elevated iodine intake was associated with adverse effects on IQ among school-age children in Portugal. In a representative sample of children from the north of the country, IQ percentiles by age (assessed with Raven’s Colored Progressive Matrices) were dichotomized to <50 (“below-average” IQs) and ≥50. Morning urine iodine concentrations, corrected for creatinine, were dichotomized to <250 µg/g and ≥250 µg/g, according to the European Commission/Scientific Committee on Food’s tolerable upper level of daily iodine intake for young children. Data were examined with Chi-square tests, logistic regression, and GLM univariate analysis. The sample (N = 1965) was classified as generally iodine-adequate (median urinary iodine concentration = 129 µg/L; median iodine-to-creatinine ratio = 126 µg/g) according to the WHO’s criteria. A greater proportion of children in the ≥250 µg/g group had below-average IQs, compared to children with less than 250 µg/g (p = 0.037), despite a sizable (though non-significant) proportion of children in the less-than-250 µg/g group also presenting below-average IQs, at the bottom of the iodine distribution (<50 µg/g). The proportion of below-average IQs increased with increasingly elevated iodine concentrations (p = 0.047). The association remained significant after the adjustment for confounders, with the elevated iodine group showing increased odds of having below-average IQs when compared with the non-elevated iodine group (OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.11−2.17; p = 0.011). Consistently, the former group presented a lower mean IQ than the latter (p = 0.006). High iodine intake was associated with lower IQs even in a population classified as iodine-adequate. These results bear on child cognition and on initiatives involving iodine supplementation. "
259,18025926,"Accurate inference of genetic ancestry is critical because common diseases and drug responses can be influenced by genetic factors that vary in frequency or differ altogether among populations. Frequently, clinicians and researchers use popular notions of race to make inferences about a child's genetic ancestry and predict whether he or she carries specific risk factors that influence health. The extent to which race is useful for making such predictions depends on how well race corresponds with genetic inferences of ancestry and whether ancestry is predictive of genotypes associated with risk. Recent studies of human population genetic variation show that while race captures some information about genetic ancestry, particularly in US populations, it often fails to account for admixture and population structure. Ancestry is more accurately inferred by geographical origin or, better yet, explicit genetic data. This is an important result because the genetic variants predicted to underlie common disease are often not common across populations with different ancestry or differ significantly in frequency among such populations. Geographical origin and explicit genetic data are more accurate predictors of ancestry than race. Using such alternatives is an important step toward identifying genetic risk variants for common pediatric diseases and personalizing disease prevention and intervention strategies. "
260,11280632,"Catheter-related thrombosis is a common problem in the pediatric intensive care unit. Strategies that reduce the incidence of thrombosis may have significant clinical advantage. Nitroglycerin (NTG) infusions release nitric oxide (NO). NO is responsible for much of the vasodilating and antithrombotic properties of the vasculature. We hypothesized that an intracatheter NTG infusion would reduce the incidence of catheter-related thrombosis. Prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Pediatric intensive care unit. Children of 6 years or less with femoral venous catheters who were not on antithrombotic therapy. Subjects were randomly assigned to NTG or control groups. NTG group patients received NTG at 0.1 mcg x kg x min in 5 % dextrose; control group patients received only 5 % dextrose. Infusions were delivered continuously through the catheter until the catheter was removed. Demographic data, physical and laboratory findings, catheter insertion attempts and infusate composition were recorded. Clinical evidence of vascular thrombosis or catheter malfunction was noted. Ultrasound examinations were performed within 2 days of catheter insertion and within 2 days after removal. Forty-four patients (age 12.0 +/- 2.6 months) completed the study, 21 in the NTG group and 23 in the control group. Duration of catheter placement was 7.5 +/- 0.7 days. Twelve of 44 patients (27 %) had thrombi: 7/21 in the NTG group; 5/23 in the control group (p = NS). There were no significant differences between children with and without thrombi in age, gender, number of insertion attempts, duration of catheter placement, clinical signs of thrombosis or infections. Catheter-related thrombosis is common after placement of femoral venous catheters in children. Low dose intracatheter NTG infusion does not protect against catheter-related venous thrombosis in children. "

Of these patients, 29 (52.7%) were hypermetropes, 7 (12.7%) were emmetropes, and 7 (12.7%) were myopes; astigmatism of more than 3.00 diopters was present in 7(12.7%) patients. Strabismus was observed in 12 (21.8%) patients. All but one of these 12 patients also had esotropia. Congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction was present in 12 subjects (21.8%). Blepharitis was found in 19 (34.5%) cases. Nystagmus occurred in 7 (12.7%) patients. Brushfield spots were detected in only 20 (36.3%) of the patients and were more common in light-colored irides. Lens opacities were diagnosed in 11 (20%) patients, and two underwent successful cataract surgery. On fundus examination, an increased number of retinal vessels crossing the optic nerve head was detected in 21 (38.1%) cases. One of the patients had a retinal detachment. Significant but correctable ocular problems are present in patients with Down's syndrome and may interfere with the quality of life of the patient and with binocular vision. Surgical intervention may be needed for strabismus and for cataracts. "
262,34172296,"Accreditation standards in medical education require curricular elements dedicated to understanding diversity and addressing inequities in health care. The development and implementation of culturally effective care curricula are crucial to improving health care outcomes, yet these curricular elements are currently limited in residency training. A needs assessment of 125 pediatric residents was conducted that revealed minimal prior culturally effective care instruction. To address identified needs, an integrated, longitudinal equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) curriculum was designed and implemented at a single institution using Kern's Framework. This consisted of approximately 25 h of instruction including monthly didactics and sessions which addressed (1) EDI definitions and history and (2) microaggressions. A mixed methods evaluation was used to assess the curricular elements with quantitative summary of resident session scores and a qualitative component using in-depth content analysis of resident evaluations. Thematic analysis was used to code qualitative responses and identify common attitudes and perceptions about the curricular content. 109/125 (87.2%) residents completed the needs assessment. Over one year, 323 resident evaluations were collected for curricular sessions. Average overall quality rating for sessions was 4.7 (scale 1-5), and 85% of comments included positive feedback. Key themes included lecture topic relevance, adequate time to cover the content, need for screening tools and patient resources, importance of patient case examples to supplement instruction, and novel/ ""eye opening"" content. In addition, several broader institutional impacts of the curriculum were noted such as recognizing the need for comprehensive support for residents of color, corresponding EDI faculty training, and a resident reporting system to identify learning climate issues. The implementation of a comprehensive resident EDI curriculum was feasible earning positive evaluations in its first year, with requests for additional content. It has also spurred multiple institution-wide ripple effects. Suggestions for improvement included more case-based learning, skills practice, and simulation. Future steps include expansion of this EDI curriculum to faculty and examining its impact in resident of color affinity groups. Given ACGME requirements to improve training addressing equity and social determinants of health, this curriculum development process serves as a possible template for other training programs. "
263,38273645,"Symptoms and cognition are both utilized as indicators of recovery following pediatric concussion, yet their interrelationship is not well understood. This study aimed to investigate: 1) the association of post-concussion symptom burden and cognitive outcomes (processing speed and executive functioning [EF]) at 4 and 12 weeks after pediatric concussion, and 2) the moderating effect of sex on this association. This prospective, multicenter cohort study included participants aged 5.00-17.99 years with acute concussion presenting to four Emergency Departments of the Pediatric Emergency Research Canada network. Five processing speed and EF tasks and the Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI; symptom burden, defined as the difference between post-injury and retrospective [pre-injury] scores) were administered at 4 and 12 weeks post-concussion. Generalized least squares models were conducted with task performances as dependent variables and PCSI and PCSI*sex interaction as the main predictors, with important pre-injury demographic and injury characteristics as covariates. 311 children (65.0% males; median age = 11.92 [IQR = 9.14-14.21 years]) were included in the analysis. After adjusting for covariates, higher symptom burden was associated with lower Backward Digit Span (χ Higher symptom burden is associated with lower working memory and cognitive flexibility following pediatric concussion, yet these associations were not moderated by sex. Findings may inform concussion management by emphasizing the importance of multifaceted assessments of EF. "
264,9482175,"To report four children with visual impairment associated with mutism after posterior fossa surgery. Mutism after posterior fossa surgery is a well-described phenomena, but to our knowledge, visual impairment has not been reported in association with it. Record review of four children (age range, 3-7 yr) who underwent posterior fossa surgery (via suboccipital craniotomies) for removal of a medulloblastoma (three patients) or ependymoma (one patient). Each presented with headache, ataxia, or nausea and vomiting, but none had preoperative visual complaints other than diplopia. Postoperatively, all patients were mute, and because of apparent visual loss, neuro-ophthalmic consultation was requested. Postoperative scans and examinations were also reviewed. Each child was awake but appeared withdrawn without verbal output. No child blinked to threat or fixed or followed. In each case, pupillary reactivity was normal, and funduscopic examinations revealed only papilledema. One child reached for money. Within weeks or months postoperatively, the mutism spontaneously resolved, and visual behavior in general improved, roughly in parallel. During the follow-up period, papilledema resolved and the disc color was normal in each case. Magnetic resonance images obtained postoperatively revealed nothing remarkable, except surgical defects, without lesions in the retrogeniculate pathway. Impaired visual behavior, mimicking cortical visual loss, may be associated with mutism after posterior fossa surgery in children. The prognosis for recovery is excellent and parallels the return of normal speech. The mechanism is unclear. "
265,31758259,"Compared with fluorescein angiography (FA), the gold standard for diagnosing choroidal neovascularization (CNV) activity, optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is non-invasive without risks associated with fluorescein dye use, and may be especially advantageous in the diagnosis and monitoring of children with CNV. Eight eyes from eight patients aged 12 months to 18 years were imaged with the investigational Spectralis OCTA (version 6.9, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) and the RTVue XR Avanti (Optovue Inc., Fremont, CA, USA). Two patients were imaged during examination under anesthesia while six patients were imaged in the clinic. Demographic information, ocular characteristics, treatment history, and imaging studies (color photos, fluorescein angiography, OCT) were collected and reviewed. Three eyes had active CNV while five had quiescent CNV at the time of imaging. CNV was idiopathic or secondary to trauma, retinal vascular dysgenesis versus retinopathy of prematurity, pigmentary retinopathy, Best vitelliform macular dystrophy, panuveitis, morning glory disc anomaly, and optic disc drusen. OCTA of two active CNV demonstrated presence of a main trunk with multiple fine capillaries, vessel loops, and anastomoses. OCTA was repeated after treatment for two CNV and demonstrated a decrease in size with loss of fine capillaries, vessel loops, and anastomoses. For the third active CNV, OCTA verified flow in the CNV complex despite the uncertainty of FA hyperfluorescence in the setting of grossly abnormal retinal vasculature. The five quiescent CNV all lacked fine capillaries, vessel loops, and anastomoses on OCTA. OCTA demonstrates morphological differences between active and quiescent pediatric CNV. "
266,27339062,"Previous studies have reported that children are at risk of severe injuries from exposure to laundry detergent pods. For the first time, this study sought to compare demographic and exposure characteristics and risk among children exposed to pod and non-pod laundry detergents presenting to emergency departments (EDs). Data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) from 2012-2014 were used. All observations with injuries involving laundry detergent (NEISS code 0949) were included in this study. The χ From 2012-2014, there were an estimated 26 062 non-pod and 9814 pod laundry detergent related exposures among those aged 18 years and younger. For pod detergent, children aged 0-5 years had the most injuries. Poisoning (71.3%) was the most common diagnosis for pod detergent while contact dermatitis (72.2%) was most common for non-pod detergent. Hospitalisation occurred in 12.5% of pod detergent cases and just 3.0% of non-pod cases. Compared with non-pod detergent, those exposed to pod detergent were 4 times as likely to be hospitalised (OR 4.02; 95% CI 1.96 to 8.24). A greater effort should be made to appropriately educate the public about the dangers of laundry detergents, specifically pods, so a safe home environment can be established. While new regulations such as childproof containers, opaque packaging, and less appealing and colourful pods could reduce the number of pod related ED visits for children, caregivers should store detergents, along with other chemicals, in a secure location where children cannot easily access them.

267,22982821,"The use of urine for the immunodiagnosis of lymphatic filariasis has a definite advantage: the sample collection is not invasive and thus well accepted by people. Urine-based ELISA to detect filaria-specific IgG4 has been used successfully. However, ELISA requires equipment such as a microplate reader, which is often not available in most endemic areas. We have developed a new visual immunodiagnosis that detects urinary IgG4 using red-colored latex beads (bead test). The sensitivity was 87.2% when ICT antigen test positive people were regarded as the standard (136/156), and the specificity was 97.2% with the non-endemic people in Japan and Bangladesh, and the urine ELISA negatives in Sri Lanka (1264/1300). In a prevalence study, the bead test could detect filarial infection more effectively than ICT test among young children in Sri Lanka, indicating the usefulness of the visual test in epidemiological studies.

268,7595295,"The aim of this retrospective survey of unintentional carbon monoxide-related deaths in Vienna was to determine whether the cherry-pink coloring of livor mortis is a reliable finding for the coroner to suspect a carbon monoxide-related death immediately at the death scene. In addition, we investigated the recognition pattern of unintentional carbon monoxide-related deaths by Viennese coroners between 1984 and 1993. Therefore, we analyzed autopsy reports of postmortems performed at the Viennese Institute of Forensic Medicine between 1984 and 1993. The study involved 182 unintentional carbon monoxide-related deaths: 92 females and 90 males. We found a strong association between the carboxyhemoglobin level and the cherry-pink coloring of livor mortis. In 98.4% of unintentional carbon monoxide-related deaths livor mortis were clearly cherry-pink. During the 10-year study period Viennese coroners recognized only 61% of unintentional carbon monoxide-related deaths immediately at the death scene. The percentage of unrecognized carbon monoxide fatalities with a clear cherry-pink coloring of livor mortis almost doubled from 1984 to 1993. The older the victim, the worse the coroners recognition. In summary, we have shown that coroners should be able to recognize unintentional carbon monoxide-related deaths immediately at the death-scene, because fresh corpses with carboxyhemoglobin levels greater than 31% show a clear cherry-pink coloring of livor mortis. Therefore, coroners should be encouraged to examine naked corpses thoroughly, especially regarding the color of livor mortis. Thus, a carbon monoxide-related death can be recognized immediately and the source of gas release identified as soon as possible protecting people who otherwise would also be at risk of poisoning.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) "
269,18358276,"Several studies have addressed the issue of manpower needs in pediatric surgery. The number of training programs has multiplied dramatically over the past decade. The distribution of surgeons is more significant than the absolute change in numbers--are major metropolitan areas seeing a more dramatic increase than less populated areas? To evaluate the geographic and demographic changes associated with this increase, we used choropleth and geomapping techniques to evaluate the change in number and distribution of American Pediatric Surgical Association (APSA) members (and by proxy, pediatric surgeons) in the United States over the past decade. Data regarding membership were obtained from APSA. In 1996, management companies changed, and accurate data for initial year of membership were only available after 1996. Online sources (www.services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/home and www.mapresso.com) were used for data analysis. There was a 175% increase in the number of APSA members over the past decade. The geographic distribution parallels the state population to some extent but is uneven. The number of APSA members by state over time is displayed in color density maps. Predictions of prior manpower studies were generally accurate. The number of pediatric surgeons in the United States has rapidly increased in the past decade, with no sign of diminution in this trend. Increases in the number of surgeons correlates with state population, indicating a tendency for surgeons to reside in more densely populated areas, as expected. Areas with a disproportionately high or low number of surgeons can be identified via choropleth mapping. "
270,33543592,"Telomere length (TL) has been associated with lifestyle and dietary pattern. However, the available evidence on this association in children is scarce, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the association of dietary pattern and leukocyte TL (LTL) in preschool children, Sabzevar, Iran (2017). This cross-sectional study was based on 187 preschool children (aged 5 to 7) recruited from 27 kindergartens. Nutrition information including amounts of consumed dairy products, meat and processed meat products, nuts and seeds, white bread and refined grains, fruits, vegetables, simple sugars, fats and drinks was obtained through a questionnaire. Linear mixed-effects models were fitted with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) plate ID and kindergartens as random effects to estimate the association of each food group consumption with LTL, controlled for relevant covariates. Higher consumption of dairy products and sugar was associated with shorter LTL (β = -0.180, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.276, -0.085, P value <0.001 and β = -0.139, 95% CI: -0.193, -0.086, P value <0.001, respectively). An increase in consumption of fish, nuts and seeds, coloured fruits, green leafy vegetables, cruciferous vegetables and olive was significantly associated with the increase in relative LTL. The associations for the consumption of legumes, other fruits, yellow and orange vegetables, red meat, egg, white bread and refined grains, solid and liquid fats, processed meats, potato chips, carbonated drinks, tea (black) and soft drinks groups were not statistically significant. Our findings showed that there was an association between the consumption of certain food groups with LTL. "
271,26211689,"The parallel ridge pattern (PRP) is considered the dermoscopic hallmark of acral melanoma (AM). However, it was recently shown that approximately one-third of AMs do not display a PRP dermoscopically, rendering their detection more troublesome. To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of dermoscopic criteria for the diagnosis of AM. Dermoscopic images of consecutive cases of histopathologically diagnosed AMs and acral naevi with histopathological diagnosis or with at least 1 year of follow-up were evaluated by three independent investigators for the presence of predefined criteria. Crude and adjusted odds ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to choose among competing classification schemes. In total 603 lesions (472 naevi and 131 AMs) were included in the study. A scoring system (named BRAAFF) composed of six variables was associated with optimal area under the curve and sensitivity for the diagnosis of AM. This method includes four positive (irregular blotches, ridge pattern, asymmetry of structures and asymmetry of colours) and two negative predictors (furrow pattern and fibrillar pattern). The BRAAFF checklist significantly improves the diagnostic accuracy of dermoscopy for the diagnosis of AM. "

Juan Gandulfo, died tragically, at a very young age, in 1931. Juan Gandulfo, remembered in Neruda's memoirs, as the most formidable leader of the Anarchist movement of that time and that engraved in wood the cover and all the illustrations of the first edition of Crepusculario, published in 1923. Neruda qualified these as the ""most impressive engravings made by a man that nobody relates to artistic creation"". Juan Gandulfo, as a medical student, made the color illustrations used to teach biology and histology by Professor Juan Noe. Juan Gandulfo wrote more than one hundred articles in the magazine ""Claridad"", pertaining to the Student Federation of Chile. Juan Gandulfo was consequent with his writings and went to jail twice as a student leader and fought a duel for a woman. Later on, with the same vehemence, he dedicated himself to the care of children in the Arriaran Hospital and to teach general surgery at the San Vicente Hospital, but fate truncated his career at the age of 36. This essay is an homage to this man, in the centennial of Pablo Neruda's birth. "
273,27339737,Minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment in the bone marrow (BM) postinduction therapy is now standard of care in patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). We examined the use of peripheral blood as a less invasive means of MRD assessment at days 8 and 15 of induction therapy and established the cutoff level that would allow the most accurate prediction of BM MRD postinduction therapy. MRD analysis was performed using 5-color flow cytometry on BM and PB samples from 77 B-ALL patients. BM MRD at diagnosis and day 29 of induction therapy was analyzed using the following antibody combinations: CD45-PC5/CD19-PC7/CD20-PE/CD10-ECD/CD38-FITC/CD13 + CD33-PE/CD10-ECD/CD34-FITC. PB MRD at days 8 and 15 was determined using CD45-PC5/CD19-PC7/CD20-ECD/CD10-PE/CD34-FITC. Day 8 and day 15 PB MRD levels were significantly higher in patients who had persistent BM MRD at day 29. PB MRD <0.01% at day 8 and/or day 15 predicted negative day 29 BM MRD status with 100% sensitivity but poor specificity. ROC curve analysis showed that day 15 PB MRD level of 0.1% yielded the highest sensitivity (78%) and specificity (82%). PB MRD cutoff level of 0.1% at day 15 has the best predictive value in determining positive day 29 BM MRD. 
274,35362631,"To estimate the socioeconomic disparities in untreated dental caries in early childhood according to socioeconomic characteristics in three birth cohorts in Southern Brazil. The socioeconomic data to this study were collected at the 48-month follow-up and oral health studies of 1993, 2004 and 2015 Pelotas birth cohort studies. The outcome was untreated dental caries in children aged 6 (1993 cohort), 5 (2004 cohort) and 4 years (2015 cohort), dichotomized into absence/presence. Analyses were stratified by maternal skin colour/race, maternal education and family income. For statistical purposes, the prevalence difference, relative risk and absolute and relative indices of health inequality (Slope Index of Inequality-SII and Concentration Index-CIX) were used. The prevalence of untreated dental caries in primary dentition was 63.4%, 45.5% and 15.6%, in 1993, 2004 and 2015 cohorts, respectively. The prevalence of untreated dental caries was concentrated in the poorest quintile and lower maternal education group in both absolute (SII) and relative (CIX) measures of inequality, being characterized as a pro-poor event. A higher risk of untreated caries was found in the poorest quintile of family income compared with the richest quintile in the 1993 cohort (RR 1.44 [95% CI 1.05; 1.98]). That risk was higher considering the 2004 Cohort (RR 1.78 [95% CI 1.42; 2.23]) and 2015 cohort (RR 4.20 [95% CI 2.97; 5.94]) data. Over the course of two decades, a higher prevalence of untreated dental caries is concentrated among the most socioeconomically deprived children. "
275,36422485,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders in childhood, is diagnosed clinically by assessing the symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Also, there are limited objective assessment tools to support the diagnosis. Thus, in this study, a new electrooculography (EOG) based on visual stimulus tracking to support the diagnosis of ADHD was proposed. Reference stimulus one-to-one tracking numbers (RSOT) and colour game detection (CGD) were applied to 53 medication-free children with ADHD and 36 healthy controls (HCs). Also, the test was applied six months after the treatment to children with ADHD. Parameters obtained during the visual stimulus tracking test were analyzed and Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD) and Hjorth parameters were calculated for all EOG records. The average test success rate was higher in HCs than in children with ADHD. Based on machine learning algorithms, the proposed system can distinguish drug-free ADHD patients from HCs with an 89.13% classification performance and also distinguish drug-free children from treated children with an 80.47% classification performance. The findings showed that the proposed system could be helpful to support the diagnosis of ADHD and the follow-up of the treatment. "
276,16425650,"Numerous factors are known to affect the academic performance of students. These include prenatal conditions, birth conditions, postnatal events, nutritional, socio-economic factors and environmental factors. This paper examines the nutritional status and its relationship with academic performance of 9-10 years old primary school children recruited randomly in Selangor, Malaysia. A standard self-administered questionnaire was utilized to obtain pertinent information and a face-to-face interview was also conducted with the parents. Results of the academic performances were extracted from the students' report cards. The intellectual performance was assessed using Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices. Physical examination was also conducted on these students by doctors. Overall 1,405 students and 1,317 parents responded to the survey. Of these 83.6% were Malays, 11.6% Indians, and 4.2% Chinese. The majority of them (82.9%) were from urban areas. The female: male ratio was 51:49; mean age was 9.71 years. The mean height and weight were 32.3 kg and 135.2 cm respectively. Their mean BMI was 17.42 kg/cm2, with 0.9% underweight, 76.3% normal BMI, 16.3% overweight, and 6.3% obese. Academic performance was significantly correlated with breast feeding, income and educational level of their parents, BMI, and whether they have been taking breakfast. There was a weak correlation between presence of anaemia and intellectual performance. Improving the socio-economic status of the parents will lend a helping hand in the academic performance of the students. Since breast feeding is associated with better academic and intellectual performance it must be emphasized, particularly to expectant mothers in the antenatal clinics. "

278,19875647,"To determine the dependency of straylight on ocular biometry. This prospective study included 518 eyes of 277 volunteers of diverse ethnic backgrounds with healthy eyes of various iris colors. The eyes had retinal straylight tested using a commercial psychophysical device. Ocular axial length and refraction were also measured with an ocular biometer and an autorefractometer, respectively. The measured retinal straylight was validated by comparing data with the age model described in the literature as log(s) = P(1) + log[1 + (age/65)(4)], where P(1) is the logarithm of the average straylight for the eyes of a newborn. The data agreed well with this model, although P(1) was slightly higher (0.931 vs. 0.87). When this model was subtracted from the measured straylight values, a quadratic increase was found in the function of axial length, L: log(s) = 0.931 + log[1 + (age/65)(4)] + (0.01089L(2) - 0.4820L + 5.330). A similar model was defined for the spherical equivalent refraction SE. This corresponds to an increasing amount of straylight for increasing degrees of myopia. No correlation was found with keratometry and corneal astigmatism or with iris color. Retinal straylight increases not only with age, but also with axial length. Further study is needed to identify the cause of this dependency. "
279,36722564,"The most common complication of circumcision is bleeding. Monitoring bleeding by visual assessment of the diaper can cause errors due to the high absorbency of diapers. The patient may have had significant problems before the visible changes. The amount of liquid that wets the cloth does not necessarily lead to a visual change consistent with the amount, and the nature of the liquid contaminating the diaper may cause difficulties in terms of visual evaluation. Making a decision based on the visual changes in the patient's diaper cannot be considered as reliable. We planned to evaluate the visual changes that are caused by liquids of various volumes and contents that wet the diaper, according to measurable criteria. We aimed to emphasise the importance of the subject in circumcision practices of diapered children. Wetting of diapers with different volumes and variable blood load was performed utilising blood with different haematocrits and fluids. One hundred and sixty different diapers in four groups were moistened utilising the drip method. Visual changes in the soaked diapers were evaluated with the colorimetric method and five different colour criteria. The saturation and lightness values, which indicate the colour value, were obtained by using the numerical equivalents of the three main components, red, green and blue. Analysis was carried out by subjecting statistical evaluation within and between groups. There was a significant difference between the control group and the study group. It was observed that visual changes caused by the moistened cloths with linear increase did not make the same linear interaction. There was not a significant difference between Group II and Group IV, which were soaked with the same amount of blood and different volume of fluid. In Group III, colour saturation changes were found to have a parabolic effect instead of a linear change. In two different analyses of moistened diapers in terms of volume and blood load; it was not determined that the expected linear changes between the groups were not observed. Visual changes in diapers related to volume or blood load effects of fluids may not be compatible with the amount of bleeding. Mistakes may occur when super absorbent wipes are used when determining the amount of bleeding from the use of colour changes in the diaper. Visual changes should not be relied on in bleeding due to circumcision. Rather, vital signs follow-up and measurable laboratory tests should be used as a basis. "
280,8956636,"To observe and classify tear film lipid layer interference patterns in normal volunteers and dry eye patients and to investigate the relation between the lipid layer interference patterns in the dry eyes and the results of other dry eye examinations. Precorneal tear lipid layer interference patterns were observed at the central cornea in 25 eyes of 13 normal controls and 85 eyes of 48 dry eye patients. Observed patterns were classified in masked fashion by five physicians into five grades: grade 1, somewhat gray color, uniform distribution; grade 2, somewhat gray color, nonuniform distribution; grade 3, a few colors, nonuniform distribution; grade 4, many colors, nonuniform distribution; and grade 5, corneal surface partially exposed. Other methods of dry eye examination were also performed, including the cotton thread test, the Schirmer I test and modified Schirmer I test, measurement of tear film breakup time, scoring of corneal fluorescein staining density (grades 0 to 3) and area (grades 0 to 3), and rose bengal staining (grades 0 to 9). In 92 (84%) of 110 eyes, four or more of the five physicians agreed in their grade classifications. Among the 92 eyes, normal control eyes were classified into grades 1 and 2 (10 and 12 eyes, respectively) and dry eyes were classified into grades 2, 3, 4, and 5 (22, 26, 10, and 12 eyes, respectively). There was a significant correlation between the grading and the results of other dry eye examination modalities, including fluorescein staining, rose bengal staining, and tear film breakup time. Tear lipid layer interference patterns are highly correlated with dry eye severity. "
281,37803890,"There is a paucity of literature on pediatric skin conditions in skin of color, of which old epidemiological data are likely to become outdated as the ethnic diversity in developed countries such as Australia continues to grow. We analyzed the prevalence of presenting conditions of pediatric patients with skin of color attending an urban dermatology clinic in Melbourne, Australia over an 18-month period. The major presenting issues were vitiligo, atopic dermatitis, and acne vulgaris, the majority of which did not significantly differ by ethnicity; however, there was a statistically significantly higher proportion of Chinese and Indian patients presenting with atopic dermatitis. Given the varying presentations of these conditions in skin of color, our findings highlight the importance of increasing education for dermatologists and health personnel in pigmentary disorders and the need for further focused studies comparing the prevalence of skin disease across ethnicities.

282,15607019,"An unusual case of uncertain twin paternity is presented. New research on inbred strains of mice may hold important clues for paternity testing of twins in the future. Next, four recent twin studies examining selected topics in autism, color perception, language development and high-order pregnancy risk are reviewed. Finally, several unusual twin-related situations are variously considered with respect to their research significance and practical applications. "
283,33453056,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of the vascularization index (VI) obtained using color superb microvascular imaging (cSMI) technique in assessment of the anterior urinary bladder wall in pediatric patients with acute cystitis (AC). The anterior bladder wall of 157 patients (age range 13-84 months, mean 43.62 ± 17.79 months) whose clinical and laboratory findings were proven of AC and 150 healthy asymptomatic participants (age range 13-84 months, mean 43.88 ± 18.11 months) with normal laboratory values were examined using cSMI. VI measurements were performed by manually drawing the contours of the anterior bladder wall using the free region of interest with 2-dimensional cSMI VI (2DcSMIVI) mode. The quantitative 2DcSMIVI values of the symptomatic group and the asymptomatic group were compared. The correlation between the 2DcSMIVI values and the anterior bladder wall thickness (BWT) were analyzed. The mean 2DcSMIVI values of the BWT were significantly higher in symptomatic group when compared to the asymptomatic group (p<0.001). AC can be diagnosed with a 93% sensitivity, 92% specificity when 3.25% 2DcSMIVI designated as the cutoff value. There was a significant positive correlation between 2DcSMIVI values and BWT (p<0.001). Two-dimensional cSMI VI can be used effectively in children as an imaging method in the diagnosis of AC. "
284,11312426,"Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) is a genodermatosis with autosomal dominant inheritance. In identified kindreds the diagnosis is relatively easy, but for the patients without family history of this syndrome a high clinical suspicion is necessary for diagnosis. Acrochordons are distinctly uncommon in childhood. Our purpose was to evaluate skin tags that develop at an early age. This is a retrospective series evaluation of 7 children who presented with pedunculated papules (acrochordon-like growths). A full history was then correlated with biopsy results in each patient. Clinically, lesions consisted of flesh-colored and pigmented pedunculated papules. Histopathologic examination of these papules showed basal cell carcinomas in each biopsy specimen. We consider that ""skin tag""-like basal cell carcinomas in childhood may represent a marker for NBCCS. Early diagnosis of this syndrome and early sun protection of the affected children could help decrease the number of lifetime tumors. Biopsy should be performed on acrochordons in children because they may be the presenting sign of NBCCS. Because these tags may precede other stigmata of the NBCCS, recognition may facilitate early diagnosis and allow early treatment and sun protection. "
285,32048036,"To evaluate the implications of hepatic subcapsular and capsular flows using ultrasonography (US) in children after Kasai operation. Children who underwent liver US including color Doppler US and microvascular imaging (MVI) from May 2017 to October 2017 were retrospectively included. Children who underwent the Kasai operation for biliary atresia were included in the Kasai group and children with normal liver were included in the control group. Using US results, the number of intrahepatic biliary cysts and the maximum diameter of the spleen were evaluated in the Kasai group. Liver stiffness values were included when patients in the Kasai group had transient elastography (TE) or shear wave elastography (SWE) results. Hepatic subcapsular and capsular flows on color Doppler US and MVI were compared between the two groups using the following scores: 0, no flow reaching the hepatic capsule; 1, any flow reaching the hepatic capsule; and 2, contiguous hepatic capsular flow. The logistic regression test was used to identify associations between age, intrahepatic biliary cysts, spleen size, SWV, TE results, and flow scores measured on Doppler US and MVI in the Kasai group using the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). A total of 65 children (mean 7.6 ± 5.3 years), 44 in the Kasai group and 21 in the control group, were included. In the control group, one child had score 1 on MVI and others had score 0 on both Doppler US and MVI. Among the Kasai group, 28 children (63.6%) had score 1, while others had score 0 using Doppler US. Using MVI, 24 children (54.5%) had score 2, 18 children had score 1, and one child had score 0. In the Kasai group, increased liver stiffness on TE was the only factor significantly associated with the presence of subcapsular flow on color Doppler US (OR 1.225, 95% CI 1.020-1.470) and increased spleen size was the only factor significantly associated with increased flow scores on MVI (OR 1.397, 95% CI 1.002-2.724). Detection of hepatic subcapsular, capsular flows on US would be meaningful for children after receiving the Kasai operation. • Hepatic subcapsular or capsular flows can be useful not only for the diagnosis but also for the postoperative follow-up in patients with biliary atresia. • Increased liver stiffness and splenomegaly after the Kasai operation were associated with presence of subcapsular or capsular flow on ultrasonography. • Evaluation of hepatic subcapsular and capsular flows could be needed to assess disease progression after receiving the Kasai operation.

286,31734638,"To evaluate the value of fused high b-value diffusion weighted and T2-weighted MRI compared to T1-weighted imaging, T2-weighted imaging and DWI for staging pediatric Hodgkin's lymphoma. 21 consecutive pediatric patients who underwent whole-body MRI at Hodgkin's lymphoma staging were included. Fused, colorized DWI/T2-weighted images were created. Image sets consisting of (a) T1-weighted, T2-weighted and DWI images and (b) T1-weighted, T2-weighted, DWI and DWI/T2-weighted fused images were reviewed by a radiologist using a cross-over design with blinding and randomization. Scoring was performed using a standardized form, based on detection, characterization and reading time, using a FDG-PET/CT based reference standard. Test characteristics, test agreement to a FDG-PET/CT based reference standard and reading times were calculated. Agreement for whole-body MRI without fused images and FDG-PET/CT was very good for nodal staging (κ = 0.86, 95% CI 0.78-0.93) and extra-nodal staging (κ = 0.90, 95% CI 0.71-1.09). Agreement improved with the addition of the fused DWI/T2-weighted images (κ = 0.92 95% CI 0.87-0.97 (nodal staging), κ = 0.92 95% CI 0.76-1.08 (extra-nodal staging). Sensitivity and specificity for staging nodal disease were 99 % and 95% respectively for whole-body MRI including DWI/T2-weighted fused images (versus 88 % and 97 % without fused images) and 100 % and 99 % for extra-nodal disease (83 % and 100 % without fused images). Disease stage for MRI including fused DWI/T2-weighted images agreed with the reference standard in 18 out of 21 patients. The addition of DWI/T2-weighted fusion images to T1-weighted, T2-weighted and DWI whole-body MRI might shorten reading times and might improve the diagnostic performance of whole-body MRI in staging pediatric Hodgkin's lymphoma.

287,22431769,"The aim of the study is to report a case of a rare congenital anomaly of the venous system and to emphasize its clinical importance. We describe a case of aplasia of the right common and external iliac veins in a healthy seven-year-old boy who was referred for Doppler ultrasound examination for further evaluation of an abnormal varicosity in the suprapubic region. Colour Doppler ultrasound revealed a dilated, arch-shaped vein. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography showed the absence of the right common iliac vein and external iliac vein. It also clearly demonstrated the aberrant venous structure, originating from the right common femoral vein and draining to the left common femoral vein. In conclusion, in our case, the patient’s life was threatened because the aberrant venous connection crossing within subcutaneous fatty tissue was not protected from external trauma and possible abdominal surgical interventions. Additional attention should be given to avoid such injuries, which can cause significant haemorrhage. "
288,37014804,"This review defines intersectionality, discusses recent studies that use an intersectional framework in adolescent health research, and outlines ways where clinicians can use intersectionality to address health disparities in youth of color through clinical practice, research, and advocacy. Research using an intersectional framework can identify populations at risk for certain disorders or behaviors. Recent studies in adolescent health research using an intersectional lens identified lesbian girls of color as an at-risk population for e-cigarette use, demonstrated lower skin color satisfaction among Black girls of all ages predicted greater binge-eating disorder symptoms, and showed that two-thirds of Latine (gender-neutral term that refers to people with Latin American roots) youth who recently immigrated to the United States experienced at least one traumatic event during their migration journey, putting them at risk for PTSD and other mental health disorders. Intersectionality refers to how multiple social identities intersect to produce a specific experience that reflects overlapping systems of oppression. Diverse youth contain multiple identities that intersect to produce unique experiences and health inequities. Using an intersectional framework acknowledges that youth of color are not homogenous. Intersectionality becomes an important tool to care for marginalized youth and advance health equity. "
289,21839473,"To investigate whether abnormal regional white matter architecture in the perisylvian region could be used as an easy and sensitive quantitative method to demonstrate language pathway abnormalities in children with developmental delay (DD). We performed diffusion tensor imaging in 15 DD subjects (age, 61.1 ± 20.9 months) and 15 age-matched typically developing (TD) children (age, 68.4 ± 19.2 months). With diffusion tensor imaging color-coded orientation maps, we quantified the fraction of fibers in the perisylvian region that are oriented in anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) directions, and their ratio (AP/ML) was calculated. The AP/ML ratio was more sensitive than tractography in characterizing perisylvian regional abnormalities in DD children. The AP/ML ratio of the left perisylvian region was significantly lower in DD children compared with TD children (P = .03). The ML component of bilateral perisylvian regions was significantly higher in DD children compared with TD children (P = .01 [left] and P = .004 [right]). No significant difference was found in the AP component in the two groups. A significant negative correlation of the left ML component with Vineland communication skills was observed (r = -0.657, P = .011). The AP/ML ratio appears to be a sensitive indicator of regional white matter architectural abnormalities in the perisylvian region of DD children. "
290,15101077,"This report describes unusual changes in the hepatic vasculature in 3 children presenting with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The study included 3 children (ages 5-8 years) who presented with hematemesis. All had mild hepatosplenomegaly and normal liver function. Esophageal varices were demonstrated in all on upper endoscopy. Color and spectral Doppler sonography was performed to assess the hepatic vasculature, including the hepatic veins (HVs), portal vein (PV), hepatic artery (HA), and inferior vena cava (IVC). The HVs were all patent but with ostial occlusion at the point of their communication with the IVC. Complete flow reversal was shown inside the HVs, with blood draining into collateral vessels at the liver surface and paraumbilical vein. In one patient, the paraumbilical vein could be traced to its communication with the right external iliac vein. In all children, the direction of flow in the PV, HA, and IVC was normal. After endoscopic sclerotherapy, all children were shown to be in good general condition and to have normal liver function for a follow-up period of 15-36 months. Ostial occlusion of the HV is a rare cause of hepatic outflow obstruction in children. Doppler sonography is a valuable, noninvasive imaging technique for evaluation of the hepatic vasculature and the accompanying shunting pathways in such cases. "
291,29147848,"Both anemia and sickle cell disease (SCD) are highly prevalent across sub-Saharan Africa, and limited resources exist to diagnose these conditions quickly and accurately. The development of simple, inexpensive, and accurate point-of-care (POC) assays represents an important advance for global hematology, one that could facilitate timely and life-saving medical interventions. In this prospective study, Robust Assays for Point-of-care Identification of Disease (RAPID), we simultaneously evaluated a POC immunoassay (Sickle SCAN™) to diagnose SCD and a first-generation POC color-based assay to detect anemia. Performed at Bugando Medical Center in Mwanza, Tanzania, RAPID tested 752 participants (age 1 day to 20 years) in four busy clinical locations. With minimally trained medical staff, the SCD POC assay diagnosed SCD with 98.1% sensitivity and 91.1% specificity. The hemoglobin POC assay had 83.2% sensitivity and 74.5% specificity for detection of severe anemia (Hb ≤ 7 g/dL). Interobserver agreement was excellent for both POC assays (r = 0.95-0.96). Results for the hemoglobin POC assay have informed the second-generation assay design to be more suitable for low-resource settings. RAPID provides practical feasibility data regarding two novel POC assays for the diagnosis of anemia and SCD in real-world field evaluations and documents the utility and potential impact of these POC assays for sub-Saharan Africa.

292,27560723,"The objective of this exploratory study was to determine whether fruit and vegetable consumption differed by race/ethnicity, by origin and nativity among Hispanics, and by language preference (as an indicator of acculturation) among foreign-born Hispanics. We recruited 723 women enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) and orally administered a questionnaire containing demographic items, validated measures of food security status and social desirability trait, and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System fruit and vegetable module. Differences in intakes of 100% fruit juice, fruit, cooked or canned beans, and dark green, orange-colored, and other vegetables were assessed by using analysis of covariance with Bonferroni post hoc tests. Analyses were controlled for age, pregnancy status, breastfeeding status, food security status, educational attainment, and social desirability trait. The frequency of vegetable intake differed by race/ethnicity (cooked or canned beans were consumed more often among Hispanic than non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white or other participants, orange-colored vegetables were consumed more often among Hispanics than non-Hispanic black participants, and other vegetables were consumed more often among non-Hispanic white or other than among non-Hispanic black and Hispanic participants), origin (other vegetables were consumed more often among Columbian and other Hispanics than Dominican participants) and nativity (orange-colored vegetables were consumed more often among foreign-born than US-born Hispanics). Fruit and vegetable intake did not differ by language preference among foreign-born Hispanics. Differences in fruit and vegetable consumption among WIC participants by race/ethnicity and by Hispanic origin and nativity may have implications for WIC nutrition policies and nutrition education efforts.

293,32955684,"This study evaluated a new light-emitting diode (LED-S) photic stimulator and compared skin electroretinogram (ERG) responses obtained to those evoked by the Grass Instrument stimulator (GP-S). Two sub-studies were combined to evaluate the difference in responses resulting from the LED-S and GP-S stimuli. The first was a photometry study that matched the LED-S stimuli to the GP-S. In the second study, electroretinograms (ERGs) were recorded under scotopic and photopic conditions using stimuli each stimulator. The stimuli were matched photometrically to measurements obtained from the photometer located 30 cm in front of the stimulators. In addition, the ERG responses were recorded from the LED stimulator when photometrically matched to the GP-S blue stimulus presented through a ganzfeld. The amplitudes and time peaks of the resulting ERG a- and b-waves were then measured and compared using paired T-tests. Study 1: The LED-S was matched to the GP-S at various intensity settings measured 30 cm away from the stimulator. Measurement through a ganzfeld full-field stimulator (GFFS) demonstrated that the GP-S had a significant hot spot centrally. Study 2: Photometrically matched ERGs evoked by both stimulators while employing the direct head-on measurements demonstrated multiple similarities. Similarities included component morphology, amplitude and implicit time across the two stimulators, excluding the rod-driven stimulus (GP-S setting employing a blue filter). Differences between the rod-driven ERGs evoked by the GP-S and LED-S while employing head-on photometric measurements were due to the significant difference in intensities between the two stimulators. The GP-S and LED-S evoked similar rod-driven ERG responses when they were matched using the GFFS photometrically matched intensities protocol. A hand-held stimulator is essential when recording ERG's in the practice of paediatric visual electrophysiology. The LED-S can match the GP-S stimulus intensities, making it a potential replacement for the GP-S. In addition, the LED-S has uniform intensity across the surface of the device compared to the GP-S, is silent for standard stimuli and can generate prolonged duration stimuli for the recording of on-off ERGs.

294,38866447,"Despite documented associations between social determinants of health and outcomes post-congenital heart surgery, clinical risk models typically exclude these factors. The study sought to characterize associations between social determinants and operative and longitudinal mortality as well as assess impacts on risk model performance. Demographic and clinical data were obtained for all congenital heart surgeries (2006-2021) from locally held Congenital Heart Surgery Collaborative for Longitudinal Outcomes and Utilization of Resources Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database data. Neighborhood-level American Community Survey and composite sociodemographic measures were linked by zip code. Model prediction, discrimination, and impact on quality assessment were assessed before and after inclusion of social determinants in models based on the 2020 Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database Mortality Risk Model. Of 14,173 total index operations across New York State, 12,321 cases, representing 10,271 patients at 8 centers, had zip codes for linkage. A total of 327 (2.7%) patients died in the hospital or before 30 days, and 314 children died by December 31, 2021 (total n = 641; 6.2%). Multiple measures of social determinants of health explained as much or more variability in operative and longitudinal mortality than clinical comorbidities or prior cardiac surgery. Inclusion of social determinants minimally improved models' predictive performance (operative: 0.834-0.844; longitudinal 0.808-0.811), but significantly improved model discrimination; 10.0% more survivors and 4.8% more mortalities were appropriately risk classified with inclusion. Wide variation in reclassification was observed by site, resulting in changes in the center performance classification category for 2 of 8 centers. Although indiscriminate inclusion of social determinants in clinical risk modeling can conceal inequities, thoughtful consideration can help centers understand their performance across populations and guide efforts to improve health equity.

295,24909606,"It is critical to differentiate between a multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) and a kidney with severe hydronephrosis as the treatment varies significantly. We designed a study to compare renal ultrasound (RUS) to nuclear medicine (NM) scan in the diagnosis of MCDK, in order to determine if RUS can be used for the definitive diagnosis of MCKD without use of NM scan. We performed a retrospective review of children with MCDK, who underwent both a RUS and Tc-99m MAG3 or DMSA scan. We planned to calculate the positive predictive value of an RUS diagnosis of MCDK, using NM scan diagnosis of a nonfunctioning kidney as the gold standard. The diagnosis of MCDK was made by RUS in 91 patients, 84 of whom had a normal bladder US. NM confirmed the diagnosis of MCDK in all 84 of these patients (100%). We have demonstrated a high predictive value for RUS in the diagnosis of MCDK. Our data support that in healthy infants with RUS diagnosis of unilateral MCDK and normal bladder US, NM scan may be unnecessary to confirm the diagnosis. "
296,33534362,"Striking histopathological overlap between distinct but related conditions poses a disease diagnostic challenge. There is a major clinical need to develop computational methods enabling clinicians to translate heterogeneous biomedical images into accurate and quantitative diagnostics. This need is particularly salient with small bowel enteropathies; environmental enteropathy (EE) and celiac disease (CD). We built upon our preliminary analysis by developing an artificial intelligence (AI)-based image analysis platform utilizing deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for these enteropathies. Data for the secondary analysis was obtained from three primary studies at different sites. The image analysis platform for EE and CD was developed using CNNs including one with multizoom architecture. Gradient-weighted class activation mappings (Grad-CAMs) were used to visualize the models' decision-making process for classifying each disease. A team of medical experts simultaneously reviewed the stain color normalized images done for bias reduction and Grad-CAMs to confirm structural preservation and biomedical relevance, respectively. Four hundred and sixty-one high-resolution biopsy images from 150 children were acquired. Median age (interquartile range) was 37.5 (19.0-121.5) months with a roughly equal sex distribution; 77 males (51.3%). ResNet50 and shallow CNN demonstrated 98% and 96% case-detection accuracy, respectively, which increased to 98.3% with an ensemble. Grad-CAMs demonstrated models' ability to learn different microscopic morphological features for EE, CD, and controls. Our AI-based image analysis platform demonstrated high classification accuracy for small bowel enteropathies which was capable of identifying biologically relevant microscopic features and emulating human pathologist decision-making process. Grad-CAMs illuminated the otherwise ""black box"" of deep learning in medicine, allowing for increased physician confidence in adopting these new technologies in clinical practice. "
297,19455642,"New evidence suggests that autism may be associated with (a) varied behavioral responses to folate therapy and (b) metabolic anomalies, including those in folate metabolism, that contribute to hypomethylation of DNA. We hypothesized that children with autism who are homozygous for the MTHFR 677 T allele (TT) and, to a lesser extent those with the CT variant, would exhibit more behavioral problems and/or more severe problematic behaviors than homozygous wild-type (CC) individuals because of difficulties in effectively converting 5,10-MTHF to 5-MTHF. Data from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) collection were analyzed for all children who met strict criteria for autism per the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and who had been genotyped for the 677 C to T MTHFR polymorphism (n=147). Chi-square tests, logistic regression, and one-way ANOVAs were used to determine whether differences existed among MTHFR genotypes for specific behaviors on the ADI-R and indices for level of functioning. Exploratory results indicated four behaviors from the ADI-R that were more common and problematic (95% CI) among those with at least one copy of the T allele as compared to homozygous wild-type individuals: direct gaze, current complex body movements, a history of self-injurious behavior, and current overactivity (ORs=2.72, 2.33, 2.12, 2.47, respectively). No differences existed among genotypes for level of functioning as measured with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Third Edition, Ravens Colored Progressive Matrices, or the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales. Findings call for further investigation of the relationship between folate metabolism and problem behaviors among children with autism. "
298,26856061,"A case of the myocardial contusion associated with the closed blunt chest injury in the girl aged 1 year 7 months is presented. The autopsy revealed hemorrhage of an irregular oval shape, coloured dark-red, and confined to the region with the area of 4.0 x 3.5 cm. It penetrated throughout the entire thickness of the lower part of the left atrial myocardium and the upper and middle parts of the left ventricle. No other changes were found in the heart, nor were congenital cardiac and vascular malformations documented. The main factors playing an important role in the formation of the myocardium contusion are discussed. The authors emphasize that it is the children having the narrow chest with the pliable wall who constitute the group at the highest risk of accidents resulting in the chest injury and myocardial contusion.

299,19849880,"This fMRI study investigates the neural bases of cognitive control of emotion processing in pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Seventeen un-medicated PBD patients, 15 un-medicated ADHD patients, and 14 healthy controls (HC) (mean age = 13.78 +/- 2.47) performed an emotional valence Stroop Task, requiring them to match the color of an emotionally valenced word to the color of either of two adjacent circles. Both patient groups responded significantly slower than HC, but there were no group differences in accuracy. A voxel-wise analysis of variance on brain activation revealed a significant interaction of group by word valence [F(2,41) = 4.44; p = .02]. Similar group differences were found for negative and positive words. For negative versus neutral words, both patient groups exhibited greater activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and parietal cortex relative to HC. The PBD group exhibited greater activation in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) relative to HC. The ADHD group exhibited decreased VLPFC activation relative to HC and the PBD group. During cognitive control of emotion processing, PBD patients deployed the VLPFC to a greater extent than HC. The ADHD patients showed decreased VLPFC engagement relative to both HC and PBD patients. "
300,30029863,"To compare exercise capacity measured by direct cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) of children with Kawasaki disease with different coronary artery diameter z scores (CA z score). This was a retrospective study that recruited children with Kawasaki disease after the acute stage receiving CPETs determined by CPET with treadmill. CA z score was based on a model using the Lambda-Mu-Sigma method. Max-Z was defined as the maximum z score of the proximal left anterior descending CA (LCA) or right CA (RCA). Children with Kawasaki disease with a Max z <2.0 and ≥2.0 were defined as Kawasaki disease group 1 and Kawasaki disease group 2, respectively. We recruited 32 boys and 17 girls with a mean age of 12.39 ± 3.61 years. Kawasaki disease group 1 (n = 36) had significantly higher peak metabolic equivalent (peak-MET) and peak rate pressure product (PRPP) than Kawasaki disease group 2 (n-13) (P = .046, P < .001). Max-Z correlated with peak-MET moderately and negatively (P < .001, Spearman rho= - .506). Max-Z correlated with PRPP modestly and negatively (P = .011, Spearman rho= - .360). Children after Kawasaki disease with a coronary artery Max-Z ≥ 2.0 had significantly lower peak exercise capacity than those with a Max-Z < 2.0. Max-Z might be used as an indicator of CA reserve and exercise capacity during peak exercise after the acute stage of Kawasaki disease. "
301,34365785,"Although sonoelastography is applied in assessment of many organs, studies for evaluation of muscles are very few in number and are mostly limited to adults. With this prospective study, we aimed to evaluate the value of sonoelastography in assessment of influenza related benign acute myositis in children. This study enrolled 25 patients with a clinical diagnosis of benign acute childhood myositis (BACM) and 25 age and sex-matched healthy controls. All patients presented to our emergency department with the complaint of inability to walk and had increased serum creatine kinase (CK) levels. All patients underwent strain elastography of the gastrocnemius muscle, and an elastography score was assigned to each patient by using a previously published 5 point-color scoring system. The findings were compared with those of the control group. No statistically significant difference was detected regarding age, weight, height, or body mass index (BMI) between patient and control groups. A statistically significant difference was found between the final elastography scores of the patient and control groups, mean values being 4.16 ± 0.75 versus 3.08 ±0.40, respectively (p < 0.001). Sonoelastography yielded a sensitivity of 80%, positive predictive value of 87%, specificity 88%, negative predictive value of 81.5%, and an overall accuracy of 84 %. Sonoelastography proves to be a valuable tool for diagnosis of BACM. It is one of the available ultrasound techniques in a radiology department and may particularly evolve to become a useful routine ancillary technique for investigation and follow-up in these cases. "
302,31129767,"Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in the HPRT1 gene. The clinical features and mutation spectrum of 26 Korean LNS patients from 23 unrelated families were retrospectively reviewed. The HPRT1 gene was analyzed by direct sequencing of genomic DNA. The median age at diagnosis was 2.3 years (range, 4 months-22.6 years) and the initial presenting features included developmental delay, orange colored urine, and self-injurious behaviors. Most patients were wheelchair-bound and suffered from urinary complications and neurologic problems such as self-mutilation and developmental delay. Twenty different mutations in HPRT1 were identified among 23 independent pedigrees, including six novel mutations. The most common mutation type was truncating mutations including nonsense and frameshift mutations (45%). Large deletions in the HPRT1 gene were identified in exon 1, exons 5-6, exons 1-9, and at chr X:134,459,540-134,467,241 (7702 bp) including the 5'-untranslated region, exon 1, and a portion of intron 1. In conclusion, this study describes the phenotypic spectrum of LNS and has identified 20 mutations from 23 Korean families, including six novel mutations in Korean patients with LNS. "
303,23566563,"South African adolescents have high HIV risk, yet few prevention interventions are effective. Parents play a pivotal role in youths' healthy sexual development and may be at risk themselves. We tested whether Let's Talk!, a worksite-based parenting program, improves parent-child communication about HIV and sexual health and parent condom use self-efficacy and behavior. We culturally adapted Let's Talk! in two languages, drawing on formative research and community stakeholder input. We then conducted a small randomized test at a large public worksite in Cape Town, South Africa. The intervention consisted of 5 weekly 2-hour group sessions for parents of youth aged 11-15. Sixty-six parents (64% female) and their 64 adolescents (41% female) completed surveys before and 1-2 weeks post-intervention; surveys assessed comfort with talking about sex, communication about 16 HIV- and sex-related topics, and parents' condom use self-efficacy and behavior. Thirty-four black African (Xhosa language) and 32 coloured (mixed-race; Afrikaans language) parent-child dyads participated. Parents were randomized to intervention (n = 34) and control (n = 32) groups; randomization was stratified by language. Multivariate regressions indicated that the intervention significantly increased parents' comfort with talking to their adolescent about sex, b(SE) = .98(.39), p = .02, and the number of sex- and HIV-related topics discussed with their adolescent, b(SE) = 3.26(1.12), p = .005.

304,25523574,"To elevate the prognostic value of minimal residual disease (MRD) detection by four-color flow cytometry with the antibody panel in childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The clinical data of 183 children with newly-diagnosed acute B-ALL and who accepted MRD detection between October 2010 and March 2012 was retrospectively reviewed. According to the detection time and result of MRD, the 183 children were classified into four groups: MRD negative (n=37) and positive (n=18) in the induction chemotherapy and MRD negative (n=113) and positive (n=15) in the maintenance chemotherapy. During both induction and maintenance chemotherapy, the percentage of patients at high and median risk in the MRD positive group was higher than in the MRD positive group (P<0.05). In the maintenance chemotherapy group, the 3- year cumulative incidence of relapse in MRD positive patients was higher than negative patients (P=0.04). The Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis showed that insensitive reaction for prednisone (RR=1.005, 95%CI: 0.864-1.170, P=0.032), bone marrow morphology that did not meet M1 on the 15th day (RR=6.454, 95%CI: 2.191-19.01, P=0.002) and MRD≥0.01% (RR=1.923, 95%CI: 0.750-4.933, P=0.043) were risk factors for relapse in children with B-ALL. The four-color flow cytometry with the antibody panel can distinguish from MRD positive patients from negative patients with B-ALL. The result of MRD detection, as prednisone sensitivity and bone marrow morphology on the 15th day, is also a independent prognostic factor in children with B-ALL. "
305,32079555,"To investigate the cross-sectional associations of dietary carbohydrate and fatty acid intakes with cognition in mid-childhood. Dietary carbohydrate and fatty acid intakes were assessed using 4-d food records, and cognition was evaluated using the Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (RCPM) score. The cross-sectional associations of dietary carbohydrate and fatty acid intakes with cognition were investigated using linear regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, body fat percentage, household income, parental education and daily energy intake. The baseline examinations of the Physical Activity and Nutrition in Children study. A population-based sample of 487 children (250 boys, 237 girls) aged 6-8 years living in the city of Kuopio, Finland. A higher dietary intake of fructose (standardised regression coefficient, β = 0·24, P < 0·001), total fibre (β = 0·16, P = 0·02) and soluble fibre (β = 0·15, P = 0·02) was associated with a higher RCPM score in boys. Other dietary carbohydrates and fatty acids, including total carbohydrates, glucose, sucrose, starch, insoluble fibre, total fat, SFAs, MUFAs, PUFAs, palmitic acid (C16), stearic acid (C18), linoleic acid (C18:2), α-linoleic acid (C18:3), arachidonic acid (C20:4), EPA (C20:5n-3) and DHA (C22:6n-6), were not associated with the RCPM score in boys. Dietary carbohydrates or fatty acids were not associated with the RCPM score in girls. Higher dietary fructose and fibre intakes were associated with better cognition in boys, but not in girls. Dietary fatty acids were not related to cognition in boys or in girls. "
306,22353490,"In Vietnam, efforts are underway to improve latrine use in rural and remote areas with particular focus on increasing coverage of sanitation in schools. However, there is a lack of information on how the school program affects latrine use by schoolchildren and at community level. This paper analyzes sanitation use among schoolchildren in a multi-ethnic area to inform future school-based sanitation promotion programmes. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was applied during a 5 months period in six primary and secondary schools and in the homes of schoolchildren in four different ethnic villages in Northern rural Vietnam. Using a structured questionnaire, 319 children were interviewed face-to-face to collect quantitative data. Qualitative methods included extensive observations at schools and in the homes of 20 children, a single day's diary writings of 234 children, in-depth interviews with children (20), their parents (20) and school staff (10), and focus group discussions with parents (4) and teachers (6), and picture drawing with children (12). All surveyed schools had student latrines. However, the observed schoolchildren most commonly urinated and defecated in the open. Main barriers for latrine use included inadequate number of latrines, limited accessibility to latrines, lack of constant water supply in latrines and lack of latrine maintenance by school management. Programs promoting latrine use for children were not conducted in either schools or communities and were not established as a preferred social norm in such settings. Children perceived existing school latrines as unappealing and expressed a wish to have basic, functional, clean, and colorful school latrines with privacy. The paper shows that the current school based sanitation promotion is insufficient to change sanitation behavior of school children irrespective of their ethnicity. It is important that schools, households and communities work more closely together to increase use and uptake of latrine use among schoolchildren. Also, the contractors of latrine facilities must work more closely with local school management when constructing latrines, including identifying location, design and appropriate systems of water supply. A separate budget needs to be allocated to allow the school to maintain the sanitation infrastructure and keep it hygienic and appealing for users. "
307,16046749,"Rickets fortunately remains rare in the United Kingdom, although its actual incidence is currently undetermined.1 Many still consider it to be a disease of poverty prevalent during the Victorian era. However, a number of recent articles have highlighted concern among British health professionals about the number of cases still being diagnosed in this country. These cases have nearly all involved non-Caucasian children who are considered to be at high risk due to skin colour, prolonged breast feeding, and low maternal vitamin D levels. Their presentations are variable ranging from failure to thrive, bone deformities, seizures, and even stridor. The diagnosis is usually made in babies and toddlers.We present a series of patients attending our accident and emergency (A&E) department, over a five month period, where the diagnosis of rickets was primarily a radiological diagnosis.

308,15911004,"Serefeddin Sabuncuoglu is known to be the author of the first illustrated surgery book, Cerrahiyyetu'l Haniyye (Imperial Surgery), which was written in Turkish in 1465 a.d. at the age of 80. The purpose of this paper is to describe his contributions to pediatric otorhinolaryngology. Cerrahiyyetu'l Haniyye consists of three chapters totaling 412 pages, in which there are 191 sections dealing with a wide range of surgical specialties, including pediatric otorhinolaryngologic surgery. Sabuncuoglu explains some of child diseases and their treatment in a whole section, and gives information on the same subject in relevant part of sections. The illustrations he provides are not at a state of the art level with those of his contemporaries, but they bear a great importance considering the attitudes of Islam to the art of painting. For each section, a single, poetic sentence describes in detail the diagnosis, classification and surgical technique. Some authors have claimed that he only translated Ebu Kasim-al Zahravi (Albucasis)'s Al-Tasrif (Textbook of Surgery) and added the illustrations of the surgical techniques. Even if this is accepted, the illustrations are enough to entitle this work as a milestone. Serefeddin Sabuncuoglu describes medical and surgical management pediatric otorhinolaryngologic diseases such as harelip, hypertrophy of adenoids, atresia of external auditory canal, a foreign body in external auditory canal, short frenulum, abscess of head, mass and abscess of neck in children and unpleasant odor in nose in his textbook. Although not recognized and rewarded in his time, Serefeddin Sabuncuoglu was a great surgeon in Turkish medical history. The sections on children in his book are of great importance in pediatric otorhinolaryngology which became a different speciality in the last century. Writing his book at his 80's, he deserves to be considered as a distinguished scientist, medical doctor and illustrator of his era, considering the insulting and discriminating ideas toward women and children, especially girls, at that period.

309,22281374,"This study aimed to investigate a wide variety of factors that influence auditory, speech, and language development following pediatric cochlear implantation (CI). Prospective collection of language tested data in profound hearing-impaired children. Pediatric CI can potentially be effective to development of practical communication skills and early implantation is more effective. We proposed a set of language tests (assessment package of the language development for Japanese hearing-impaired children; ALADJIN) consisting of communication skills testing (test for question-answer interaction development; TQAID), comprehensive (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised; PVT-R and Standardized Comprehension Test for Abstract Words; SCTAW) and productive vocabulary (Word Fluency Test; WFT), and comprehensive and productive syntax (Syntactic processing Test for Aphasia; STA). Of 638 hearing-impaired children recruited for this study, 282 (44.2%) with >70 dB hearing impairment had undergone CI. After excluding children with low birth weight (<1800 g), those with >11 points on the Pervasive Developmental Disorder ASJ Rating Scale for the test of autistic tendency, and those <2 SD on Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices for the test of non-verbal intelligence, 190 children were subjected to this set of language tests. Sixty children (31.6%) were unilateral CI-only users, 128 (67.4%) were CI-hearing aid (HA) users, and 2 (1.1%) were bilateral CI users. Hearing loss level of CI users was significantly (p<0.01) worse than that of HA-only users. However, the threshold level, maximum speech discrimination score, and speech intelligibility rating in CI users were significantly (p<0.01) better than those in HA-only users. The scores for PVT-R (p<0.01), SCTAW, and WFT in CI users were better than those in HA-only users. STA and TQAID scores in CI-HA users were significantly (p<0.05) better than those in unilateral CI-only users. The high correlation (r=0.52) has been found between the age of CI and maximum speech discrimination score. The scores of speech and language tests in the implanted children before 24 months of age have been better than those in the implanted children after 24 months of age. We could indicate that CI was effective for language development in Japanese hearing-impaired children and early CI was more effective for productive vocabulary and syntax. "
310,12921295,"To determine the frequency of valvular regurgitation, 174 children from birth to 18 years old (mean age 7.42+/-4.54 years), with structurally normal hearts were analyzed. Flow patterns across the four valves were examined by pulsed- (PW), continuous-wave (CW) and color Doppler. Regurgitation was detected in 59.7% of the valves. Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) was most commonly found in 32.8% (n=57), pulmonary regurgitation (PR) in 17.2% (n=30), mitral regurgitation (MR) in 8.6% (n=15), and aortic regurgitation (AR) in 1.1% (n=2). The range of peak velocities of the regurgitant flow with CW were as follows: TR:0.98-2.54 m/sec, PR:0.50-1.80 m/sec, MR:0.72-2.30 m/sec, and AR:1.22-1.25 m/sec. The mean peak velocities of the regurgitant flow were similar with CW and PW measurements (p>0.05). The length of the regurgitant flow with color Doppler was less than 1 cm beyond the mitral and aortic valves. It reached up to 1.8 cm behind the pulmonary and 1.83 cm behind the tricuspid valves. Frequency of valvular regurgitation was unchanged with age (p>0.05). Tricuspid regurgitation was more frequent in males (40.9% versus 23.5%; p=0.016). Regurgitation of tricuspid, pulmonary or mitral valves is relatively common in children with structurally normal hearts. Aortic regurgitation is scarce and the possible pathologic cause should always be carefully sought. "
311,32770180,"The COVID-19 (2019 novel coronavirus) pandemic has had a significant economic, social, emotional, and public health impact in the United States. A disturbing trend is that Black, Indigenous, and/or People of Color (BIPOC) are disproportionately contracting coronavirus, as well as dying from COVID-19. Objective/Methods The pandemic has the potential to entrench and magnify existing health disparities and families marginalized across multiple demographic intersections such as race/ethnicity, class, immigration status, are especially vulnerable. These inequities have been further underscored by the recent murders of Black Americans by police and a resulting spotlight on racial injustice in the United States. Results Efforts to lessen the spread of the virus, have resulted in changes in pediatric primary and subspecialty service delivery which may affect access for BIPOC communities. BIPOC trainees including those with debt or caregiving responsibilities may be faced with new barriers resulting in delays in completion of their training. Further, clinical, community-based, and translational research has been disrupted by heightened safety precautions and social distancing which may affect BIPOC representation in research downstream. Conclusion In our roles as clinicians, supervisors, trainees, and researchers in primary and subspecialty care as well as in academia, pediatric psychologists have an ethical responsibility to address the disproportionate burden of this pandemic on vulnerable communities and to allocate our time and resources to ensuring health equity now and in the aftermath of COVID-19.

312,24702753,"To determine the sex- and ethnicity-specific prevalence of color vision deficiency (CVD) in black, Asian, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white preschool children. Population-based, cross-sectional study. The Multi-Ethnic Pediatric Eye Disease Study is a population-based evaluation of the prevalence of vision disorders in children in Southern California. A total of 5960 subjects 30 to 72 months of age were recruited for the study, of whom 4177 were able to complete color vision testing (1265 black, 812 Asian, 1280 Hispanic, and 820 non-Hispanic white). Color vision testing was performed using Color Vision Testing Made Easy color plates (Home Vision Care, Gulf Breeze, FL), and diagnostic confirmatory testing was performed using the Waggoner HRR Diagnostic Test color plates (Home Vision Care). Testability of color vision in preschool children between 30 and 72 months of age and prevalence of CVD stratified by age, sex, and ethnicity. Testability was 17% in children younger than 37 months of age, increasing to 57% in children 37 to 48 months of age, 89% in children 49 to 60 months of age, and 98% in children 61 to 72 months of age. The prevalence of CVD among boys was 1.4% for black, 3.1% for Asian, 2.6% for Hispanic, and 5.6% for non-Hispanic white children; the prevalence in girls was 0.0% to 0.5% for all ethnicities. The ethnic difference in CVD was statistically significant between black and non-Hispanic white children (P = 0.0003) and between Hispanic and non-Hispanic white children (P = 0.02). In boys, most CVD cases were either deutan (51%) or protan (34%); 32% were classified as mild, 15% as moderate, and 41% as severe. Testability for CVD in preschool children is high by 4 years of age. The prevalence of CVD in preschool boys varies by ethnicity, with the highest prevalence in non-Hispanic white and lowest in black children. "
313,18392303,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation through a new interface helmet in the treatment of cardiogenic pulmonary oedema due to scorpion sting envenomation in children. Three patients presented with fever, and respiratory distress following scorpion sting. Their cardiac enzymes were abnormal. Electrocardiogram (ECG) of 3 patients showed features of myocardial strain with ST elevation. Bedside chest X-ray taken in emergency showed marked bilateral infiltrates suggestive of pulmonary oedema. M-mode, two-dimensional colour-flow Doppler echocardiogram showed left ventricular dysfunction. At paediatric intensive care unit admission, they were treated with antivenom, prazosin (0.03 mg/kg/dose), dopamine (15 mcg/kg/ min), dobutamine (10 mcg/kg/min) and nitroprussid (1 mcg/kg/min). Epinephrine (0.1 mcg/kg/ min) were added later. They were hypoxic and dyspnoeic. A slight sedation was induced with ketamine and/or midazolam. Non-invasive pressure support ventilation (NPSV) was delivered via the helmet by means of an intensive care unit ventilator. We evaluated the effect of NPSV delivered by helmet on oxygenation, respiratory rate, haemodynamics, complications and outcome. An improvement of oxygenation was observed within 2 hours of treatment.The helmet was well tolerated by all the children. No complications occurred in the 3 patients. This new approach of delivering NPSV through a helmet allows the successful treatment of cardiogenic pulmonary oedema in children with scorpion sting envenomation, assuring a good tolerance without complications. Future studies are needed before recommending the extensive application of this technique in all cases of cardiogenic pulmonary oedema due to scorpion sting envenomation. "
314,23516446,"To explore mechanisms underlying reduced fixation of eyes in autism, children with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) and typically developing children were tested in five visual search experiments: simple color feature; color-shape conjunction; face in non-face objects; mouth region; and eye region. No group differences were found for reaction time profile shapes in any of the five experiments, suggesting intact basic search mechanics in children with ASD. Contrary to early reports in the literature, but consistent with other more recent findings, we observed no superiority for conjunction search in children with ASD. Importantly, children with ASD did show reduced accuracy for eye region search (p = .005), suggesting that eyes contribute less to high-level face representations in ASD or that there is an eye region-specific disruption to attentional processes engaged by search in ASD.

315,15536719,"This study was done to ascertain the prevalence and aetiology of extrinsic stains among 11-16 year-old school children in Surulere, which is one of the Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Lagos, Nigeria. 600 school children were randomly selected from 6 schools, 3 primary and 3 secondary, in the LGA. About 100 children were examined from each age category of 11 to 16 years for extrinsic stains, and information on their dietary and oral habits was obtained. A 64.0% prevalence of extrinsic stains was found among the study population (boys =64.5%, girls = 63.4%). The colour of the extrinsic stains ranged from yellow, brown, green, orange, black to red and were mainly due to poor oral hygiene. The extrinsic stains were derived mainly from food consumption and the action of chromogenic bacteria. The high level of extrinsic stains seen in this study is also a reflection of the low utilisation of dental services and subsequently of professional oral prophylaxis among the subjects as 91.5% had never visited a dentist and 94.8% had never had a professional oral prophylaxis. The prevalence of stains seen in the study population is higher than would be expected in adolescents who should be rather self-conscious at that age, the older adolescents even having a significantly higher prevalence of stains than younger adolescents (p < 0.05). No statistical difference in extrinsic stains prevalence was found among the sexes (p = 0.7) or among social classes (p> 0.05). The establishment of a school oral health care programme in the Local Government Area is advocated, as this may be the only source of oral care for these children. Dental health education and promotion services should be the main thrust of such services, which may be in form of fixed or mobile dental clinics. "
316,21080146,"Pediatric patients with Takayasu arteritis were studied by analyzing clinical presentation, diagnostic images, response to multimodal therapy, and long-term outcome. Fourteen consecutive children and adolescents (mean age: 10 years) were diagnosed with Takayasu arteritis at our institution between 1995 and 2007. They were subjected to clinical and diagnostic studies including color ultrasonography, MRI and angiography, and received interdisciplinary treatment. The median time lag between the first onset of symptoms and diagnosis was 7.7 weeks. The majority of patients presented with acute severe clinical symptoms and extensive vascular lesions. Hypertension was the most common finding on first presentation (93%), followed by headache (64%), nausea (64%) and palpitation (50%). Ten patients (71%) had reduced or absent carotid, brachial or femoral pulses in one or more locations. C-reactive protein was elevated in 79% of the patients and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in 64%. Cardiovascular imaging showed extensive vasculitis of both sides of the diaphragm in 86%. Complications included renal artery stenosis (n=7), aortic dissection, thoracic aortic aneurysm and infrarenal aneurysm (all n=1). Conservative drug treatment was effective in 50%. Interventional dilatation of stenosis and surgical therapy, including aortic bypass, resection of aneurysms and nephrectomy, were necessary in the remaining patients. Follow-up for 25 months to 12 years showed that all children are well without disease-related mortality. Takayasu arteritis is a rare and potentially life-threatening disease in children, likely with a prolonged subclinical course. Rapid diagnosis and interdisciplinary management help to prevent life-threatening complications. "
317,19933660,"The purpose of our study was to compare chest ultrasound and chest CT in children with complicated pneumonia and parapneumonic effusion. We retrospectively compared chest ultrasound and chest CT in 19 children (nine girls and 10 boys; age range, 8 months-17 years) admitted with complicated pneumonia and parapneumonic effusion between December 2006 and January 2009. Images were evaluated for effusion, loculation, fibrin strands, parenchymal consolidation, necrosis, and abscess. In the subset of patients who underwent surgical management, imaging findings were correlated with operative findings. Eighteen of 19 patients had an effusion on both chest ultrasound and chest CT. The findings of effusion loculation as well as parenchymal consolidation and necrosis or abscess were similar between the two techniques. Chest ultrasound was better able to visualize fibrin strands within the effusions. Of the 14 patients who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopy, five had surgically proven parenchymal abscess or necrosis. Preoperatively, chest ultrasound was able to show parenchymal abscess or necrosis in four patients, whereas chest CT was able to show parenchymal abscess or necrosis in three. In our series, chest ultrasound and chest CT were similar in their ability to detect loculated effusion and lung necrosis or abscess resulting from complicated pneumonia. Chest CT did not provide any additional clinically useful information that was not also seen on chest ultrasound. We suggest that the imaging workup of complicated pediatric pneumonia include chest radiography and chest ultrasound, reserving chest CT for cases in which the chest ultrasound is technically limited or discrepant with the clinical findings.

318,27796468,"Children with Alagille syndrome undergo surveillance radiologic examinations as they are at risk for developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. There is limited literature on the imaging of liver masses in Alagille syndrome. We report the ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearances of incidental benign giant hepatic regenerative nodules in this population. To describe the imaging findings of giant regenerative nodules in patients with Alagille syndrome. A retrospective search of the hospital database was performed to find all cases of hepatic masses in patients with Alagille syndrome during a 10-year period. Imaging, clinical charts, laboratory data and available pathology were reviewed and analyzed and summarized for each patient. Twenty of 45 patients with confirmed Alagille syndrome had imaging studies. Of those, we identified six with giant focal liver masses. All six patients had large central hepatic masses that were remarkably similar on US and MRI, in addition to having features of cirrhosis. In each case, the mass was located in hepatic segment VIII and imaging showed the mass splaying the main portal venous branches at the hepatic hilum, as well as smaller portal and hepatic venous branches coursing through them. On MRI, signal intensity of the mass was isointense to liver on T1-weighted sequences in four of six patients, but hyperintense on T1 in two of six patients. In all six cases, the mass was hypointense on T2- weighted sequences. The mass post-contrast was isointense to adjacent liver in all phases in five the cases. Five out of six patients had pathological correlation demonstrating preserved ductal architecture confirming the final diagnosis of a regenerative nodule. Giant hepatic regenerative nodules with characteristic US and MR features can occur in patients with Alagille syndrome with underlying cirrhosis. Recognizing these lesions as benign giant hepatic regenerative nodules should, thereby, mitigate any need for intervention. "

320,27110747,"This study was designed to establish preliminary feasibility testing of a set of inherently benign somatosensory stimulus-response tests (to cutaneous and deep stimuli) for bedside or office evaluation of pain disorders in children and adolescents. Associations between, and the relative influence of, cutaneous somatosensory testing (SST) responses, deep SST responses, and psychological factors (depression, pain-related catastrophizing) on pain outcomes (worst pain intensity, pain-related disability) were considered. Sixty participants (6 to 18 y) were recruited from the pediatric chronic pain clinic. SST responses were assessed at the pain site (PS) and control sites to diverse stimuli (static/dynamic touch, punctate pressure, vibration, cool, deep pressure) using Colored Analogue Scales (CAS) with modified anchors. Validated measures of depression, pain-related catastrophizing, and pain-related functional interference were administered. Responses at the PS were more frequently hypersensitive than hyposensitive for all SST measures except vibration. Deep pressure responses were the only statistically significant predictor of worst pain intensity. Depression and pain-related catastrophizing accounted for a statistically significant amount of variance of pain-related disability, over and above that which was accounted for by SST responses. Preliminary feasibility of a set of somatosensory stimulus-response tests for bedside or office evaluation of pain disorders in children and adolescents was established. Deep pressure responses contributed unique information in predicting worst pain intensity but not functional interference. Although cutaneous SST responses at the PSs were frequently abnormal, cutaneous SST responses were not confirmed in this study to have clinical utility, but rather might be centrally mediated epiphenomena.

322,23114128,"The purpose of this study was to establish a method for the monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) in bone marrow samples of the children with T acute lymphoid leukemia (T-ALL), and to evaluate its value in clinical application. The immuno-phenotype of the leukemic cells were detected by flow cytometry with two sets of 4-color combinations of antibodies against TdT/CD5/cCD3/HLA-DR(+)CD19(+)CD33 and CD34/CD5/cCD3/HLA-DR(+)CD19(+)CD33 in 32 cases of de novo T-ALL and were compared with the results in 10 normal controls. The antibody combination in regions of the two-parameter plots where the leukemic cells appeared were different from the normal cells was screened as the effective combination which was used to monitor MRD in the bone marrows of the T-ALL children after the inductive treatment. The results indicated that the respective effective frequencies of antibodies against TdT/CD5/cCD3/HLA-DR(+)CD19(+)CD33 and CD34/CD5/cCD3/HLA-DR(+)CD19(+)CD33 were 90.6% and 62.5%. 32 cases of childhood T-ALL were successively screened for antibodies combinations of interest and were identified in 100% (32/32) of these cases. After inductive treatment, the positive rate in 129 times of MRD monitoring was 19.4% (25/129) by flow cytometry and 5.43% (7/129) by FAB morphology. It is concluded that monitoring MRD in patients with T-ALL by flow cytometry with two 4 color combinations of fluorescent antibodies is an quick and effective method. The sensitivity of this method is high and it may be of important significance for the treatment and prognostic evaluation in childhood T-ALL. "
323,2198634,"A total of 420 sonograms of renal transplants in 80 children were obtained because of decreased renal function or to establish a baseline after surgery. We describe normal anatomy of a renal transplant on sonograms, including duplex Doppler and color flow images, and a spectrum of complications.

324,7823336,"We conducted this study to determine if color Doppler ultrasonography can identify increased vascularity associated with gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions and to determine if specific diagnoses can be established based on flow patterns. Twenty-five children with acute right lower quadrant pain and discharge diagnoses of inflammatory bowel processes were examined by color Doppler sonography, as an adjunct to routine gray-scale examinations. Final diagnoses included gastroenteritis (10 cases), Crohn's disease (five cases), neutropenic colitis (four cases), peritonitis (four cases), and Yersinia enterocolitis (two cases). The results of color Doppler sonography were considered positive for inflammation if increased vascularity was demonstrated in the bowel mucosa, muscularis layer, or adjacent tissues. A control group of 19 patients was examined. No sonographic abnormalities were identified in any patients in the control group. Diffuse, concentric wall thickening with increased blood flow centrally within the mucosa was seen in Crohn's disease (60%) and Yersinia enterocolitis (100%), whereas wall thickening with increased transmural vascularity was identified in neutropenic colitis (50%) and Crohn's disease (40%). In contrast, in peritonitis color Doppler sonography showed thickened bowel wall and hypervascularity within peripheral bowel wall or in adjacent soft tissues. No demonstrable bowel vascularity was seen in gastroenteritis. Our experience suggests that mucosal or transmural hypervascularity on color Doppler sonography can be seen with several inflammatory bowel processes, but it is nonspecific. However, color Doppler sonography may aid in differentiating primary bowel disease from extrinsic inflammatory conditions, such as peritonitis. "
325,32376728,"Children and adolescents who become involved with the justice system often do so with complex medical, mental health, developmental, social, and legal needs. Most have been exposed to childhood trauma or adversity, which both contribute to their involvement with the justice system and negatively impact their health and well-being.

326,27506166,"The resistive and pulsatility indices are known tools for assessing renal function in kidney diseases, especially in proteinuric conditions like Paediatric Nephrotic syndrome (NS) which is a glomerular disease. However, there is a limited knowledge in the use of Doppler Resistive and pulsatility indices in the management of this disease condition. This was a case control study involving 53 cases and 57 controls. The Doppler parameters, resistive index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) of the renal interlobar arteries were determined for the upper, middle, and lower poles bilaterally for both controls and cases. The mean RI on the right and left were 0.59 ± 0.06 and 0.58 ± 0.06 respectively for the NS cases whereas for the controls it was 0.61 ± 0.05 and 0.60 ± 0.04 on the right and left respectively. The mean PI on the right and left measured 0.96 ± 0.16 and 0.94 ± 0.15 respectively for the NS cases while that for the control cases measured 0.98 ± 0.13.and 0.95 ± 0.12 on the right and left respectively. Although, the interlobar arteries mean RIs were generally less than that for the controls, but only the left middle pole showed statistically significant mean difference (p= 0.004). There was also statistically significant mean difference (p= 0.048) between the cases and controls in the left middle pole PI. However, no correlation was found when the renal RI and PI are compared with the serum albumin and creatinine. Although there was no statistical significance between the mean RI and PI of the NS cases and controls, except in the left middle pole RI, it is recommended that Doppler ultrasound should still be part of management of Nephrotic syndrome patients especially those who have developed end stage renal disease in order to monitor their renal function.

327,38166516,"To understand parent and child perception of spaces experienced during outpatient procedures and to measure their anxiety in these spaces. Same-day procedures are becoming prevalent among children in the United States. While studies conducted in different types of healthcare settings show that the physical environment influences healthcare experiences of patients, there is a lack of research on patient and family perceptions of the physical environment of the outpatient centers where such procedures are conducted. This study used ecological momentary assessment to collect patient experience and anxiety data at different points during the patient's journey through an ambulatory surgical center where pediatric gastrointestinal (GI) procedures were performed. Objective and subjective measures of anxiety were collected. A Qualtrics survey asked participants' perceptions about four spaces-waiting, preprocedure, procedure, and recovery. Child participants reported liking murals, double chairs, patient beds, wall color, and access to a television. They disliked medical equipment and lack of child-friendly furniture. Most parents liked the murals, access to a television, and nature photos, while disliking the lack of privacy, lack of toys in waiting areas, and lack of child-friendly furniture. On average, both children and parents experienced the highest anxiety levels before and during the procedure and the lowest during recovery. Between the four spaces, no significant differences were observed in the heart rate variability and skin conductance responses for both groups. Despite the outpatient nature of the procedures, participants experienced anxiety before the GI procedure. Comfortable design features that provide distractions are preferred by children and their parents. "
328,11475602,"This study was undertaken to evaluate the role of ultrasound (US), conventional color (CD) and power Doppler (PD) in the detection and quantification of inflammatory signs of the knee in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and to correlate these findings with patient history, clinical, laboratory and radiological findings. Thirty patients with JIA who had clinical signs of knee involvement as well as 15 healthy children as a control group where subjected to full clinical examination and laboratory investigations on the same day of US examination. The knee joints were evaluated with plain radiography, US, and color Doppler in 13 patients, while the remaining 17 were assessed with power Doppler. Fourteen patients were subjected to follow-up assessment. A highly significant difference in synovial thickening and cartilage thickness detected by US between JIA affected knees and those of controls (p < 0.0001). Knee effusion was demonstrated in 93% of patients. Synovial vessels were detected by Doppler in 76.7% of patients. A significant correlation was detected between the degree of vascularity detected by PD and knee score (p < 0.05), and JAFAR score (P < 0.05). On comparing the findings of the follow-up with those of the initial examination, a significant positive correlation was detected between the differences in the knee score and those in synovial thickness (p < 0.05), and with the vascularity scale detected by PD (p < 0.05). This study suggests the Doppler sonography as a non-invasive, low-cost, and readily available tool for the evaluation and follow-up of articular involvement in knees of JIA patients. "
329,11112814,"Ultrasonography (US) is of value in the evaluation and characterization of breast masses in children. Most masses represent either normal breast tissue, cysts, or fibroadenomas. Premature thelarche may be unilateral, and normal breast tissue is found at US. Cysts are commonly retroareolar; when they become infected, they appear sonographically as a complex mass. Fibroadenoma is the most frequent breast tumor in adolescent girls, and it is usually solitary, homogeneous, and hypoechoic. Malignant breast lesions are very rare in children; most are due to metastatic disease secondary to rhabdomyosarcoma, leukemia, lymphoma, and neuroblastoma, and their US appearance is nonspecific. Gynecomastia in boys can be mimicked by general obesity and pectoral hypertrophy; US is helpful in the diagnosis, especially when gynecomastia is asymmetric. Most breast lesions in children and adolescents are benign, and surgery should be avoided to prevent later deformity. US is the ideal imaging modality to evaluate breast lesions and may be used to guide a fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Color Doppler US evaluation is helpful; cysts are avascular, fibroadenomas may be avascular or hypovascular, and abscesses show peripheral increased flow. Bloody nipple discharge is more common in prepubertal patients, may occur in infants, and may be secondary to mammary ductal ectasia. Discharge commonly resolves spontaneously, and findings at US are frequently normal. "
330,31651129,"Aim Our aim was to design a new insulin prescribing tool in compliance with the Irish Medicines Safety Network recommendations. Methods In 2015, we undertook a review of the existing paediatric subcutaneous insulin-prescribing sheet introduced to Cork University Hospital in 2013. This involved a retrospective analysis of 15 consecutive in-patient insulin prescribing charts and a questionnaire distributed to health professionals. Following this a new insulin prescribing chart was designed and implemented in 2016 and a re-audit was performed in 2017. Results The 2017 re-audit demonstrated that the new insulin chart was viewed as easier (95% of previous users n=18) and safer (n=16) to use. There was less confusion (2017: 28%, n=11/39 vs 2015: 50%, n=17/34 2015) and the ALERT system helped staff standardise hypo/hyperglycaemia management (71%, n=28). Conclusion The new paediatric insulin prescribing chart has improved safety and ease of prescribing insulin. The colour coded quasi graph and ALERT system has made it easier to appreciate capillary blood glucose trends and manage them safely. "
331,10999708,The authors report the clinical course of a young girl with ovarian torsion who was treated conservatively. This case shows that detorsion of the ovary may be associated with immediate postoperative febrile morbidity and slow resolution of ovarian enlargement. The authors emphasize that these signs can be associated with viable ovarian tissue and are not necessarily an indication for oophorectomy. 
332,38149216,"It is often a challenge for a child to communicate their pain, and their possibilities to do so should be strengthened in healthcare settings. Digital self-assessment provides a potential solution for person-centered care in pain management and promotes child participation when a child is ill. A child's perception of pain assessment differs when it is assessed using digital or analog formats. As we move into the digital era, there is an urgent need to validate digital pain assessment tools, including the newly developed electronic Faces Thermometer Scale (eFTS). This study protocol describes three studies with the overall aim to evaluate psychometric properties of the eFTS for assessing pain in children 8-17 years of age. A multi-site project design combining quantitative and qualitative methods will be used for three observational studies. Study 1: 100 Swedish-speaking children will report the level of anticipated pain from vignettes describing painful situations in four levels of pain and a think-aloud method will be used for data collection. Data will be analyzed with phenomenography as well as descriptive and comparative statistics. Study 2: 600 children aged 8-17 years at pediatric and dental settings in Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, and USA will be included. Children will assess their pain intensity due to medical or dental procedures, surgery, or acute pain using three different pain Scales for each time point; the eFTS, the Faces Pain Scale Revised, and the Coloured Analogue Scale. Descriptive and comparative statistics will be used, with subanalysis taking cultural context into consideration. Study 3: A subgroup of 20 children out of these 600 children will be purposely included in an interview to describe experiences of grading their own pain using the eFTS. Qualitative data will be analyzed with content analysis. Our pilot studies showed high level of adherence to the study procedure and rendered only a small revision of background questionnaires. Preliminary analysis indicated that the instruments are adequate to be used by children and that the analysis plan is feasible. A digital pain assessment tool contributes to an increase in pain assessment in pediatric care. The Medical Research Council framework for complex interventions in healthcare supports a thorough development of a new scale. By evaluating psychometric properties in several settings by both qualitative and quantitative methods, the eFTS will become a well-validated tool to strengthen the child's voice within healthcare. "
333,25921253,"Dilation of the aorta is a frequent complication in patients with bicuspid aortic valves. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the subtype of leaflet fusion, right and noncoronary leaflet (R/N) fusion versus right and left leaflet (R/L) fusion, and the patterns of aortic dilation and valve dysfunction in young patients with bicuspid aortic valves. We performed a retrospective review of 642 patients who presented with bicuspid aortic valves between 1994 and 2014. Of these patients, 210 (33%) had aortic dilation (z score >3) by echocardiogram. For each patient, the most recent study or the last study before intervention was reviewed. Median patient age was 15 years (range, 0 to 40 years) with patients with R/N fusion being younger. The most prevalent subtype was R/N fusion (R/N, n = 114, 54% versus R/L, n = 96, 46%). Dilation of the ascending aorta was seen more often in patients with R/N fusion (R/N, 88% versus R/L, 68%; p = 0.004), whereas the prevalence of dilation of the sinuses of Valsalva was significantly higher in patients with R/L fusion (R/L, 46% versus R/N, 20%; p = 0.01). The magnitude of dilation differed as well. The z value of the sinuses of Valsalva was significantly higher in patients with R/L fusion (R/L, 2.03 versus R/N, 1.2; p = 0.003), whereas the z values of the ascending aorta and sinotubular junction were similar between the groups. Patients with R/N fusion were more likely to have aortic stenosis, and within the R/N group, patients with aortic insufficiency had a greater degree of ascending aorta dilation (p = 0.04). Our study suggests that in young patients with bicuspid aortic valves and aortic dilation, aortic valve morphology may be associated with the patterns of aortic dilation and valve dysfunction. Patients with R/N fusion were more likely to have ascending aorta dilation, whereas patients with R/L fusion were more likely to have dilation of the aortic root. In addition, patients with R/N fusion presented at a younger age and were more likely to have aortic stenosis. Recognition of these differences may eventually be helpful for patient counseling and the planning of follow-up. "
334,37395084,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and gender dysphoria (GD) frequently cooccur. However, existing research has primarily used smaller samples, limiting generalizability and the ability to assess further demographic variation. The purpose of this study was to (1) examine the prevalence of cooccurring ASD and GD diagnoses among US adolescents aged 9 to 18 and (2) identify demographic differences in the prevalence of cooccurring ASD and GD diagnoses. This secondary analysis used data from the PEDSnet learning health system network of 8 pediatric hospital institutions. Analyses included descriptive statistics and adjusted mixed logistic regression testing for associations between ASD and GD diagnoses and interactions between ASD diagnosis and demographic characteristics in the association with GD diagnosis. Among 919 898 patients, GD diagnosis was more prevalent among youth with an ASD diagnosis compared with youth without an ASD diagnosis (1.1% vs 0.6%), and adjusted regression revealed significantly greater odds of GD diagnosis among youth with an ASD diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio = 3.00, 95% confidence interval: 2.72-3.31). Cooccurring ASD/GD diagnoses were more prevalent among youth whose electronic medical record-reported sex was female and those using private insurance, and less prevalent among youth of color, particularly Black and Asian youth. Results indicate that youth whose electronic medical record-reported sex was female and those using private insurance are more likely, and youth of color are less likely, to have cooccurring ASD/GD diagnoses. This represents an important step toward building services and supports that reduce disparities in access to care and improve outcomes for youth with cooccurring ASD/GD and their families. "
335,27773359,"Certain pesticides may affect children's neurodevelopment. We assessed whether pesticide exposure was associated with impaired neurobehavioral outcomes in children aged 6-9 years. We conducted a cross-sectional study in 140 children living near banana plantations and plantain farms in the Talamanca County, Costa Rica and assessed their neurobehavioral performance. Exposure was determined by analyzing urinary metabolites of chlorpyrifos (3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol, TCPy), mancozeb (ethylenethiourea, ETU), and pyrethroids (3-phenoxybenzoic acid, 3-PBA). Repeated urine samples were obtained for 36 children. We estimated associations of pesticide concentrations with neurobehavioral outcomes using multivariable linear and logistic regression models. Median (25th-75th percentiles) TCPy, ETU, and 3-PBA concentrations were 1.4 (.7-3.1), 1.2 (.7-3.0), and .8 (.5-1.5) μg/L, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) ranged between .32 and .67. After adjustment for potential confounders, higher urinary TCPy concentrations were associated with poorer working memory in boys (n = 59) (β per 10-fold increase in TCPy concentrations = -7.5, 95% CI: -14.4, -.7); poorer visual motor coordination (β = -1.4, 95% CI: -2.7, -.1); increased prevalence of parent-reported cognitive problems/inattention (adjusted OR per 10-fold increase in urinary concentrations = 5.8, 95% CI: 1.6, 22.9), oppositional disorders (aOR = 3.9, 95% CI: 1.0, 16.0), and ADHD (aOR = 6.8, 95% CI: 1.8, 28.6), and; decreased ability to discriminate colors (aOR = 6.6, 95% CI: 1.6, 30.3; the higher the score the worse). Higher ETU concentrations were associated with poorer verbal learning outcomes (β = -7.0, 95% CI: -12.7, -1.3). Higher 3-PBA concentrations were associated with poorer processing speed scores, particularly in girls (β = -8.8, 95% CI: -16.1, -1.4). Our findings indicate that children living near banana and plantain plantations are exposed to pesticides that may affect their neurodevelopment, which for certain domains may differ between boys and girls. We recommend the implementation of measures to reduce pesticide exposure in children living nearby banana plantations. "
336,28634695,"Assessment of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is vital in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF). The early diastolic intraventricular pressure gradient (IVPG) in the LV plays an important role in diastolic function. IVPG is calculated as the intraventricular pressure difference divided by the LV length, which allows to account for differences in LV size and therefore calculate IVPG in children. We aimed to investigate the mechanisms of LV diastolic dysfunction by measuring mid-to-apical IVPG as an indicator of the active suction force sucking blood from the left atrium into the LV. We included 38 rTOF patients and 101 healthy controls. The study population was stratified based on age group into children (4-9 years), adolescents (10-15 years), and adults (16-40 years). IVPGs were calculated based on mitral inflow measurements obtained using color M-mode Doppler echocardiography. Although total IVPGs did not differ between rTOF patients and controls, mid-to-apical IVPGs in adolescents and adults were smaller among rTOF patients than among controls (0.15 ± 0.05 vs. 0.21 ± 0.06 mmHg/cm, p < 0.05; 0.09 ± 0.07 vs. 0.17 ± 0.05 mmHg/cm, p < 0.001; respectively). Additionally, only mid-to-apical IVPG correlated linearly with peak circumferential strain (ρ = 0.217, p = 0.011), longitudinal strain (ρ = -0.231, p = 0.006), torsion (ρ = -0.200, p = 0.018), and untwisting rate in early diastole (ρ = -0.233, p = 0.006). In rTOF, the mechanisms underlying diastolic dysfunction involve reduced active suction force, which correlates with reduced LV deformation in all directions. "
337,37067808,"Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in children is a low-incidence, high-risk event associated with cognitive overload and potential errors producing unfavourable outcomes. Cognitive aids, such as charts, algorithms and flow diagrams, are prompts that externalise and structure mental processes to reduce cognitive load, thereby reducing errors. The Paediatric Anaesthetic Emergency Drug Solution (PAEDS) approach combines a colour-coded chart and medication box with a simplified mathematical system of volume-based dosing; the effect of which on cognitive load during a simulated RSI has not previously been described. A randomised, cross-over trial was conducted with 26 multi-disciplinary emergency medicine clinicians (doctors and nurses) allocated to four groups, performing four high-fidelity RSI simulations, two mandating the use of the PAEDS approach. This mixed methods study followed the pragmatic ontology using grounded theory methodology. Qualitative data were collected from nine individual interviews by a process of thematic analysis via an inductive approach, to allow for appropriate open and axial coding to occur. Quantitative data collected included cognitive loading using the raw NASA-Task Load Index as well as time to intubation and drug dosage details to assess for safety. Qualitative results showed that the PAEDS approach reduced cognitive loading through the use of both the labelled medication box and colour-coded medication charts. The PAEDS approach also showed improved perceived time pressure without feeling rushed, and with no recorded drug errors. Differences in the quantitative data for total cognitive load, error and time were not statistically significant, likely due to sample size. The PAEDS approach is a multifaceted system which is not inferior to current practice, with some components described as an improvement. Further research on a larger sample size needs to be conducted to assess the aspects of the PAEDS approach both collectively and independently. "
338,37123537,"This article summarizes frameworks for understanding Hispanic children's health, sources of national data available to evaluate their health, and variations in health among Hispanic children. Following ecological and life-course perspectives, we organize our review of the literature on Hispanic children's health and development according to three key stages of child development (zero to three, early to middle childhood, and adolescence to emerging adulthood) with attention to how each stage influences the next. Within each stage, we consider how social position (i.e. skin color, social class, gender, and nativity), social contexts (i.e. family, school, and neighborhood), and political and legal contexts influence Hispanic children's health and development. To improve the health and development of Hispanic children, federal, state, and local policies must address social and economic injustices that lead to declines in health across immigrant generations and persistent racial/ethnic health disparities.

340,30006436,"The development of a compounded oral liquid medication formulary and subsequent implementation of revised standard formulations in a university health system are described. A standard assessment form was developed to direct evaluation of published literature and current compounding resources for all oral liquid formulations prepared by health-system pharmacies. Specific variables reviewed included concentration, components, beyond-use dating, and storage recommendations. After their review and approval, revised formulations were typed into distinct templates that incorporated additional safety features. An online departmental repository was developed to house the revised formulations. Modifications were made to 136 (78%) of the 175 compounded formulations reviewed. Changes in storage conditions and extension of beyond-use dating were the most common revisions in 77 (44%) and 42 (24%) of compounds, respectively. In addition, strawberry syrup was removed as a component of 38 (22%) formulations, reducing exposure of pediatric patients to red dye. Presentations were given at several forums to inform pharmacy staff of the goals of the project and details regarding implementation. In addition, e-mail communications were sent to share the online location of the updated formulations and compounding sheets. Nursing, medical, and pharmacy staff were notified of concentration changes through the pharmacy newsletter and e-mail. A comprehensive review resulted in updates to over 75% of oral liquid medications prepared by pharmacies in a university health system. Revised formulations were made available through an online repository, ensuring consistency of compounding procedures with respect to concentrations, components, and storage requirements. "
341,34674815,"Longitudinal follow-up, resource utilization, and health disparities are top congenital heart research and care priorities. Medicaid claims include longitudinal data on inpatient, outpatient, emergency, pharmacy, rehabilitation, home health utilization, and social determinants of health-including mother-infant pairs. The New York Congenital Heart Surgeons Collaborative for Longitudinal Outcomes and Utilization of Resources linked robust clinical details from locally held state and national registries from 10 of 11 New York congenital heart centers to Medicaid claims, building a novel, statewide mechanism for longitudinal assessment of outcomes, expenditures, and health inequities. The authors included all children <18 years of age undergoing cardiac surgery in The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database or the New York State Pediatric Congenital Cardiac Surgery Registry from 10 of 11 New York centers, 2006 to 2019. Data were linked via iterative, ranked deterministic matching on direct identifiers. Match rates were calculated and compared. Proportions of the linked cohort trackable over 3, 5, and 10 years were described. Of 14,097 registry cases, 59% (n = 8,322) reported Medicaid use. Of these, 7,414 were linked to New York claims, at an 89% match rate. Of matched cases, the authors tracked 79%, 74%, and 65% of children over 3, 5, and 10 years when requiring near-continuous Medicaid enrollment. Allowing more lenient enrollment criteria, the authors tracked 86%, 82%, and 76%, respectively. Mortality over this time was 7.7%, 8.4%, and 10.0%, respectively. Manual validation revealed ∼100% true matches. This establishes a novel statewide data resource for assessment of longitudinal outcome, health expenditure, and disparities for children with congenital heart disease. "
342,18294820,"The pathophysiology of pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) impacts both affective and cognitive brain systems. Understanding disturbances in the neural circuits subserving these abilities is critical for characterizing developmental aberrations associated with the disorder and developing improved treatments. Our objective is to use functional neuroimaging with pediatric bipolar disorder patients employing a task that probes the functional integrity of attentional control and affect processing. Ten euthymic unmedicated pediatric bipolar patients and healthy controls matched for age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, and IQ were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging. In a pediatric color word matching paradigm, subjects were asked to match the color of a word with one of two colored circles below. Words had a positive, negative or neutral emotional valence, and were presented in 30-s blocks. In the negative affect condition, relative to the neutral condition, patients with bipolar disorder demonstrated greater activation of bilateral pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and left amygdala, and less activation in right rostral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dorsolateral PFC at the junction of the middle frontal and inferior frontal gyri. In the positive affect condition, there was no reduced activation of PFC or increased amygdala activation. The pattern of reduced activation of ventrolateral PFC and greater amygdala activation in bipolar children in response to negative stimuli suggests both disinhibition of emotional reactivity in the limbic system and reduced function in PFC systems that regulate those responses. Higher cortical cognitive areas such as the dorsolateral PFC may also be adversely affected by exaggerated emotional responsivity to negative emotions. This pattern of functional alteration in affective and cognitive circuitry may contribute to the reduced capacity for affect regulation and behavioral self-control in pediatric bipolar disorder. "
343,20052808,"During the South African/Anglo-Boer War(1899-1902), the British established concentration camps in retaliation to Boer guerilla fighters. Thousands of Boer women and children and thousands of blacks and ""coloured"" people were interned within these camps. The conditions in the camps were unsanitary and led to the death by disease,mostly respiratory illnesses, of many of the inmates. There were outcries in Britain over the camps among Liberal members of Parliament and social reformers such as Emily Hobhouse. In response to this, the Secretary of War sent an all ladies commission to South Africa. Their final report cited unsanitary conditions and insufficient camp administration as contributing factors to the high death rates.Among their recommendations was to increase the nursing staff. The Colonial Nursing Association provided nurses for these jobs. This article uses a previously unused archival source, the case notes of the medical advisor to the Colonial Office. In 1901-1902, he examined a group of nurses going out to work in the concentration camps of South Africa. This article presents the results of the examinations of 89 nurses, three of whom were rejected, and places them in the context of medical concerns at the time. "
344,17161186,"There are various treatment strategies for gastroesophageal varices in children. We studied the therapeutic value of endoscopic variceal clipping (EVC) and ligation (EVL). Four hundred ninety-nine endoscopic examinations performed between 1991 and 2005 were retrospectively analyzed. F2 and F3 varices with red color signs on follow-up endoscopy were treated with prophylactic EVC. In variceal rupture cases, EVC and EVL were used in combination. Eighty-two prophylactic EVCs were done, and variceal progression was prevented in 89.9%. However, some patients had persistent red color signs and required frequent EVC. Ten emergent procedures were done for variceal rupture, and, in 4 cases, EVL was used to arrest massive variceal bleeding. Five patients developed bleeding during follow-up cause by rupture of gastric fundal varices, which probably had been aggravated by prior treatment for esophageal varices. The control of gastroesophageal varices by routine EVC was satisfactory. However, ruptures during follow-up suggested the importance of controlling gastric fundal varices. Endoscopic variceal ligation is a simple, effective, and safe treatment tool, particularly for ruptured varices. However, it is difficult to treat gastric fundal varices with EVL; this disadvantage of EVL can be overcome by the concomitant use of EVC. "
345,36576919,"Food insecurity impacts childhood nutritional status, physical and cognitive development, and increases lifetime risk for chronic disease. Previous South African studies have examined hunger at the sub-national level without a specific focus on children and adolescents. This study determines the national prevalence of childhood food insecurity, from birth to adolescence, and identifies factors associated with hunger within the household. Individual and household-level data were extracted from the South African National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (SANHANES-1). Prevalence of food insecurity was assessed using the Community Childhood Hunger Identification Project (CCHIP) index. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted on all households (with and without children) to determine the predictors of food insecurity, with additional analyses adjusting for child dependency and sociodemographic characteristics of household heads in households with children. Of 5 098 households surveyed, 68.6% had children and adolescents present (0-19 years). Of these households, 32.5% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 29.5-35.7) were experiencing hunger and 26.3% (95% CI: 23.9-28.8) were at risk of hunger. Among all the households, significant associations for experiencing hunger were the presence of children and adolescents: Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 1.68 (95% CI: 1.12-2.53); being female-headed: AOR = 1.53 (95% CI: 1.21-1.94) and informally-located; AOR = 1.6 (95% CI: 1.07-2.43). Of the racial groups, having a non-African household head, Coloured: AOR = 0.29 (95% CI: 0.19-0.44) and White/Indian/Asian: AOR = 0.12 (95% CI: 0.04-0.33) conferred lower odds of experiencing hunger; and, the household head having secondary/tertiary education conferred lower odds of experiencing hunger; AOR = 0.40 (95% CI: 0.28-0.56) as well as being at risk of hunger; AOR = 0.69 (95% CI: 0.52-0.92). Receiving social grants, pensions, or remittances more than doubled the odds of experiencing hunger; AOR = 2.15 (95% CI: 1.49-3.09). After adjusting for child dependency in households with children, having at least one older child (age 15-19 years old) did not change the odds of food insecurity. In summary, only 41% of South African households with children and adolescents were food secure. The associations between household head sociodemographics, household location and size on household food insecurity indicate a need for multi-sectoral interventions to bolster sustainable food systems for households with children and adolescents and to improve public protections for female-headed, African-headed and informally-located households dependent on social grants.

346,23929254,"The efficacy and safety of beta-blockers versus corticosteroids in the treatment of infantile hemangiomas (IHs) is controversial. This study aimed to summarize evidence described in the literature and to assess the quality of studies involving beta-blockers and corticosteroids for the treatment of cutaneous IHs. Comparative studies were collected from 15 online electronic databases, including OVID Medline, PubMed, ISI Web of Science, CENTRAL, CNKI, ChiCTR, JPCTR, CTRIndia, IranCTR, SLCTR, ISRCTRN, NLCTR, GCTR, ANCTR, ClinicalTrial. gov, and associated references. Studies without a control group were excluded, and the remaining studies were assessed by two reviewers independently using the Downs & Black scale for reported quality. The main areas assessed in the included studies were volume changes, overall improvement in appearance, eye function, and adverse events. Ten comparative studies were included with a total of 419 children. A meta-analysis was not performed due to the considerable heterogeneity across studies. Some evidence showed that beta-blockers are superior to steroids in reducing volume and improving the overall appearance of IHs, such as lightening of the color and flattening of the surface. Conclusions regarding improved eye function and adverse events were divided, and no consensus has been reached on the superiority of one treatment over another. No episodes of severe-onset asthma, hypotension, or bradycardia occurred in the beta-blocker treatment due to the rigorous exclusion of patients with contraindications. Available studies indicate that beta-blockers are an alternative option to corticosteroids for IH treatment with respect to volume shrinkage and improvement in appearance. No evidence has shown a significant difference in improved eye function and adverse events between beta-blockers and corticosteroids in the treatment of IH; indeed, there is a lack of well-designed, high-quality randomized control trials.

347,20711120,"The aim of the present study was to identify some factors related to the occurrence of dental trauma in mixed and permanent dentition. Over a period of two months 1325, 6 to 18 year olds from three primary schools in Valencia were examined. Data was collected through clinical examinations and interviews and their Dental trauma was classified according to IADT's criteria. The prevalence of dental injuries was 6%; boys aged between 12-18 years old experienced more injuries than girls. There was a statistical difference between the types of fractures. Non complicated coronal fractures were the most frequent (9.18%). Games were the main cause of trauma (40%) in both sexes. In 14.3% of patients a dental colour change was observed. Angle's class I was the most frequent in traumatized injured children (41.2%). The present study revealed a relatively low prevalence of dental trauma, but this figure still represents a large number of children. Therefore, educational programs are to be initiated for the community regarding causes , prevention and treatments of traumatic dental injuries. "
348,12695158,"To develop an objective method of nailfold capillaroscopy (NFC), applicable to a wide age range of paediatric patients. To compare the morphological characteristics of the nailfold capillaries in different rheumatology patient groups and controls. A colour digital video camera attached to a stereomicroscope was used to capture nailfold capillary images. Computerised image processing was used to analyse and store data. Subsequent quantitative and qualitative morphological analysis was performed in the following paediatric patient and control groups: 18 children with connective tissue diseases (CTD: juvenile dermatomyositis, systemic sclerosis, and undifferentiated connective tissue disease), eight with systemic lupus erythematosus, nine with primary Raynaud's disease, three with primary vasculitis, 15 with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 17 healthy children and 20 healthy adults. Images were analysed by a single assessor who was unaware of the patient details. The NFC technique was simple to perform and gave reproducible results, although some intra- and intersubject variation was noted. Capillary density and width was age related, with younger children having fewer and wider capillaries than older children and adults. Linear capillary density was significantly higher in healthy adults (mean (SD) 8.6 (1.6) capillaries/mm) compared with healthy children (HC 6.9 (0.9) capillaries/mm). The group with CTD had the most abnormal findings, with lower linear density (4.9 (1.7) capillaries/mm) and increased capillary loop width (10.7 (7.3) mm) compared with HC (3.5 (1.7) mm). In addition, 11/18 (61%) patients in the CTD group had more than two definitely abnormal capillaries in at least two nailfolds, an abnormality not seen in other subjects. Two qualitative measures, the degree of avascularity and general disarrangement of capillary pattern, were more commonly observed in the CTD group than in HC. The proportion of tortuous capillaries did not differ significantly between study groups. This study is unique in measuring objective quantitative and qualitative parameters of the nailfold vasculature across a wide spectrum of age and disease. Differences in capillary morphology and frequency in children with CTD compared with other paediatric diseases and healthy controls were demonstrated. In the clinical situation, an assessment of the general degree of disarrangement may offer a fast tool for assessment of the nailfold vasculature which correlates well with NFC data. "
349,27918000,"There are certain disorders of hyper- and hypopigmentation that are more common in children with skin of color. It is imperative that practitioners can swiftly and accurately diagnose these pigmentary disorders to prevent delay in treatment and enhance quality of life. Pigmentary disorders have many etiologies and may present similarly in the clinical setting; however treatment varies widely and is dependent on accurate diagnosis. Herein, we present a review of common disorders of hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation in children with skin of color. We aim to provide physicians with information that can enhance clinical detection of common pigmentary disorders in this vulnerable population. "

351,9442814,"The aim of this study was to investigate the morphological alterations of labial salivary glands in children with type I diabetes. For this purpose labial salivary glands under local anesthesia were excised from the lower lip of ten diabetic children at the onset of diabetes (mean age, 10 years). Additionally ten similar biopsies were obtained from ten healthy children (mean age, 9 years). The tissues were conventionally processed and embedded in paraffin wax. The first section was stained with hematoxylin/eosin, while two additional sections were stained immunohistochemically using the indirect immunoperoxidase avidin-biotin method to detect T and B lymphocytes. The results showed that a mononuclear infiltration was apparent in all diabetic children. Lymphocytes were particularly seen around various ducts. In contrast, the salivary glands of healthy controls were free of infiltrates. The immunohistochemical analysis showed that the majority of these cells were T cells. B cells were found to a lesser extent. These findings indicate that a destruction of labial salivary glands takes place in type I diabetes. This phenomenon is T-cell mediated. The similarity of this condition with the insulitis suggests that labial salivary glands and pancreas may share a common antigen that might be the target of the autoimmune process in type I diabetes.

352,25603627,"The aim of the present study was to compare the success and complication rates of pediatric renal biopsy procedures between the angled tangential approach and the traditional approach. From 2004 to 2009 we prospectively enrolled pediatric patients who had undergone real time ultrasound guided renal biopsy with angled tangential approach. For comparison, we retrospectively reviewed pediatric patients who had undergone traditional renal biopsy between 2002 and 2004. Adequacy of renal tissue histopathological samples and the complication rates were compared between groups. One hundred twenty-eight patients underwent traditional renal biopsy (Group A) while 166 patients underwent biopsy performed with angled tangential approach (Group B).The rate of inadequate material was higher in Group A compared to Group B (6.3% vs. 0.6%, p = 0.006). In four cases (three in Group A and one in Group B) renal biopsies revealed normal renal tissue. While a major complication (hemoperitoneum requiring transfusion) occurred in one case in Group A, no major complications were seen in Group B. Compared with the traditional technique, the angled tangential approach resulted in a higher adequate material rate and lower complication rate.These findings indicate that angled tangential approach could be considered for pediatric percutaneous renal biopsies.

355,7676899,"Visual functions including color vision and spectral sensitivity were investigated in 18 of 36 patients and in 2 persons with normal visual acuity in 8 families with dominantly inherited juvenile optic atrophy. Seven of the 8 families had at least one member who showed mainly acquired blue-yellow color vision deficiency. However, only 4 patients showed typical blue-yellow color vision deficiency, which suggested nonspecific characteristics of color vision deficiency in optic neural diseases. One family showed mainly acquired red-green color vision deficiency. Spectral sensitivity functions measured in 5 patients of 3 families showed sensitivity loss in the middle and long wavelength range as well as markedly decreased sensitivity in the short wavelength range. Decrease in spectral sensitivity in the short wavelength range or minimal blue-yellow color vision defect in a subject's brothers with normal visual acuity is interesting, but further study is needed because blue sensitivity decreases easily in various conditions.

356,9046647,"Forty-seven Korean patients with port-wine stains were treated with a copper vapour laser and clinical responses were assessed at three months after the last treatment by comparing photographs taken before each treatment. The immediate histologic changes within 15 min after laser treatment were also observed by routine H&E and nitroblue tetrazolium chloride staining. When we treated port-wine stains with minimal whitening doses of 6-8 J/cm2, no or slight colour changes were obtained. Thus, all port-wine stain lesions in this study were treated with non-specific energy densities ranging from 10-20 J/cm2. Good to excellent results were obtained in 18 (38.2%) of 47 Korean patients with port-wine stains. Repeated treatment can continue to reduce colour. Darker lesions (purple or red) are more likely to result in a marked colour change. At above threshold dose, there was wedge-shaped diffuse coagulation necrosis and loss of viability of the epidermis and underlying dermis. Even though copper vapour laser treatment of port-wine stains in brown skin is not as selective as in white skin because of epidermal melanin, our clinical data demonstrate the usefulness of the copper vapour laser for the treatment of port-wine stains in brown skin.

357,23302009,"Subungual haemorrhages are characterized by well-circumscribed dots or blotches with a red to red-black pigmentation, but some cases can be difficult to distinguish from subungual melanoma by the naked eye alone. Dermoscopy has proven to be a useful, noninvasive tool in the diagnosis of pigmented lesions in the nail; however, few dermoscopic studies of subungual haemorrhages have been reported. To investigate characteristic dermoscopic patterns of subungual haemorrhages, and to find distinctive features that can differentiate them from nail-unit melanomas. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of either subungual haemorrhage or nail-unit melanoma at a tertiary university hospital were included in the study. Clinical features and dermoscopic patterns were evaluated. Sixty-four patients with a total of 90 lesions of subungual haemorrhage were enrolled in the study. The majority of cases (84%) showed combinations of more than one colour, while 16% had only one colour. The most common colour of the subungual haemorrhages was purple-black, in 37% of cases. A homogeneous pattern was observed in 92% of cases, globular patterns in 42% and streaks in 39%. Peripheral fading and periungual haemorrhages were found in 54% and 22% of cases, respectively. Destruction or dystrophy of the nail plate was observed in 16% of cases. In the 16 cases of nail-unit melanomas, Hutchinson sign, longitudinal irregular bands or lines, triangular shape of bands, vascular pattern, and ulcerations were found in 100%, 81%, 25%, 6% and 81% of cases, respectively. In contrast, these features were not found in subungual haemorrhages. Dermoscopy provides valuable information for the diagnosis of subungual haemorrhage and aids in the differential diagnosis from nail-unit melanoma. "

The aim of this study was to investigate associations between executive functions (EF), anemia, and iron deficiency. A total of 688 children > 6 years of age enrolled in the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) study who underwent evaluation for EF were included. Hemoglobin (Hgb) was characterized as low (1 Anemia was present in 41% of children, and median Hgb was 11.8 gm/dl. New onset anemia was associated with lower digit span total score (- 0.75, 95% CI - 1.36, - 0.15, p = 0.01). Persistent anemia was associated with lower scores on color-word inhibition/switching (β =  - 0.98; 95% CI - 1.78, - 0.18, p = 0.02). Errors of omission were significantly higher (worse) in those with persistent anemia (β = 2.67, 95% CI 0.18, 5.17, p = 0.04).

360,32343109,"To describe implementation and early evaluation of using quantitative electroencephalography for electrographic seizure detection by PICU clinician staff. Prospective observational study of electrographic seizure detection by PICU clinicians in patients monitored with quantitative electroencephalography. Quantitative electroencephalography program implementation included a continuous education and training package. Continuous quantitative electroencephalography monitoring consisted of two-channel amplitude-integrated electroencephalography, color density spectral array, and raw-electroencephalography. PICU. Children less than 18 years old admitted to the PICU during the 14-month study period and deemed at risk of electrographic seizure. None. Real time electrographic seizure detection by a PICU team was analyzed for diagnostic accuracy and promptness, against electrographic seizure identification by a trained neurophysiologist, retrospectively reading the same quantitative electroencephalography and blinded to patient details. One-hundred one of 1,510 consecutive admissions (6.7%) during the study period underwent quantitative electroencephalography monitoring. Status epilepticus (35%) and suspected hypoxic-ischemic injury (32%) were the most common indications for quantitative electroencephalography. Electrographic seizure was diagnosed by the neurophysiologist in 12% (n = 12) of the cohort. PICU clinicians correctly diagnosed all 12 patients (100% sensitivity and negative predictive value). An additional eleven patients had a false-positive diagnosis of electrographic seizure (false-positive rate = 52% [31-73%]) leading to a specificity of 88% (79-94%). Median time to detect seizures was 25 minutes (5-218 min). Delayed recognition of electrographic seizure (> 1 hr from onset) occurred in five patients (5/12, 42%). Early evaluation of quantitative electroencephalography program to detect electrographic seizure by PICU clinicians suggested good sensitivity for electrographic seizure detection. However, the high false-positive rate is a challenge. Ongoing work is needed to reduce the false positive diagnoses and avoid electrographic seizure detection delays. A comprehensive training program and regular refresher updates for clinical staff are key components of the program. "

362,2063764,"Previous studies have indicated that the definitive diagnosis of anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary trunk (ALC) should be made by cardiac catheterization and angiography. This study evaluates echocardiography (two-dimensional, pulsed Doppler, and color flow mapping) as a method to establish the diagnosis of ALC. To diagnose ALC, a modified parasternal short-axis view was used to demonstrate continuity of the ALC with the pulmonary trunk and to detect the retrograde flow through the ALC into the pulmonary trunk. Absence of these imaging characteristics ruled out ALC. From June 1985 to January 1990, 16 patients who presented with or had previously had a dilated poorly contracting left ventricle were prospectively assessed by echocardiography to rule out ALC. Four patients had ALC (age 2 to 120 months, mean +/- 1SD = 32 +/- 59) and 12 patients (age 1 to 192 months, mean +/- 1SD = 57 +/- 80) had myocardiopathy. Two other patients with known ALC were evaluated by an observer unaware of the diagnosis. All coronary anatomy was confirmed by angiography, surgery, or autopsy. The correct diagnosis of coronary anatomy was obtained by echocardiography in all instances without false positive or false negative diagnosis of ALC. Three infants underwent surgical repair of ALC based only on the echocardiographic diagnosis. Echocardiography can be used to establish the diagnosis of ALC. Therefore surgical repair can be undertaken in some critically sick infants based on the echocardiographic diagnosis alone. "
363,23800185,"Visual clinical methods of skin color evaluation for diagnostic purposes are so far mostly subjective and thus inaccurate. We present a modified method of melanin amount measurement based on diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). This method is non-invasive and objective, and allows easy quantification and comparison of melanin levels. Skin pigmentation was measured by DRS method in 0-18 year old patients at the Department of Pediatric Dermatovenerology, School of Medicine Comenius University Bratislava. Patients were treated for their vitiligo by Balneo PUVA treatment twice weekly. Each patient had measured his remittance spectra from the treated vitiliginous skin before the treatment was started, after 10 irradiations of Balneo PUVA and at the end of the treatment after 25 irradiations of Balneo PUVA. In our study as a reference skin for spectroscopic assessment of melanin in vivo was used the averaged remittance spectra (measured on the inner arm) from the sample of 10 albino patients. The remittance spectra obtained from the vitiligo patients were ratioed against the newly described remittance reference albino skin. We exploited the linear behavior of the spectral curve in the 620-720 nm interval (significant for melanin absorption) and used the slope of the regression line to compute the quantification index α. By clinical examination before the Balneo PUVA therapy, after the 10th dose of Balneo PUVA therapy as well as at the end of the complete course of Balneo PUVA therapy (after 25 irradiations) we recorded a marked increase of pigmentation in all treated patients for their vitiligo. In each patient the values of melanin quantification angle α were calculated. Statistically we found a significant difference between the melanin quantification angle α in vitiliginous skin before, during the 10th dose of treatment and after the treatment. Similar significant difference was also observed between treated and non-involved skin. We could confirm a clear association between clinical visual examination of treated vitiligo lesions, objective data collected by DRS and melanin quantification angle α. By using a new standard for the reference skin (albino skin) we could more exactly compare melanin levels in different subjects. Our proposed melanin quantification angle α expresses the extent of the difference in melanin levels between the examined skin lesions. We successfully used this index to quantify the variations of melanin (progress of repigmentation) throughout different stages of treatment of the same lesion and also to objectively evaluate the final effect of the therapy. In the present study, we showed that the diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) may be suitable method to measure skin colour and the content of human skin melanin in vivo. "
364,10146329,"Congenital pulmonary valve disease is often not discovered until adolescence or adulthood. Transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography can provide detailed information regarding right ventricular outflow anatomy, although images are often less satisfactory than those obtained in infants and children. The more recent addition of biplanar transesophageal echocardiography has enhanced our ability to image the right ventricular outflow tract, pulmonary valve, and pulmonary artery noninvasively. Pulsed and continuous-wave Doppler estimates of subvalvular and transvalvular gradients have proved to be accurate. Doppler color flow mapping has proved useful in determining the location and direction of stenotic and regurgitant flow. With no accepted standard for comparison, quantification of regurgitation remains problematic. In many cases, echocardiography has replaced catheterization and angiography in the evaluation and long-term follow-up of congenital pulmonary valve disease before and after intervention. "
365,36240512,"To report on the early detection of congenital heart disease (CHD) in low- and high-risk populations managed at our hospital; and perform a detailed analysis of false-negative diagnoses, in order to derive possible recommendations on how to reduce their incidence. This was a retrospective observational study analyzing cases which underwent an ultrasound examination at the end of the first trimester at the Fetal Medicine and Surgery Unit of Gaslini Children's Hospital, Genoa, Italy, in the period January 2015 to December 2021. The study population included both low-risk pregnancies that underwent standard first-trimester combined screening and high-risk ones referred to our unit because of a positive combined test or suspicion of fetal anomalies raised in a regional community hospital. For each case, the following variables were retrieved and analyzed: number of fetuses, maternal body mass index, gestational age at first-trimester screening, whether the pregnancy was low or high risk, nuchal translucency thickness (normal or > 99 Gestational age at ultrasound ranged from 12 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks (crown-rump length (CRL), 50.1-84.0 mm) in the low-risk group and from 11 + 5 to 13 + 6 weeks (CRL, 45.1-84.0 mm) in the high-risk group. Over the 7-year study period, 7080 pregnancies were evaluated in the first trimester. Of these, 6879 (7167 fetuses) were low-risk and 201 were high-risk cases. In the low-risk group, there were 30 fetuses with CHD (including 15 major and 15 minor CHD), yielding a prevalence of 4.2/1000 (2.1/1000 for major CHD). Nine of the 30 CHD cases were suspected at screening ultrasound (7/15 major CHD). Excluding cases in which the CHD would not be expected to be associated with a modification of the screening views and would therefore not be detectable on screening ultrasound, 7/12 cases of major CHD were detected, corresponding to a sensitivity of 58.3%. Among the 201 high-risk cases, there were 46 fetuses with CHD (including 44 major and two minor CHD), of which 43 were detected, corresponding to a sensitivity for early fetal echocardiography of 93.5%, or 97.7% if the two cases that were unlikely to be detectable on first-trimester screening were excluded. Analysis of the 11 (of 24) false-negative cases that would be expected to be picked up on screening views revealed that human error (image interpretation and/or scanning approach) was involved in all 11 cases and technical factors (excessive color priority (color-balance function) and/or incorrect plane alignment) were present in two. There was impairment of the acoustic window (associated with maternal obesity and/or twin gestation) as a cofactor in five of the 11 cases. The sensitivity for detection of major CHD of early cardiac screening in low-risk pregnancy is under 60%, partly due to the natural history of CHD and, it seems, partly relating to human error and technical issues with image quality. Factors associated with false-negative diagnoses may be categorized into three types: human error, technical factors and acoustic-window impairment. We recommend: appropriate assessment with fetal posterior spine; that sufficient time is spent on assessment of the fetal situs; and that color/power Doppler settings are adapted to the individual case. A lower threshold for referring doubtful cases for early fetal echocardiography should be adopted in cases of maternal obesity and in twin gestation. © 2022 The Authors.

366,2692792,"We screened 236 consecutive patients aged 6 years or less using an Off-Axis photoscreener and an Otago-type photoscreener. With a masked standardized clinical assessment as the standard, an overall comparison of the results obtained with the two techniques revealed a sensitivity and specificity in the neighbourhood of 0.85 and 0.87 respectively for the Off-Axis photoscreener and 0.94 and 0.94 respectively for the Otago photoscreener. Both techniques, but especially the Off-Axis technique, were less sensitive and specific in younger children (24 months or less). Fundus colour (light or dark) did not greatly affect sensitivity or specificity. Photoscreening with the pupil dilated led to an increase in false-positive results with both techniques. Our results showed the Otago photoscreener to be superior in this clinical trial. "
367,30808770,"Ultrasound has become a useful tool in the workup of pediatric patients because of the highly convenient, cost-effective, and safe nature of the examination. With rapid advancements in anatomic and functional ultrasound techniques over the recent years, the diagnostic and interventional utility of ultrasound has risen tremendously. Advanced ultrasound techniques constitute a suite of new technologies that employ microbubbles to provide contrast and enhance flow visualization, elastography to measure tissue stiffness, ultrafast Doppler to deliver high spatiotemporal resolution of flow, three- and four-dimensional technique to generate accurate spatiotemporal representation of anatomy, and high-frequency imaging to delineate anatomic structures at a resolution down to 30 μm. Application of these techniques can enhance the diagnosis of organ injury, viable tumor, and vascular pathologies at bedside. This has significant clinical implications in pediatric patients who are not easy candidates for lengthy MRI or radiation-requiring examination, and are also in need of a highly sensitive bedside technique for therapeutic guidance. To best use the currently available, advanced ultrasound techniques for pediatric patients, it is necessary to understand the diagnostic utility of each technique. In this review, we will educate the readers of emerging ultrasound techniques and their respective clinical applications. "
368,38619154,"Layla is a 6.7-year-old girl diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-predominantly hyperactive/impulsive type-delayed adaptive skills, enuresis, unspecified malnutrition, and feeding difficulties. She presented to developmental-behavioral pediatrics (DBP) in January 2022 due to caregiver concerns for autism spectrum disorder (ASD).Layla lives in a polyamorous family with her biological mother and father, mother's partner whom Layla refers to as her uncle, and her 2 half-siblings. There is a maternal history of special education services, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, multiple sclerosis, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and ADHD. Layla's father is a veteran diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Layla's siblings, aged 5 and 9 years, have established diagnoses of ADHD, ASD, global developmental delays, behavioral concerns, and poor sleep. There is a history of adverse childhood experiences, including parental mental health, poverty, and involvement with child protective services. Acknowledgement and inclusion of all members of this diverse family structure, as well as consistent validation from the DBP and social worker, allowed a strong treatment alliance to form and the mother continued to contact the DBP clinic, even for those questions related to other specialties. A social worker received weekly calls from the mother sharing grievances related to feeling misunderstood and spoke about the assumptions she felt external providers made about her family, culture, and parenting styles. For example, she recalls the pediatrician commenting about their family structure being ""confusing for the children"" and describing their home as ""chaotic,"" assumptions that may not have been made of nuclear family structures. Behavioral therapies were a repeated recommendation, but the mother verbalized not being interested in these options as she had participated in parent management training several years earlier and felt that the strategies taught were not applicable to her unique family structure, to which the clinician replied, ""this is the standard recommendation for all children this age with disruptive behaviors."" Although the mother was initially hesitant to trial medications, she eventually agreed that Layla's symptoms were negatively affecting her school performance, and the DBP initiated a stimulant medication.Layla's initial evaluation included a developmental history, behavioral observations, and standardized testing. The results from developmental testing demonstrated age equivalents between 4 and 6 years across gross motor, adaptive, visual motor, and speech-language domains.On observation, Layla was extremely active. During the visit, she walked over to her mother, made eye contact, and showed her the picture that she had drawn. She engaged in imaginary play, reciprocal conversation, and responded to social bids. The mother felt strongly that Layla had ASD and reported symptoms such as motor stereotypies (hand flapping), covering ears with certain noises/sounds, and rigidity when it came to things being a certain way or a certain color. These behaviors did not occur in the initial or subsequent clinic visits with DBP, her general pediatrician, or during other outside evaluations the mother pursued. The DBP felt strongly that Layla was mimicking her siblings' symptoms and provided ongoing education regarding ADHD symptomology.In terms of behavior management, the mother did not attempt to redirect Layla's behaviors during the initial clinic visit and in subsequent visits, and both adult men yelled loudly, clapped, and hit their hands on the table as a form of redirection. The mother continued to voice her diagnostic disagreement with the DBP and the pediatrician and insisted that Layla met the criteria for ASD. When the mother reviewed the report, a statement insinuating that Layla's behaviors were ""understandable given parental inconsistency and complicated family structure"" upset her.What factors would you consider when thinking about caregiver disagreement with the diagnosis and treatment plan? Does diagnostic overshadowing apply here? "
369,14506123,"Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common problems in pediatrics. An accurate diagnosis of AOM can guide proper treatment and follow-up. To systematically review the literature regarding precision and accuracy of history taking and physical examination in diagnosing AOM in children. We searched MEDLINE for English-language articles published from 1966 through May 2002. Bibliographies of retrieved articles and textbooks were also searched. We located studies with original data on the precision or accuracy of history or physical examination for AOM in children. Of 397 references initially identified, 6 met inclusion criteria for analysis. Two authors independently reviewed and abstracted data to calculate likelihood ratios (LRs) for symptoms and signs. Four studies of symptoms used clinical diagnosis as the criterion standard and were limited by incorporation bias. Ear pain is the most useful symptom (positive LRs, 3.0-7.3); fever, upper respiratory tract symptoms, and irritability are less useful. One study of clinical signs used tympanocentesis as the criterion standard, and we adjusted the results to correct for verification bias. A cloudy (adjusted LR, 34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 28-42), bulging (adjusted LR, 51; 95% CI, 36-73), or distinctly immobile (adjusted LR, 31; 95% CI, 26-37) tympanic membrane on pneumatic otoscopy are the most useful signs for detecting AOM. A distinctly red tympanic membrane is also helpful (adjusted LR, 8.4; 95% CI, 6.7-11) whereas a normal color makes AOM much less likely (adjusted LR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.19-0.21). Although many of the studies included in this analysis are limited by bias, a cloudy, bulging, or clearly immobile tympanic membrane is most helpful for detecting AOM. The degree of erythema may also be useful since a normal color makes otitis media unlikely whereas a distinctly red tympanic membrane increases the likelihood significantly. "
370,33334921,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on the health of people globally. Yet, not all people are being affected by this crisis equally. In the United States, this pandemic has exacerbated long-standing inequities and entrenched structural racism. At the onset of the crisis, few data were available detailing the demographic characteristics of individuals with COVID-19. However, as data emerged, it became apparent that communities of color were disproportionately affected. To illustrate these inequities, we analyzed publicly available race and ethnicity data on COVID-19 cases and deaths and were one of the first groups to compile these findings. We launched a social media campaign to highlight these racial and ethnic inequities and raise awareness among public and elected officials. Given the tremendous amount of missing data, we demanded transparency in state reporting of race and ethnicity data. Using both messaging and mapping tools, we publicized state and city efforts to address these inequities, focusing on the creation of task forces tackling the racial inequities of COVID-19. As racial and ethnic data on COVID-19 cases and mortality became more widely reported, statistics emerged about the downstream effects of these inequities. Despite initial false reassurance that COVID-19 largely spared children, the pandemic has exacerbated many social needs, leading to significant negative impacts on children. For example, as pediatricians, we saw how worsening food insecurity was affecting children. Using social media and infographics, we launched an additional stage of the campaign to illustrate these inequities and highlight advocacy opportunities. "
371,28670817,"To evaluate oral health conditions in pediatric liver transplant recipients, with special focus on caries, green staining of the teeth, gingival bleeding, and gingival overgrowth. 40 patients (mean age 11.6 years) were examined at a routine follow-up visit, 6 months to 16 years after liver transplantation at the Swiss Center for Liver Disease in Children. After the medical examination, participants were further examined for the presence of dental caries, periodontal disease, GE, and GTC. The mean decay, missing, and filled teeth (dmft/DMFT) score was 3.8. 45% of the participants presented at least one carious lesion. Two-third of the participants had more than 20% of sites with the presence of plaque and gingival inflammation. Signs of GE were found in 18% and GTC in 30% of the participants. A positive correlation was identified between GTC and peak serum bilirubin (P<.001) and primary diagnosis of cholestatic disease (P=.04). Gingival inflammation was associated with plaque (P<.001), use of immunosuppressive medication (P=.04), and was more pronounced in children with cholestatic disease (P=.007). Children and young adults with liver transplants presented a rather poor oral health status. Liver transplant physicians should counsel patients for regular dental follow-up in order to avoid serious dental infections. "
372,35196603,"Decades of research have documented elevated rates of psychopathology among individuals affected by poverty. However, many studies have relied on predominately White samples, and on brief symptom screening measures which may not fully capture the experiences of individuals of color (who are disproportionately affected by poverty in the United States.) The present study examines prevalence rates of probable major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use disorder, and alcohol use disorder in a predominately Black sample that grew up in urban poverty, utilizing structured neuropsychiatric interview methods. Data are drawn from a subsample of the Chicago Longitudinal Study (CLS), which has followed a large cohort for over four decades. Outcomes were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) 7.0.2. Results indicate high probable rates of all measured outcomes, with notably high rates of substance use and alcohol use disorder compared to rates reported in previous national studies. Differences by sex and childhood neighborhood poverty, as well as significant comorbidity among psychiatric, substance and alcohol use disorders were also detected. Findings underscore an urgent need for community-based, culturally tailored prevention and intervention initiatives to support the mental health of individuals living in poverty. The high prevalence of psychiatric, substance and alcohol use disorders in this study likely reflect systematic inequities faced by low-income people of color in the United States. Future directions for research and practice are discussed. "
373,3834871,"The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of incorporating sweet lupine flour (SLF) to bread, upon the organoleptic characteristics and acceptability of the product. The substitution levels were 3, 6, 9 and 12%. The sensory evaluation test was done by 25 trained judges using the hedonic scaling method (9 to 1 scoring). Internal and external characteristics of appearance, color, aroma, texture, bitterness and flavor, as well as general acceptability, were measured. Sensory evaluation results of the external characteristics were significant at the 9 and 12% SLF levels for color (p less than 0.05) while the other parameters did not show significant differences. In regard to the internal characteristics, a significant difference for color was found at the 3% level of SLF (p less than 0.05); and at 6, 9 and 12% SLF levels, for appearance (p less than 0.05). The general acceptability was good at all the levels tested, with no significant differences among them. An acceptability study at the consumer level for 9% lupine flour bread was carried out in a group of 90 girls, aged 10-12 years, during a 10-day period. The results showed a very good acceptability of the product (p less than 0.01). The results of this study indicate that the incorporation of 6% SLF to the bread, did not affect adversely its sensory properties. Moreover, the acceptability of bread containing up to 12% SLF was excellent. "
374,15661262,"In this study, 107 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were analysed for the presence of hyperdiploidy by cytogenetics and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation (I-FISH). Structural aberrations in hyperdiploid cells were investigated by multiple colour FISH (mFISH). Clones with high hyperdiploidy (>50 chromosomes) (HeH) were found in 46 patients (43%). In nine of these (20%), the abnormal clone was present in <20% of the total cell population. There was no significant difference in EFS between those patients with HeH in 2.5-20% or >20% of cells. Structural rearrangements in the HeH clone were found in 10 patients (22%). In this study, HeH karyotypes containing structural aberrations were an indication of a poor prognosis in childhood ALL. "
375,16327476,"Granuloma annulare is a dermatologic condition of unknown etiology. It most frequently presents on the extremities and trunk as skin-colored nodules arranged in an annular pattern. The lesions are usually asymptomatic and resolve spontaneously. Granuloma annulare is more common in females than males. Subcutaneous granuloma annulare is a subtype of granuloma annulare that affects children. It rarely occurs on the face and scalp and is extremely rare in the periocular region. Subcutaneous granuloma annulare is often misdiagnosed because it is not included in the differential diagnosis. Due to the rarity of facial presentation of granuloma annulare, we present a case of subcutaneous granuloma annulare of the eyelids and scalp in a 4-year-old child. "
376,9676169,"To determine the appropriate indications and timing for surgery in children with either a perimembranous or a subarterial type of ventricular septal defect (VSD) associated with aortic cusp prolapse. Retrospective review of children with VSD and associated aortic cusp prolapse with or without aortic regurgitation. This review was based on data obtained from clinical findings, two-dimensional echocardiography, cardiac catheterization and angiocardiography. Tertiary health care facility with two-dimensional and colour Doppler echocardiographic and cardiac surgery facilities, and a catheterization laboratory. Forty-eight patients were found to have perimembranous or subarterial VSDs in association with aortic cusp prolapse with or without aortic regurgitation. All 48 patients had high resolution two-dimensional and colour Doppler echocardiography. Of the 19 patients who underwent surgical closure of their VSD, five also had an aortic valvuloplasty and one had an aortic valve replacement. Cardiac catheterization was performed in 16 of the 19 surgical patients and 12 of the 29 nonsurgical patients. Annual clinical and echocardiographic assessments in the nonsurgical group did not demonstrate increasing aortic insufficiency. Two children in the nonsurgical group showed spontaneous resolution of aortic insufficiency. In the surgical group, four children with VSD and clinical aortic insufficiency had surgery at less than five years of age; two were found to be regurgitant-free, one had trivial clinical aortic insufficiency and the other had echocardiography-only insufficiency. Of the seven surgical patients older than five years with VSD and clinical aortic insufficiency, four were found to be regurgitant-free, one had echocardiography-only regurgitation and two were unchanged. Two children undergoing surgery with VSD and no aortic insufficiency had postoperative echocardiography-only regurgitation, presumably related to cusp deformity from presurgical prolapse. Children with large VSDs with or without aortic cusp prolapse required surgery for indications of shunt size and pulmonary resistance. For children with small perimembranous VSDs and cusp prolapse, surgery is indicated only if there is clinical evidence of aortic regurgitation and progressive left ventricular enlargement. "
377,17989148,"Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) disorders in children have never been studied using quantified measurements and validated clinical outcome measures. The objectives of the study were to prospectively examine the relationship between malacia lesions and their respiratory illness profiles. The site of malacia lesions (eg, tracheomalacia, TBM, and bronchomalacia) were determined, measured, and related to the respective cricoid (ie, airway/cricoid ratio) using the color histogram mode technique. These children and normal control subjects were followed up for 12 months with their respiratory illness profiles determined using the Canadian Acute Respiratory Illness Scale (CARIFS) and cough diary scores. Outcome measures were respiratory illness frequency (> 12 months), severity score (day-1 CARIFS score), and significant cough interfering with daily activity (score of >or= 3) and illness resolution (time to return to a quarter of CARIFS day 1 score). The group of 116 children were composed of patients with malacia (n = 81) and control subjects (n = 35). The median age of the group was 2.1 years (age range, 0.2 to 17.3 years). The adjusted relative risk of illness frequency was 2.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 3.4), and of significant cough was 7.2 (95% CI, 1.01 to 27.22) for the malacia group while CARIFS day 1 score was 1.66 (95% CI, 1.1 to 2.56) compared to control subjects. Illness resolution rates at day 14 in the malacia group trended 25% slower than those for control subjects. Malacia type and severity of lesions were not associated with increased rates of illness or worse clinical profiles. Children with malacia have an increased likelihood of respiratory illness frequency, severity, significant cough, and tendency for delayed recovery. However, neither the site nor the severity of malacia exhibited any significant dose effect on respiratory illness profiles. "
378,11579399,"We evaluated the sonographic findings in epidermal inclusion cysts and related them to the pathologic findings. We retrospectively reviewed the sonograms and pathology specimens of 24 patients with pathologically proven epidermal inclusion cysts. We evaluated the lesions for shape, size, internal echogenicity, posterior sound enhancement, and presence of color Doppler signals. We classified the masses into 5 sonographic types according to their internal echogenicity. The relationship between the sonographic types and the pathologic findings was examined. The masses were ovoid or spherical in 17 cases (71%), lobulated in 5 (21%), and tubular in 2 (8%). The longest diameter ranged from 1 to 6 cm (mean, 3.1 cm). Twenty-three cases (96%) were associated with posterior sound enhancement. Color Doppler signals were absent in 20 cases, but some vascularity was noted in 4 ruptured epidermal cysts, in areas of granulation tissue. The most common sonographic type was a hypoechoic lesion with scattered echogenic reflectors (10 cases). Sonographic findings were related to the lamellation of keratin debris and the granulation tissue secondary to rupture. Most cases with a lobulated configuration (4 of 5) or color Doppler signals (4 of 4) were ruptured cysts. Epidermal inclusion cysts most often appeared sonographically as a hypoechoic mass containing variable echogenic foci without color Doppler signals. Ruptured epidermal cysts, however, may have lobulated contours and show color Doppler signals, mimicking a solid mass. "
379,1854592,"Two children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) were given photosensitive dye Platonin in combination with prednisolone. Analysis of clinical and laboratory data showed that Platonin was efficacious in the improvement of the clinical symptoms and the severity of inflammation, or in the maintenance of the remission state. There were no adverse side effects during long-term administration of medication. "
380,12123435,"The immature nervous system of the fetus is characterised by rapid cell growth and division and is particularly vulnerable to carcinogens and mutagens. Several epidemiological studies have reported an increased risk for childhood brain tumours (CBT) associated with exposure to N-nitroso compounds (NOC). Hair-colouring products (hair ""dyes"") that contain NOC-related aromatic amines have shown mutagenicity in vitro and carcinogenic properties in vivo. The potential public health impact of the relationship between hair dye use and carcinogenesis has prompted epidemiological research, given that a large proportion of American women have used hair dyes. A large population-based case-control study was conducted on the west coast of the USA to investigate risk factors for CBT including exposure to NOC. Eligible CBT patients (<20 years of age and diagnosed between 1984 and 1991) were identified from cancer registries in Los Angeles County, the San Francisco Bay Area in California and the Seattle area in Washington state. A total of 540 biological mothers of these children were interviewed, and 801 control subjects who were frequency matched to the CBT patients on birth year and sex were obtained using random digit dialling. Mothers were asked details about personal use of hair dyes during the index pregnancy including frequency of use, trimester of use and type of dye used. Results from age- and sex-adjusted unconditional logistic regression analyses showed no association between risk for CBT and use of hair dyes 1 month before and/or during pregnancy nor during specific trimesters. A nearly twofold increased risk for CBT was associated with single-interval use during the 1 month before pregnancy, but the confidence interval (CI) was imprecise and the estimate was not different from unity (OR = 1.9, 95% CI [0.5, 7.0]). Exclusive use of permanent dye, temporary dye or hair darkeners was not associated with risk for CBT. A twofold increased risk (OR = 2.0, 95% CI [0.83, 4.7]) was observed with exclusive use of semi-permanent dye during the month before or during pregnancy. Exclusive use of semi-permanent dye during the month before pregnancy and/or first trimester also was associated with an elevated risk for CBT, again not different from unity and with an imprecise CI (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = [0.58, 10.3]). There was no evidence of an association between risk for CBT by histological subtypes and use of hair dyes during the index pregnancy or the month before conception. Together with results from previous studies, these results provide no consistent evidence of an association between risk for CBT and use of hair dyes during pregnancy. "
381,37953072,"Non-Hispanic (NH) Black children are less likely to receive a standard treatment course for infantile epileptic spasms syndrome (IESS) than White/NH children at pediatric tertiary care epilepsy centers in the United States. However, if inequities exist in time to diagnosis is unknown. Diagnostic delays as little as 1 week can be associated with worse developmental outcomes. Diagnostic delays were evaluated in a retrospective cohort of 100 children with new onset IESS between January 2019 and May 2022. Children with Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) caregivers were more likely to experience clinically significant delays in referral from first provider to neurologist, when compared to White/NH children, even after controlling for other demographic and clinical variables (odds ratio = 4.98, confidence interval = 1.24-19.94, p = .023). Disproportionate diagnostic delays place BIPOC children at risk of adverse developmental and epilepsy outcomes. Further interventional prospective and qualitative studies are needed to address inequities in care. "
382,25188507,"ALK is an established causative oncogenic driver in neuroblastoma, and is likely to emerge as a routine biomarker in neuroblastoma diagnostics. At present, the optimal strategy for clinical diagnostic evaluation of ALK protein, genomic and hotspot mutation status is not well-studied. We evaluated ALK immunohistochemical (IHC) protein expression using three different antibodies (ALK1, 5A4 and D5F3 clones), ALK genomic status using single-color chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH), and ALK hotspot mutation status using conventional Sanger sequencing and a next-generation sequencing platform (Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (IT-PGM)), in archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded neuroblastoma samples. We found a significant difference in IHC results using the three different antibodies, with the highest percentage of positive cases seen on D5F3 immunohistochemistry. Correlation with ALK genomic and hotspot mutational status revealed that the majority of D5F3 ALK-positive cases did not possess either ALK genomic amplification or hotspot mutations. Comparison of sequencing platforms showed a perfect correlation between conventional Sanger and IT-PGM sequencing. Our findings suggest that D5F3 immunohistochemistry, single-color CISH and IT-PGM sequencing are suitable assays for evaluation of ALK status in future neuroblastoma clinical trials. "
383,17708575,"Longitudinal follow-up of children with tracheobronchomalacia is essential to improving our understanding of these disorders, yet currently, there is no such data. To longitudinally define malacia sites and quantify the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the lumen using a bronchoscopic technique and to relate these measurements to illness profiles. The validated color histogram mode technique was utilized to quantify primary malacia lesions and airway sites' CSA. Illness frequency, validated scales of illness and cough diary scores were prospectively used to assess clinical profiles. Thirty-five malacia sites were defined from the 2 studies of 21 children. CSA of 21 (60%) of the malacia lesions increased, 5 (14%) new lesions appeared, 5 (14%) decreased in size, 3 (8%) remained unchanged, and 1(3%) was indeterminate. Overall there was no statistically significant change in paired-data assessments of malacia sites' area while there was a significant increase in area of non-malacia sites. The median yearly growth rate for the malacia sites and non-malacia was 3.65 mm2/year sites and 5.38 mm2/year, respectively (P = 0.31). The type and severity of lesion was not associated with any difference in growth rates, illness frequency or clinical scores. Malacia lesions increase in size at the same rate as non-malacia sites. However malacia may worsen and new primary lesions may develop. Neither malacia type nor severity influences their growth pattern or illness profile. "
384,38394179,"This systematic review aimed to establish the extent to which each Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptom criterion is being assessed without being influenced (biased) by factors such as informant, sex/gender, and age. Measurement invariance (MI) testing using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is the prime statistical method to ascertain how these factors may affect the measurement and colour the perception or interpretation of symptom criteria. Such effects (non-invariance) can be operationalised in the form of altered association of a symptom criterion with the measured trait (expressed via variations in CFA loadings which represent the weight of each symptom criterion) due to the factor(s) and/or artificially alter the probability of endorsement of a particular symptom criterion (expressed via variations in the CFA threshold(s) representing how mild or severe a given symptom is). Based on a pre-registered protocol (CRD42022276105), we searched PubMed, Global Health, Embase and PsycInfo up to 21-02-23 for studies that included MI assessments on specific ADHD symptom criteria in individuals aged 0-18 years old, using parental and/or teacher report. Self-reports were excluded, given the poor reliability of self-report in ADHD. All included studies met specific COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) criteria. Results were synthesised in tabular form, grouping results by factors (e.g. informant) from 44 studies retained. Most comparisons indicated both metric (same loadings) and scalar invariance (same thresholds) with regard to informant, gender, age, temporal (repeated assessments) and co-morbidity. Therefore, the available evidence supports the current diagnostic criteria. However, findings could have been improved by systematic reporting of the direction of bias and its effect size. There appears to be a bias towards reporting MI instead of non-invariance. More studies in the literature are needed where the amalgamation of information provided by different informs and the association of specific symptoms with comorbidity are analysed. "
385,35739629,"Microcystic lymphatic malformation (MiLM), also known as lymphangioma circumscriptum, is a superficial collection of lymphatic vessels measuring <1 cm in the largest diameter, often with a more extensive deeper malformation. It commonly presents as discrete or grouped plaques of clear or hemorrhagic vesicles classically described as ""frogspawn""; however, here we describe a case of its unique presentation as firm papules on the lips of a healthy six-year-old child. These skin-colored papules in the absence of vesicles with lymphatic and/or hemorrhagic fluid may not be clinically indicative of MiLM. This case represents a diagnostic challenge due to the unique morphology of pink, fleshy papules as opposed to the clear or hemorrhagic vesicles typically observed in MiLM. "
386,32896906,Infantile hemangiomas (IHs) are the most common benign tumors in children. Color Doppler ultrasound is a noninvasive imaging modality that can show subclinical anatomic parameters in a wide range of dermatologic conditions. The purpose of this study was to describe the ultrasound characteristics of IHs and look for subclinical features with the potential to influence the involution and therapeutic response. A review of the ultrasound database of children with clinical and ultrasound IH diagnoses was conducted. The clinically reported duration and the ultrasound assessment of the proliferative phase were compared. Descriptive and statistical analyses of qualitative and quantitative parameters of the series were performed. Significance was set at P < .05. A total of 204 IHs were included. Twenty percent had arteriovenous shunts; 15% had afferent branches from main regional arteries; and almost 30% showed involvement of deep structures. Sixty-one percent of IHs were in the head and neck. Deep hemangiomas showed significantly thicker lesional vessels. A prolonged proliferative stage was significantly associated with a higher presence of arteriovenous shunts and a higher peak systolic velocity of the arterial vessels (≥15 cm/s) within the lesions. Color Doppler ultrasound can support the detection of subclinical anatomic features that may potentially influence the involution and response to treatment of IHs. Some of these characteristics may serve as potential markers to predict and manage IHs in prolonged proliferative stages. 
387,22883418,"To determined the current incidence and acute complications of asymptomatic central venous catheter (CVC)-related deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in critically ill children. We performed a prospective cohort study in 3 pediatric intensive care units. A total of 101 children with newly inserted untunneled CVC were included. CVC-related DVT was diagnosed using compression ultrasonography with color Doppler. Asymptomatic CVC-related DVT was diagnosed in 16 (15.8%) children, which equated to 24.7 cases per 1000 CVC-days. Age was independently associated with DVT. Compared with children aged <1 year, children aged >13 years had significantly higher odds of DVT (aOR, 14.1, 95% CI, 1.9-105.8; P = .01). Other patient demographics, interventions (including anticoagulant use), and CVC characteristics did not differ between children with and without DVT. Mortality-adjusted duration of mechanical ventilation, a surrogate for pulmonary embolism, was statistically similar in the 2 groups (22 ± 9 days in children with DVT vs 23 ± 7 days in children without DVT; P = .34). Mortality-adjusted intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay also were similar in the 2 groups. Asymptomatic CVC-related DVT is common in critically ill children. However, the acute complications do not seem to differ between children with and without DVT. Larger studies are needed to confirm these results. Future studies should also investigate the chronic complications of asymptomatic CVC-related DVT. "
388,38749372,"Cryptorchidism and testicular torsion (TT) are relatively common conditions in clinical practice; however, sparse information about cryptorchid TT is available in the current literature. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical characteristics, treatment modalities, and long-term outcomes of pediatric patients treated for acute cryptorchid TT. We found eight patients with unilateral acute cryptorchid TT with a prevalence of 8.9% (8/90) among all TT cases. The left testis was affected in six patients. The median age of patients at the time of the surgery was 65 months (interquartile range (IQR) 4-136 months). The median duration of symptoms was 16 h (IQR 9-25 h), while the median time to treatment was 60 min (IQR 59-63 min). The most common symptoms were pain (abdominal and inguinal) and inguinal mass with no palpable testis in the ipsilateral hemiscrotum. Preoperative color Doppler ultrasonography revealed absent or decreased testicular blood flow in the affected testes in 7/8 of patients. Various degrees of testicular torsion (median 540°, min 360°, max 1260°) were found during surgery. A necrotic testis that led to orchidectomy was found in 4/8 of patients. The median follow-up period was 42.6 months (IQR 12.5-71.2 months), revealing only one patient with testicular atrophy. The final testicular salvage rate was 35%. Greater awareness among caregivers and primary care physicians about acute cryptorchid TT is required to improve their timely diagnosis and treatment. A physical examination of the external genitalia and inguinal regions should be mandatory to attain a proper diagnosis and treatment without delay. "

Mitral valve surgery may stabilize the evolution of dilated cardiomyopathy and delay the ultimate need for heart transplant. "
390,9349785,"Color Doppler ultrasonography (CDUS), which provides information regarding both the tissue and the blood flow simultaneously in real time, is a relatively new and noninvasive technique for the evaluation of organ perfusion. The authors investigated the usefulness of CDUS in the detection of tumor thrombus in 34 children who had malignant tumor (21 neuroblastomas, 2 Wilms' tumors, 5 hepatoblastomas, 2 rhabdomyosarcomas, and 4 others) who underwent CDUS between April 1992 and March 1995 in our department. The CDUS showed tumor thrombus in four patients (11.8%). Three thrombi (in one patient each with neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumor, and hepatoblastoma) were situated in the inferior vena cava, and one (in a patient who had hepatoblastoma) in the portal vein. Each tumor thrombus was monitored and followed up using CDUS every month during the entire clinical course; two of the four thrombi remained despite intensive treatments. The authors have found CDUS to afford rapid and noninvasive detection of tumor thrombus, and it proved useful not only in the detection of tumor thrombus but also in its follow-up in these children who had malignant tumor.

392,34002704,"To assess schoolchildren's feelings and attitudes towards dentists and their potential impact on oral health. 7902 schoolchildren (12 and 15 years old) attending public and private schools completed a questionnaire that assessed their feeling and attitude toward dentists. DMFT and CPI indices were used to assess dental caries and periodontal diseases respectively according to the World Health Organization method and criteria. 79.7% of all schoolchildren who participated in this study had been to the dentist. 24.7% reported that they are afraid of dental visits, pain being the main reason for this disturbing feeling (88, 2%). Of the children, 81.4% preferred a female dentist; 82.3% preferred a dentist with a colored coat and 80.3% favored a renovated dental facility. 91.1% of the children are irritated by the noises in the dental clinic. The mean DMFT and CPI scores were significantly higher in patients with dental fear, and in patients who never had a dental visit. Meeting patient's perceptions and preferences regarding their dentist may help to reduce the potential dental anxiety and thus ensure the delivery of a high-quality dental treatment leading to better oral health status. Patient perception about dentists is affected by a series of factors related to the dentist, the patient, and the dental clinic. Patients who experience the worst perceptions of dental professional tend not to seek dental care, which leads to a bad oral health status, hence the importance of further studies in this area to improve such perceptions, and promote attitudinal changes toward positive health-seeking behavior.

393,2658846,"Congenital smooth muscle hamartoma (CSMH) represents a proliferation of randomly oriented dermal smooth-muscle bundles. Six patients with CSMH were observed, the largest series to date, and the literature was reviewed. Congenital smooth muscle hamartoma has presented as congenital patches or slightly indurated plaques with prominent overlying hair (88% of cases), or rarely as patches with perifollicular papules without prominent hair (12% of cases). Most lesions (61% of cases) have been somewhat hyperpigmented, but 39% of cases have been flesh colored. Congenital smooth muscle hamartoma has occurred on the torso and proximal extremities, except for one case on the eyebrow and eyelid (present study). A positive pseudo-Darier's sign (temporary induration or piloerection after rubbing) helped to differentiate CSMH from congenital hairy nevo-cellular nevus. Congenital smooth muscle hamartoma is a distinct entity that is at one end of a spectrum that includes Becker's nevus, and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any congenital hairy lesion.

394,37598395,"Beeswax is a naturally occurring product that worker bees produce. Beeswax is used in a variety of industries and pharmaceuticals. Humans utilize it extensively in cosmetics, medicinal formulations, and food manufacturing. Beeswax is an essential component of advanced contemporary beekeeping. Beekeepers, in particular, utilize significant amounts of beeswax to make beeswax comb foundation. In its natural condition, beeswax is white, but it becomes yellow then dark in color when it comes into touch with honey and pollen. The ongoing use of wax comb in bee activities (such as brood rearing, storage honey and bee bread), combined with environmental factors such as heavy metal and pesticide residues, resulted in a black color. Because of heavy metals can accumulate in wax for decades, beeswax can be a helpful tool for gathering data on hazardous contaminants in the environment. Because of their lipid-based chemical composition, beeswax combs act as a sink for numerous ambient pollutants as well as poisons when in the hive. The current study aims to measure nine heavy metals and important elements, including iron (Fe), chromium (Cr), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and cobalt (Co) in beeswax collected in the Behaira governorate region of Egypt between 2018 and 2022. Sample collection was conducted each year in triplicate. The samples were analyzed using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The quantity of metals in beeswax at different ages differed significantly. Depending on the wax age, Fe has the highest concentration in the range of 2.068 to 5.041 ppm, while Cd has the lowest ratio at 0.024 to 0.054 ppm from the first to fifth years old of comb age. The findings showed that as beeswax combs aged, the concentration of heavy metals rose. According to the study, it should gradually recycle beeswax combs each year and also adding new foundations. "
395,38053328,"BACKGROUND High altitude increases sunlight exposure, resulting in actinic keratosis, which predisposes people to skin cancer. The dermoscopy procedure evaluates keratotic and pigmented skin changes. This study aimed to describe the clinical and dermoscopic actinic changes in the lips of 25 indigenous children living at high altitude in Ecuador. MATERIAL AND METHODS An observational study was conducted in a public school in the Andes region of Ecuador (August-November 2019). Twenty-five children, males and females, age 5-15 years were assessed by complete physical examination, digital dermoscopic photographs, and punch biopsies. Descriptive statistics and Fisher's exact test were used to summarize and analyze the data. RESULTS We included 17 (68%) boys and 8 (32%) girls with a mean age of 9.8±2.0 years. Clinical lips findings reported desquamation [52% Upper Lip (UL); 40% Lower Lip (LL)], fissuring (8% UL; 8% LL), scabs (8% UL; 8% LL), and discoloration (40% UL; 20% LL). Dermoscopic features included a white-yellow lip color (24% UL; p=0.02). The main morphologic pattern of blood vessels was monomorphic (88% UL; p<0.001), polymorphous (60% LL; p<0.001), dotted pattern (64% UL; 28% LL; p=0.02), and linear-irregular (32% UL; 72% LL; p=0.01). Girls had radiating white structures on UL (p=0.025), while boys presented white structureless areas (UL 63.6%; LL 77.8%; p=0.032). No differences in dermoscopic findings were observed according to Fitzpatrick scale score (FSS). Punch biopsies showed no indications of actinic cheilitis. CONCLUSIONS Dermoscopic features in indigenous children living in high altitudes were related to actinic damage, but histopathological findings were negative. "
396,3340935,"Allergic asthma is a disease with a well-defined aetiology, the recognition and elimination of which could be achieved with relatively simple and inexpensive prophylactic treatment. Some of the well-known factors--respiratory tract infections, exposure to cigarette smoke, specific antigens and regular application of prophylactic treatment--which could cause or complicate asthma were studied in groups of white and coloured patients. More respiratory tract infections occurred in coloured patients and they were more exposed to their own and secondary cigarette smoke. Pets and grass pollen allergenicity was more common among whites while allergy to Aspergillus fumigatus and Ascaris lumbricoides was found more frequently among coloured patients. Both white and coloured patients had problems with regular prophylactic control of their symptoms with inhaled beta-stimulants, even after an average of two education sessions per patient, but this was of greater dimension for the coloured (60%) than the white group (27%) (P less than 0.001). It is not possible to separate causative from genetic factors when studying asthma in different population groups, but recognition of prevailing causative factors for each group could stimulate an educational approach aimed at control by prevention rather than treatment of acute attacks.

397,29131366,"Nevus of Ota represents congenital dermal melanocytosis in a trigeminal distribution, most commonly occurring in Asian individuals and other individuals with skin of color. Evidence suggests early treatment is beneficial. Multiple reports have shown efficacy and safety of Q-switched laser treatment in adults. There is little data on children and in non-Asian skin types. This series was done to demonstrate safe and effective use of Q-switched laser therapy in children of multiple skin types. Retrospective case series. This was a chart review of patients under 18 years old who presented to our practice from 2002 to 2015 with a clinical diagnosis of nevus of Ota who were treated with Q-switched lasers (694 and 1,064 nm). Patients were treated without the use of general anesthesia or sedation, and corneal shields were used in appropriate cases. Percentage of improvement as well as side effects were rated by five physicians independently. Improvement, when present, was rated in quartiles (1-25%, 26-50%, 51-75%, and 76-100% improvement). Twenty-four children were included. The average age at the start of treatment was 3.9 years old (range of 3 months to 12.4 years), and patients had Fitzpatrick skin types IV through VI. The mean number of treatments was 9.3. Assessment revealed excellent response (76-100% improvement) in 70% of patients and good to excellent response (51-100% improvement) in 86%. Two patients (8%) had post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, one of whom also had focal hypopigmentation. Treatment of nevus of Ota with Q-switched lasers in children with skin of color, without general anesthesia or sedation, is safe and effective. Early intervention should be encouraged for better efficacy and to prevent psychosocial distress in later childhood and adulthood. Lasers Surg. Med. 50:56-60, 2018. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. "
398,2361355,"Scalp hair has been successfully used in forensic medicine, screening populations for heavy metal poisoning, and for monitoring environmental pollutants. However, its use for the diagnosis of the individual for disease or nutritional status has been questionable. This is primarily due to the large individual differences associated with age, sex, race, hair color, hair treatment, and environmental exposure. "

400,33302860,"Vitiligo is a relatively common acquired pigmentation disorder that can cause significant psychological stress and stigmatism. This article aims to familiarize physicians with the clinical manifestations, evaluation, diagnosis, and management of vitiligo. A Pubmed search was conducted in Clinical Queries using the key term ""vitiligo"". The search included meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, observational studies, and reviews. The search was restricted to English language. The information retrieved from the above search was used in the compilation of the present article. Approximately one quarter of patients with vitiligo have the onset before 10 years of age. Genetic, immunological, neurogenic and environmental factors may have a role to play in the pathogenesis. Vitiligo typically presents as acquired depigmented, well-demarcated macules/patches that appear milk- or chalk-white in color. Lesions tend to increase in number and enlarge centrifugally in size with time. Sites of predilection include the face, followed by the neck, lower limbs, trunk, and upper limbs. The clinical course is generally unpredictable. In children with fair skin, no active treatment is usually necessary other than the use of sunscreens and camouflage cosmetics. If treatment is preferred for cosmesis, topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, and narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy are the mainstays of treatment. The therapeutic effect of all the treatment modalities varies considerably from individual to individual. As such, treatment must be individualized. In general, the best treatment response is seen in younger patients, recent disease onset, darker skin types, and head and neck lesions. Topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors are the treatment choice for those with localized disease. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are generally preferred for lesions on genitalia, intertriginous areas, face, and neck. Narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy should be considered in patients who have widespread vitiligo or those with localized vitiligo associated with a significant impact on the quality of life who do not respond to treatment with topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors.

401,9191883,"Reagents are now available which allow simultaneous assessment of three different fluorescence wave-lengths on most commercially available flow cytometers. Such three-color analyses provide more information than single- or dual-color analyses. The present study was undertaken in order to establish age-related differences in lymphocyte subpopulations by simultaneously measuring three surface antigens in newborns, children, and adults. A whole blood method was used to label cells with antibodies conjugated to FITC, PE, and perCP. We found that the percentage of lymphocytes expressing HLA-DR/CD28/CD8, HLA-DR/ CD38/CD8, CD95/CD45RO/CD8, CD95/CD45RO/CD4, CD95/CD4, and CD95/CD8 showed relative increases with age. The percentage of lymphocytes expressing CD28/CD8, CD38/CD8, and CD38/CD4 showed relative decreases with age, while the subset HLA-DR/CD38/ CD4 did not change. Three-color flow cytometry is a powerful tool to more precisely define lymphocyte subsets than the current two-color methods. We present values using a three-color panel in healthy newborns, children, and adults. "
402,33931761,"Genetic syndromes often have ocular involvement. Ophthalmologists may have difficulty identifying dysmorphic features in genetic syndrome evaluations. We investigated the sensitivity and specificity of Face2Gene (F2G), a digital image analysis software trained on integrating dysmorphic features, by analysing patient photos from genetics textbooks. We analysed all clear facial photos contained within the textbooks Smith's Recognizable Patterns of Human Malformation and Genetic Diseases of the Eye using F2G under standard lighting conditions. Variables captured include colour versus grey scale photo, the gender of the patient (if known), age of the patient (if known), disease categories, diagnosis as listed in the textbook, and whether the disease has ophthalmic involvement (as described in the textbook entries). Any photos rejected by F2G were excluded. We analysed the data for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity based on disease categories as outlined in Smith's Recognizable Patterns of Malformation. We analysed 353 photos found within two textbooks. The exact book diagnosis was identified by F2G in 150 (42.5%) entries, and was included in the top three differential diagnoses in 191 (54.1%) entries. F2G is highly sensitive for craniosynostosis syndromes (point estimate [PE] 80.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 56.3-94.3%, P = 0.0118) and syndromes with facial defects as a major feature (PE 77.8%, 95% CI 52.4-93.6%, P = 0.0309). F2G was highly specific (PE > 83percentage with P < 0.001) for all disease categories. F2G is a useful tool for paediatric ophthalmologists to help build a differential diagnosis when evaluating children with dysmorphic facial features. "
403,37065421,"Early childhood caries (ECC) is a chronic but preventable disease affecting young children worldwide. Many young children face access to care barriers to early preventive dental visits for a variety of reasons, which can increase their risk for ECC. Non-dental primary health care providers are well positioned to assist in assessing a child's risk for ECC by performing caries risk assessment (CRA). The purpose of this project was to report on primary health care provider and stakeholder feedback in order to refine a drafted CRA tool for Canadian children <6 years of age intended for use by non-dental primary health care providers. In this mixed methods project, we conducted six focus groups with primarily non-dental primary health care providers followed by a short paper-based survey to quantify preferences and feedback. Data were thematically and descriptively analyzed. Participants' feedback on the drafted CRA tool included the need for it to be relatively quick to complete, easy and practical to score, easy to implement into practitioners' clinic schedules, and to include anticipatory guidance information to share with parents and caregivers. All participants (100%) welcomed a CRA tool. Many (85.4%) liked a layout that could be added to tools they already utilize. Most (73.2%) wanted the tool to be in colour, and many (90.2%) wanted the tool to include pictures. Non-dental primary health care providers informed the final development and layout of the newly released Canadian CRA tool. Their feedback resulted in a user-friendly CRA tool with provider-patient dynamics and preferences. "
404,9216633,"In the pediatric age group, color Doppler sonography appears to be as accurate as scintigraphy in evaluating causes of acute scrotal pain, provided that sensitivity for detecting low-velocity flow is adequate. Sonography has the advantage of providing anatomic information and it lacks radiation. Scintigraphy remains a reliable method of evaluating acute scrotal pain and should be used when color Doppler sensitivity for low-velocity, low-volume testicular blood flow is inadequate leading to doubt about the sonographic diagnosis. It is also advocated when examiner expertise with color Doppler sonography is limited. Regardless of which imaging study one prefers, it needs to be recognized that imaging of any type is not warranted in patients with a high clinical suspicion of torsion, because it delays immediate surgical treatment needed to prevent permanent damage.

405,12718365,"Doppler indexes have been used successfully to determine the severity of aortic regurgitation (AR) in adults but have not been evaluated in children. To determine the accuracy of pulsed, color, and continuous-wave (CW) Doppler echocardiographic indexes in assessing the degree of AR in children, the correlation between the non-invasive measurements and angiographic grading of the regurgitant flow (1+ to 4+) was examined in 14 children (mean age 11 +/- 3 years) with chronic AR. Forward and reverse flows in the aortic arch were evaluated from the suprasternal notch using pulsed Doppler. Aortic time-velocity integrals (TVI) were measured during systole (forward flow) and diastole (reverse flow), and the ratio of reverse to forward TVI (%) was calculated. Doppler color flow mapping was used to detect and assess the severity of AR (which appears as mosaic turbulent signals extending in the left ventricular outflow tract during diastole) by using four color Doppler grades of severity. The envelope of the flow velocity pattern in diastole was recorded from the CW Doppler signal of AR with the transducer in the lower sternal border to determine the peak flow velocity and deceleration slope (alpha) indexes. The ratio of reverse to forward aortic TVI and color flow mapping grading showed strong correlation with angiographic grade (r=0.92 and r=0.86, respectively) but AR slope (alpha) and peak flow velocity did not correlate well with the angiographic grade (r=-0.039 and r=0.74, respectively). We concluded that the severity of AR in children as determined by angiographic grading can be estimated with reasonable accuracy by noninvasive technique based on color and pulsed wave Doppler. Use of these indexes may obviate the need for angiography to detect the severity of AR in children. "
406,9610598,"To analyze and identify collagen subtypes in the primary obstructed and refluxing megaureter of childhood. Anticollagen monoclonal antibodies to collagen types I, III, and IV were used in control ureters (n = 4), obstructed (n = 7), and refluxing (n = 13) megaureters. Additionally, all were stained with Masson's trichrome to further define the extracellular matrix. After staining and serial sectioning, representative ureteral sections, focusing on the muscularis and lamina propria regions, were digitized and analyzed with a color image analysis system. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated increases in collagen types I and III for both obstructed and refluxing megaureters compared with controls (P <0.05). Collagen type IV was not detected in statistically significant amounts in any ureter. In control ureters most was type I (83% +/- 9%) collagen. Obstructed megaureters produced similar results with virtually all collagen being type I (84% +/- 26%) with very little type III collagen present, 5.3% +/- 3%. Refluxing megaureters contained only 55% +/- 15% type I collagen. However, there was an increase in type III collagen (16% +/- 4%) versus (4.5% +/- 2%) in controls (P <0.05). These data suggest that the greater contribution of type III collagen may play a role in the pathophysiology of refluxing megaureters. Because type III collagen is a less distensible fiber, it may cause an intrinsically stiffer ureter and play a role in the lower surgical success in the reimplantation of refluxing megaureters. "
407,36754076,"Victims of child abuse and neglect come from every racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic background, yet clinical evaluation, reporting to child protective services, and responses to reports inequitably harm Black children and malign families of color. Racial bias and inequity in suspicion, reporting, and substantiation of abuse and neglect and in services offered and delivered, foster care placement, and criminal prosecution are widely documented. In response, clinicians and health care organizations should promote equity by educating clinicians about racial bias, standardizing evaluation using clinical decision support tools, and working with policy makers to support prevention services. If we decide that it is ethically justifiable for clinicians to err on the side of overreporting, we must ensure fair distribution of associated benefits and harms among all children and families. "
408,11486937,"The prevalence rates and specific risk factors for development of eye conditions among Asian-Pacific Islander schoolchildren are unknown. This information is necessary to understand their eye care needs and to improve access to eye care for this rapidly growing population. Data obtained from a computer database of vision screening examinations conducted by the UCLA Mobile Eye Clinic from October 1987 through December 1996 were analyzed for 2,687 Asian-Pacific Islander schoolchildren between 5 and 7 years of age. Myopia (8.9%) and astigmatism (15.8%) represented the majority of visual disorders. Mean myopic refractive error was -1.21 +/- 0.83 D among bilateral myopes. Color-vision deficiency was prevalent among 2.8% of male children, extraocular muscle imbalance among 3.0% of children, and amblyopia among 1.0% of children. All other conditions were present in less than 4% of children screened. Asian-Pacific Islander schoolchildren may be at higher risk for development of juvenile myopia than white, Hispanic, and African-American children. Prevalence rates of other disorders are comparable to those obtained for other ethnic groups. This information can be used in planning to meet the eye care needs of Asian-Pacific Islander schoolchildren. "
409,38499988,"In 2020, one study by Strait and colleagues raised awareness that the clinical images in rheumatology educational materials underrepresent people with skin of color (P-SOC). Since then, publishers of rheumatology educational materials have focused on addressing this shortcoming. This study investigates the change in representation of P-SOC following the review of Strait et al. METHODS: We used the methods of the aforementioned study to collect images from commonly referenced rheumatology educational materials and categorized the skin tones within them as ""light"" or ""dark."" We calculated the proportional change in images depicting dark skin tones between 2020 and 2022 from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Image Library, the 10th edition of Kelley's Textbook of Rheumatology, and New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) as well as between 2020 and 2024 from rheumatology articles within UpToDate. We compared results using one-sided Z-tests. Overall, the proportion of images depicting dark skin tones increased 40.6% (P < 0.0001). The 10th edition of Kelley's Textbook of Rheumatology most significantly increased inclusion of P-SOC (90.1%; P = 0.0039), with ACR Image Library, UpToDate, and NEJM also enhancing representation (41.9%, P < 0.0001; 31.0%, P = 0.0083; 28.2%, P = 0.3046, respectively). This study assesses the progress of rheumatology educational materials toward equitable representation of P-SOC. It demonstrates that awareness coupled with focused efforts from educational publishers can enhance the proportion of images depicting dark skin tones, thereby enriching the quality of foundational knowledge relayed to rheumatology providers with the goal of improving health experiences and outcomes for P-SOC with rheumatic diseases.

410,32964824,"Pityriasis rosea is a common acute, self-limited papulosquamous dermatosis that primarily affects children and young adults. The condition and its clinical variants may pose a diagnostic challenge, especially in the absence of the herald patch. This article aimed to familiarize pediatricians with clinical manifestations, evaluation, diagnosis, and management of pityriasis rosea. A search was conducted in March 2020 in Pubmed Clinical Queries using the key term "" pityriasis rosea"". The search strategy included all clinical trials (including open trials, non-randomized controlled trials, and randomized controlled trials), observational studies, and reviews (including narrative reviews and meta-analyses) published within the past 10 years. Only papers published in the English literature were included in this review. The information retrieved from the above search was used in the compilation of the present article. Pityriasis rosea occurs mainly in individuals between 10 and 35 years of age with a peak during adolescence. Human herpesvirus (HHV)-7 and HHV-6 have been implicated as the causative agents in some patients with pityriasis rosea. A mild prodrome consisting of headaches, fever, malaise, fatigue, anorexia, sore throat, enlarged lymph nodes and arthralgia is present in about 5% of patients. The most common presenting sign, found in approximately 80% of patients, is a ""herald"" or ""mother"" patch which is larger and more noticeable than the lesions of the later eruption. A generalized, bilateral, symmetrical eruption develops in approximately 4 to 14 days and continues to erupt in crops over the next 12 to 21 days. Typical lesions are 0.5 to 1 cm, oval or elliptical, dull pink or salmon-colored macules with a delicate collarette of scales at the periphery. The long axes tend to be oriented along the skin lines of cleavage (Langer lines). Lesions on the back may have a characteristic ""Christmas tree"", whereas lesions on the upper chest may have a V-shaped pattern. There are many conditions that may mimic pityriasis rosea. Pityriasis rosea in the absence of the herald patch and its variants may pose a diagnostic challenge. The typical course is 6 to 8 weeks. In the vast majority of cases, reassurance and symptomatic treatment should suffice. Active intervention may be considered for individuals with severe or recurrent pityriasis rosea and pregnant women with the disease. Treatment options include acyclovir, macrolides (in particular, erythromycin), and ultraviolet phototherapy. If active intervention is needed, there is evidence supporting the use of oral acyclovir to shorten the duration of illness. Pityriasis rosea is a common, acute, self-limiting exanthematous skin disease that primarily affects children and young adults. The condition is characterized by a ""herald patch"" after which oval erythematous squamous lesions appear along Langer's lines of cleavage on the trunk and proximal extremities, giving it a ""Christmas tree"" appearance. The disease presenting in its classical form can easily be diagnosed. Clinical variants of the disease may pose a diagnostic challenge for the general pediatrician. Knowledge of the disease is essential to allow prompt diagnosis and to avoid unnecessary investigations. "
411,35921603,"To describe the clinical presentation with a focus on ocular manifestations and response to riboflavin supplementation of 3 patients with riboflavin transporter deficiency (RTD) caused by mutations in SLC52A2 ( SLC52A2- RTD). This is a retrospective review of records of 3 children (aged 18, n = 2 and age = 8, n = 1) with SLC52A2- RTD. Patients underwent comprehensive ophthalmic evaluations including color vision testing, pattern visual-evoked potentials (pVEPs, 1 patient) and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging. Patients received riboflavin supplements from the time of the molecular diagnosis of RTD. Two unrelated 18-year-old patients with SLC52A2- RTD had a symptomatic onset with sensorineural hearing loss and auditory neuropathy/dys-synchrony since age 3 and 11, respectively. On examination 7 years after symptomatic onset, they showed subnormal visual acuities (20/30 and 20/60, both eyes, respectively), preserved color vision, and a thin but measurable retinal ganglion cell layer (GCL) and nerve fiber (RNFL). The inner and outer nuclear layers were normal. The asymptomatic SLC52A2- positive brother of one of these patients started riboflavin supplementation right after the molecular diagnosis and had normal vision and SD-OCTs 7 years later. Onset of riboflavin supplementation in one of the 2 symptomatic cases resulted in acute improvement of the pattern visual-evoked potential and vision. Retinal ganglion cells and their axons are uniquely susceptible to RTD compared with other highly energy-dependent retinal neurons, such as photoreceptors, raising the possibility for alternative mechanisms of disease or protection. Riboflavin supplementation results in acute functional improvement of vision and long-term preservation of GCL and RNFL if initiated early. "

414,28246900,"Massive ovarian edema is a rare benign condition that predominantly affects childbearing women as well as preadolescent girls. It is thought to result from intermittent or partial torsion of the ovary compromising the venous and lymphatic drainage but with preserved arterial supply. The clinical features of massive ovarian edema are nonspecific and can simulate tumors, leading to unnecessary oophorectomy. To demonstrate imaging features that should alert radiologists to consider the diagnosis of massive ovarian edema preoperatively so that fertility-sparing surgery may be considered. We identified five girls diagnosed with massive ovarian edema at pathology. Presenting symptoms, sidedness, imaging appearance, preoperative diagnosis, and operative and histopathological findings were reviewed. Age range was 9.6-14.3 years (mean age: 12.5 years). Common imaging findings included ovarian enlargement with edema of the stroma, peripherally placed follicles, isointense signal on T1-W MRI and markedly hyperintense signal on T2-W MRI, preservation of color Doppler flow by US, and CT Hounsfield units below 40. The uterus was deviated to the affected side in all patients. Two of the five patients had small to moderate amounts of free pelvic fluid. Mean ovarian volume on imaging was 560 mL (range: 108-1,361 mL). While the clinical presentation of massive ovarian edema is nonspecific, an enlarged ovary with stromal edema, peripherally placed follicles and preservation of blood flow may be suggestive and wedge biopsy should be considered intraoperatively to avoid unnecessary removal of the ovary.

415,33369057,"This panel was designed to identify, quantify and phenotypically characterize putative leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in bone marrow (BM) samples from individual pediatric patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Based on an aberrant expression on immunophenotypically defined hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), several antigens have been proposed as LSC markers in AML research, using healthy adult BM samples as reference material. Generally, these antigens have been evaluated individually in smaller panels (e.g. 8-color panels). This necessitates several tubes to characterize the LSC phenotype and compromises the ability to evaluate LSC heterogeneity. The present 15-color OMIP incorporates nine suggested LSC markers to comprehensively capture LSC immunophenotypes and to explore heterogenic marker-patterns within LSC populations in a single tube. Importantly, this single tube approach requires less input material, which is essential when sampling BM aspirates from pediatric patients where sample volumes often are sparse. As knowledge on normal expression levels of the included LSC markers in HSCs from hematologically healthy children are a prerequisite for labelling a phenotype as abnormal, we have evaluated the applicability of the panel on cryopreserved mononuclear cells (MNCs) isolated from BM samples from pediatric patients without hematological disorders as well as pediatric AML patients. The panel is optimized for cryopreserved BM MNCs, but could in principle, be utilized for LSC detection in any biological material containing human hematopoietic cells. "
416,32791524,"This introduction to the special issue on Addressing Health Disparities in Pediatric Psychology provides context for why this special issue is needed, reviews key findings of the accepted articles, and discusses future directions for advancing the field. This special issue, one of three on this topic area that has been put forth in the history of this journal, comes at a critical point in our world. This is a time when the COVID-19 pandemic is systematically infecting Black, Indigenous, and People of Color and when there has been increased attention to systemic racism and intersecting violence inherent in multiple systems, including the justice, health, and educational systems. Using Kilbourne et al. (2016) framework, this special issue focuses on Phase 2 and Phase 3 research. Rather than only identifying health disparities (Phase 1), this issue focuses on understanding mechanisms and translating such understanding into interventions and policy changes. The accepted articles span a wide gamut from obesity to autism to rural populations. Furthermore, the articles provide methods for advancing the field beyond simply noting that systematic differences exist toward strategies to address these inequities. We conclude this introduction by discussing next steps for future research, with hopes that it inspires the next generation to study issues of disparities and inequity in deeper, more meaningful, and impactful ways.

417,25783395,"Although the usefulness of intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescent imaging for the resection of hepatocellular carcinoma has been reported, its usefulness for the resection of hepatoblastoma remains unclear. This study clarifies the feasibility of intraoperative ICG fluorescent imaging for the resection of hepatoblastoma. In three hepatoblastoma patients, a primary tumor, recurrent tumor, and lung metastatic lesions were intraoperatively examined using a near-infrared fluorescence imaging system after the preoperative administration of ICG. ICG fluorescent imaging was useful for the surgical navigation in hepatoblastoma patients. In the first case, the primary hepatoblastoma exhibited intense fluorescence during right hepatectomy, but no fluorescence was detected in the residual liver. In the second case, a recurrent tumor exhibited fluorescence between the residual liver and diaphragm. A complete resection of the residual liver, with a partial resection of the diaphragm, followed by liver transplantation was performed. In the third case with multiple lung metastases, each metastatic lesion showed positive fluorescence, and all were completely resected. These fluorescence-positive lesions were pathologically proven to be viable hepatoblastoma cells. Intraoperative ICG fluorescence imaging for patients with hepatoblastoma was feasible and useful for identifying small viable lesions and confirming that no remnant tumor remained after resection. "
418,25228043,"Prevalence of ocular morbidity among street children is largely unknown. The present study was carried out to determine the prevalence of ocular morbidity among street children in the Kathmandu Valley. A cross-sectional study consisting of an eye examination program among 569 street children aged younger than 18 years was conducted from March 2013 to February 2014. Children were included from 11 safe houses of 6 non-governmental organizations and an independent eye camp. Eye examination included visual acuity testing, anterior segment and posterior segment examination, retinoscopy and refraction, cover test, convergence, accommodation and color vision tests. Chi-square test was used to analyze the association of ocular morbidity with age, sex and living conditions. The majority of children (43.8%) were in the age group of 12-15 years, and the male to female ratio was 3.9:1. Uncorrected and best-corrected visual acuity ≥6/9 in at least one eye was found in 89.8% and 98.4% of children, respectively. Total ocular morbidity was observed at 31.6%. The most common types of ocular morbidity were conjunctivitis (11.0%) and refractive error (11.6%). Ocular morbidity was more common in children over 15 years of age (40.9%; p < 0.01; odds ratio 1.8). Ocular infection and refractive error represent the most common ocular morbidities in street children in the Kathmandu Valley. "
419,35322771,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the early myocardial dysfunction detected by strain echocardiography in children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This cross-sectional study was conducted with 47 patients diagnosed with MIS-C and 32 healthy age- and gender-matched children. All patients underwent two-dimensional, colour, pulsed, and tissue Doppler, and 2D speckle tracking echocardiography examination at admission, 2 weeks, and 2 months after discharge. The MIS-C patient group was compared with the control group. Echocardiographic changes in MIS-C patients during follow-up were evaluated. Of 47 patients, 30 (63.8%) were male and 17 (36.2%) were female. The mean age at diagnosis was 9.1 ± 4.3 (1.25-17) years. At admission, 25 patients had abnormal findings on conventional echocardiography. Among them, eight patients had left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Ejection fraction and fractional shortening were significantly lower in the patient group at admission compared to controls (p = 0.013, p = 0.010, respectively). While the ejection fraction was <55% in eight patients, and global longitudinal strain was lower than -2SD in 29 patients at admission. Global longitudinal strain z-score <-2SD persisted in 13 patients at 2-month follow-up. Ejection fraction increased above 55% in 3.42 ± 0.53 days in 7 of 8 patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, ejection fraction was 51% at discharge in one patient, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction persisted at the 6-month of follow-up. These results confirmed that speckle tracking echocardiography is more likely to detect subclinical myocardial damage compared to conventional echocardiography. In addition, it is a valuable method for follow-up in this patient group. "
420,31713982,"To analyse the spatiotemporal patterns of leprosy occurrence in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil from 2001 to 2017. Mixed population-based ecological study with spatial and temporal trend analysis of epidemiological indicators based on new cases reported to the Information System for Notifiable Diseases of the Ministry of Health occurring in individuals residing in North and Northeast states of Brazil. A total of 396 987 new cases were analysed; 9.2% of these involved children <15 years of age, and 5.4% involved individuals with grade 2 disability (G2D). The Northeast region recorded 66.4% of the new cases. Most cases involved males between 15 and 59 years of age and of brown race/colour. The temporal trend showed a reduction in most of the indicators and study variables. The G2D rate did not have trends over time in the Northeast Region, in individuals 0-14 years of age, or in municipalities with 'very high' social vulnerability indexes. The spatial and spatiotemporal analysis showed the presence of hyperendemic foci with high detection risk involving municipalities in the states of Tocantins, Pará and Maranhão. Leprosy in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil persists as a critical public health problem. Temporal and spatiotemporal patterns identified in this study confirm that leprosy remains epidemiologically relevant in vulnerable areas. Surveillance and control interventions are needed in municipalities with low detection in the general population, in children and in individuals with G2D, to reduce late diagnosis. Analyser les profils spatiotemporels de l’apparition des cas de lèpre dans les régions du nord et du nord-est du Brésil de 2001 à 2017.

RÉSULTATS: 396.987 nouveaux cas ont été analysés; 9,2% d'entre eux concernaient des enfants de moins de 15 ans et 5,4% concernaient des personnes avec un handicap de grade 2 (G2D). La région du nord-est a enregistré 66,4% des nouveaux cas. La plupart des cas concernaient des hommes âgés de 15 à 59 ans et de race/couleur noire. La tendance temporelle a montré une réduction dans la plupart des indicateurs et des variables de l'étude. Le taux de G2D n'a pas évolué au cours du temps dans la région du nord-est, chez les individus de 0 à 14 ans ou dans les municipalités avec des indices de vulnérabilité sociale ""très élevés"". L'analyse spatiale et spatiotemporelle a montré la présence de foyers hyper endémiques à risque élevé de détection impliquant des municipalités dans les Etats de Tocantins, Pará et Maranhão. La lèpre dans les régions du nord et du nord-est du Brésil persiste comme problème critique de santé publique. Les schémas temporels et spatiotemporels identifiés dans cette étude confirment que la lèpre reste épidémiologiquement importante dans les zones vulnérables.

421,35217321,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are a public health crisis, affecting nearly half of children in the United States. Long-term effects of ACEs on psychological well-being, engagement in risk behaviors, and physical health have been observed. Moreover, many individuals exposed to ACEs are also affected by an accumulation of stressors due to broader structural inequities. The current study examined heterogeneity in patterns of ACEs, explored how these patterns varied based on race/ethnicity, biological sex, and socioeconomic status, and assessed how ACE patterns were associated with physical health, mental health, and risk-related outcomes in adulthood. Drawing on the Add Health dataset, survey data from Waves I, III, IV (n = 12,288) were analyzed. Mean age of participants was 28.3 (SD = 1.9), more than half were female (54.4%), and a little less than half identified as youth of color (46.7%). Multigroup latent class analysis explored heterogeneity in ACE exposure and variations based on structural inequities. Latent class regression assessed associations between ACE classes and outcomes. A four-class solution was identified. Class sizes and latent structures differed by biological sex. Among males and females, the low adversity class had more positive physical health, mental health, and risk-related outcomes compared to all classes, while the childhood maltreatment and high adversity/community violence classes engaged in more risk-related behaviors. Very small to medium effects were observed. Findings highlight the importance of examining heterogeneity in ACE exposure, and how patterns of ACEs may differentially affect outcomes in adulthood. "
422,38696006,"Inorganic elements are added to toys as impurities to give desired stability, brightness, flexibility, and color; however, these elements may cause numerous health issues after acute or chronic exposure. In this study, the inorganic profile of 14 elements (Al, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Se, Sb, Pb, and Zn) in 63 toy makeup products was identified by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry after microwave acid digestion method. Additionally, organic allergen fragrance was investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The systemic exposure dosage (SED), margin of safety (MoS), lifetime cancer risk (LCR), hazard quotient (HQ), and hazard indices were used to assess the safety evaluation. Then, 57 out of 63 samples (90.48%) exceeded the limits at least for one toxic element with descending order Ni > Cr > Co > Pb > Sb > Cd > As > Hg. The SED values were compared with tolerable daily intake values and remarkably differences were found for Al and Pb. The MoS values for 57.15% of samples exceeded the limit value for Al, As, Cd, Co, Hg, Mn, Sb, and Zn elements. The LCR values were observed at 100% (n = 63), 79.37% (n = 50), 85.71% (n = 54), 77.78% (n = 49), and 18.87% (n = 10) for Cr, Ni, As, Pb, and Cd, respectively. Also, the skin sensitization risks were obtained for Cr and Ni at 26.980% (n = 17) and 9.52% (n = 6), respectively. The HQ values for 80% of samples were found to be ≥ 1 at least for one parameter. The investigation of fragrance allergens in samples did not show any significant ingredients. As a result, toy makeup products marketed in local stores were found to be predominantly unsafe. Children should be protected from harmful chemicals by regular monitoring and strict measures. "
423,8773672,"To measure the prevalence of juvenile spring eruption of the ears in Dunedin primary school aged children. To characterise the population of children affected by juvenile spring eruption in New Zealand. Children attending three primary schools were examined for evidence of clinical and preclinical juvenile spring eruption on a single occasion in the late spring. Ear protuberance, hair cover and other factors related to sun exposure were assessed. The overall prevalence of clinical juvenile spring eruption was 6.7% (95% confidence interval = 4.7% to 7.5%). The prevalence in males was 12% (95% CI = 7.3% to 17%). Lack of hair cover and protuberant ears (75th percentile or greater) were strongly associated with clinical juvenile spring eruption. There was no evidence of an association between clinical juvenile spring eruption and skin tone, hair colour, time spent outdoors, sunscreen use, and hat use. Juvenile spring eruption is a relatively common dermatological condition among primary school aged children in Dunedin, especially boys. "
424,31784079,"Nowadays, most of the swimsuits are mainly made of artificial fibres, which have interesting properties such as water repellence and fast drying. Swimsuits contain a wide range of additives, which can mean a hazard for the environment and/or human health. In this study, the concentrations of formaldehyde (free and water soluble), 24 aromatic amines, and 28 trace elements (Ag, Al, As, B, Ba, Be, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sc, Se, Sm, Sr, Sn, Tl, Ti, V and Zn) were analysed in 39 swimsuits covering a wide range of materials, colours and brands. Dermal exposure and health risks were assessed for adults (men and women) aged > 18 years old, babies between 2 and < 3 years old, children (boys and girls) between 3 and < 6 years old and 6 and < 11 years old, and teenagers (boys and girls) between 11 and < 16 years old, wearing swimsuits for 4 h or 8 h. Formaldehyde and aromatic amines were below their respective detection limits in all samples (<16 and < 1.5 mg/kg, respectively). Regarding trace elements, Ti showed the highest mean levels (1844 mg/kg), being significantly higher in polyamide (3759 mg/kg) than in polyester (24.1 mg/kg) swimsuits. These high Ti levels were confirmed by environmental scanning electron microscope in a single sample made of polyamide. Increased concentrations of Cr were also observed, but only in polyamide black fabrics, with values ranging from 624 to 932 mg/kg. Non-cancer risks (hazard quotients) derived from the exposure to trace elements were in a safe zone for all analysed trace elements. Furthermore, the carcinogenic risks were evaluated for As, Cr and Pb, exhibiting values below the 10 "
425,26886184,"The use of medicines is influenced by different factors. This study aimed to analyze the use of medicines and identify the sources for obtaining them and associated factors, using a population-based cross-sectional design with two-stage cluster sampling in Campinas, São Paulo State, Brazil, in 2008. Prevalence of use of at least one drug in the 3 previous days was 57.2% and prevalence of obtaining the drug from the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS) was 30%. 47.8% of individuals with no health insurance had to pay out-of-pocket for their medication, and 10.9% of individuals with insurance nevertheless obtained their medication from the SUS. Use of medicines obtained from the SUS was associated with older age, widowhood, black or brown skin color, lower schooling and income, and lack of insurance. Only 2.1% reported not being able to obtain the prescribed medication, and the main reasons were lack of availability in the public system and lack of money for out-of-pocket purchases. The study identified the subgroups that obtained most of their medicines in the SUS and showed that these were the subgroups with the lowest use of medicines in the system. "
426,20462330,"Aberrant Mongolian spots (AMS) distal from the lumbosacral region are said to be more apt to persist than the typical sacral AMS, so the Q-switched ruby laser (QSRL) has been the treatment of choice for AMS. However, so far as we could determine, there is no statistical analysis of the treatment of AMS. This paper shows statistical comparisons of the efficacy and complications in the treatment of AMS with QSRL. Fifty-three patients (16 males and 37 females) with 57 AMS regions were treated with the QSRL from March 1999 to April 2007, and we divided the diseased areas into exposed regions that could not be concealed by clothing and non-exposed regions that could be concealed by clothing, and performed a statistical analysis. The results indicated that QSRL treatment of AMS in the exposed regions showed significantly improved coloration and caused less pigmentation when compared with the non-exposed regions. We concluded that QSRL treatment of AMS in the exposed regions is more effective than that of AMS in the non-exposed regions. "
427,30003330,"Controversy exists as regards the best non-invasive diagnostic tool for pediatric cervical lymphadenopathy. The current work aimed to evaluate the reliability, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of sonoelastography in diagnosing benign and/or malignant pediatric cervical lymphadenopathy. Prospective study took place over a period of 4 years from January 2013 to December 2016. A total of 177 lymph nodes (LNs) in 128 children with an age ranging from 11 months to 12 years were recruited in this study. Patients were 77 males and 51 females with a ratio of 3:2. All patients underwent a thorough history taking and clinical examination of the neck focusing on the cervical lymph nodes. After that, a B-mode sonography, Color Doppler ultrasound, and Sonoelastography were performed. Elastographic patterns of 1-5 were evaluated, whereas patterns of 3-5 (firm to hard) were suspected to have a malignant nature. Sonographic-guided aspiration cytology took place in 107 lymph nodes and excisional biopsy in 102 lymph nodes, whereas 13 lymph nodes responded adequately to conservative treatment. They proved to be benign reactive hyperplasia. The majority of LNs (87%) were of the malignant type that showed an elastographic pattern of 3-5. The same patterns were observed in only 6 (3.4%) of the benign LNs. Sonoelastography showed a sensitivity of 85.9%, specificity of 100%, PPV of 100%, NPV of 75.96%, and overall accuracy of 90.23% in distinguishing benign from malignant lymph nodes. Using the B-Mode ultrasound, an abnormal hilum was seen in 75%. The accuracy of color Doppler US reached 82.7%. Sonoelastography may be superior to other US modalities in elucidating different cervical lymph node biopsy helping to distinguish benign from malignant lesions. This may replace the lymph node biopsies in the future. Moreover, its use in the follow-up of patients with cervical malignancies may reduce the number of future biopsies. Further studies with more patients may be needed for a better assessment of results. "
428,36321255,"Laboratory information systems typically contain hundreds or even thousands of reference limits stratified by sex and age. Since under these conditions a manual plausibility check is hardly feasible, we have developed a simple algorithm that facilitates this check. An open-source R tool is available as a Shiny application at github.com/SandraKla/Zlog_AdRI. Based on the zlog standardization, we can possibly detect critical jumps at the transitions between age groups, regardless of the analytical method or the measuring unit. Its advantage compared to the standard z-value is that means and standard deviations are calculated from the reference limits rather than from the underlying data itself. The purpose of the tool is illustrated by the example of reference intervals of children and adolescents from the Canadian Laboratory Initiative on Pediatric Reference Intervals (CALIPER). The Shiny application identifies the zlog values, lists them in a colored table format and plots them additionally with the specified reference intervals. The algorithm detected several strong and rapid changes in reference intervals from the neonatal period to puberty. Remarkable jumps with absolute zlog values of more than five were seen for 29 out of 192 reference limits (15.1%). This might be attenuated by introducing shorter time periods or mathematical functions of reference limits over age. Age-partitioned reference intervals will remain the standard in laboratory routine for the foreseeable future, and as such, algorithmic approaches like our zlog approach in the presented Shiny application will remain valuable tools for testing their plausibility on a wide scale.

429,31424059,"The immune system has evolved as a powerful tool for our body to combat infections, and is being engineered for new treatments in cancer and autoimmune disease. More recently, the complex role of the immune system is being recognized in tissue repair, regenerative medicine and biomaterial responses. From these combined interests, the field of immunoengineering is rapidly growing. However, bridging immunology with engineering poses numerous challenges including the biological complexity, language of immunology and accurately leveraging the powerful techniques of immunology to new applications. Elucidating the identity and function of immune cell populations responding to engineering systems will be required for continued advancement. Multi-color flow cytometry is a central technique used by immunologists for this purpose that requires careful control of variables, data acquisition, and interpretation. Here, we present methods for multi-color flow cytometry experimental design and analysis focused on characterizing the scaffold immune microenvironment in regenerative medicine research. "
430,10692929,"To determine the effect of congenital ptosis on corneal shape, and to assess the role of these topographic changes in the development of amblyopia. Twenty-two patients with congenital ptosis were examined and a corneal topographic examination performed in both the ptotic and normal eyes. The qualitative corneal classification was done according to the colour-coded topographic maps. The surface regularity index (SRI) and the surface asymmetry index (SAI) were used as quantitative descriptors of the study. Ptotic eyes had an increased incidence of astigmatism, bow tie pattern on corneal topography, corneal asymmetry (SAI, p < 0.05) and corneal irregularity (SRI, p < 0.05). Lack of mirror-image symmetry with the fellow eye was higher in amblyopic eyes. Eyes with congenital ptosis have an increased incidence of astigmatism and a bow tie pattern on corneal topography. These features are associated with the presence of amblyopia. "

432,31058429,"Achromatopsia (ACHM) is a hereditary cone photoreceptor disorder characterized by the inability to discriminate colors, nystagmus, photophobia, and low-visual acuity. Six genes have been associated with this rare autosomal recessively inherited disease, including the GNAT2 gene encoding the catalytic α-subunit of the G-protein transducin which is expressed in the cone photoreceptor outer segment. Out of a cohort of 1,116 independent families diagnosed with a primary clinical diagnosis of ACHM, we identified 23 patients with ACHM from 19 independent families with likely causative mutations in GNAT2, representing 1.7% of our large ACHM cohort. In total 22 different potentially disease-causing variants, of which 12 are novel, were identified. The mutation spectrum also includes a novel copy number variation, a heterozygous duplication of exon 4, of which the breakpoint matches exactly that of the previously reported exon 4 deletion. Two patients carry just a single heterozygous variant. In addition to our previous study on GNAT2-ACHM, we also present detailed clinical data of these patients. "
433,38244857,"This qualitative study applies a community-based participatory research approach to elicit formative data on pediatric patient experiences of racism in the health care setting and to explore clinic-based opportunities for supporting pediatric patients experiencing racism. The study is situated within the outpatient practice of a large tertiary academic medical center in a midsize Midwestern city. Community partners were involved in all aspects of the research, including research protocol design, recruitment, data analysis, community dissemination, and manuscript preparation. Participants were youth between 11 and 18 years, in middle or high school, self-identifying as a person of color, Latinx or Indigenous who answered yes to the question ""have you ever experienced race-related prejudice and discrimination?"" Parent/guardians of youth meeting inclusion criteria participated in separate focus groups. Data were analyzed using an interpretative phenomenological analysis approach. Major findings were divided into 2 categories: 1) racism-related experiences in the health care setting; and 2) patient and parent/guardian recommendations to support pediatric patients experiencing racism. Among health care setting experiences, primary emerging themes included racism experienced in the health care setting, patient-clinician communication around racism, patient-clinician concordance, and high-quality clinical care. Recommendations were presented within the 4 domains of racism: intrapersonal, interpersonal, structural, and institutional. Racism experiences worsen child biological, psychological, and behavioral functioning, yet research is lacking on how health care professionals may best support pediatric patients experiencing racism. Study findings suggest opportunities for providing safer and more supportive health care spaces for youth experiencing racism. "
434,10982698,"Although the assessment of right ventricular (RV) function is important in the clinical management of children with congenital heart disease, available imaging techniques have been limited because of the complex geometry of the right ventricle. A new Doppler index combining systolic and diastolic time intervals (the Tei index) has been reported to be useful for the assessment of global RV function in adults. However, normal values in children, age-related changes, and the clinical utility of the Tei index with regard to congenital heart disease have not been demonstrated. The purpose of this study was to prospectively assess RV function in children with normal heart and congenital heart disease using the Tei index. The subjects included 150 healthy children and 43 patients with congenital heart disease (35 patients with atrial septal defects and 8 patients who had had a Senning operation). The index was defined as the sum of isovolumetric contraction time and isovolumetric relaxation time divided by ejection time and was measured from conventional RV outflow and inflow Doppler velocity profiles. The Tei index was not affected by age in healthy children (0.24 +/- 0.04). There was a significant difference in index rating between patients who had had a Senning operation (0.58 +/- 0.09) and healthy children (p < 0.01), but there was no significant difference between children with atrial septal defect (0.25 +/- 0.13) and healthy children. The Tei index is a feasible approach to use when assessing global RV function in children with congenital heart disease. "
435,34670797,"In December 2014, the Kidney Allocation System (KAS) was implemented to improve equity in access to transplantation, but preliminary studies in children show mixed results. Thus, we aimed to assess how the 2014 KAS policy change affected racial and ethnic disparities in pediatric kidney transplantation access and related outcomes. We performed a retrospective cohort study of children <18 years of age active on the kidney transplant list from 2008 to 2019 using the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. Log-logistic accelerated failure time models were used to determine the time from first activation on the transplant list and the time on dialysis to deceased donor transplant, each with KAS era or race and ethnicity as the exposure of interest. We used logistic regression to assess odds of delayed graft function. Log-rank tests assessed time to graft loss within racial and ethnic groups across KAS eras. All children experienced longer wait times from activation to transplantation post-KAS. In univariable analysis, Black and Hispanic children and other children of color experienced longer times from activation to transplant compared with White children in both eras; this finding was largely attenuated after multivariable analysis (time ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.32; time ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.28; and time ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.96 to 1.41 post-KAS, respectively). Multivariable analysis also showed that racial and ethnic disparities in time from dialysis initiation to transplantation in the pre-KAS era were mitigated in the post-KAS era. There were no disparities in odds of delayed graft function. Black and Hispanic children experienced longer times with a functioning graft in the post-KAS era. No racial and ethnic disparities from activation to deceased donor transplantation were seen before or after implementation of the KAS in multivariable analysis, whereas time on dialysis to transplantation and odds of short-term graft loss improved in equity after the implementation of the KAS, without compromising disparities in delayed graft function.

436,27384573,"Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common childhood neurobehavioral conditions. Evidence of the negative effects of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) on mental health has not been convincing, although a few studies have found an association between high SSB levels and attention problems in children. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that SSB consumption is associated with ADHD among children. Doctor-diagnosed ADHD cases (n = 173) and non-ADHD controls (n = 159) between age 4 to 15 were recruited. SSB consumption, socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics of the children, as well as of their mothers' characteristics during pregnancy, were collected using a questionnaire. Blood lead levels and polymorphisms of two commonly verified dopaminergic-related genes (the D4 dopamine receptor gene DRD4 and the dopamine transporter gene DAT1) were also analyzed. There was a dose-response relationship between SSB consumption and ADHD. After covariates were adjusted, children who consumed SSBs at moderate levels and high levels had 1.36 and 3.69 odds, respectively, of having ADHD, compared with those who did not consume SSBs (p for trend < 0.05). Similar results were obtained when females were excluded. Our findings highlighted the adverse correlation between SSB consumption and ADHD and indicated a dose-response effect even after covariates were adjusted. "
437,32045936,"A force sensor system was developed to give real-time visual feedback on a range of force. In a prospective observational cross-section study, twenty-two anaesthesia nurses applied cricoid pressure at a target range of 30-40 Newtons for 60 seconds in three sequential steps on manikin: Group A (step 1 blinded, no sensor), Group B (step 2 blinded sensor), Group C (step 3 sensor feedback). A weighing scale was placed below the manikin. This procedure was repeated once again at least 1 week apart. The feedback system used 3 different colours to indicate the force range achieved as below target, achieve target, above target. Significantly higher proportion of target cricoid pressure was achieved with the use of sensor feedback in Group C; 85.9% (95%CI: 82.7%-88.7%) compared to when blinded from sensor in Group B; 31.3% (95%CI: 27.4-35.4%). Cricoid force achieved blind (Group B) exceeded force achieved with feedback (Group C) by a mean of 8.0 (95%CI: 5.9-10.2, p<0.0001) and 6.2 (95%CI:4.1-8.3, p< 0.0001) Newtons in round 1 and 2 respectively. Weighing scale read lower than corresponding force sensor by a mean of 8.4 Newtons (95% CI: 7.1-9.7, p<0.0001) in group B and 5.8 Newtons (95% CI: 4.5-7.1, p<0.0001) in Group C. Force sensor visual feedback system enabled application of reproducible target cricoid pressure with less variability and has potential value in clinical use. Using weighing scale to quantify and train cricoid pressure requires a review. Understanding the force applied is the first step to make cricoid pressure a safe procedure. "
438,32585990,"Efforts to shape the food environment are aimed at reducing diet-related co-morbidities. Front-of-package labeling (FOPL) may support the consumers to make an informed decision at the point of purchase and encourage industry to reformulate food products. The Israeli Ministry of Health (MOH) implemented a unique FOPL system, using two colors: A mandatory warning (red) label alongside a voluntary positive (green) label. An independent Scientific Committee, from academia, the healthcare system, and MOH was appointed to determine the core principles for the positive FOPL. The criteria were based on the Mediterranean diet principles, with adjustments to the Israeli dietary habits, focusing on the health advantages of the food and considering its processing level. The food products eligible for positive FOPL are foods in their natural form or with added spices or herbs, or those that underwent minimal processing, with no food additives. Based on population consumption data, 19.8% of food products were eligible for positive FOPL; of them, 54% were fruits and vegetables, 20% dairy, and 14% grains. An evaluation plan is needed to assess the degree of acceptance of the positive FOPL by the industry, retailers, and the public, and its impact on food consumption and on public health. "

440,7792343,"The presence of a selective attention deficit in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was investigated by administering a trial-by-trial version of the Stroop Color-Naming Task to children, aged 9-12, with ADHD (n = 19) and age-matched normal control children (n = 19). Performance was evaluated on both interference and facilitation components of the task. On the standard version of the task, with equal numbers of color words and neutral words, children with ADHD showed increased Stroop interference (prolongation of color-naming times by color-incongruent stimuli) but normal amounts of facilitation (speeding of color naming by color-congruent stimuli). This finding suggests that children with ADHD show increased disruption of color-naming performance by task-irrelevant information, probably secondary to decreased attentional control over the interference process. In contrast to findings of studies in adults, both groups of children failed to use an attentional strategy to reduce interference when they were administered blocks of trials that varied their expectancy for color word trials. This precluded a direct test of the diminished control hypothesis. There were no significant correlations between abnormal Stroop performance and impairment on the Continuous Performance Test or the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test or measures of IQ or reading performance. The implications of these findings for our understanding of information-processing deficits in children with ADHD and of the neurobiological underpinnings of these deficits are discussed. "
441,34530678,"Asthma scoring tools are used by emergency department (ED) teams to communicate severity of illness. Although most have been validated, none has been found to be sufficiently valid to allow for use across a multidisciplinary team managing pediatric asthma exacerbations. We sought to evaluate the inter-rater reliability of the Clinical Respiratory Score (CRS) among all members of an ED care team. We conducted a retrospective study of children aged 2 to 18 years presenting with an acute asthma exacerbation to an urban pediatric ED over a 2-year period. We determined reliability using two CRS measurements independently documented by two separate providers, 15 min apart. An inter-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to determine overall reliability among users. Subgroup analysis was conducted to determine reliability between types of providers and the six components of the CRS. A total of 9,749 patient encounters were identified and 1,562 (16%) met our inclusion criteria.

442,39312767,"Up to half of the children with new-onset type 1 diabetes present to the hospital with diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening condition that can develop because of diagnostic delay. Three-quarters of Australian children visit their general practitioner (GP) the week before presenting to the hospital with diabetic ketoacidosis. Our prototype, DIRECT-T1DM (Decision-Support for Integrated, Real-Time Evaluation and Clinical Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus), is an electronic clinical decision support tool that promotes immediate point-of-care testing in general practice to confirm the suspicion of diabetes. This avoids laboratory testing, which has been documented internationally as a cause of diagnostic delay. In this investigation, we aimed to pilot and assess the feasibility and acceptability of our prototype to GP end users. We also explored the challenges of diagnosing type 1 diabetes in the Australian general practice context. In total, 4 GPs, a pediatric endocrinologist, and a PhD candidate were involved in conceptualizing the DIRECT-T1DM prototype, which was developed at the Department of General Practice and Primary Care at the University of Melbourne. Furthermore, 6 GPs were recruited via convenience sampling to evaluate the tool. The study involved 3 phases: a presimulation interview, simulated clinical scenarios, and a postsimulation interview. The interview guide was developed using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) as a guide. All phases of the study were video, audio, and screen recorded. Audio recordings were transcribed by the investigating team. Analysis was carried out using CFIR as the underlying framework. Major themes were identified among three domains and 7 constructs of the CFIR: (1) outer setting-time pressure, difficulty in diagnosing pediatric type 1 diabetes, and secondary care considerations influenced GPs' needs regarding DIRECT-T1DM; (2) inner setting-DIRECT-T1DM fits within existing workflows, it has a high relative priority due to its importance in patient safety, and GPs exhibited high tension for change; and (3) innovation-design recommendations included altering coloring to reflect urgency, font style and bolding, specific language, information and guidelines, and inclusion of patient information sheets. End-user acceptability of DIRECT-T1DM was high. This was largely due to its implications for patient safety and its ""real-time"" nature. DIRECT-T1DM may assist in appropriate management of children with new-onset diabetes, which is an uncommon event in general practice, through safety netting. "
443,27900839,"To assess the safety and efficacy of the Gore Septal Occluder (GSO) used for device-closure of significant secundum-type atrial septal defects (ASD II) focusing on pediatric patients. The GSO is a patch-like double disc device. Due to its design, it is assumed to be safe, even when implanted in ASDs with deficient retro-aortic rims. Multicenter retrospective analysis of consecutive children and adolescents with a GSO in situ for at least 12 months according to a 1- to 4-year midterm follow-up. Hundred and seventy three pediatric patients were enrolled. At implantation, median age was 6 years (range 0.7-17.9), median body weight and length were 21 kg (6.4-95) and 119 cm (65-193). Median follow-up period was 20 months (range 12-51). ASD anatomy was comprised of single defects in 131 patients (76%), multi-fenestrated defects in 42 (24%), and deficient retro-aortic rims in 33 (19%). Follow-up confirmed an overall closure-rate of 95.4%. Small residual shunts were reported in eight patients (4.6%) without need for any re-intervention. Complications were classified as minor events both during the initial procedure (9 patients, 5.2%) and on follow-up (another 9 patients), including transient AV block II in three patients (1.8%) and four snare-retrievals (2.4%) during the initial procedure. Periprocedural and midterm follow-up data have shown the GSO to be effective and safe for ASD device closure in children and adolescents. GSO may be considered the first-choice device in deficient retro-aortic rims and multi-fenestrated defects, when covering most of the atrial septum is necessary. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. "
444,33785404,"Wraparound is a common method for coordinating care for children and adolescents with serious emotional disorders (SED), with nearly 100,000 youths served annually in the United States. The current systematic review and meta-analysis estimated effects on youth outcomes (symptoms, functioning, school, juvenile justice, and residential placement) and costs. A literature search identified 17 peer-reviewed and gray literature studies meeting criteria, which were coded on characteristics of sample, design, implementation, and outcomes. Random effects modeling was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 3.0. Effect sizes were calculated using Hedges g. Homogeneity of effects were assessed using Q statistics. Medium-sized effects favored Wraparound-enrolled youths for costs (g = 0.391, CI = 0.282-0.500, p < .001), residential outcomes (g = 0.413, CI = 0.176-0.650, p = .001), and school functioning (g = 0.397, CI = 0.106-0.688, p = .007); small effects were found for mental health symptoms (g = 0.358, CI = 0.030-0.687, p = .033) and functioning (g = 0.315, CI = 0.086-0.545, p = .007). Larger effects were found for peer-reviewed studies, quasi-experimental designs, samples with a larger percentage of youths of color, and Wraparound conditions with higher fidelity. Results indicate positive effects for Wraparound, especially for maintaining youths with SED in the home and community. However, many studies showed methodological weaknesses, and fidelity measurement was largely absent, suggesting a need for additional research. Nonetheless, the results should aid decisions around resource allocation, referral practices, and system partnerships among child psychiatrists and other behavioral health professionals. "

The survey included 29 questions assessing: demographics, methods of image acquisition, parameters routinely evaluated and reported, and methods used to assess chamber sizes, valves, and ventricular function. There were 47/85 (55%) responses; 83% were academic centers and 77% in an urban setting. Wide variations exist in acquisition method (clips versus sweeps) and color scale settings. The most commonly used methods for left ventricular (LV) function are M-mode shortening fraction, qualitative assessment, and Doppler Tissue Imaging. The most commonly used parameter for right ventricular function is qualitative. LV mass is routinely measured by the majority of centers with variations in methods of calculation. Conversely, while a minority measure left atrial volume, there is consensus regarding the preferred method. While multiple techniques exist for assessing valves, qualitative assessment is reported to be the preferred method. Despite quantification guidelines, there is a lack of uniformity in performance and analysis of pediatric echocardiograms. Further studies are needed to determine why variations exist and whether development of consensus guidelines might improve interpretation, consistency and quality of reports, patient care, and provide a standardized system allowing for comparative research among centers.

446,25998217,"To review the literature regarding electronic cigarettes and discuss potential implications and need for advocacy for the pediatric otolaryngologist. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are battery-operated devices that deliver nicotine-containing vapors via inhalation. Research on the health related consequences of e-cigarettes is ongoing and safety has yet to be established. E-cigarettes are not presently under the regulation of any national governing body with wide accessibility to minors. Use of these products has substantially increased since arrival to the market, particularly within the adolescent population. These products are marketed via various platforms including television, Internet and social media. Hundreds of flavors are offered and e-cigarettes are packaged in various colors. Not only are the ill health effects and addictive quality of nicotine concerning, these products have the potential to serve as a gateway for minors to tobacco use. The relationship between tobacco use, secondhand smoke exposure and otolaryngology specific diseases has well been defined. As use of electronic cigarettes increases, pediatric otolaryngologists should be aware of the ongoing literature regarding these products and to be prepared to counsel families accordingly. The use of e-cigarettes among teenagers, potential implications of secondhand vapor exposure from parents and friends, and concerns this may encourage adolescents to utilize conventional tobacco products needs to be considered.

447,29090844,"Retinal imaging is an important and effective tool for detecting retinal diseases. However, degraded images caused by the aberrations of the eye can disguise lesions, so that a diseased eye can be mistakenly diagnosed as normal. In this work, we propose a new image enhancement method to improve the quality of degraded images. A new method is used to enhance degraded-quality fundus images. In this method, the image is converted from the input RGB colour space to LAB colour space and then each normalized component is enhanced using contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization. Human visual system (HVS)-based fundus image quality assessment, combined with diagnosis by experts, is used to evaluate the enhancement. The study included 191 degraded-quality fundus photographs of 143 subjects with optic media opacity. Objective quality assessment of image enhancement (range: 0-1) indicated that our method improved colour retinal image quality from an average of 0.0773 (variance 0.0801) to an average of 0.3973 (variance 0.0756). Following enhancement, area under curves (AUC) were 0.996 for the glaucoma classifier, 0.989 for the diabetic retinopathy (DR) classifier, 0.975 for the age-related macular degeneration (AMD) classifier and 0.979 for the other retinal diseases classifier. The relatively simple method for enhancing degraded-quality fundus images achieves superior image enhancement, as demonstrated in a qualitative HVS-based image quality assessment. This retinal image enhancement may, therefore, be employed to assist ophthalmologists in more efficient screening of retinal diseases and the development of computer-aided diagnosis. "
448,3358229,"A nutritional anaemia survey was carried out on 610 11-year-old coloured, black and white schoolchildren in urban and rural communities in the western Cape. The mean (+/- 1 SD) haemoglobin concentration was 13.0 +/- 1.2 g/dl. The coloured and black subgroups considered together had a significantly lower mean haemoglobin concentration than the white subgroup (12.8 +/- 1.2 g/dl v. 13.4 +/- 1.0 g/dl) (F = 37.47; P less than 0.0001). The urban population as a whole had a significantly lower geometric mean (1 SD range) serum ferritin concentration than the rural population (25.6 (13.5-48.6) micrograms/l v. 34.1 (21.3-54.6) micrograms/l) (F = 42.94; P less than 0.0001). The lowest geometric mean serum ferritin values were found in the urban coloured (23.1 (11.5-46.4) micrograms/l) and urban black schoolchildren (23.7 (13.2-42.6) micrograms/l), with figures of less than 12 micrograms/l in 11.7% and 12.5% respectively. Although 28% of the children had red cell folate values below the recommended lower limit of normal (175 ng/ml), probability plot analysis of the data suggested that folate deficiency was not a major problem in the study population. The calculated daily iron and folate intakes were below the age-related recommended dietary allowance (RDA) in all the subgroups, yet anaemia was relatively uncommon. These findings suggest that the RDA values are too high. Overall the prevalence of nutritional anaemia was low and only the urban coloured subgroup showed significant second populations with low haemoglobin and serum ferritin measurements. "
449,38958831,"This review explores the emerging evidence regarding pathogenesis, future trajectories, treatment options, and phenotypes of youth-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D). Youth-onset T2D is increasing in incidence and prevalence worldwide, disproportionately affecting First Nations communities, socioeconomically disadvantaged youth, and people of colour. Youth-onset T2D differs in pathogenesis to later-onset T2D and progresses more rapidly. It is associated with more complications, and these occur earlier. While there are limited licensed treatment options available, the available medications also appear to have a poorer response in youth with T2D. Multiple interacting factors likely contribute to this rising prevalence, as well as the increased severity of the condition, including structural inequities, increasing obesity and sedentary lifestyles, and intergenerational transmission from in-utero exposure to maternal hyperglycemia and obesity. Youth-onset T2D is also associated with stigma and poorer mental health, and these impact clinical management. There is an urgent need to develop effective interventions to prevent youth-onset T2D and enhance engagement of affected youth. It is also critical to better understand the differing phenotypes of youth-onset T2D, to effectively target treatments, and to address intergenerational transmission in high-risk populations. "
450,32335599,"Inherited macular dystrophies constitute a group of diseases characterized by bilateral central visual loss with symmetrical macular abnormalities usually presenting in the first two decades of life. The aim of this study were to find out the demographic characteristics and disease pattern of inherited retinal dystrophies in subjects attending retina outpatient department in a tertiary care center. An observational study among twenty-six participants diagnosed as macular dystrophy visiting a tertiary care centre in Nepal, during January 2018 to June 2018 were included in the study. Detailed history, slit lamp examination, dilated fundus examination, coloured fundus photography, full field electroretinogram, multifocal electroretinogram, automated visual field and colour vision were done. A total of 52 eyes of 26 subjects were diagnosed with macular dystrophy. The male to female ratio was 1:1. The mean age of presentation was 28.38 years. Most common symptom was blurring of vision seen in 96.15%.The mean visual acuity was 0.67 log mar units in right eye and 0.71 log mar units in the left eye. The most common macular dystrophy was cone dystrophy followed by adult vitelliform macular dystrophy and Stargardts dystrophy. Cone dystrophy is the most common followed by Stargardt's disease and adult vitelliform macular dystrophy. Most presented in the first two decades of life and the most common presenting symptom was blurring of vision. "
451,35103751,"To explore the relationship of color vision deficiency with myopia progression and axial elongation in Chinese primary school children during a five-year cohort study. A total of 2849 grade 1 students (aged 7.1 ± 0.4 years) from 11 primary schools were enrolled and followed up for five years. Cycloplegic autorefraction and axial length were measured annually. Color vision testing was performed using Ishihara's test and the City University color vision test. The prevalence of color vision deficiency was 1.68%, with 2.81% in boys and 0.16% in girls. Color-deficient cases consisted of 91.6% deutan and 8.3% protan. Over the five years, the cumulative incidence of myopia was 35.4% (17/48) in the color-vision deficiency group, which was lower than the 56.7% (1017/1794) in the color normal group (P = 0.004). Over the five-year study period, the change in spherical equivalent refraction in the color vision-deficiency group (-1.81 D) was also significantly lower than that in the color normal group (-2.41 D) (P = 0.002). The lower incidence and slower progression of myopia in children with color-vision deficiency over the five-year follow-up period suggest that color-deficient individuals are less susceptible to myopia onset and development.

453,17172063,"Ventricular noncompaction, characterized by numerous, prominent ventricular trabeculations and deep intratrabecular recesses, is thought to be due to an arrest of myocardial morphogenesis. We report eight patients with ventricular noncompaction diagnosed at our center in the previous one year. Two patients had associated congenital cardiac anomalies while the others were without coexisting cardiac abnormalities. Both ventricles were involved in one patient, only the right ventricle in one, and only the left ventricle in six patients. Seven patients had initially been diagnosed as having different types of cardiomyopathies. In conclusion, based on our limited experience, we propose that during the differential diagnosis of cardiomyopathies, ventricular noncompaction should be considered. "

To do this, we have developed a new method of surgical repair using 2 pennant-shaped rim flaps. Six constricted ear patients underwent correctional ear plasty using this method. Four of the deformities were Tanzer group 2b and 2 were group 3. Our surgical procedure elongated the patients' helix from 7 to 22 mm, leaving them with smooth curvature and a good color match to the adjoining skin. "

456,26002141,"To describe a case series of transient oxygen desaturation measured by pulse oximetry during the intravenous infusion of indocyanine green to enhance transpupillary thermotherapy in treating retinoblastoma after ophthalmic artery chemosurgery. Retrospective descriptive case series. The intravenous administration of indocyanine green for ophthalmic angiography resulted in a transient drop in oxygen saturation as measured by Nellcor fingertip pulse oximetry in three children with retinoblastoma receiving indocyanine green-guided transpupillary thermotherapy. The magnitude of reduction ranged from 92% to 94% from an initial reading of 99% to 100% in each case, with an average duration of 3 minutes. Concurrent measurement of blood pressure, pulse, and expired CO2 showed no changes during this process. Administration of intravenous indocyanine green resulted in a transient desaturation by oximetry during transpupillary thermotherapy for children with retinoblastoma under anesthesia because of the fluorescent dye's absorption of red light in a manner similar to that of deoxygenated hemoglobin, thereby leading to transient instrument misinterpretation and miscalculation of arterial oxygenation.

457,1813676,"The developmental mode of eating disorder was studied by investigating 48 cases in detail. After various factors were examined, it appeared certain that the intensification of adolescent turmoil as well as the neurotic level of determinants can become the strong driving force and the cause of eating disorder. Among most cases, the less sprightly life is dominant around preadolescence, which affects the orientation of psychopathology in adolescence. Under the influence of the developmental mode in preadolescence, every case determines how to utilize adolescent mentality (asceticism and indulgence colored by masochism and defiance vs. obedience). With this standpoint, the author illustrates how there may occur branching out of the subtype of eating disorder. "
458,24725581,"To evaluate the usefulness of colonic ultrasonography (US) in assessing the extent and activity of disease in pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) and to compare US findings with clinical and endoscopic features. Consecutive pediatric patients (n = 60) with a diagnosis of UC and suspected disease flare-up were prospectively enrolled; of these, 50 patients were eligible for the study. All underwent clinical evaluation, bowel US with color Doppler examination and colonoscopy. Blind US was performed the day before endoscopy in all patients. The US assessed variables were bowel wall thickness >3 mm, bowel wall stratification, vascularity, presence of haustra coli, and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. The endoscopic extent of disease was independently confirmed in 47 patients by US that yielded a 90% concordance with endoscopy (95% CI 0.82-0.96). Multiple regression analysis showed that US measurements with an independent predictive value of severity at endoscopy were increased bowel wall thickness (P < .0008), increased vascularity (P < .002), loss of haustra (P = .031), and loss of stratification of the bowel wall (P = .021). Each variable was assigned a value of 1 if present. The US score strongly correlated with clinical (r = 0.94) and endoscopic activity (r = 0.90) of disease (P < .0001). Colonic US is a useful first line noninvasive tool to assess the extent and activity of disease in children with UC and to estimate the severity of a flare-up, prior to further invasive tests. "
459,8212106,"Perceptions of the causes of malaria, its treatment and prevention were studied among 996 adults, selected randomly from 73 villages and hamlets in a rural area of The Gambia. Structured questionnaires and other interview techniques were used for data collection. Malaria has no specific name in the study area; it is referred to commonly as Fula kajewo (Fula fever). Only 28% of the respondents knew that mosquitoes transmitted malaria. However, most people believed correctly that August to October was the main malaria season. Eighty-six per cent of the subjects were bed net users. The majority of nets were produced locally, usually white in colour and made of sheeting fabrics. Usage of nets was correlated with ethnic group, age and polygamy but not with education, income, occupation or ownership of certain items which indicate high social status. Analysis of expenditure on mosquito coils indicated that non-users of nets spent 43% more on coils than did users. Bed nets have been used for a long time in the study area; 98% of users saw their parents using them during their childhood. In the Gambia, malaria specialists at the Medical Research Council Laboratories oversaw interviews of 996 men and women from, 73 villages and hamlets on the south bank of the River Gambia to learn their perceptions of the causes of malaria and of its treatment and prevention. No specific local term for malaria existed. The most common term used by all ethnic groups, except the Fulas, was Fula kejewo (Fula fever). Just 28% of all adults knew that mosquitoes transmit malaria. Men were more likely to know the real cause of malaria than women (p .001). Knowledge about the cause of malaria increased with education p =.01). Most people (90%) knew that malaria transmission occurs most often during August-October. 86% of adults and 81% of their children less than 10 years old used bed nets. Girls were more likely to sleep under bed nets than boys (p = .005). Local tailors made most bed nets with either second hand or new fabrics. They tended to be made of sheeting fabrics and white in color. Most adults were willing to treat their bed nets with the insecticide permethrin to protect against mosquitoes. Ethnic group (Fulas less likely, p .001), age (older people more likely, p .001), and polygamy (p = .002) were correlated with bed net use. Education, income, and occupation or ownership of items indicating high social status were not correlated with bed net use. Nonusers of bed nets spent 43% more on mosquito coils, used to smoke out mosquitoes from rooms before going to sleep, than did users (p = .001). Almost all adults (98%) remembers their parents using bed nets when they were children. The bed nets users who were at least 70 years old said that the Mandinkas mainly used bed nets. These findings should prove useful to the government as it develops a national impregnated bed net program to control malaria in rural areas. "
460,15480731,"Forensic investigations in dog attacks usually involve the examination of bite marks and toothprints, the dog's stomach and pathological methods. For identification of the offending dog we evaluated canine STR typing of saliva traces on dog bite marks. The specificity of 15 canine-specific STRs was tested on human-canine DNA mixtures prior to an applied study in which 52 cases of dog bites were investigated. The first-aid wound bandages as well as swab samples from the surrounding area of the wound were used for DNA analyses. Generally, it was possible to obtain a canine-specific STR profile from the dog's saliva left on the wound area, even when high background of human DNA was present (blood). Interestingly, we found canine STR typing to be more successful when the bandages and swabs showed high amounts of human blood, i.e. when the dog bite was severe. Canine saliva was then sometimes visible as white-coloured secretion on the human blood surface. Less severe bite cases, which did not result in bleeding wounds, showed less success in obtaining useful STR results, probably due to the fact that the surface of the wounds may have been treated before the victims consulted medical aid which therefore removed the canine cells.

461,8312338,"In patients who have undergone successful orthotopic heart transplantation, echocardiography has the potential to be a noninvasive method for rejection surveillance that would reduce the frequency and guide the timing of endomyocardial biopsies, as well as allow for more frequent monitoring, with less cost and risk to the patient. To determine the applicability of echocardiography to detect moderate to severe rejection in children, 26 two-dimensional-guided M-mode echocardiograms with Doppler/color flow mapping were performed within 24 hours of endomyocardial biopsy. M-mode echocardiograms of the left ventricle were digitized and analyzed with a computer-assisted measurement format for left ventricular size, mass, and wall motion in systole and diastole. These echocardiographic parameters were clustered and analyzed by a unique echocardiographic scoring algorithm blinded to the biopsy interpretation. In eight cases in which findings of biopsies were consistent with moderate to severe rejection, left ventricular mass was increased and indexes of systolic and diastolic function were depressed compared with the remainder of the cases (n = 18), in which findings of biopsies included either no evidence or mild evidence of rejection. The echocardiographic score of the group with moderate to severe rejection was significantly greater than the score of the group that was normal or had mild rejection (5.4 +/- 0.7 vs 2.2 +/- 0.3; p < 0.001). With rejection prospectively defined as an echocardiographic score of greater than or equal to score 4, echocardiography achieved 88% sensitivity and 83% specificity in detecting moderate to severe rejection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) "
462,9893287,"To determine the usefulness of a few types of photic stimulation in patients with photo-convulsive response. A clinical electroencephalographic study was conducted in nine children who developed convulsions and other symptoms while they watched the TV animation and were subsequently treated at the hospital. Photic stimulation was applied with their eyes open or closed. Another photic stimulation was applied with the video tape of the animation. A photoparoxysmal response (PPR) was never seen in the electroencephalographs (EEG) in any of these patients when photic stimulation was applied with their eyes closed, while PPR was seen in three of seven patients when photic stimulation was applied with their eyes open. Two patients (siblings) showed no specific abnormality when photic stimulation was applied with their eyes either open or closed. However, myoclonus and PPR appeared when the EEG was conducted while they watched the video tape of the animation under supervised conditions. In a society where people are exposed to abundant TV games, TV animation or videos, self-restraint or regulations of frequent use of flickering scenes is thought to be necessary. However, it is also thought to be necessary to conduct EEG by applying photic stimulation, not only with the eyes closed, but also with the eyes opened or by applying flickering red light stimulation, which is emitted from a strong light source, or a combination of two colors, such as red and blue or red and green, in patients with suspected photosensitivity.

463,22776155,"To investigate intrinsic stiffness changes using real-time sonoelastography (RTS) in the medial gastrocnemius muscle (GCM) after rehabilitation therapy with botulinum toxin type A (BTA) injection in spastic cerebral palsy (CP). Prospective study using ultrasonography and RTS. An inpatient rehabilitation clinic. Children (N=17) with spastic CP (mean age, 57±22y, age range, 26-110mo). Rehabilitation therapy and intramuscular injection of BTA in both medial and lateral GCMs. RTS was obtained on the medial GCM, and the elastic pattern of the medial GCM was graded from RTS 1 (purple to green: soft) to RTS 4 (red: stiff) on the basis of color-scaled RTS. RTS score, color histogram, Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) score of the ankle plantar flexor muscles, and Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) score were obtained before intervention and 4 weeks after intervention. The correlations among RTS score, GMFM, and MAS score were determined. Intrarater reliability was also evaluated. Before and at 4 weeks after intervention, the mean RTS score decreased from 3.4 to 1.5 (P<.05), median red pixel intensity decreased from 112.5 to 101.3 (P<.05), median blue pixel intensity increased from 82.6 to 90.4 (P<.05), mean MAS score of the ankle decreased from 2.7 to 1.3 (P<.05), and mean GMFM score increased from 54.55% to 62.32%. Significant correlations were observed between the RTS score and the MAS score. Intrarater reliability was high. Our results suggest that more information about the change of spastic muscle in CP after rehabilitation treatment with BTA may be gained by estimating muscle stiffness using RTS combined with clinical scale measurements.

464,2106224,"Recent reports describe formation of collateral vessels in children who have hepatic artery thrombosis after liver transplantation. This led us to reevaluate the role of duplex Doppler imaging in this population. Among 135 pediatric liver transplant patients, 20 had arteriography for suspected hepatic artery thrombosis. Duplex and/or color Doppler imaging was performed in 13 of these children. The Doppler examination failed to show hepatic artery signals in five patients. Arteriography showed hepatic artery thrombosis in all five. In three of these, subsequent Doppler examinations showed reappearance of arterial Doppler signals. Arteriography confirmed the interval development of collaterals. Hepatic artery signals were found on the Doppler examinations of the remaining eight patients. Four had normal arteriograms, but the remaining four had hepatic artery thrombosis with collateral formation. Patients with hepatic artery thrombosis and collateral circulation tended to have increased diastolic flow (decreased resistive index). In addition, early scans clearly identified patients with complete thrombosis before collateral formation. On the basis of our preliminary experience, a child with a liver transplant and a clinical history strongly suggestive of hepatic artery compromise should have arteriography despite an apparently normal Doppler examination. "
465,7785579,"The purpose of this study was to determine the significance of portal vein pulsatility on duplex Doppler waveforms in children with end-stage hepatic failure undergoing liver transplantation. Thirty-eight children with end-stage hepatic decompensation were examined with color-assisted spectral Doppler waveform analysis of the hepatic artery and the portal vein. Correlation was made with age, duration of illness, clinical and pathologic diagnosis, and presence of portal hypertension. Findings were compared with those for six patients with acute viral hepatitis and 12 healthy control subjects. Portal vein pulsatility was noted in all 36 patients in whom portal vein flow was detected by Doppler imaging. The majority of these (34) had clinical or sonographic evidence of portal hypertension. In two patients, no portal vein flow was identified in the liver hilum; both had a large portosystemic shunt through collaterals or surgical graft. Significantly increased pulsatility of the hepatic artery waveform (resistive index [RI] = 0.89 +/- 0.15, p < .0001) was seen in patients with end-stage liver disease. In contrast, no portal vein pulsatility and normal hepatic artery pulsatility (RI = 0.60 +/- 0.11) was noted in all patients with acute hepatitis and control subjects. Portal vein waveform pulsatility is 94% sensitive and 90% specific for portal hypertension in end-stage liver disease. "
466,12437558,"A previously healthy 7-year-old boy presented with polyarthritis and skin lesions. Multiple, skin- to pink-colored, firm papules were noted on the periungual areas, hands, feet, and nose. There was swelling of the proximal interphalangeal joints, wrists, elbows, ankles, and knees. A skin biopsy specimen revealed dermal fibrosis and interspersed histiocytes and lymphocytes. These findings were consistent with fibroblastic rheumatism, a condition characterized by cutaneous nodules and a symmetric polyarthritis. He was treated with methotrexate and corticosteroids with improvement in the symptoms of his arthritis and skin lesions. This early treatment was beneficial in our patient. "
467,36389468,"We present a conceptual model of the ways in which built and social environments shape the development of self-regulation in early childhood. Importantly, in centering children of color growing up in historically disinvested neighborhoods, we first describe how systemic structures of racism and social stratification have shaped neighborhood built and social environment features. We then present evidence linking these neighborhood features to children's development of self-regulation. Furthermore, we take a multilevel approach to examining three potential pathways linking neighborhood contexts to self-regulation: school environment and resources, home environment and resources, and child health behaviors. Finally, we consider how racial-ethnic-cultural strengths and multilevel interventions have the potential to buffer children's development of self-regulation in disinvested neighborhood contexts. Advancing multilevel approaches to understand the development of self-regulation among children of color living in historically disinvested neighborhoods is an important step in efforts to promote equity in health and education.

468,35410742,"There is a risk of gaseous and solid micro-embolus formation during transcatheter cardiac interventions and surgery in children with congenital heart disease (CHD). Our aim was to study the burden of high-intensity transient signals (HITS) during these procedures in infants. We used a novel color M-mode Doppler (CMD) technique by NeoDoppler, a non-invasive ultrasound system based on plane wave transmissions for transfontanellar continuous monitoring of cerebral blood flow in infants. The system displays CMD with 24 sample volumes and a Doppler spectrogram. Infants with CHD undergoing transcatheter interventions (n = 15) and surgery (n = 13) were included. HITS were manually detected based on an ""embolic signature"" in the CMD with corresponding intensity increase in the Doppler spectrogram. Embolus-to-blood ratio (EBR) defined HITS size. A total of 1169 HITS with a median EBR of 9.74 dB (interquartile range [IQR]: 5.10-15.80 dB) were detected. The median number of HITS in the surgery group was 45 (IQR: 11-150), while in the transcatheter group the median number was 12 (IQR: 7-24). During cardiac surgery, the highest number of HITS per hour was seen from initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass to aortic X-clamp. In this study we detected frequent HITS and determined the feasibility of using NeoDoppler monitoring for HITS detection. "
469,12875684,"To evaluate the dimensions of atrial septal aneurysm (ASA), the presence and characteristics of interatrial shunt, the movement of the wall of the aneurysm, and correlation between these findings and sign and/or symptoms suggesting embolism in Manisa, a district of a western Anatolian city of Turkey. Two thousand five hundred cases were examined by routine transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in both pediatric and adult cardiology outpatient clinics. ASA was detected in 20 cases and evaluated by two-dimensional color Doppler echocardiography (CDE). The length of the base, the maximum radius and the maximum displacement of ASA were measured. The shunt between the atria was examined by CDE. In cases where a shunt could not be found, galactose and palmitic acid was injected. Standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and exercise stress test were also performed. No clinical signs or symptoms were found, suggesting a systemic or cerebral embolism. The maximum displacement of ASA was between 2 and 5 mm. All of the aneurysms were localized in the right atrium, and the walls of the aneurysm did not move beyond the base of the left atrium during the maximum displacement. Interatrial shunt was detected in 14 of 20 patients (70%) by CDE and in the remaining six cases by contrast TTE. Frequent ventricular ectopic beats were observed in one patient. During routine TTE we observed 0.8% asymptomatic ASA in our population. The use of a contrast agent was found to be a valuable additional method in patients with ASA when the shunt could not be detected by CDE. The risk for embolism is not high when the maximum displacement of the wall of ASA was 5 mm or less and no bulge into the left atrium was observed. Based on our experience with this method, TTE is easy to perform, well-tolerated and acceptable. "
470,21888167,"The study was aimed at finding out the pattern of referrals to ophthalmology outpatient department (OPD) in a teaching hospital and to provide guidelines for the improvement. Patients referred from various departments of a medical college situated in central India for ophthalmic evaluation were scrutinised for age, sex, diagnosis and the referring OPD. Out of 730 patients referred, 350 (47.95%) were males and 380 (52.02%) were females. The highest referral was found in the age group 45-64 years (22.60%). The highest referral was from the medicine OPD (58.22%) and the lowest was from psychiatry (2.05%). Maximum patients were referred for fundus examination (27.40%). While there were 280 patients (38.36%) who had refractive error, no diagnosis was established in 147 cases (20.14%). Ophthalmic opinion definitely helped patients as well as physician in the management of the patients. The study also stresses on some areas deficient, when unnecessary referrals could be avoided by arranging short annual refreshers courses to acquire basic skills in ophthalmology like visual acuity testing, colour vision, ophthalmoscopy and the diagnosis of common ocular conditions. We believe this kind of activity will help to make our services more efficient and cost effective. "
471,28899405,"Congenital erythropoietic porphyria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that affects heme-porphyrin synthesis. This disorder is due to the genetic defect of uroporphyrinogen III cosynthase. This defect results in the accumulation of high amounts of uroporphyrin I in all tissues, leading to clinical manifestations ranging from mild to severe chronic damage of the skin, cartilage and bone. Hypertrichosis, erythrodontia and reddish-colored urine are often present, as well as hemolytic anemia accompanied by hepatosplenomegaly. Here, we present a case of a 5-year-old male child of Middle Eastern origin who had been diagnosed as having alpha thalassemia and was undergoing chronic blood transfusions. He later presented with hypopigmented skin lesions and atrophy post-photosensitivity, persistent red-colored urine and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory investigations showed a high level of porphyrin metabolites in his plasma and erythrocytes. As a result, he was diagnosed as having Congenital erythropoietic porphyria. Here, we diagnose a case of congenital erythropoietic porphyria which was initially missed, although the clinical features were clear (red-colored urine, hepatosplenomegaly and hemolytic anemia were present since birth, and skin manifestations appeared at the age of 22 months after being exposed to sunlight). After a DNA test was performed, the patient was initially diagnosed as having alpha thalassemia. We identified two causes of hemolytic anemia (congenital erythropoietic porphyria and alpha thalassemia) in this patient. The diagnosis of congenital erythropoietic porphyria was missed up until the child turned 5 years old. To our knowledge, this is the first case of hemolytic anemia to be reported with a diagnosis of both congenital erythropoietic porphyria and alpha thalassemia. "

We develop an item response theory (IRT) approach to integrate multiple task variables together to improve measurement precision of the underlying construct. We apply this approach to create an integrative measure of childhood inhibitory control, and study impacts of pre/post-natal lead exposure. Using data from a prospective cohort based in Mexico (N = 533), we created an inhibitory control scale that integrates accuracy and reaction time information from four inhibitory control tasks (Go/NoGo Letter, Go/NoGo Neutral, Go/NoGo Happy, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Color-Word Interference Test, Condition 3). Using a generalized partial credit item response theory model, we estimated an inhibitory control index for each participant. We then assessed adjusted associations between umbilical cord blood and 4-year lead and childhood inhibitory control. We developed a resampling approach to incorporate error estimates from the inhibitory control variable to confirm the consistency of the lead-inhibitory control associations. We modeled time-varying associations of lead with each inhibitory control measure separately. Participants had a median age of 9 years; 51.4% were males. Umbilical cord blood [-0.06 (95% CI: -0.11, -0.01)] and 4-year lead [-0.07 (95% CI: -0.12, -0.02)] were associated with inhibitory control index at 8-10 years. A resampling approach confirmed that 4-year lead was consistently associated with childhood inhibitory control index. Umbilical cord blood and 4-year lead were each associated with 3 out of 8 measures in separate models. This is the first application of IRT in environmental epidemiology to create a latent variable for inhibitory control that integrates accuracy and reaction time information from multiple, related tasks. This framework can be applied to other correlated neurobehavioral assessments or other phenotype data. "
473,38500311,"Pediatric longitudinal melanonychia (LM) can exhibit atypical features that mimic red-flag signs for subungual melanoma in adults and lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Nail biopsy may be unnecessary if clinical inspection and dermoscopy suggest a benign nature. We searched PubMed and Embase from inception to February 2023 for studies of any design reporting either the number or proportion of clinical and dermoscopic features in at least five children (≤18 years) with LM. Non-English articles, reviews, and abstracts were excluded. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to collate all existing data. A total of 1218 articles were screened and 24 studies with 1391 pediatric patients were included. Nevus was the most common diagnosis (86.3%). The most prevalent sites were fingernails (76.2%) and first digits (45.4%). Pooled proportions of common features were: dark-color bands (69.8%), multi-colored bands (47.6%), broad bandwidth (41.1%), pseudo-Hutchinson sign (41.0%), irregular patterns (38.1%), Hutchinson sign (23.7%), dots and globules (22.5%), nail dystrophy (18.2%), and triangular sign (10.9%). Outcomes included progression (widening or darkening, 29.9%), stability (23.3%), and spontaneous regression (narrowing or fading, 19.9%). Only eight cases of subungual melanoma in situ were reported, and no invasive melanomas were identified. Although atypical characteristics are common in pediatric LM, the probability of malignant transformation is exceedingly low. Appropriate evaluation and management of pediatric LM includes careful clinical and dermoscopic inspection with attention to benign features followed by long-term interval follow-up. "
474,29533276,"In this observation, we report an unusual presentation of a pilomatricoma in an 8-year-old girl who was initially referred to the department of vascular medicine for diagnosis and care of a suspected mixed lymphatic venous malformation. The lesion on her left shoulder presented as a giant bluish-purple red solitary mass, painful and rapidly growing, measuring 7 cm in anteroposterior diameter. This mass did not present the typical characteristics of a lymphatic venous malformation but exhibited warning signs of malignancy on clinical examination and imaging. The diagnosis of pilomatricoma was reached by fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the mass, showing mummified ""ghost"" squamous cells and a granulomatous inflammatory reaction stroma with scattered multinucleated giant cells and no sign of malignancy. Complete surgical excision associated with plastic surgery was curative. Diagnostic and management approach to skin lesion in childhood is subject of great concern for health care professionals, including dermatologists and vascular medicine specialists who may be confronted with this atypical presentation of one of the most common causes of superficial neck masses in children.

475,8295862,"Composite flour blends containing wheat (W), fababean (F), cottonseed and sesame flours were formulated to provide the FAO/WHO/UNU protein requirements for the 2-5 year old child, and evaluated in pan and flat bread applications. Water absorption of composite flour doughs was up to 35% greater than the control but gluten strength and slurry viscosities were markedly reduced. Loaf volume and specific volume of pan breads prepared from composite flours were 25-60% less than that of the control bread but flat breads tolerated the protein supplements extremely well. The W/F flat bread, containing 27% of fababean flour, received acceptable taste, texture and colour scores and was only slightly inferior to the control in puffing and layer separation. Additions of cottonseed or sesame flours to the W/F blend failed to improve sensory properties of the flat breads. "
476,36626525,"Aicardi syndrome is a genetic malformation syndrome with a triad of dysgenesis or agenesis of the corpus callosum, distinctive chorioretinal lacunae and infantile spasms. It is a rare developmental disorder first described in 1965. The disease affects 1 in 100,000 live births. We describe a 34-month-old girl diagnosed with Aicardi Syndrome. Based on the results of color images of the fundus, medical history as well as the analysis of karyotype and DNA microarrays, the patient was diagnosed with Aicardi's syndrome. Additionally an B-scan ultrasonography and an electrophysiological test was performed. Fundoscopic examination revealed optic disc colobomas in both eyes, extensive chorioretinal lacunae at the posterior pole with retinal pigment epithelium regrouping and atrophy. Flash visual evoked potentials (FVEP) P2 amplitude was lower than normal range. B-scan ultrasonography revealed an optic disc lesion consistent with optic disk coloboma. Children with congenital central nervous system malformations should undergo regular ophthalmic checkups to facilitate diagnosis and determine prognosis of visual function development. "

478,32666167,"To evaluate ocular findings, contrast sensitivity, color perception, and macular and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This prospective study included a group of 37 patients aged 6-16 years diagnosed with combined ADHD and a healthy control group of 37 children. The participants underwent an ophthalmological examination. Color vision testing was administered using the Ishihara plates test. Contrast sensitivity test was performed using the Functional Acuity Contrast Test. Macular thickness and RNFL thickness were measured by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. No significant difference was found between the patient and control groups with regard to ocular findings, color vision, and convergence insufficiency (p > 0.05). Contrast sensitivity level was significantly lower at four out of five spatial frequencies (1.5, 3, 12, and 18 cpd) in the patient group compared to the control group. The RNFL thickness in nasal quadrant and macular thickness was significantly higher in the healthy control group compared to the ADHD group. Contrast sensitivity levels and the nasal quadrant RNFL thickness were significantly lower in the patient group compared to the control group. Based on the findings of the study, we suggest that the level of contrast in the tools used by ADHD patients in daily life settings should be enhanced. "

480,8521331,"The portal vein (PV) velocity was measured by duplex Doppler ultrasound to predict the severity of portal hypertension. A total of 143 patients with liver cirrhosis were studied from January 1991 to June 1992. There were 104 males and 39 females with a mean age of 52 years old (range 23-76). The maximal PV velocity was significantly lower in patients with moderate and severe varices, cardiac varices, red-color signs on varix, esophagitis and congestive gastropathy. The patients with bleeding esophageal varices or upper gastrointestinal tract were found to have a significantly maximal PV velocity. Comparing patients without ascites or victims with controllable ascites. The maximal PV velocity in Child's C or mortality cases was also significantly lower than that in Child's A, Child's B and surviving cases. If we set the cut off value of PV velocity at 15 cm/sec, we could get the accuracy of 67.8%, 62.2%, 67.8% and 73.5% in the prediction of massive ascites, varices severity, Child C class and mortality respectively. In conclusion, PV velocity may reflect the severity of clinical portal hypertension in cirrhotic patients; it could be a prognostic factor in cirrhotic patients. "
481,35319572,"Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) and restrictive cardiomyopathies (RCM) are rare diseases with high morbidity and mortality in the pediatric age group, particularly the restrictive. They can be diagnosed at any age even in fetal life, in isolation or association with other cardiomyopathies or congenital heart disease. The causes may be genetic, neuromuscular, metabolic, storage, or idiopathic disorders. The main morphological characteristic of LVNC is the presence of a non-compact myocar dium with numerous prominent trabeculations and deep recesses, which may results in myocardial dysfunction, malignant arrhythmias and thromboembolism. On the other hand, in RCM there is an abnormal myocardial stiffness, which generates a restrictive ventricular filling and atrial dilatation secondary. Clinically it manifested by severe diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, arrhyth mias and sudden death. For both cardiomyopathies, the Doppler color echocardiography, electro cardiography and Holter monitoring of arrhythmias are the gold standard for diagnosis and follow up. Cardiac resonance adds information on functional assessment and quantification of myocardial fibrosis. The therapy is oriented to improve symptoms and quality of life. Patients with severe forms of LVNC and RCM may require extracorporeal ventricular support and cardiac transplantation, even in early stages of the disease. The pediatrician plays an important role in the early recognition of these pathologies for timing to referral as well as in the follow-up and screening for complications. The objective of this review is to update the clinical, genetic, diagnostic, therapeutic issues and prognostic of the LVNC and RCM. "
482,2680080,"To extend the advantages of stereotactic localization to open procedures, a computational device with a graphic output is introduced. It is designed to be used in the operating room, where it processes neuroradiological information (CT, MR, and angiography) acquired under stereotactic conditions. The surgeon can interact with neuroanatomical data, extracting borders of structures of surgical relevance. The resulting sets of outlines, shown tridimensionally within the reference of a stereotactic head holder, are presented with respect to the planned approaching trajectory. Color-coded high-resolution graphics show the relationship between lesions and normal brain structures and guide the surgeon's access to deep-seated lesions through small exposures. "
483,37671665,"Short anagen hair (SAH) is a rare paediatric hair disorder characterized by a short anagen phase, an inability to grow long scalp hair and a negative psychological impact. The genetic basis of SAH is currently unknown. To perform molecular genetic investigations in 48 individuals with a clinical phenotype suggestive of SAH to identify, if any, the genetic basis of this condition. Exome sequencing was performed in 27 patients diagnosed with SAH or with a complaint of short, nongrowing hair. The cohort was screened for variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) < 5% in the general population and a Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) score > 15, to identify genes whose variants were enriched in this cohort. Sanger sequencing was used for variant validation and screening of 21 additional individuals with the same clinical diagnosis and their relatives. Genetic association testing of SAH-related variants for male pattern hair loss (MPHL) was performed using UK Biobank data. Analyses revealed that 20 individuals (42%) carried mono- or biallelic pathogenic variants in WNT10A. Rare WNT10A variants are associated with a phenotypic spectrum ranging from no clinical signs to severe ectodermal dysplasia. A significant association was found between WNT10A and SAH, and this was mostly observed in individuals with light-coloured hair and regression of the frontoparietal hairline. Notably, the most frequent variant in the cohort [c.682T>A;p.(Phe228Ile)] was in linkage disequilibrium with four common WNT10A variants, all of which have a known association with MPHL. Using UK Biobank data, our analyses showed that c.682T>A;p.(Phe228Ile) and one other variant identified in the SAH cohort are also associated with MPHL, and partially explain the known associations between WNT10A and MPHL. Our results suggest that WNT10A is associated with SAH and that SAH has a genetic overlap with the common phenotype MPHL. The presumed shared biologic effect of WNT10A variants in SAH and MPHL is a shortening of the anagen phase. Other factors, such as modifier genes and sex, may also play a role in the clinical manifestation of hair phenotypes associated with the WNT10A locus. "
484,38408130,"To investigate superb microvascular imaging (SMI), a novel Doppler ultrasound technique that can visualize low-velocity microvascular flow, for assessing pediatric focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH). Nine FNH lesions in 6 patients were enrolled. On SMI and color Doppler imaging (CDI), intralesional vascularity was assessed visually and categorized as typical spoke-wheel pattern (central vessel radiating from the center to the periphery), multifocal spoke-wheel pattern, and nonspecific pattern. We compared the vascular features of the lesions between SMI and CDI and evaluated vascular patterns according to lesion size. In terms of vascularity pattern, the typical spoke-wheel pattern of FNH was noted more frequently on SMI (67%) than on CDI (11%; P < 0.05). In addition, a multifocal spoke-wheel pattern was noted in all remaining lesions (33%) on SMI. On the contrary, a nonspecific vascular pattern was detected in the majority (78%) of CDI. Regarding the lesion size and vascularity on SMI, the typical spoke-wheel pattern was seen more frequently in the small FNH group than in the large FNH group. The intralesional vascular signal was detected more frequently on SMI (100%) than on CDI (89%). SMI is feasible in evaluating FNH in children and has a greater ability to demonstrate the spoke-wheel pattern than CDI. "

486,27562977,"To test the hypothesis that continuous intramural vascular signal measuring at least 3 mm on color Doppler imaging is highly specific for appendicitis in patients with diagnostically borderline-size appendices. Two blinded observers independently reviewed color Doppler images of the appendix in 94 consecutive patients who had undergone sonography for suspected appendicitis and whose appendices were of diagnostically borderline size (6-8 mm maximum outer diameter). Intramural vascular flow on color Doppler images was classified as absent, type 1 (only punctate and dispersed signal), or type 2 (continuous linear or curvilinear signal measuring at least 3.0 mm in long- or short-axis views). Histopathologic examination and clinical follow-up served as reference standards. Proportions were assessed by the exact binomial test. Of the 94 patients, 33 (35.1%) had type 1 flow (of whom 5 [15.2%] had appendicitis); 23 (24.5%) had type 2 flow (of whom 20 [87.0%] had appendicitis); and 38 (40.4%) had absent flow (of whom 10 [26.3%] had appendicitis). The sensitivity, specificity, and odds ratio of type 2 flow as an indicator of appendicitis were 57.1%, 94.9%, and 24.9 (P< .001), respectively; the corresponding values for type 1 flow as an indicator of normal appendices were and 47.5%, 85.7%, and 5.4 (P = .002). Continuous intramural linear or curvilinear signal measuring at least 3 mm on color Doppler imaging is a highly specific, although relatively insensitive, sign of acute appendicitis in noncompressible appendices of diagnostically borderline size (6-8 mm).

487,35859347,"This systematic review was undertaken to answer the research question: ""In children with primary cataracts, what are the outcomes (posterior continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis + posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation) of surgery when performed with and without trypan blue staining of the posterior lens capsule?"" An electronic search in six biomedical databases was conducted to identify randomised controlled trials that compared trypan blue with no stain during surgery in children 0-16 years with primary cataracts. Titles and abstracts of studies published between 1946 and 2021 in English language were screened. Data extraction, risk of bias assessment and synthesis of findings were done by two independent reviewers, while conflicts were discussed and resolved with a third. A total of 115 of 153 articles were screened after de-duplication. Of these, 113 were excluded while 2 randomised controlled trials involving 56 eyes of 42 participants were included in the review. The risk of bias was similar across all domains in both. Staining of the capsule led to complete posterior capsulorhexis and optimal placement of the implant in >90% of study eyes, while the control arms had 65%-80% for both outcomes. Use of trypan blue in paediatric cataract surgery probably leads to better outcomes, but more well-conducted randomised controlled trials on this important topic are needed. "
488,12943899,"In a cohort of 56 school-aged children with repaired tetralogy of Fallot, significant (moderate to severe) tricuspid regurgitation was common (32% of patients) and was related to both tricuspid annulus dilatation and structural valve abnormalities that were potentially related to previous surgery. Even after adjusting for pulmonary regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation was significantly correlated with right ventricular volume (r= 0.39, p = 0.009), suggesting that tricuspid regurgitation as well as pulmonary regurgitation may contribute significantly to progressive right ventricular dilatation in this population.

489,11533339,"To determine whether children with pallid breath-holding spells associated with bradycardia can be treated safely and successfully with permanent pacemaker implantation. The records of pediatric patients who had apparent breath-holding spells and associated bradycardia and were treated with permanent pacemaker implantation were reviewed. Ten pediatric patients with apparent breath-holding spells associated with bradycardia were treated with a permanent ventricular demand pacemaker at the Mayo Clinic between 1985 and 1995. Patients had onset of symptoms between ages 6 days and 12 months and presented for evaluation between ages 12 months and 5 years. Duration of spells was 15 seconds to 10 minutes. Medications to prevent spells were unsuccessful. Electrocardiograms documented asystolic pauses of 1.7 to 24 seconds (mean: 11.9 seconds). Permanent ventricular demand pacemakers were implanted at 10 months to 5 years of age (median: 14.5 months): 9 endocardial and 1 epicardial. Three patients required pacemaker revision. At follow-up of 38 to 170 months (median: 65.5), 5 patients had complete resolution of spells, 2 had only mild color change without loss of consciousness or seizure activity, and 3 continued to have minor brief spells. Permanent pacemaker therapy for children with pallid breath-holding spells associated with severe bradycardia is safe, efficacious, and warranted. "
490,33045901,"Academic centers embody the ideals of otolaryngology and are the specialty's port of entry. Building a diverse otolaryngology workforce-one that mirrors society-is critical. Otolaryngology continues to have an underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minorities. The specialty must therefore redouble efforts, becoming more purposeful in mentoring, recruiting, and retaining underrepresented minorities. Many programs have never had residents who are Black, Indigenous, or people of color. Improving narrow, leaky, or absent pipelines is a moral imperative, both to mitigate health care disparities and to help build a more just health care system. Diversity supports the tripartite mission of patient care, education, and research. This commentary explores diversity in otolaryngology with attention to the salient role of academic medical centers. Leadership matters deeply in such efforts, from culture to finances. Improving outreach, taking a holistic approach to resident selection, and improving mentorship and sponsorship complement advances in racial disparities to foster diversity. "
491,25140598,"Enterococci are a natural part of the bacterial flora of humans, animals, and insects and are frequently found in the community. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have emerged as a growing problem, associated with high morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of VRE among healthy Swedish preschool children and ascertain whether they constitute a reservoir for the bacteria. In total, 313 individual diapers were collected from preschools in Uppsala, Sweden. Fecal samples were screened by analyzing the color change in a broth followed by polymerase chain reaction for vanA and vanB genes, which are associated with vancomycin resistance. Neither vanA nor vanB genes could be detected from the samples. Preschool children in Uppsala do not constitute a reservoir for VRE. The zero prevalence is consistent with the overall decline in VRE prevalence in Sweden during the last years. "
492,29091079,"Genetic defects that affect intestinal epithelial barrier function can present with very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEOIBD). Using whole-genome sequencing, a novel hemizygous defect in NOX1 encoding NAPDH oxidase 1 was identified in a patient with ulcerative colitis-like VEOIBD. Exome screening of 1,878 pediatric patients identified further seven male inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with rare NOX1 mutations. Loss-of-function was validated in p.N122H and p.T497A, and to a lesser degree in p.Y470H, p.R287Q, p.I67M, p.Q293R as well as the previously described p.P330S, and the common NOX1 SNP p.D360N (rs34688635) variant. The missense mutation p.N122H abrogated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in cell lines, ex vivo colonic explants, and patient-derived colonic organoid cultures. Within colonic crypts, NOX1 constitutively generates a high level of ROS in the crypt lumen. Analysis of 9,513 controls and 11,140 IBD patients of non-Jewish European ancestry did not reveal an association between p.D360N and IBD. Our data suggest that loss-of-function variants in NOX1 do not cause a Mendelian disorder of high penetrance but are a context-specific modifier. Our results implicate that variants in NOX1 change brush border ROS within colonic crypts at the interface between the epithelium and luminal microbes. "
493,39394851,"The errors young children make when recognising others' emotions may be systematic over-identification biases and may partially explain the challenges some have socially. These biases and associations may be differential by emotion. In a sample of 871 ethnically and racially diverse preschool-aged children (i.e. 33-68 months; 49% Hispanic/Latine, 52% Children of Colour), emotion recognition was assessed, and scores for accuracy and bias were calculated by emotion (i.e. anger, sad, happy, calm, and fear). Child and family characteristics and teacher-reported social behaviour were also collected. Multilevel structural equation modelling revealed emotion-specific recognition accuracies varied between 36 and 65% whereas biases varied between 4 and 13%. Anger was the strongest bias followed by sad, happy, fear, and calm, in contrast to the pattern for accuracy - happy, sad, angry, fear, and calm. More variance was explained in emotion-specific recognition accuracies by child and family characteristics - 7-38% - than biases - 3-7%. Negatively-valanced emotion recognition biases associated with positively-valanced accuracies, and positively-valued emotion recognition biases associated with negatively-valued accuracies. Biases did not have meaningful associations with social behaviour. This study highlights that children's emotion recognition errors may partially be systematic, but future studies are needed to understand the underlying cognitive mechanisms. "
494,17588706,"In children, the agreement between the many scales used to document the intensity of pain is not well known. Thus, to determine the agreement, we evaluate the visual analog scale, the standardized color analog scale, the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale, and a verbal numeric scale in children with acute abdominal pain suggestive of appendicitis in a pediatric emergency department (ED). Participants were children who were aged 8 to 18 years, presented to a pediatric ED with abdominal pain suggestive of appendicitis, and were recruited to participate in a randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of morphine. Patients were initially asked to grade their pain on a plasticized color analog scale, a paper visual analog scale, a paper Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale, and then with a verbal numeric scale. Thirty minutes after morphine or placebo administration, the assessment was repeated. All scores were then converted to a value of 0 to 100. Agreements between scores were evaluated with the Bland-Altman method, and the 95% lower and upper limits were reported. We defined a priori the maximum limit of agreement at +/-20 mm. A total of 87 children were included in the study, 58 of them with confirmed appendicitis. The 95% limits of agreement for each pair of scales were visual analog scale/color analog scale -18.6, 14.4; visual analog scale/Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale -20.1, 33.7; visual analog scale/verbal numeric scale -30.2, 20.7; color analog scale/Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale -18.5, 36.3; color analog scale/verbal numeric scale -26.9, 22.1; and Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale/verbal numeric scale -38.7, 15.7. Our study suggests that only the visual analog scale and the color analog scale have acceptable agreement in children with moderate to severe acute abdominal pain. In particular, the verbal numeric scale is not in agreement with the other evaluated scales. "
495,10149214,"Noninvasive cardiac imaging has dramatically altered the practice of cardiology, specifically, the pediatric patient with congenital heart disease over the past decade. Since the introduction of transesophageal echocardiography nearly 15 years ago, addition of high-resolution cross-sectional imaging combined with Doppler color flow mapping has provided a new window to examine the heart. Recently, miniaturization of the transesophageal probe to ""pediatric-size"" has enabled its use in the smallest of infants to add significantly to the assessment of congenital heart malformations. Most recently, addition of a longitudinal-plane probe to the already-existent, transverse-plane probe has made biplane transesophageal echocardiography a reality with significant additional information being provided by orthogonal images of the cardiac structures. We used these probes in complementary fashion in 30 studies performed in 23 patients ages 1 day to 12 years with a mean of 35 months, weighing 2.6-40 kg (mean 12.4 kg). These studies were performed in the operating room, intensive care unit, cardiac catheterization laboratory, and outpatient department. Limitations of single-plane, transverse transesophageal echocardiography were overcome using the longitudinal-axis pediatric probe: left and right ventricular outflow tracts, distal pulmonary arteries, and all of the interventricular and atrial septa were easily visualized. Its use in the operating room and postoperative cardiac intensive care unit for continuous ventricular monitoring in otherwise-inaccessible patients also provided critical information. Transesophageal echocardiography in infants and small children is a valuable ""noninvasive"" imaging technique which, with addition of complementary longitudinal-plane views, offers important additional information regarding congenital heart malformations and their repair.

496,20698915,"Juvenile xanthogranuloma(JXG) is the variant of non-Langerhans' cell histiocytosis. The orange-yellow background coloration with clouds of paler yellow deposits is the most characteristic dermoscopic finding of JXG. Other dermoscopic features include erythematous border, subtle pigment network and white linear streak. The objective of this study was to present the structural correlation between dermoscopic features and histopathological findings of JXG and to find the different dermoscopic features in various stages of JXG. Eleven patients with histologically proven JXG were examined with polarized light dermoscopy. Histopathological findings were assessed and dermoscopic features including setting sun appearance, clouds of paler yellow globules, whitish streak, and branched and linear vessels were evaluated. Among 11 patients, five patients were in early evolutionary stage, four patients in fully developed stage and two in late regressive stage. The setting sun appearance was found in all patients in different stages except one in late regressive stage (90.9%). The clouds of paler yellow globules were present in nine patients (81.8%) and were constant features in fully developed stage and late regressive stage. The whitish streak was present in four patients (36.4%) and telangiectasia in 10 patients (81.8%). The setting sun appearance may hold diagnostic value in early evolutionary stage to fully developed stage, but not in late regressive stage. The clouds of paler yellow globules are more predominant in fully developed stage and late regressive stage. In addition to the use of dermoscopy as an accurate diagnostic tool for differential diagnosis, it could be applied in evaluation of histopathological maturation of JXG. "

498,11870134,"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a controversial endocrine pathology and, recently, it has been suggested that the condition is hereditary. The aim of this study was to prospectively determine in daughters of patients with PCOS, by ultrasonographic (US) and colour Doppler analyses, the incidence of polycystic ovaries and search any correlation with specific hormonal parameters. Fifteen prepubertal offspring (Group I) of patients with PCOS and 10 normal control prepubertal girls (Group II) were submitted to clinical, auxological, and basal hormonal assay. In addition all patients were submitted to US and colour Doppler ovarian and uterine evaluation. Among Group I girls the prevalence of polycystic ovaries was 93%, whereas no subjects among Group II had polycystic ovaries. The ovarian volume (2.76 +/- 1.21 ml versus 0.87 +/- 0.46 ml; P < 0.001) and the number of small sized follicles (5.36 +/- 2.2 versus 0.75 +/- 0.92; P < 0.001) were significantly higher in Group I than Group II patients. In addition, a normal stromal score and an absent stromal vascularization was observed in the control group. The hormone levels did not differ between the two groups. In conclusion we speculate that polycystic ovaries in childhood may be considered a sign of genetic predisposition to PCOS and that environmental factors may express the adult clinical and hormonal presentation of the syndrome.

499,15574605,"Dental care is a major unmet health need of refugee children. Many refugee children have never received oral health care or been exposed to common preventive oral health measures, such as a toothbrush, fluoridated toothpaste, or fluoridated water. Oral health problems among refugee children are most likely to be detected first by pediatricians and family practitioners. Given the increased influx of refugees into the United States, particularly children, it is important for the pediatric community to be aware of potential oral health problems among refugee children and be able to make referrals for treatment and recommendations for the prevention of future oral diseases. The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of caries experience and untreated decay among newly arrived refugee children stratified by their region of origin and compared with US children. Oral health assessments were conducted within 1 month of arrival to the United States as part of the Refugee Health Assessment Program of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. The outcome variables include caries experience and untreated decay. Caries experience is determined by the presence of an untreated caries lesion, a restoration, or a permanent molar tooth that is missing because it has been extracted as a result of dental caries. Untreated caries is detected when 0.5 mm of tooth structure is lost and there is brown coloration of the walls of the cavity. Comparisons of the refugee children with US children in Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data were made using chi2 test of independence and multiple logistic regression. Oral health screenings were performed on 224 newly arrived refugees who ranged in age from 6 months to 18 years and had a mean age of 10.6 years (SD: 4.82; median: 10.7 years). African refugees represented 53.6%, with the majority from Somalia, Liberia, and Sudan. Eastern European refugees composed 26.8% of the study sample. The remaining 19.6% come from a number of countries, such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Middle East. Refugee children had 51.3% caries experience and 48.7% with untreated decay. Caries experience in refugees varied by region of origin, with 38% from Africa exhibiting a history of caries compared with 79.7% of Eastern Europeans. The highest proportion of children with no obvious dental problems was from Africa (40.5%) compared with 16.9% from Eastern Europe. US children had caries experience similar to that of refugees (49.3%) but significantly lower risk of untreated decay (22.8%). Comparisons between refugee children and US children found significant differences for treatment urgency, untreated caries, extent of dental caries, and presence of oral pain. White refugee children, primarily from Eastern Europe, were 2.8 times as likely to have caries experience compared with white US children, with 9.4 times the risk of untreated decay compared with white US children. In contrast, African refugee children were only half as likely to have caries experience compared with white US children (95% confidence interval: 0.3-0.7) and African American children (95% confidence interval: 0.3-0.7). However, African refugee children were similar to African American children in risk of untreated decay (odds ratio: 0.94). African refugee children had significantly lower dental caries experience as well as fewer untreated caries as compared with similarly aged Eastern European refugee children. They were also less likely to have ever been to a dentist. Possible reasons for these findings may include differences in exposure to natural fluoride in the drinking water, dietary differences, access to professional care, and cultural beliefs and practices. The prevalence of caries experience and untreated caries differed significantly between refugee children and US children. These differences varied significantly by race. When refugee children were compared with US children, the African refugee children had only half the caries experience of either white or African American children. However, African refugee children had similar likelihood of having untreated caries as compared with African American children, despite that very few African children had previous access to professional dental care. These findings are consistent with previous studies on health disparities in the United States. White refugee children, primarily from Eastern Europe, were also 3 times as likely to have caries experience compared with either white or African American children and were 9.4 times as likely to have untreated caries as white US children. Refugee children are more likely to establish primary medical care before seeking dental treatment. With the limited access to dental care among refugees, pediatricians should be particularly alert to the risk of oral diseases among refugee children. "
500,9799323,"Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is an unusual hepatic tumour in children and should be distinguished from other hepatic lesions. To describe the imaging characteristics of FNH in children. We examined five patients (three boys and two girls, mean age 9.4 years) with pathologically confirmed FNH. The diagnosis was obtained by tumour resection (n = 4) and percutaneous needle biopsy (n = 1). One patient with multiple FNHs showed recurrent lesions after tumour resection. All patients were studied with US (including colour and power Doppler US [n = 3]) and CT. Dynamic enhanced CT scans were available in three patients. MRI (n = 2) or coeliac angiography (n = 1) was performed in three patients. Seven of eight FNH lesions in five patients were demonstrated by imaging. The average size of the lesions was 6.5 cm. Six lesions detected on US showed variable echogenicity with a central hyperechoic scar (n = 2). On Doppler examination, central or peripheral hypervascular areas were seen (n = 3). Six lesions detected on contrast-enhanced CT showed high attenuation (n = 4) or iso-attenuation (n = 2). On early phase scans, all the lesions (n = 3) showed high attenuation. Irregular linear or ovoid central scars were detected in two patients on CT. MR demonstrated three lesions in two patients, one of which had not been detected by US or CT. A central low signal intensity scar (n = 1) was seen on T2-weighted MRI. Coeliac angiography performed in one patient showed a hypervascular mass with homogeneous staining. FNH in children shows a wide spectrum of imaging findings on various radiological examinations and the typical central scar was not always seen on imaging studies. Dynamic enhanced CT obtained in the early phase and colour Doppler studies may be helpful in the diagnosis of FNH by allowing characterisation of tumour vascularity. FNH should be included in the differential diagnosis of liver mass in children. "
501,26030086,"To investigate the independent and combined associations of cardiorespiratory performance (CP), neuromuscular performance (NP; including motor performance [MP]) and body fat percentage (BF%) with cognition in children. The participants were 202 boys and 201 girls age 6-8 yr. Cardiorespiratory performance was assessed using maximal cycle ergometer test and was expressed as maximal workload per lean body mass. Neuromuscular performance score included muscle strength, speed, agility, balance, manual dexterity, and flexibility; and MP included speed and agility, balance, and manual dexterity. Body fat percentage was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Cognition was assessed using Raven Coloured Progressive Matrices (CPM). Linear regression and general linear models were used to analyze the independent and combined associations of CP, NP, MP, and BF% with Raven CPM score. Neuromuscular performance and MP were directly associated with the Raven CPM score (β = 0.138-0.190; P < 0.01). Children in the lowest or the highest thirds of BF% and in the lowest third of MP had a lower Raven CPM score than other children (P < 0.05). Children in the lowest or highest third of BF% along with the poorest MP had a lower Raven CPM score than those in the middle third of BF% and higher MP (P < 0.05). These associations and differences were much stronger in boys than in girls. Cardiorespiratory performance was not related to the Raven CPM score. Poorer NP and MP were associated with a worse cognition in children and particularly in boys. Cognition was poorer especially among children with the lowest or highest BF% accompanied with a poorer MP. "
502,12437550,"Henna is a shrub cultivated in India, Sri Lanka, and North Africa; it is used, mixed with other substances, as a hair and body dye. Several cases are reported in the literature of sensitization to para-phenylenediamine (PPD) contained in the henna tincture, but few of these are pediatric cases. We report two instances of allergic contact dermatitis due to temporary tattoos in children. In one case a patch test was positive for PPD. We suggest that the fashion of temporary henna tattoos in children is to be discouraged due to the serious consequences that a sensitization to PPD could have in their future. "
503,28913698,"The current study examined whether children with ADHD were more distracted by a stimulus previously associated with reward, but currently goal-irrelevant, than their typically-developing peers. In addition, we also probed the associated cognitive and motivational mechanisms by examining correlations with other behavioral tasks. Participants included 8-12 year-old children with ADHD (n = 30) and typically developing controls (n = 26). Children were instructed to visually search for color-defined targets and received monetary rewards for accurate responses. In a subsequent search task in which color was explicitly irrelevant, we manipulated whether a distractor item appeared in a previously reward-associated color. We examined whether children responded more slowly on trials with the previously-rewarded distractor present compared to trials without this distractor, a phenomenon referred to as value-driven attentional capture (VDAC), and whether children with and without ADHD differed in the extent to which they displayed VDAC. Correlations among working memory performance, immediate reward preference (delay discounting) and attentional capture were also examined. Children with ADHD were significantly less affected by the presence of the previously rewarded distractor than were control participants. Within the ADHD group, greater value-driven attentional capture was associated with poorer working memory. Although both ADHD and control participants were initially distracted by previously reward-associated stimuli, the magnitude of distraction was larger and persisted longer among control participants.

504,9619611,"Transthoracic Doppler color flow and spectral velocity patterns of normal coronary arteries in children have not been well studied. We designed this study to evaluate coronary artery flow velocity characteristics in normal and hypertrophied hearts. Sixty-eight children with optimal two-dimensional echocardiographic images of the left coronary artery (LCA) and right coronary artery (RCA) were prospectively studied. The heart was normal in 45 children, and 23 had left and/or right ventricular hypertrophy assessed by echocardiography (mean age 5.8 versus 5.2 years, p = NS). Color flow signals were detected in the LCA in 63(92%) of the 68 children studied, and pulsed Doppler spectral waveforms were recorded in 47 (69%). The latter were recorded in 26 (58%) of 45 normal children and in 21 (91%) of 23 children with left ventricular hypertrophy. Diastolic RCA flow signals were detected mostly in those with right ventricular hypertrophy (10 of 10). Higher levels of LCA maximum diastolic velocity (42 +/- 23 versus 24 +/- 6 cm/sec, p = 0.0004), increased diastolic flow (16 +/- 15 versus 6 +/- 4 ml/min, p = 0.01), and delayed time to peak diastolic velocity expressed as a percentage of diastolic spectral duration (38% +/- 14% versus 20% +/- 8%, p = 0.0001) were observed in children with left ventricular hypertrophy than in those in normal children. A strong correlation was present between Doppler-derived LCA flow and left ventricular mass/m2 (r = 0.7, p = 0.001). In normal hearts, LCA spectral velocity pattern did not change with increasing age, but the time velocity integral became progressively larger, resulting in a strong correlation with weight (p < 0.001, r = 0.78). This study demonstrates (1) LCA flow signals can be detected and quantitated in the majority of children with and those without left ventricular hypertrophy. (2) Left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with increased LCA flow, higher diastolic velocity, and delayed peak diastolic velocity. (3) RCA flow signals are mostly detected when there is right ventricular hypertrophy. Studies on larger groups of patients are needed to further confirm our observations and to enhance understanding of coronary artery flow reserve. "
505,30365419,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the longitudinal associations of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), motor competence (MC), and body fat percentage (BF%) with cognition in children. Altogether, 371 children (188 boys and 183 girls) 6-9 yr of age at baseline participated in this 2-yr follow-up study. We assessed CRF by maximal cycle ergometer test, computed the MC score from the z-scores of the 50-m shuttle run, static balance, and box and block test results, measured BF% by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and assessed cognition using the Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (RCPM) score. The associations were studied by linear regression analysis and repeated-measures ANCOVA. In boys, a higher MC score (β = -0.161, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.314 to -0.009), a shorter 50-m shuttle run test duration (β = 0.152, 95% CI = 0.007-0.296), and a higher number of cubes moved in the Box and block test (β = -0.161, 95% CI = -0.309 to -0.013) at baseline were associated with a smaller increase in the RCPM score during follow-up. These associations were largely explained by the RCPM score at baseline. However, boys in the highest third (mean difference = 2.5, 95% CI for difference = 0.66-4.33) and the middle third (mean difference = 2.1, 95% CI for difference = 0.39-3.82) of the MC score at baseline had a higher RCPM score over the 2-yr follow-up than boys in the lowest third. CRF, MC, or adiposity was not associated with the RCPM score in girls. Changes in CRF, MC, or BF% were not associated with changes in cognition. Higher MC at baseline predicted better cognition during the first two school years in boys but not in girls. CRF or adiposity was not associated with cognition in boys or girls. "
506,26299519,"Visual object recognition develops during the first years of life. But what if one is deprived of vision during early post-natal development? Shape information is extracted using both low-level cues (e.g., intensity- or color-based contours) and more complex algorithms that are largely based on inference assumptions (e.g., illumination is from above, objects are often partially occluded). Previous studies, testing visual acuity using a 2D shape-identification task (Lea symbols), indicate that contour-based shape recognition can improve with visual experience, even after years of visual deprivation from birth. We hypothesized that this may generalize to other low-level cues (shape, size, and color), but not to mid-level functions (e.g., 3D shape from shading) that might require prior visual knowledge. To that end, we studied a unique group of subjects in Ethiopia that suffered from an early manifestation of dense bilateral cataracts and were surgically treated only years later. Our results suggest that the newly sighted rapidly acquire the ability to recognize an odd element within an array, on the basis of color, size, or shape differences. However, they are generally unable to find the odd shape on the basis of illusory contours, shading, or occlusion relationships. Little recovery of these mid-level functions is seen within 1 year post-operation. We find that visual performance using low-level cues is relatively robust to prolonged deprivation from birth. However, the use of pictorial depth cues to infer 3D structure from the 2D retinal image is highly susceptible to early and prolonged visual deprivation. "
507,9134834,"We investigated the velocity of renal blood flow on hydronephrosis using the pulse color Doppler ultrasound technique, comparing velocity on the healthy side with the diseased side of the renal, segmental and interlobar arteries. The velocities of the diseased side were markedly decreased, depending on the degree of hydronephrosis. These results suggest that the evaluation of renal arterial blood flow velocity in hydronephrosis is a useful examination for determining grade and predicting prognosis. "
508,35243922,"To evaluate changes in retrobulbar ocular blood flow parameters by using Colour Doppler Imaging (CDI) and changes in foveal microvasculature by using Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) in pediatric obese patients and to compare them with a group of healthy children. Children diagnosed with obesity without hypertension and diabetes (39 subjects, obese group) and age-matched healthy controls (26 subjects, control group) underwent CDI and OCTA imaging. Peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity and resistivity index from ophthalmic, central retinal and posterior ciliary arteries on CDI; superficial and deep capillary plexus vascular density and foveal avascular zone area on OCTA imaging were obtained in each group. Central foveal and subfoveal choroidal thicknesses were also measured. CDI and OCTA parameters were compared between two groups. Peak systolic and end-diastolic velocities were found to be significantly lower in obese children than in controls in all three examined arteries (p < 0.05). Resistivity index values were similar between the groups. OCTA imaging did not reveal significant changes in superficial and deep capillary plexus vascular densities and foveal avascular zone area across analysed retinal regions between the groups. Subfoveal choroid was thicker in obese group than in control group (325.89 ± 52.77 µm vs. 304.52 ± 21.76 µm, p = 0.04). An apparent decrease was present in retrobulbar hemodynamics in obese children. This arises the possibility of early ocular macrovascular compromise rather than retinal microvascular impairment in childhood obesity. "

510,32687299,"Allergic diseases are a common pathology in childhood. In the comprehensive medical rehabilitation of children with allergic pathology, non-drug methods of treatment are widely used, which help to reduce the number of drugs used, achieve and prolong the remission of the disease, favorably affect the clinical and functional indicators. Is the scientific justification for the use of selective chromotherapy in children with bronchial asthma (BA) and atopic dermatitis (AD). The study included 120 children with allergic diseases (BA and AD). Among 100 patients with BA, the main group included 50 children, who received exposure to monochromatic polarized green light on biologically active zones for 10 days, 50 - a comparison group that did not receive physiotherapy. The main group of children with AD included 10 patients who received selective blue chromotherapy for foci of skin lesions; the comparison group included 10 children who used only moisturizers without physiotherapy methods. In order to assess the effectiveness of the impact of physical factors in all patients, clinical and functional studies were conducted in the dynamics before and after treatment. The results of clinical and functional examinations showed high therapeutic efficacy of the use of monochromatic polarized green light in children with BA (92.0%). The effectiveness of treating children with blood pressure AD using monochromatic polarized light (blue) was 80%. Indications for the use of selective chromotherapy in children with allergic diseases have been developed. For children with BA, selective chromotherapy of the green spectrum is indicated in the presence of a mild to moderate course of the disease, a period of incomplete remission, and an increased level of anxiety. It is advisable to prescribe selective chromotherapy of the blue spectrum to children with a moderate and mild course of AD. The positive effect of selective chromotherapy of the green spectrum on the clinical course of BA in children, bronchial patency, the functional state of the central nervous system and its autonomic part, and the psychoemotional status of children have been identified. The use of selective blue spectrum chromotherapy in children with AD helps to decrease the severity of objective symptoms, reduce the intensity of itching and sleep disturbance, as well as a marked decrease in the area of skin lesion. Аллергические болезни являются распространенной патологией в детском возрасте. В комплексной медицинской реабилитации детей с аллергической патологией широко используют немедикаментозные методы лечения, которые способствуют уменьшению количества применяемых лекарственных препаратов, достижению и продлению ремиссии заболевания, благоприятно влияют на клинико-функциональные показатели. Научное обоснование применения селективной хромотерапии у детей с бронхиальной астмой (БА) и атопическим дерматитом (АД). В исследование были включены 120 детей с аллергическими заболеваниями (БА и АД). Среди 100 пациентов с БА 50 детей составили основную группу, которая получала воздействие монохроматического поляризованного света зеленого диапазона на биологически активные зоны в течение 10 сут, 50 — группу сравнения, не получавшую физиотерапию. В основную группу детей с АД вошли 10 пациентов, получавших селективную хромотерапию синего цвета на очаги поражения кожи, в группу сравнения включили 10 детей, которым применяли только увлажняющие средства без методов физиотерапии. С целью оценки эффективности воздействия физических факторов у всех пациентов проводились клинико-функциональные исследования в динамике до и после лечения. Данные клинико-функциональных исследований выявили высокую терапевтическую эффективность применения монохроматического поляризованного света зеленого диапазона у детей с БА (92,0%). Эффективность лечения детей с АД с применением монохроматического поляризованного света (синего) составила 80%. Были разработаны показания для применения селективной хромотерапии у детей с аллергическими заболеваниями. Детям с БА селективная хромотерапия зеленого спектра показана при наличии легкого и среднетяжелого течения заболевания, периода неполной ремиссии, наличии повышенного уровня тревожности. Селективную хромотерапию синего спектра целесообразно назначать детям со среднетяжелым и легким течением АД. Выявлено положительное влияние селективной хромотерапии зеленого спектра на клиническое течение БА у детей, бронхиальную проходимость, функциональное состояние центральной нервной системы и ее вегетативного отдела, психоэмоциональный статус детей. Использование селективной хромотерапии синего спектра у детей с АД способствует снижению выраженности объективных симптомов, уменьшению интенсивности зуда и нарушения сна, а также выраженному уменьшению площади поражения кожи.

511,33327937,"Literature on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suggests lower ASD prevalence and higher age of diagnosis among children of color, from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, and from families with lower educational levels. These disparities have been attributed to factors such as limited access to diagnostic and treatment services, less opportunity for upward mobility to locales with ample resources, and linguistic barriers. However, few studies describe prevalence and geographic differences of ASD diagnoses by English Language Learner (ELL) status. The primary objectives of this study are to (1) spatially explore the prevalence of ASD among New York State school districts and (2) examine differences of ASD prevalence rates between ELLs and native English-speaking peers. Using the 2016-2017 district-level data on public and non-public school age students (3-21 years old) receiving special education services in New York, we analyzed sociodemographic trends among school districts with varying percentages (low, medium, and high ranges) of students with ASD and ELLs. To do this, we conducted exploratory spatial analyses using GIS software, analysis of school district level demographic data, and multivariate linear regression. In contrast to prior research on ASD prevalence among minority groups, we found disproportionately higher rates of ASD among school districts with higher proportions of Black and Hispanic students. Geographic analysis revealed statistically significant clustering of school districts with high ASD rates in New York City and Albany. Higher proportions of ELLs tended to be concentrated in densely populated, urban, and geographically smaller school districts and had higher proportions of Black, Hispanic, and Asian students. Schools with higher rates of ASD and ELL students tend to be concentrated in urban regions throughout New York and have higher representation of Black and Hispanic/Latino students, as well as higher rates of learning disabilities in general. Further research is warranted to explore possible reasons for this phenomenon. "
512,9399756,"Duodenal gastric metaplasia (DGM) is commonly found in association with Helicobacter pylori (Hp)-associated gastritis in adults. DGM is also considered a risk factor for duodenal ulcer development. The prevalence of DGM in children and its association with gastritis, duodenitis, or the presence of Hp organisms is not clear. We investigated the prevalence of DGM in children and explore its association with several possible risk factors, including age, gender, gastritis, duodenitis, or Hp presence in the gastric antrum. A retrospective analysis of 173 upper endoscopy procedures performed between 1993 and 1995 at Cabell Huntington Hospital, Huntington, WV, was done. Gastric and duodenal biopsies were stained with Giemsa for Hp detection, periodic acid-Schiff for DGM, and hematoxylin and eosin for histologic assessment. Gastric mucosal inflammation was graded according to Sydney criteria. Duodenal gastric metaplasia was identified in 23 of 173 (13%) patients. Duodenitis but not age, gender, gastritis, or the presence of Hp in the gastric antrum was associated with DGM development. In 4 of 23 DGM foci, Hp was identified. In children, DGM is not the consequence of Hp infection. "
513,11683107,"Whether diagnosed before birth or suspected in a newborn, congenital heart diseases rapidly require an evaluation by the pediatric cardiologist. The role of the pediatric cardiologist is threefold: 1) to realize a careful anatomical examination using color Doppler echocardiography; 2) in many cases to perform a palliative or curative therapeutic act based upon interventional catheterization, such as Rashkind atrioseptotomy or percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty; and 3) whenever necessary, to take a rapid decision of cardiac surgery in concert with the cardiac surgeon, and to prepare the child for surgery.

514,35710888,"While the use of Pediatric Track and Trigger Tools as a standard to discriminate high level of urgency in pediatric care has received considerable attention, less focus has been given to other important factors such as nurses' clinical observations and judgement. The purpose of this study was to explore nurses' observational practice and focus on which non-measurable signs and symptoms nurses find important when identifying inpatient pediatric patients at risk of clinical deterioration. This was an inductive qualitative study based on an interpretive description methodology. Data were obtained through participant observation of experienced nurses working in a Danish pediatric unit and focus group interviews with pediatric nurses. Field notes were taken, and focus group interviews were audio taped and transcribed. A thematic text condensation method was used to analyse data. Findings revealed the following four main themes of non-measurable signs and symptoms that nurses find important when identifying children at risk of clinical deterioration: Colour and skin tone; sounds; movement patterns; behavioural signs. This study suggest that pediatric patients show signs and symptoms that go beyond the objective measurements integrated in Pediatric Track and Trigger Tools and they should not be ignored as they are highly valuable to nurses who are responsible for observing inpatient pediatric patients at risk of clinical deterioration. More empirical research on nurses' observational practice is recommended, especially research to identify the signs and symptoms - both measurable and non-measurable - that are significant to nurses at the bedside.

515,19426960,"To determine the testability of several vision and refraction tests in preschool-aged children. Population-based study of Chinese preschool-aged children in Singapore. One thousand five hundred and forty-two Singaporean Chinese children aged 6 to 72 months were recruited through door-to-door screening of government-subsidized apartments in Singapore. Trained eye professionals administered all tests, including monocular logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution visual acuity with the Sheridan Gardiner chart, monocular Ishihara color testing (Richmond Products Inc, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA), biometric measurements using IOLMaster (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany), and Randot stereoacuity (Stereo Optical Co, Chicago, Illinois, USA) for children 30 to younger than 72 months. Cycloplegic refraction and keratometry measurements also were determined using a table-mounted autorefractor (Canon Autorefractor RK-F1; Canon, Tokyo, Japan) in children 24 to younger than 72 months. Testabilities were 84.8% for visual acuity (40.7% for age 30 to < 36 months, 70.8% for age 36 to < 42 months, 86.7% for age 42 to < 48 months, 94.8 for age 48 to < 54 months, 98.6 for age 54 to < 66 months, and 98.7% for age 66 to < 72 months), 81.1% for the Ishihara color test, 82.2% for Randot stereoacuity, 62.2% for table mounted autorefraction, and 91.7% for IOLMaster. All testabilities significantly increased with age (P < .0001). Girls had higher testability rates than boys for the autorefraction and Randot stereoacuity tests (P = .036 and .008, respectively). The vision and refraction tests were testable in a high proportion of preschool-aged Chinese Singaporeans. Preschool children in older age groups are likely to complete these tests successfully, with important implications for determining age limits for screening in the community and clinic. "
516,33175124,"Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a neurocutaneous syndrome involving the skin, brain, and eyes. Consensus recommendations for management are lacking. To consolidate the current literature with expert opinion to make recommendations that will guide treatment and referral for patients with port-wine birthmarks (PWBs). In this consensus statement, 12 nationally peer-recognized experts in dermatology with experience treating patients with SWS were assembled. Key topics and questions were formulated for each group and included risk stratification, optimum treatment strategies, and recommendations regarding light-based therapies. A systematic PubMed search was performed of English-language articles published between December 1, 2008, and December 1, 2018, as well as other pertinent studies identified by the expert panel. Clinical practice guidelines were recommended. Treatment of PWBs is indicated to minimize the psychosocial impact and diminish nodularity and potentially tissue hypertrophy. Better outcomes may be attained if treatments are started at an earlier age. In the US, pulsed dye laser is the standard for all PWBs regardless of the lesion size, location, or color. When performed by experienced physicians, laser treatment can be safe for patients of all ages. The choice of using general anesthesia in young patients is a complex decision that must be considered on a case-by-case basis. These recommendations are intended to help guide clinical practice and decision-making for patients with SWS and those with isolated PWBs and may improve patient outcomes. "

Physical examination revealed flesh-colored, rough-textured papules surrounded by faint erythema. These lesions were present diffusely over the upper trunk, arms, thighs, face, ears, and neck. Evaluation of four immediate family members revealed a similarly affected brother and father. A biopsy of the papules showed the presence of a mid-dermal epithelial cyst containing numerous vellus hairs. "
518,35361366,"Supporting the mental health of youth who identify as Black, Indigenous, or Persons of Color (BIPOC) continues to be a challenge for clinicians and policymakers alike. Children and adolescents are a vulnerable population, and for BIPOC youth, these vulnerabilities are magnified by the effects of structural, interpersonal, and internalized racism. Integration of psychiatric care into other medical settings has emerged as an evidence-based method to improve access to psychiatric care, but to bridge the gap experienced by BIPOC youth, care must extend beyond medical settings to other child-focused sectors, including local governments, education, child welfare, juvenile legal systems, and beyond. Intentional policy decisions are needed to incentivize and support these systems, which typically rely on coordination and collaboration between clinicians and other stakeholders. Clinicians must be trauma-informed and strive for structural competency to successfully navigate and advocate for collaborative systems that benefit BIPOC youth. "
519,33558175,"Immunoglobulin A vasculitis/Henoch-Schönlein purpura (IgAV/HSP) is a leukocytoclasia vasculitis of childhood, predominantly affecting the skin, joints, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys. The involvement of the penis is rare. We aimed to describe this rare manifestation of IgAV/HSP and to review the previous studies, including similar cases. Clinical data were reviewed for two children of penile involvement of IgAV/HSP in our hospital. More clinical cases were retrieved from the databases of PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus from database inception to February 1, 2020. We presented two boys aged three and five years both of whom had penile lesions after presenting with the typical rash of IgAV/HSP on lower extremities. The penile lesions improved entirely in a few days without treatment in one and with corticosteroid treatment in the other. The literature review revealed 12 articles describing 20 patients with penile involvement of IgAV/HSP. The penile findings were edema, erythema, ecchymosis, purpuric rash, edema, color change, stiffness of the shaft or prepuce, and tenderness. Penile lesions appeared before the purpuric rash of IgAV/HSP in three of 22 patients. The penile involvement could make the diagnosis challenging especially if the penile lesions appear before the typical rash of the disease. The lesions improved entirely in the short term in all patients; in five without treatment in fifteen after corticosteroid or immunosuppressive drug treatment. It is important to raise awareness about this rare manifestation among health care providers. It is not clear whether corticosteroid treatment should be initiated for treatment since it seems as a self-limited feature. Treatment with corticosteroids could be considered in the treatment of selected cases especially with systemic involvement. "
520,20186412,"When evaluating superficial soft tissue masses with ultrasonography, it is not always clear whether the mass is cystic or solid. We reviewed sonograms of soft tissue masses, which were interpreted as cystic but confirmed as solid tumors. We scanned a database of patients with superficial soft tissue masses from two different institutions. Four hundred and thirty lesions were evaluated with ultrasonography and then confirmed surgically. Twenty-three masses were identified, of which initial interpretation on gray scale included cystic tumor which pathology revealed to be solid tumors. All images were evaluated by two musculoskeletal radiologists, regarding internal echogenicity of lesions, presence of posterior enhancement, margins, size, and internal vascularity. Of 23 masses, there were 5 giant cell tumors of the tendon sheath, 4 schwannomas, 3 vascular leiomyomas, 2 benign fibrous histiocytomas, 2 dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, 2 granular cell tumors, 1 dermatofibroma, 1 fibroma of the tendon sheath, 1 fibromatosis, 1 eccrine spiradenoma, and 1 granulation tissue. Masses were hypoechoic in 16 and anechoic in 7 cases. Posterior enhancement was present in 9, and 10 masses showed no internal vascularity on color Doppler imaging. Margins were smooth in 13, smooth with mild lobulation in 7, and lobulated in 3 cases. Mean size was 2.3 cm. On ultrasonography, solid soft tissue tumors may be confused with cystic masses. Such cases are not common, and fibrous tumors are the most frequent. Care should be given to these solid tumors that have a cystic appearance and even lack internal vascularity on color Doppler imaging to enhance diagnosis of cystic and solid masses. "

Since 80% of preschool children spend ∼40 h/week in out-of-the home childcare, childcare centers are promising sites for obesity prevention interventions. Mixed methods were used to develop, implement, and assess the feasibility of an obesity prevention program for children 2-5 years. The intervention which consisted of brief (1-3 min), interactive, educational modules was developed by content experts and parents (n = 20) and targeted four areas (milk, sugar sweetened beverages, screen time, and physical activity). The modules were delivered by community health workers in the childcare center during pick-up and drop-off times, in small groups and home visits upon request. Focus groups with childcare center staff (n = 28) assessed satisfaction and interest in incorporating the intervention into care. Between February 2013 and March 2014, 354 caregivers (∼73%) at six centers participated in one or more educational sessions. Of children, 37.4% in 2013 and 35.9% in 2014 were overweight or obese. Children entering preschool in 2014 were more likely to be overweight/obese than children who had been in the center since 2013 (36.2 vs 23.2%, p < 0.05). Childcare staff endorsed the intervention and received training to continue the program. Brief, interactive health-related behavior-change interventions engaged large numbers of low-income caregivers at childcare centers and resonated with center staff. Childcare center staff represent an underutilized resource to combat the childhood obesity epidemic. "
522,25028778,"Fluid intelligence and the behavioral problems of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are related to academic performance, but how this association occurs is unclear. This study aimed to assess mediation and moderation models that test possible pathways of influence between these factors. Sixty-two children with ADHD and 33 age-matched, typically developing students were evaluated with Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices and the spelling and arithmetic subtests of the Brazilian School Achievement Test. Dimensional ADHD symptomatology was reported by parents. Our findings suggest that fluid intelligence has a significant impact on academic tests through inattention. The inattentive dimension was the principal behavioral source of influence, also accounting for the association of hyperactive-impulsive manifestations with school achievement. This cognitive-to-behavioral influence path seems to be independent of diagnosis related group, and gender, but lower socioeconomic status might increase its strength. Fluid intelligence is a relevant factor in the influence of ADHD behavioral symptoms on academic performance, but its impact is indirect. Therefore, early identification of both fluid intelligence and inattentive symptoms is of the utmost importance to prevent impaired academic performance and future difficulties in functioning. "
523,32315929,"Executive dysfunction is prevalent in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including prominent difficulties in the two facets of inhibition, as well as with selective attention. School-based mindfulness has been used in typically-developing children to improve executive functioning, though this has not been investigated in children with ASD. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of a school-based mindfulness program for improving inhibition (prepotent response inhibition and interference control) and selective attention in children with ASD. Using a quasi-experimental, pre-post design, an eight week school-based mindfulness program (Mindful Schools;https://www.mindfulschools.org/), was administered to students with ASD (n = 27) at a private, not-for-profit school for children with special needs. The Walk/Don't Walk test and the Color-Word Interference test were used to evaluate prepotent response inhibition and interference control, respectively. Selective attention was measured using a cancellation test. Significant improvements followed the intervention for prepotent response inhibition and interference control (medium effect sizes), as well as for overall selective attention (large effect size). The study's findings demonstrate that school-based mindfulness holds promise for increasing specific executive functioning abilities in children with ASD. "
524,11729579,"Acute scrotal pain in children presents a major diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Epididymitis has been considered uncommon in childhood. The clinical spectrum and therapeutic policy of the acute scrotum in children is continually being reassessed. To determine whether there has been an increase in the incidence of epididymitis in children and to advocate a more selective surgical approach to the acute scrotum. We conducted a retrospective review of 65 children admitted to our department of pediatric surgery with the diagnosis of acute scrotum during a 5 year period. Of the 65 children admitted with the diagnosis of acute scrotum, epididymitis was diagnosed in 42 (64.6%). The remaining cases included torsion of the testis in 12 patients (18.5%), torsion of the appendix testis in 5 (7.7%), scrotal pain and minimal physical findings in 4 (6.1%), and scrotal hematoma and idiopathic scrotal edema in one patient each. Doppler ultrasound of the groin, color Doppler ultrasound of the testis and testicular nuclide scintigraphy (Tc-99m scan) examinations were performed on 49, 30 and 57 occasions, respectively; the Tc-99m scan was the most effective tool. All the patients with epididymitis were diagnosed before surgical intervention and were treated conservatively. We observed an increasing frequency of epididymitis in children admitted with the diagnosis of acute scrotum. "
525,32302621,"Cystic dysplasia of the rete testis (CDT) is a rare, benign, cause of testicular mass in the pediatric population. The mass appears on sonography as multiple small cysts of varying size surrounded by normal or compressed testicular tissue. CDT is often associated with other genitourinary anomalies, commonly presenting with agenesis or dysplasia of the ipsilateral kidney. The pathophysiology and the management remains controversial. We report a case of a 3-year-old presenting with an enlarged testicular mass later presumed to be CDT associated with ipsilateral renal agenesis, review the literature, and propose an evaluation and management algorithm.

526,7811138,"29% of unselected pathological and forensic autopsy cases revealed mites of the species Demodex folliculorum longus and brevis in hair follicles and sebaceous glands of the scalp. The attack by these parasites was equal in male and female subjects and correlated to the number of sebaceous glands but not to the density of hair follicles. However there was a tendency to an increased number of parasites inhabiting the scalp of people of advanced age, dark hair colour or with a bald head. A chronic lymphocytic infiltration of the skin was conspicuous in more than 70% of cases with Demodicosis folliculorum. "
527,15562558,"This study was designed to assess the predictive value of an MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2,5-diphenyl] tetrazolium bromide) in vitro assay for the evaluation of leukemic cell resistance/sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs, and to compare these results with clinical and laboratory parameters in cases of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).The chemoresistance of leukemic cells was ascertained by means of an MTT assay in 32 previously untreated children with ALL. The children were treated using the protocol ALL-BFM 90. Statistical correlations were made between in vitro drug resistance to anti-cancer drugs: prednisolone (PRED), vincristine (VCR),daunorubicin (DNR), etoposide (VP-16) and cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C) and in vivo clinical and laboratory parameters: age, sex, risk factor (RF), leukocytes (WBC)and absolute number of blast cells (BC) at diagnosis (BC0), BC at day 8 (BC8), the percentage of blast cells in bone marrow at day 15 (BM15) and at day 33 (BM33),and leukocyte surface antigens CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8, CD10, CD19, CD20, HLADR.

528,26888070,"Rapid and flexible interpretation of conflicting sensory inputs in the context of current goals is a critical component of cognitive control that is orchestrated by frontal cortex. The relative roles of distinct subregions within frontal cortex are poorly understood. To examine the dynamics underlying cognitive control across frontal regions, we took advantage of the spatiotemporal resolution of intracranial recordings in epilepsy patients while subjects resolved color-word conflict. We observed differential activity preceding the behavioral responses to conflict trials throughout frontal cortex; this activity was correlated with behavioral reaction times. These signals emerged first in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) before dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), followed by medial frontal cortex (mFC) and then by orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). These results disassociate the frontal subregions based on their dynamics, and suggest a temporal hierarchy for cognitive control in human cortex. "
529,23849375,"The object of this study was to determine the expression and localization of periostin in the major mixed odontogenic tumors and to correlate any differential staining of the mesenchymal components to the interrelationship of these tumors. Five ameloblastic fibromas, 8 ameloblastic fibro-odontomas and 10 odontomas were assessed immunohistochemically for periostin staining. Because mesenchymal tissues were consistently present in all studied cases, these tissues were selected for statistical analysis of differential periostin staining. Periostin was variably localized to the mesenchymal component of the tumors as well as to preameloblasts and ameloblasts. Analysis of the mesenchymal staining intensity was statistically significantly different between ameloblastic fibro-odontomas and odontomas (P < .001; Dunn multiple comparisons test). Our results document periostin staining in human mixed odontogenic tumors. Statistical analysis of differential stromal staining supports the concept that the ameloblastic fibroma is a histogenetically distinct neoplasm as compared to ameloblastic fibro-odontoma and odontoma.

530,2009569,"A hyperdynamic left ventricle can lead to post-dilation mid-cavitary obstruction in the absence of any preballoon mid-cavitary obstruction in children with aortic valve stenosis. The purpose of this study was to define the incidence and course of post-dilation mid-cavitary obstruction. We reviewed the catheterization and echocardiographic data of 35 patients, ages 3 days to 18 years (mean = 7.9 years), with isolated aortic valve stenosis who underwent balloon dilation with a fall in aortic valve gradient to less than 20 mm Hg. Post-dilation mid-cavitary obstruction was suspected from post-dilation left ventricular angiogram and was quantitated by echocardiographic and Doppler examinations performed immediately after dilation and in a 1-3 month follow-up period. Continuous wave Doppler directed by color flow Doppler was used for evaluation and differentiation of post-dilation mid-cavitary obstruction and residual aortic valve stenosis. Three children (3/35 [9%]) all under 2 years of age developed post-dilation mid-cavitary obstruction immediately after dilation. The obstruction within the cavity resolved spontaneously in all three patients. 1) Post-dilation left ventricular mid-cavitary obstruction can occur in children under 2 years of age after balloon dilation of severe aortic valve stenosis, and 2) total regression of post-dilation mid-cavitary obstruction occurs spontaneously in all patients.

531,27685196,"We assessed the perception of scarring and distress by pediatric burn survivors with burns covering more than one-third of total body surface area (TBSA) for up to 2 years post-burn. Children with severe burns were admitted to our hospital between 2004 and 2012, and consented to this IRB-approved-study. Subjects completed at least one Scars Problems and/or Distress questionnaire between discharge and 24 months post burn. Outcomes were modeled with generalized estimating equations or using mixed linear models. Significance was accepted at p < 0.01. Responses of 167 children with a mean age of 7 ± 5 years and burns covering an average 54 ± 14% of TBSA were analyzed. Significant improvements over the 2-year period were seen in reduction of pain, itching, sleeping disturbance, tightness, range of motion, and strength (p < 0.01). There was a significantly increased persistent desire to hide the scarred body areas over time (p < 0.01). The perception of mouth scarring, inability to portray accurate facial expressions, and skin coloration did not improve over the follow-up period. According to self-assessment questionnaires, severely burned children exhibit significant improvements in their overall perception of scarring and distress. However, these patients remain self-conscious with respect to their body image even 2 years after burn injury. Implications for Rehabilitation According to self-assessment questionnaires, severely burned children perceive significant improvements in scarring and distress during the first 2 years post burn. Significant improvements were seen in reduction of pain, itching, sleeping disturbances, tightness, range of motion, and strength (p < 0.01). Burn care providers should improve the treatment of burns surrounding the mouth that with result in scarring, and develop strategies to prevent skin discoloration. Careful evaluation of pain and sleeping disorders during the first year post burn are warranted to improve the patient rehabilitation. Overall, significantly more female patients expressed a persistent desire to hide their scarred body areas. The rehabilitation team should provide access to wigs or other aids to pediatric burn survivors to address these needs. "
532,32713256,"Care and outcomes of infants admitted to neonatal intensive care vary and differences in family-centered care may contribute. The objective of this study was to understand families' experiences of neonatal care within a framework of family-centered care. We conducted focus groups and interviews with 18 family members whose infants were cared for in California neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) using a grounded theory approach and centering the accounts of families of color and/or of low socioeconomic status. Families identified the following challenges that indicated a gap in mutual trust and power sharing: conflict with or lack of knowledge about social work; staff judgment of, or unwillingness to address barriers to family presence at bedside; need for nurse continuity and meaningful relationship with nurses and inconsistent access to translation services. These unmet needs for partnership in care or support were particularly experienced by parents of color or of low socioeconomic status. "
533,34981493,"With a prevalence of 0.7 to 29.6%, functional constipation (FC) is a common pediatric complaint worldwide. Current therapeutic strategies for FC mainly include prevention and treatment of fecal impaction, by administration of oral laxatives or rectal medications. However, these agents have been reported to have limited efficacy and a number of serious side effects. In traditional Persian medicine, local application of olive oil was used to relieve childhood constipation. In this pilot placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, the laxative effects of the external use of olive oil ointment in 1- to 4-year-old children with functional constipation were investigated. Forty patients with FC were randomly assigned in olive oil ointment or placebo groups, receiving either an ointment containing 85% olive oil or a comparable placebo or an ointment containing 85% liquid paraffin adjusted to have color and odor similar to those of intervention ointment, twice a day for 4 days. Rome III criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) were used to identify eligible patients from three hospitals. The primary outcome measure was treatment success, defined as ≥1 spontaneous stools per day, without episodes of fecal impaction at endpoint (day 4). The secondary outcome measure was the frequency of fecal incontinence, abdominal discomfort or flatulence, painful defecation, and dermal irritations (adverse effect). Improvements in stool frequency started from day 1 and continued up to day 4 (end of the study) and were significantly greater in patients receiving olive oil ointment in comparison with placebo group (p < 0.05). No adverse effect (including fecal incontinence, painful defecation, gripe and skin reaction, etc.) was reported in intervention and placebo groups during the study. Olive oil ointment used in this study can be presented as a safe, well-tolerated, and effective herbal preparation in children with functional constipation. "
534,29090468,"Becker's nevus (BN) presents as a hairy patch or plaque with or without proliferation of the dermal smooth muscles. BN has been described as acquired as found in a similar entity, congenital smooth muscle hamartoma (CSMH). This study was aimed at evaluating the clinicopathological aspects of BN in Korean cases in differential diagnosis with CSMH. We performed a retrospective study of 103 patients histopathologically diagnosed as having BN or CSMH. The cases included 40 cases diagnosed with BN or CSMH before the age of 10 years who had clinical monitoring and a second skin biopsy after puberty to determine the disease course. Among cases of children to adolescents (<18 years), we observed a slight male predominance. Among children aged <14 years, sex ratio converged at 1:1. Early-onset BN showed a female predominance and hyperpigmented skin lesions. All BN cases showed hyperpigmentation, and face and neck involvement tended to make severe cosmetic concerns. In contrast, hypertrichosis was more frequent in CSMH. Either skin-colored lesion or pseudo-Darier's sign was not seen in early-onset BN. BN showed less dermal smooth muscle than CSMH. Androgens themselves do not seem to be related to the development of BN but play only an aggravating role especially in male patients. Considering high occurrence in exposed areas, BN may distress patients severely. As early laser treatment may be helpful in some patients with BN, early-onset BN in comparison to CSMH should be diagnosed appropriately. "
535,34155974,"Hair greying is a hallmark of aging generally believed to be irreversible and linked to psychological stress. Here, we develop an approach to profile hair pigmentation patterns (HPPs) along individual human hair shafts, producing quantifiable physical timescales of rapid greying transitions. Using this method, we show white/grey hairs that naturally regain pigmentation across sex, ethnicities, ages, and body regions, thereby quantitatively defining the reversibility of greying in humans. Molecularly, grey hairs upregulate proteins related to energy metabolism, mitochondria, and antioxidant defenses. Combining HPP profiling and proteomics on single hairs, we also report hair greying and reversal that can occur in parallel with psychological stressors. To generalize these observations, we develop a computational simulation, which suggests a threshold-based mechanism for the temporary reversibility of greying. Overall, this new method to quantitatively map recent life history in HPPs provides an opportunity to longitudinally examine the influence of recent life exposures on human biology. This work was supported by the Wharton Fund and NIH grants GM119793, MH119336, and AG066828 (MP). Hair greying is a visible sign of aging that affects everyone. The loss of hair color is due to the loss of melanin, a pigment found in the skin, eyes and hair. Research in mice suggests stress may accelerate hair greying, but there is no definitive research on this in humans. This is because there are no research tools to precisely map stress and hair color over time. But, just like tree rings hold information about past decades, and rocks hold information about past centuries, hairs hold information about past months and years. Hair growth is an active process that happens under the skin inside hair follicles. It demands lots of energy, supplied by structures inside cells called mitochondria. While hairs are growing, cells receive chemical and electrical signals from inside the body, including stress hormones. It is possible that these exposures change proteins and other molecules laid down in the growing hair shaft. As the hair grows out of the scalp, it hardens, preserving these molecules into a stable form. This preservation is visible as patterns of pigmentation. Examining single-hairs and matching the patterns to life events could allow researchers to look back in time through a person’s biological history. Rosenberg et al. report a new way to digitize and measure small changes in color along single human hairs. This method revealed that some white hairs naturally regain their color, something that had not been reported in a cohort of healthy individuals before. Aligning the hair pigmentation patterns with recent reports of stress in the hair donors’ lives showed striking associations. When one donor reported an increase in stress, a hair lost its pigment. When the donor reported a reduction in stress, the same hair regained its pigment. Rosenberg et al. mapped hundreds of proteins inside the hairs to show that white hairs contained more proteins linked to mitochondria and energy use. This suggests that metabolism and mitochondria may play a role in hair greying. To explore these observations in more detail Rosenberg et al. developed a mathematical model that simulates the greying of a whole head of hair over a lifetime, an experiment impossible to do with living people. The model suggested that there might be a threshold for temporary greying; if hairs are about to go grey anyway, a stressful event might trigger that change earlier. And when the stressful event ends, if a hair is just above the threshold, then it could revert back to dark. The new method for measuring small changes in hair coloring opens up the possibility of using hair pigmentation patterns like tree rings. This could track the influence of past life events on human biology. In the future, monitoring hair pigmentation patterns could provide a way to trace the effectiveness of treatments aimed at reducing stress or slowing the aging process. Understanding how ‘old’ white hairs regain their ‘young’ pigmented state could also reveal new information about the malleability of human aging more generally. "
536,28766834,"Atrial transseptal puncture (TSP) for cardiac catheterization procedures remain challenging in children and adults with complex congenital heart disease (CHD). We sought to evaluate our experience using radiofrequency (RF) current via surgical electrocautery needle for TSP to facilitate diagnostic and interventional procedures. Retrospective chart review of all patients (pts) who underwent TSP using RF energy (10-25 W) via surgical electrocautery from three centers from January 2011 to January 2017 were evaluated. Echocardiograms were reviewed to define the atrial septum as normal and complex (thin aneurysmal, thick/fibrotic, synthetic patch material, and extra cardiac conduit). A total of 54 pts underwent 55 successful TSP. Median age was 12.5 years (1 day-54 years) and weight was 52.7 kg (2-162). Indications for TSP included; EP study and ablation procedures in structurally normal hearts (n = 24) and in complex atrial septum/CHD and structural heart disease pts (n = 30): Electrophysiology study and ablation in 4, diagnostic catheterization in 9, and interventional procedures in 17 pts were performed. Atrial TSP was successful in 54/55 (98%). Atrial perforation with tiny-small pericardial effusion not requiring intervention was noted in 2 pts. TSP was unsuccessful in one critically ill neonate with unobstructed TAPVR and restricted atrial septum who experienced cardiac arrest requiring CPR, ECMO, and emergent surgery. RF current delivery using surgical electrocautery for TSP is a feasible and an effective option in patients with complex CHD for diagnostic, interventional, and electrophysiology procedures. "
537,28987706,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are carcinogenic and neurotoxic combustion by-products commonly found in urban air. Exposure to PAH is disproportionately high in low income communities of color who also experience chronic economic stress. In a prospective cohort study in New York City (NYC) we previously found a significant association between prenatal PAH exposure and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) behavior problems at age 9. Here, we have evaluated the joint effects of prenatal exposure to PAH and prenatal/childhood material hardship on ADHD behavior problems. We enrolled nonsmoking African-American and Dominican pregnant women in New York City between 1998 and 2006 and followed their children through 9 years of age. As a biomarker of prenatal PAH exposure, PAH-DNA adducts were measured in maternal blood at delivery and were dichotomized at the limit of detection (to indicate high vs. low exposure). Maternal material hardship (lack of adequate food, housing, utilities, and clothing) was self-reported prenatally and at multiple time points through child age 9. Latent variable analysis identified four distinct patterns of hardship. ADHD behavior problems were assessed using the Conners Parent Rating Scale- Revised. Analyses adjusted for relevant covariates. Among 351 children in our sample, across all hardship groups, children with high prenatal PAH exposure (high adducts) generally had more symptoms of ADHD (higher scores) compared to those with low PAH exposure. The greatest difference was seen among the children with hardship persisting from pregnancy through childhood. Although the interactions between high PAH exposure and hardship experienced at either period (""persistent"" hardship or ""any"" hardship) were not significant, we observed significant differences in the number of ADHD symptoms between children with high prenatal PAH exposure and either persistent hardship or any hardship compared to the others. These differences were most significant for combined high PAH and persistent hardship: ADHD Index (p < 0.008), DSM-IV Inattentive (p = 0.006), DSM-IV Hyperactive Impulsive problems (p = 0.033), and DSM-IV Index Total (p = 0.009). The present findings add to existing evidence that co-exposure to socioeconomic disadvantage and air pollution in early life significantly increases the risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. They suggest the need for multifaceted interventions to protect pregnant mothers and their children. "
538,37018354,"This study aimed to assess the feasibility of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN) in pediatric patients with febrile urinary tract infection (UTI). Between March 2019 and January 2021, study participants with suspected UTI were assessed for APN using ultrasound. Parenchymal echogenicity changes, renal pelvis dilatation, and the presence of a focal suspected lesion were assessed using conventional grayscale ultrasound. The presence and location of a decreased perfusion area were evaluated using color Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) and CEUS. Agreement between each ultrasound examination and a 99mTc‒dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan was assessed using the κ value, and the most visible period of the lesion was evaluated using CEUS. This study enrolled 21 participants (median age, 8.0 months; range, 2.0-61.0 months) with isolated urinary tract pathogens. Five increased parenchymal echotextures (11.9%) and 14 renal pelvic dilatations (33.3%) were confirmed, but no focal lesions were detected on the grayscale images. CDUS and CEUS showed decreased local perfusion suggestive of APN in two and five kidneys, respectively. DMSA scan showed substantial agreement with CEUS findings (κ = 0.80, P = 0.010), but other grayscale and CDUS findings did not agree with DMSA scan results (P > 0.05). All lesions were best observed in the late parenchymal phase on CEUS. CEUS can reveal renal perfusion defects in pediatric patients with suspected APN without radiation exposure or sedation; therefore, CEUS may be a feasible and valuable diagnostic technique. "
539,9007465,"It is known that the etiology of congenital biliary dilatation (CBD) is closely associated with pancreaticobiliary maljunction (PBMJ). Treatment of CBD today is primary excision of the cyst followed by hepaticoenterostomy. However, PBMJ without dilatation of the biliary tract has recently been reported and its treatment is still controversial. In adults, simple cholecystectomy without biliary reconstruction is often performed, because it usually presents as an anomaly of the gallbladder. Over 30 years, we have encountered 8 patients with PBMJ without dilatation of the common bile duct in 180 pediatric cases of CBD. The presenting symptoms of these patients were those of pancreatitis i.e. abdominal pain associated with elevation of serum amylase levels. Five cases presented with jaundice or a history of pale colored stools. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed to confirm the diagnosis. Five (62.5%) of these 8 patients were found to have dilatation of the common channel, which was seen in 50 (29%) of the 172 other cases with biliary tract dilatation. Three cases (37.5%) had proven protein plugs or debris at the level of the common channel, and this was observed in 28 (16%) of the 172 other cases. It is strongly suggested that the manifestation of clinical symptoms in these patients results from stasis or obstruction at the level of the common channel. In children who present with recurrent pancreatitis, PBMJ must be suspected even if the common bile duct appears to be normal. It is difficult to resolve these anomalies without operative repair. The authors consider that radical treatment of PBMJ is required in these children to prevent serious long-term complications. "
540,21786841,"We studied the effect of a health-promoting school-based intervention for disadvantaged children in the residential Ashram schools of rural Wardha, Maharashtra. At baseline, 1287 children in 10 Ashram schools were examined using a locally adapted Global School-based Student Health Survey questionnaire. The haemoglobin level of all children was estimated using the haemoglobin colour scale. Body mass index and physical activity score for each child were calculated. The intervention was carried out through school health committees. After 1 year, 1226 children were examined using the same questionnaire. There was significant improvement in personal hygiene and reduction in hygiene-related morbidity among the children. The median haemoglobin level of the children increased from 10.7 g/dl to 11.4 g/dl. There was also a significant increase in the proportion of children with body mass index that was normal for age (5th-85th percentile) from 32.2% to 38.5%. The need-based participatory health-promoting school initiative for disadvantaged children in Ashram schools led to an improvement in their personal hygiene and health. "
541,32336118,"Scrotal swellings have a non-specific clinical picture, so their clinical diagnosis is challenging. Scrotal grayscale and color Doppler ultrasound are non-invasive methods used in both adult and childhood groups and act as accurate screening and diagnostic modalities. To evaluate the diagnostic validity of grayscale and color Doppler ultrasound in the assessment of scrotal swelling to reach accurate diagnosis. A retrospective study included 181 patients (mean age = 35.5 ± 7.3, age range = 1-71 years) with scrotal swelling. Examinations were performed by an experienced radiologist using grayscale and color Doppler ultrasound. The diagnostic validity of grayscale and color Doppler ultrasound for diagnosing scrotal swelling were estimated using surgical findings, histopathological results, and imaging and clinical follow-up as reference standards. Overall, 202 scrotal swellings were detected. The final diagnoses were 13 (6.4%) malignant and 189 (93.6%) benign alterations. Varicocele was the most common scrotal swelling (26%), followed by hydrocele (23.8%). Matched to the reference standards, grayscale and color Doppler ultrasound represented a sensitivity of 84.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 54.6-98.1), a specificity of 76.2% (95% CI = 69.5-82.1), a positive predictive value of 19.6% (95% CI = 10.2-32.4), and a negative predictive value of 98.6% (95% CI = 95.1-99.8) for diagnosing scrotal tumors. Scrotal grayscale and color Doppler ultrasound provide high diagnostic validity for assessment of scrotal swellings. "
542,18210860,"In order to investigate the developmental changes of response inhibition in frontal function, event related potentials (ERPs) during a Go/NoGo task were collected. Twelve developmentally normal subjects, ranging in age from 7 to 15, and 9 normal adults performed a visual Go/NoGo task, which is a continuous performance test (CPT) using 5 color samples. We obtained ERPs of the Go and NoGo conditions from 13-channel EEG recordings and measured peak latency, amplitude, and topographic distribution of the NoGo N2 and NoGo P3 components. The NoGo N2 components were located at Fz in childhood, but changed from Cz to Pz in adulthood. The NoGo N2 amplitude diminished linearly with age. The NoGo P3 components were significant at Cz at all ages and the amplitude increased with age. The pattern of NoGo N2 and NoGo P3 components in 7-to 15-year-old children were similar, but differed in adults. These results suggest that the maturation of response inhibition in frontal lobe is achieved beyond 15 years of age, and that NoGo 3 amplitude particularly reflects the maturation of response inhibition.

543,32981324,"Influenza A viruses cause a spectrum of responses, from mild coldlike symptoms to severe respiratory illness and death. Intrinsic host factors, such as age, can influence disease severity. Glycosylation plays a critical role in influenza pathogenesis; however, the molecular drivers of influenza outcomes remain unknown. In this work, we characterized the host glycomic response to the H1N1 2009 pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1pdm09) as a function of age-dependent severity in a ferret model. Using our dual-color lectin microarray technology, we examined baseline glycosylation and glycomic response to infection in newly weaned and aged animals, models for young children and the elderly, respectively. Compared to adult uninfected ferrets, we observed higher levels of α-2,6-sialosides, the receptor for H1N1pdm09, in newly weaned and aged animals. We also observed age-dependent loss of O-linked α-2,3-sialosides. The loss of these highly charged groups may impact viral clearance by mucins, which corresponds to the lower clearance rates observed in aged animals. Upon infection, we observed dramatic changes in the glycomes of aged animals, a population severely impacted by the virus. In contrast, no significant alterations were observed in the newly weaned animals, which show mild to moderate responses to the H1N1pdm09. High mannose, a glycan recently identified as a marker of severity in adult animals, increased with severity in the aged population. However, the response was delayed, in line with the delayed development of pneumonia observed. Overall, our results may help explain the differential susceptibility to influenza A infection and severity observed as a function of age. "
544,2559765,"We attempted the quantitative analysis of brain computerized tomographic scans in children using Color Image Analyzer. A consecutive series of 167 computerized tomographic scans were reviewed. Areas of subarachnoid spaces, cavums, ventricles and cerebellums were measured on three slices: A slice is at the level of head of caudate nucleus, anterior horn of lateral ventricle and third ventricle. B slice is at the level of body of lateral ventricle. C slice is at the level of sella turcica and pons. We investigated these values compared with Evans ratio, Cella Media Index, cerebellar atrophy score and visually evaluations. Serial brain CT scans of eight patient with infantile spasms were also evaluated for the assessment of the brain shrinkage after ACTH therapy. 1) The ratios of the subarachnoid space/the intracranial area on A and B slices (SAS A%, SAS B%) were significantly higher in the patients of severe brain atrophy. 2) There were linear relationship between Evans ratio and SAS A% (r = 0.405, p less than 0.001), Cella Media Index and the ratio of the lateral ventricles/the intracranial areas on B slice (r = -0.501, p less than 0.001), and the cerebellar atrophy score by Une and SAS C% (r = 0.369, p less than 0.001). 3) In the normal patients, the values of SAS A% and SAS B% were much greater in less than 1.5 years old children. These results suggest that the trend of CT findings related to age may reflect physiological changes of the space between the skull and the brain with age. 4) Brain shrinkage after ACTH therapy was more pronounced in the subarachnoid space than the ventricle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) "
545,2692213,The doppler color flow imaging method was employed to detect the vesicoureteral reflux. The ultrasound examination was performed by using the doppler color flow imaging system. Ultrasonic sector scan was carried out by the use of the 3.75 MHz phased array and/or conbex array transducer with a transabdominal approach. The flow in the bladder from the ureteral orifice to the bladder was detected with a red color indicating the direction towards the probe and the flow from the bladder towards the ureteral orifice during the vesicoureteral reflux was detected with a blue color indicating the direction away from the probe. The doppler color flow imaging method appears to be a useful diagnostic procedure for the detection of the vesicoureteral reflux. 
546,26957379,"While most physicians recognize that vitamin D status varies by skin color because darker skin requires more light to synthesize vitamin D than lighter skin, the importance of body weight to vitamin D status is a newer, less recognized, finding. The purpose of this study was to use nationally representative US data to determine the probability of vitamin D deficiency by body weight and skin color. Using data for individuals age ≥6 years from the 2001 to 2010 cycles of the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we calculated the effect of skin color, body weight, and age on vitamin D status. We determined the probability of deficiency within the normal range of body weight for 3 race/ethnicity groups at 3 target levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Darker skin colors and heavier body weights are independently and significantly associated with poorer vitamin D status. We report graphically the probability of vitamin D deficiency by body weight and skin color at vitamin D targets of 20 and 30 ng/mL. The effects of skin color and body weight on vitamin D status are large both statistically and clinically. Knowledge of these effects may facilitate diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency. "

549,22360964,"Supraclavicular flaps had been widely used as pedicled flaps to reconstruct face and neck defects. However, the size of this traditional flap was limited even after expansion. In this study, we present a flap pedicled by the thoracic branch of supraclavicular artery (TBSA). The flap is located at the subclavicular region, and has the advantage of large dimension, matching colour and thin thickness. In this series, 24 patients with ages ranging between 3 and 49 years (30 flaps with six patients in bilateral fashion) were treated in the authors' institution. The maximum size of the flap was 25 cm × 25 cm, whereas the minimum size was 15 cm × 10 cm. The average size of the flaps was 241.1 ± 95.7 cm(2). Twenty-six flaps (86.7%) survived completely. Total flap loss was seen in one patient (3.3%) and was treated with reverse harvesting skin graft. Partial flap necrosis occurred in three flaps (10.0%). Through a mean time of 10-month follow-up, the colour and the texture of the flaps matched with the recipient area. No conspicuous flap contracture was observed. This expanded subclavicular flap pedicled by the TBSA has proved to be a promising method with satisfactory outcome and high success rate. "
550,25294847,"We evaluated the renal vascular indices in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD) using Doppler ultrasonography. We also assessed the renal hemodynamics alterations in patients with homozygous SCD and sickle beta-thalassemia (sickle β-thalassemia). We studied 75 patients (age range = 3-20 years; M = 9.95 ± 4.15) with SCD: 42 patients suffering from homozygous SCD and 33 patients diagnosed with sickle β-thalassemia. Thirty, age- and sex-matched, normal subjects were also included as a control group. Both patients and control groups had Doppler assessment of pulsatility (PI) and resistivity (RI) indices of main renal, segmental, interlobar, and arcuate arteries. Both PIs and RIs were significantly higher in SCD patients, compared with the control group. Among patients, PIs and RIs in the main renal, segmental, interlobar, and arcuate arteries were significantly higher in patients with homozygous SCD as compared with those with sickle β-thalassemia (p values <0.01, <0.001, <0.001, and <0.001 for PIs and <0.001, <0.001, <0.001, and <0.01 for RIs, respectively). We concluded that renal vascular resistance is raised in children and adolescents with SCD. This is more pronounced in patients with homozygous SCD as compared with those with sickle β-thalassemia. "

Those left behind carry with them the memory of the death and it can colour their future lives, making good palliative care an urgent public health issue around the world. Everyone providing healthcare needs core training in palliative care, including the fundamentals of pain and symptom relief. Governments must urgently address barriers to morphine availability and educators of health care professionals must eliminate myths and phobias, and teach good end of life care. "

553,33988825,"With the growing obesity epidemic among children and adolescents, the evaluation of disease origin to slow disease progression is necessary. Racial disparities which are evident amid prevalence and treatment must be studied to counteract disease propagation. Disparities are pronounced among Black and Hispanic pediatric patients prior to conception and birth due to genetic composition and fetal environment. Postnatal environment and psychosocial influences can further increase a child/adolescent's propensity to increased weight. Current treatment options including nutrition, physical activity, behavior modification, pharmacotherapy, and surgery are underutilized in communities of color due to limited access to care and cost. Data is limited to demonstrate disparities among treatment of obesity in children and adolescents. The reviewed studies show the role of race on disease treatment. Increased research efforts, especially in pharmacotherapy and metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS), will help combat obesity in pediatric communities of color. "
554,23557278,"The Tzanck smear is a simple, easily applicable, rapid, and inexpensive test for the diagnosis of erosive vesiculobullous, tumoral, and granulomatous diseases. The diagnostic accuracy of the Tzanck smear is known, but its diagnostic reliability has been evaluated only in herpetic infections and basal cell carcinoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic reliability of the Tzanck smear in erosive vesiculobullous, tumoral, and granulomatous diseases. Patients evaluated by Tzanck smear at Başkent University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Dermatology, between February 2009 and July 2010, were included. Three dermatologists were involved in the study. Dermatologist A performed a clinical dermatologic examination, took the smear material, made a clinical diagnosis, and compared the clinical and cytological diagnoses. Dermatologists B and C evaluated the smears. Agreement between the latter two dermatologists on the cytological diagnoses was determined. In 500 patients, a total of 272 (54%) erosive vesiculobullous, 190 (38%) tumoral, and 38 (8%) granulomatous lesions were diagnosed. The diagnostic reliability of the Tzanck smear was reasonably substantial (κ = 0.59) for all types of lesions, substantial for erosive vesiculobullous (κ = 0.79) and granulomatous (κ = 0.68) lesions, and moderate (κ = 0.50) for tumoral lesions. The Tzanck smear may be used for the evaluation of erosive vesiculobullous and granulomatous lesions with brief training. However, the evaluation of tumoral lesions by Tzanck smear requires more experience. "
555,20020242,"To investigate ocular growth and morbidity in both preschool and school-aged children born prematurely without retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). This population-based study was carried out in 26 children, 5-7 years of age, born prematurely without ROP. All children underwent a full ocular examination, including corrected visual acuity, cycloplegic refractive errors, color vision, ocular alignment, and anterior and posterior segment examinations. Anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, vitreous length, and total axial length were measured. There was no correlation between the degree of prematurity and visual acuity or refractive state. Two (7.7%) subjects had strabismus, two (7.7%) had amblyopia, and four (15%) had anisometropia. Total axial length was significantly correlated with both gestational age at birth (r=0.822, P<0.001) and birth weight (r=0.569, P=0.003). Similarly, vitreous length was also significantly correlated with gestational age (r=0.744, P<0.001) and birth weight (r=0.553, P=0.004). This study showed that although the globe gets longer as gestational age approaches term and as birth weight increases, this condition does not result in any significant refractive error. According to the literature, the prevalence of strabismus, amblyopia, and anisometropia may be higher in preterm children without ROP than in age-matched, normally delivered children. "
556,36400279,"Racialized trauma can come directly from other people or can be experienced within a wider system. It can come as the result of a direct experience when racism is enacted on you, vicariously-such as when you see videos of other people facing racism-and/or transmitted intergenerationally. More and more, research in child and adolescent psychiatry has supported that race-related stress and racialized violence has systemic roots and psychological and physiological consequences. The term ""emotion regulation"" is generally used to describe a person's ability to effectively manage and respond to an emotional experience and to adapt to the demands of their environment. At the time of writing this editorial, youth of color have witnessed a pandemic in which their families and communities have been disproportionately impacted and devastated, the death of George Floyd and other racialized violence against unarmed people of color, murder of their elders in grocery stores and churches, their peers shot by assault weapons while attending school, all compounded by discrimination against sexual and gender minority people in some regions, climate change heating up our earth, and immigrant children separated from parents or dying at the border. What will be the response of the adults around them to protect them? What is the role of emotion regulation skills for youth experiencing race-related stress and trauma in a dysregulated world? "
557,36753150,"Morphea is an insidious inflammatory disorder of the skin and deeper tissues. Determining disease activity is challenging yet important to medical decision-making and patient outcomes. To develop and validate a scoring tool, the Morphea Activity Measure (MAM), to evaluate morphea disease activity of any type or severity that is easy to use in clinical and research settings. This pilot diagnostic study was conducted from September 9, 2019, to March 6, 2020, in 2 phases: development and validation. During the development phase, 14 morphea experts (dermatologists and pediatric dermatologists) used a Delphi consensus method to determine items that would be included in the MAM. The validation phase included 8 investigators who evaluated the tool in collaboration with 14 patients with pediatric morphea (recruited from a referral center [Medical College of Wisconsin]) during a 1-day in-person meeting on March 6, 2020. During the development phase, online survey items were evaluated by experts in morphea using a Likert scale (score range, 0-10, with 0 indicating not important and 10 indicating very important); agreement was defined as a median score of 7.0 or higher, disagreement as a median score of 3.9 or lower, and no consensus as a median score of 4.0 to 6.9. During the validation phase, reliability (interrater and intrarater agreement using intraclass correlation coefficients), validity (using the content validity index and κ statistics as well as correlations with the modified Localized Scleroderma Severity Index and the Physician Global Assessment of Activity using Spearman ρ coefficients), and viability (using qualitative interviews of investigators who used the MAM tool) were evaluated. Descriptive statistics were used for quantitative variables. Data on race and ethnicity categories were collected but not analyzed because skin color was more relevant for the purposes of this study. Among 14 survey respondents during the development phase, 9 (64.3%) were pediatric dermatologists and 5 (35.7%) were dermatologists. After 2 rounds, a final tool was developed comprising 10 items that experts agreed were indicative of morphea activity (new lesion in the past 3 months, enlarging lesion in the past 3 months, linear lesion developing progressive atrophy in the past 3 months, erythema, violaceous rim or color, warmth to the touch, induration, white-yellow or waxy appearance, shiny white wrinkling, and body surface area). The validation phase was conducted with 14 patients (median age, 14.5 years [range, 8.0-18.0 years]; 8 [57.1%] female), 2 dermatologists, and 6 pediatric dermatologists. Interrater and intrarater agreement for MAM total scores was good, with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.844 (95% CI, 0.681-0.942) for interrater agreement and 0.856 (95% CI, 0.791-0.901) for intrarater agreement. Correlations between the MAM and the modified Localized Scleroderma Severity Index (Spearman ρ = 0.747; P < .001) and the MAM and the Physician Global Assessment of Activity (Spearman ρ = 0.729; P < .001) were moderately strong. In qualitative interviews, evaluators agreed that the tool was easy to use, measured morphea disease activity at a single time point, and should be responsive to changes in morphea disease activity over multiple time points. In this study, the MAM was found to be a reliable, valid, and viable tool to measure pediatric morphea activity. Further testing to assess validity in adults and responsiveness to change is needed. "
558,33864888,"Most patients with childhood-onset immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, and enteropathy have no genetic diagnosis for their illness. These patients may undergo empirical immunosuppressive treatment with highly variable outcomes. We sought to determine the genetic basis of disease in patients referred with Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked-like (IPEX-like) disease, but with no mutation in FOXP3; then to assess consequences of genetic diagnoses for clinical management. Genomic DNA was sequenced using a panel of 462 genes implicated in inborn errors of immunity. Candidate mutations were characterized by genomic, transcriptional, and (for some) protein analysis. Of 123 patients with FOXP3-negative IPEX-like disease, 48 (39%) carried damaging germline mutations in 1 of the following 27 genes: AIRE, BACH2, BCL11B, CARD11, CARD14, CTLA4, IRF2BP2, ITCH, JAK1, KMT2D, LRBA, MYO5B, NFKB1, NLRC4, POLA1, POMP, RAG1, SH2D1A, SKIV2L, STAT1, STAT3, TNFAIP3, TNFRSF6/FAS, TNRSF13B/TACI, TOM1, TTC37, and XIAP. Many of these genes had not been previously associated with an IPEX-like diagnosis. For 42 of the 48 patients with genetic diagnoses, knowing the critical gene could have altered therapeutic management, including recommendations for targeted treatments and for or against hematopoietic cell transplantation. Many childhood disorders now bundled as ""IPEX-like"" disease are caused by individually rare, severe mutations in immune regulation genes. Most genetic diagnoses of these conditions yield clinically actionable findings. Barriers are lack of testing or lack of repeat testing if older technologies failed to provide a diagnosis. "

561,33423420,"Childhood granulomatous periorificial dermatitis (CGPD), considered a clinical variant of perioral dermatitis, typically affects prepubertal children of African descent. It is a condition of unknown etiology characterized by the presence of a monomorphic yellow-brown papular eruption limited to the perioral, perinasal, and periocular regions that histopathologically shows a granulomatous pattern. This disorder should be differentiated from other conditions as granulomatous rosacea, sarcoidosis, and lupus miliaris disseminatus faciei. We report a case of a 9-year-old boy who presented with flesh-colored perorificial papules on the face, evolving for two months. Upon treatment with topical tacrolimus for follicular eczema, an aggravation of the condition was observed. A skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of CGPD. Our patient was successfully treated with a combination of topical metronidazole and topical erythromycin. "
562,24622868,"The introduction of a new type of small handheld ultrasound device brings greater portability and affordability. The basic ultrasound approach with these handheld devices has been defined by European Federation of Societies of Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (EFSUMB) as ""EchoScopy"". The current study aimed to assess the image quality, indications and limitations of a portable pocket ""EchoScope"" compared with a high-end ultrasound system in abdominal diseases. 231 consecutive patients were included in this study. Physician A performed ultrasound examinations with a high-end ultrasound system (HEUS), then physician B performed the same ultrasound examination using an EchoScope (Vscan™). In patients with focal lesions, physician B also measured the largest diameters and graded the vascularity by using colour Doppler imaging (CDI) within the lesion on the same plane with both ultrasound systems. Compared with the excellent image quality using HEUS, the image quality of the EchoScope was graded as good, sufficient or non-sufficient. Out of all 231 patients, 167 had focal lesions, 19 patients were found with diffuse pathological findings, six with ascites, six after liver puncture and 33 without any pathological findings. The image quality of the pocket device was considered as being good or sufficient to delineate the pathology in 225/231 (97.4 %). The detection rate of the EchoScope for abdominal focal lesion was 162/167 (97 %), only five superficially located lesions could not be detected. Both systems showed agreement in determination of the best positioning to perform abdominal paracentesis and assessing complications after intervention. The investigated EchoScope displays a sufficient image quality, in some indications such as detection of focal lesions > 20 mm, detection of ascites, hydronephrosis and other pathological findings with comparable results to HEUS. We conclude that pocket sized EchoScopy devices have a promising future but the indications have to be determined by a prospective study.

563,28404481,"To investigate whether a palm-held ultrasonocardiographic scanner would be useful for screening and follow-up in congenital heart disease (CHD). We retrospectively reviewed the echocardiographic images from June 1, 2014 to November 1, 2014. All patients underwent two ultrasonographic examinations including palm-held scanner examination and standard echocardiography. To compare the quality of the two instruments, we developed a diagnostic scoring system ranging from 1 point to 10 points, with 10 points indicating the best quality. Two experienced echocardiographers retrospectively reviewed all recorded images blindedly and gave each examination a score. Comparisons of diagnostic score between two equipments were performed. A total of 262 patients' images were reviewed. All cardiac lesions could be detected with both instruments. The mean diagnostic score of palm-held scanner and standard echocardiography were 8.20±0.53 versus 9.64±0.37 (p<0.05) in color image and 7.00±1.05 versus 8.56±1.14 (p<0.05) in gray-scale two-dimensional image, respectively. When we compared the score between the two instruments in individual CHDs, we found standard echocardiography had better quality except for detecting muscular ventricular septal defect and pulmonary regurgitation. The diagnostic sensitivity of palm-held scanner in detecting CHD was very good. Despite both instruments having a high diagnostic score in detecting CHD, standard echocardiography had better quality. Traditional echocardiography is still the standard tool for CHD evaluation. However, the palm-held scanner can support physical examination for initial screening and follow-up, and offer cardiologists an opportunity to visualize and listen to the heart at any time. "
564,8018488,"Abnormal T lymphocyte function and reduced interleukin-2 (IL-2) production have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the nephrotic syndrome (NS). We investigated: (1) lymphocyte subpopulations and expression of IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) on T cells using two-colour flow cytometry, (2) serum IL-2 and (3) the soluble component of IL-2R (sIL-2R) in serum, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, in 38 children with NS. All children, except those in remission, had marked proteinuria. They were divided into groups according to renal pathology: (1) steroid-sensitive NS (SSNS) not receiving prednisolone therapy, (2) SSNS on prednisolone, (3) focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), (4) SSNS in remission and not receiving prednisolone therapy, (5) congenital NS (CNS). Results were compared with 26 age-matched controls. Total T lymphocytes (CD3) were reduced in groups 1 and 2; CD4 count was reduced in groups 1-4; CD8 count increased in groups 2 and 3; CD8 and CD19 (B lymphocytes) were significantly reduced in group 5. Increased IL-2R expression (CD25) on CD4 lymphocytes was noted in groups 1, 2 and 3 implying activation of these cells. In patients with SSNS, increased serum sIL-2R was recorded during relapse (1,273 +/- 497 U/l vs. 913 +/- 401 U/l in remission, P < 0.005) but free serum IL-2 was not detectable at any stage. The specific alterations in lymphocyte subpopulations in SSNS and FSGS would imply an involvement of the immune system distinct from that in CNS. "
565,34332524,"Our group previously proved that the human enteric nervous system can be visualized with confocal laser endomicroscopy after topical application of cresyl violet using surgically resected intestine specimens. The present report documents the first in vivo visualization of the human enteric nervous system with confocal laser endomicroscopy using local cresyl violet staining. The aim of this study was to evaluate the technical feasibility and clinical efficiency of confocal laser endomicroscopy in patients with Hirschsprung's disease and allied disorders in vivo. Confocal laser endomicroscopy was performed in vivo in two patients to confirm the presence of the enteric nervous system during surgery in patients with Hirschsprung's disease and allied disorders. Cresyl violet was gently injected from the serosal side into the muscular layer of the intestine, and scanning was performed within 30 min. Then, the scanned intestines were resected, and the visualized area of the specimens was pathologically evaluated. The ganglion cell nuclei and the enteric nervous system network were clearly visualized intraoperatively in both cases. The morphological findings were similar to the pathological findings of the enteric nervous system in both cases although the period of visibility was brief. This study demonstrated the first, real-time observation of the enteric nervous system in humans using confocal laser endomicroscopy and suggest the potential to identify the enteric nervous system intra-operatively during surgery for Hirschsprung's disease and allied disorders.

566,38364572,"Chemical exposures often occur in mixtures and exposures during pregnancy may lead to adverse effects on the fetal brain, potentially reducing lower cognitive abilities and fine motor function of the child. We investigated the association of motheŕs exposure to a mixture of chemicals during pregnancy (i.e., organochlorine compounds, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, phenols, phthalates, organophosphate pesticides) with cognitive abilties and fine motor function in their children. We studied 1097 mother-child pairs from five European cohorts participating in the Human Early Life Exposome study (HELIX). Measurement of 26 biomarkers of exposure to chemicals was performed on urine or blood samples of pregnant women (mean age 31 years). Cognitive abilities and fine motor function were assessed in their children (mean age 8 years) with a battery of computerized tests administered in person (Raveńs Coloured Progressive Matrices, Attention Network Test, N-back Test, Trail Making Test, Finger Tapping Test). We estimated the joint effect of prenatal exposure to chemicals on cognitive abilities and fine motor function using the quantile-based g-computation method, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. A quartile increase in all the chemicals in the overall mixture was associated with worse fine motor function, specifically lower scores in the Finger Tapping Test [-8.5 points, 95 % confidence interval (CI) -13.6 to -3.4; -14.5 points, 95 % CI -22.4 to -6.6, and -18.0 points, 95 % CI -28.6 to -7.4) for the second, third and fourth quartile of the overal mixture, respectively, when compared to the first quartile]. Organochlorine compounds, phthalates, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances contributed most to this association. We did not find a relationship with cognitive abilities. We conclude that exposure to chemical mixtures during pregnancy may influence neurodevelopment, impacting fine motor function of the offspring. "
567,34272764,"Patients of color are disproportionately impacted by vitiligo. Access to treatment depends greatly on insurance coverage. We, therefore, assessed current vitiligo treatment coverage policies across major United States health insurers to determine current patterns and coverage gaps for vitiligo. The study surveyed 15 commercial health care insurers, 50 BlueCross BlueShield (BCBS) plans, Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Affairs. Information on treatment coverage for vitiligo, specifically pimecrolimus and tacrolimus, excimer laser therapy, PUVA, and narrow-band (nb)UVB, was collected via an online review of insurance policy documents, confirmed with phone calls to organization representatives, or via a survey of Medicaid providers, and state Medicaid directors. Of 17 organizations with regional or national coverage policies, 12% did not cover topical calcineurin inhibitors, 56% did not cover nbUVB phototherapy, 53% did not cover PUVA phototherapy, and 41% did not cover laser therapy. For BCBS, pimecrolimus and tacrolimus were not covered in 39% and 35% of states, respectively. NbUVB and PUVA therapy were not covered in 20% and 10% of states, respectively. Excimer laser therapy was not covered in 82% of states. Out of 32 states with accessible Medicaid information, 11 did not cover topicals, 5 did not cover nbUVB, 4 did not cover PUVA, and 7 did not cover laser. Two commonly cited reasons for coverage denial were that the treatment indication was considered cosmetic, and certain therapies are not FDA-approved. There is inequity in the distribution of health among vitiligo patients given current patterns of insurance coverage for treatment, which may have disproportionate impact on patients of color. "
568,38743414,"To describe the clinical, electrophysiological and genetic spectrum of inherited retinal diseases associated with variants in the PRPH2 gene. A total of 241 patients from 168 families across 15 sites in 9 countries with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in PRPH2 were included. Records were reviewed for age at symptom onset, visual acuity, full-field ERG, fundus colour photography, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), and SD-OCT. Images were graded into six phenotypes. Statistical analyses were performed to determine genotype-phenotype correlations. The median age at symptom onset was 40 years (range, 4-78 years). FAF phenotypes included normal (5%), butterfly pattern dystrophy, or vitelliform macular dystrophy (11%), central areolar choroidal dystrophy (28%), pseudo-Stargardt pattern dystrophy (41%), and retinitis pigmentosa (25%). Symptom onset was earlier in retinitis pigmentosa as compared with pseudo-Stargardt pattern dystrophy (34 vs 44 years; P = 0.004). The median visual acuity was 0.18 logMAR (interquartile range, 0-0.54 logMAR) and 0.18 logMAR (interquartile range 0-0.42 logMAR) in the right and left eyes, respectively. ERG showed a significantly reduced amplitude across all components (P < 0.001) and a peak time delay in the light-adapted 30-Hz flicker and single-flash b-wave (P < 0.001). Twenty-two variants were novel. The central areolar choroidal dystrophy phenotype was associated with 13 missense variants. The remaining variants showed marked phenotypic variability. We described six distinct FAF phenotypes associated with variants in the PRPH2 gene. One FAF phenotype may have multiple ERG phenotypes, demonstrating a discordance between structure and function. Given the vast spectrum of PRPH2 disease our findings are useful for future clinical trials. "
569,21986158,"This study aimed to determine the predictive value of intercostal and pulmonary artery Doppler flow patterns in the outcome of childhood pneumonia. Pneumonia was classified according to type of pleural effusion and the ultrasound features of consolidations. Doppler flow patterns of intercostal and pulmonary arteries were analysed and correlated with pneumonia type and hospital stay. Of 83 pneumonia cases, 55 were uncomplicated and 28 were complicated. Pleural effusion was present in 54 cases, with 29 non-septated and 25 septated cases. Patients with uncomplicated pneumonia did not have abnormal Doppler flow patterns, compared with 64% (18 of 28) of patients with complicated pneumonia. Doppler ultrasound patterns in childhood pneumonia were correlated with pneumonia type and may be predictive of pneumonia outcome. "
570,16479861,"The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of creating archetypal 3D faces through computerized 3D facial averaging. A 3D surface scanner Fiore and its software were used to acquire the 3D scans of the faces while 3D Rugle3 and locally-developed software generated the holistic facial averages. 3D facial averages were created from two ethnic groups; European and Japanese and from children with three previous genetic disorders; Williams syndrome, achondroplasia and Sotos syndrome as well as the normal control group. The method included averaging the corresponding depth (z) coordinates of the 3D facial scans. Compared with other face averaging techniques there was not any warping or filling in the spaces by interpolation; however, this facial average lacked colour information. The results showed that as few as 14 faces were sufficient to create an archetypal facial average. In turn this would make it practical to use face averaging as an identification tool in cases where it would be difficult to recruit a larger number of participants. In generating the average, correcting for size differences among faces was shown to adjust the average outlines of the facial features. It is assumed that 3D facial averaging would help in the identification of the ethnic status of persons whose identity may not be known with certainty. In clinical medicine, it would have a great potential for the diagnosis of syndromes with distinctive facial features. The system would also assist in the education of clinicians in the recognition and identification of such syndromes. "
571,1410042,"We compared the survival of cultured epithelial allografts and epithelial autografts applied to donor sites for split-thickness skin grafts. Before grafting, cultured epithelium was devoid of Langerhans cells (LCs) or lymphoid cells by immunohistochemical and electron microscopic examinations. The autografts attached to the wounds permanently, without any clinical evidence of rejection. In contrast, allografts, which were mismatched for MHC and blood-type antigens, appeared to adhere firmly only until day 7. By the second week, signs of graft rejection were apparent: The graft changed color, and the underlying dermis underwent ""microerosion"" and denudation. By the third week, the area formerly occupied by the allograft had the same coloration as ungrafted wounds and apparently had undergone reepithelialization by the host. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies clearly demonstrated that host Langerhans-like cells (without Birbeck granules) appeared in both autografts and allografts. However, these cells were numerous and distributed widely throughout allografts, whereas they were scarce and confined to the basal layer of autografts. Typical Langerhans cells (containing Birbeck granules) were present in the prickle-cell layer of autografts by day 7. The present study strongly indicates that allografts of cultured epithelium are rejected. Furthermore, given the known ability of Langerhans-like cells to function as accessory cells in T-cell activation, our results point to a role for host Langerhans-like cells in immunologically mediated rejection of the epithelial allografts.

572,8451406,"In this retrospective review, the authors evaluated the anatomic and imaging features of 140 reduced-size liver transplants in 120 boys and girls; 100 of these patients (83.3%) were 2 years old or younger. The authors reviewed the surgical reports, plain radiographs, contrast material-enhanced studies of the gastrointestinal tract, duplex Doppler and color Doppler ultrasound (US) scans, and computed tomographic (CT) scans. Understanding the anatomic features associated with transplantation was crucial to understanding the post-surgical imaging characteristics. Changes in visceral anatomic structure caused a variety of imaging appearances, some of them misleading: (a) Some patients had unusual bowel gas patterns on plain radiographs because of a shift in location by bowel loops; (b) gastrointestinal studies showed gastric compression by an oversized left lobe that mimicked mass effect; and (c) displacement or migration of the duodenum, jejunum, or cecum into the right hepatic fossa sometimes mimicked malrotation. Pitfalls were created by fluid and gas collections at the transected edge. US and CT were often used to further assess anatomic structures after surgery; color Doppler was especially helpful in vascular localization. "
573,19253863,"Reporting system after performing echocardiography is very poor in almost all hospitals of Nepal. Special but simple attempt effort has been introduced to transfer analog video images and color still images of echocardiographic investigation into a desk top computer using a locally available imported video capture system, Snazzi Movie Studio S4. Analog video signals are converted into MPEG2 and still color snaps are converted into JPEG format. Window media player can be used later on to review the video clips. All together 1059 patients including pediatric, adults and geriatric patients underwent echocardiographic evaluation at the Echo-lab of Nepal Medical College Teaching Hospital during 10th January 2007 to 9th May 2008. Age ranged from 2 months to 98 years. Mean+SD was 52.4 +/- 18.5 years. Male/female ratio was 0.8:1. More than half of the patients (64.3%) came from Kathmandu. Brahman/Chhetri (478, 45.1%), Tamang, Sherpa etc 278 (26.3%) and Newar (226, 21.3%) were the main echo-users. Elderly age group (>60 yr) comprised of more than one third of the patients (42.0%) followed by the age group of 45-59 yr (27.7%). No abnormality was detected in 133 (12.6%) patients. Valvular heart disease was noticed in more than half of patients (60.7%), followed by diastolic dysfunction (393, 14.0%) and left ventricular hypertrophy (210, 7.5%). This database is not very expensive but demand minimal extra time and energy. It will be a valuable tool to increase diagnostic accuracy and a great resource for academic purpose aiding in the improvement of cardiac care in Nepal. "
574,28372570,"Malaria is a major world health issue and its continued burden is due, in part, to difficulties in the diagnosis of the illness. The World Health Organization recommends confirmatory testing using microscopy-based techniques or rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for all cases of suspected malaria. In regions where Plasmodium species are indigenous, there are multiple etiologies of fever leading to misdiagnoses, especially in populations where HIV is prevalent and children. To determine the frequency of malaria infection in febrile patients over an 8-month period at the Regional Hospital in Bamenda, Cameroon, we evaluated the clinical efficacy of the Flourescence and Staining Technology (FAST) Malaria stain and ParaLens Advance Peripheral blood samples from 522 patients with a clinical diagnosis of ""suspected malaria"" were evaluated using GS and FM methods. A nested PCR assay was the gold standard to compare the two methods. PCR positivity, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were determined. Four hundred ninety nine samples were included in the final analysis. Of these, 30 were positive via PCR (6.01%) with a mean PPV of 19.62% and 27.99% for GS and FM, respectively. The mean NPV was 95.01% and 95.28% for GS and FM, respectively. Sensitivity was 26.67% in both groups and specificity was 92.78% and 96.21% for GS and FM, respectively. An increased level of diagnostic discrepancy was observed between technicians based upon skill level using GS, which was not seen with FM. The frequency of malarial infections confirmed via PCR among patients presenting with fever and other symptoms of malaria was dramatically lower than that anticipated based upon physicians' clinical suspicions. A correlation between technician skill and accuracy of malaria diagnosis using GS was observed that was less pronounced using FM. Additionally, FM increased the specificity and improved the PPV, suggesting this relatively low cost approach could be useful in resource-limited environments. Anecdotally, physicians were reluctant to not treat all patients symptomatically before results were known and in spite of a negative microscopic diagnosis, highlighting the need for further physician education to avoid this practice of overtreatment. A larger study in an area with a known high prevalence is being planned to compare the two microscopy methods against available RDTs. "
575,17547608,"Although the right atrial appendage (RAA) is typically used for atrial pacing lead implant, recent studies have shown benefits of alternate site atrial pacing (ASAP) in the elderly. However, comparable studies in the young are lacking. To investigate effects of ASAP on cardiac function and atrioventricular mechanical interactions in the young, 26 subjects (ages 10 to 23 years) with normal cardiac anatomy, function, and atrioventricular node conduction underwent echocardiography during electrophysiology studies while in sinus rhythm (NSR), and with temporary pacing from high right atrium (HRA), RAA, mid septal right atrium approximating Bachmann's bundle (BB), and left atrium (LA) via the distal coronary sinus (CS). After a paced steady state of 10 minutes, left atrial total and systolic ejection fractions, color-guided mitral inflow, and annular tissue Doppler indices were obtained. Left ventricular ejection fraction and myocardial performance indexes (MPI) were calculated. The total and systolic LA ejection fractions were higher during the NSR compared to all ASAP. Mitral inflow velocities changed significantly with ASAP. The passive/active ventricular filling ratio (E/A) deteriorated from NSR to HRA to BB to CS. There were significant changes in late diastolic tissue Doppler velocities during ASAP compared to NSR. The MPI during ASAP differed from those during the NSR. HRA and Bachmann bundle pacing provided better MPIs than RAA or CS pacing. The location of atrial pacing leads has an acute impact on cardiac function and atrioventricular mechanical interaction. Pacing close to sinus node location may be beneficial in the young. "
576,26671318,"The Broselow tape is a length-based tool used for the rapid estimation of pediatric weight and was developed to reduce dosage-related errors during emergencies. This study seeks to assess the accuracy of the Broselow tape and age-based formulas in predicting weights of South Sudanese children of varying nutritional status. This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study using data from existing acute malnutrition screening programs for children less than 5 years of age in South Sudan. Using anthropometric measurements, actual weights were compared with estimated weights from the Broselow tape and three age-based formulas. Mid-upper arm circumference was used to determine if each child was malnourished. Broselow accuracy was assessed by the percentage of measured weights falling into the same color zone as the predicted weight. For each method, accuracy was assessed by mean percentage error and percentage of predicted weights falling within 10% of actual weight. All data were analyzed by nutritional status subgroup. Only 10.7% of malnourished and 26.6% of nonmalnourished children had their actual weight fall within the Broselow color zone corresponding to their length. The Broselow method overestimated weight by a mean of 26.6% in malnourished children and 16.6% in nonmalnourished children (p < 0.001). Age-based formulas also overestimated weight, with mean errors ranging from 16.2% over actual weight (Advanced Pediatric Life Support in nonmalnourished children) to 70.9% over actual (Best Guess in severely malnourished children). The Broselow tape and age-based formulas selected for comparison were all markedly inaccurate in both the nonmalnourished and the malnourished populations studied, worsening with increasing malnourishment. Additional studies should explore appropriate methods of weight and dosage estimation for populations of low- and low-to-middle-income countries and regions with a high prevalence of malnutrition. "
577,28237426,"Gene therapy (GT) has offered immense hope to individuals who are visually impaired because of RPE65 mutations. Although GT has shown great success in clinical trials enrolling these individuals, evidence for stability and durability of this treatment over time is still unknown. Herein we explored the value of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as an objective measure to assess independently the longevity of retinal GT. Individuals with RPE65 mutations who underwent GT in their worse-seeing eye in a phase 1 clinical trial received a second subretinal injection in their contralateral eye in a follow-on clinical trial. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed longitudinally to assess brain responses of patients with RPE65 mutations after stimulation of their most recently treated eye before and 1 to 3 years after GT. Seven participants with RPE65 mutations who were part of the follow-on clinical trial gave informed consent to participate in a longitudinal neuroimaging fMRI study. All participants underwent fMRI using a 3-Tesla MRI system and a 32-channel head coil. Participants' cortical activations were assessed using a block design paradigm of contrast reversing checkerboard stimuli delivered using an MRI-compatible video system. The primary parameters being measured in this study were the qualitative and quantitative fMRI cortical activations produced by our population in response to the visual task. Functional MRI results showed minimal or no cortical responses before GT. Significant increase in cortical activation lasting at least 3 years after GT was observed for all participants. Repeated measures analysis showed significant associations between cortical activations and clinical measures such as full-field light sensitivity threshold for white, red, and blue colors; visual field; and pupillary light reflex. Participants with RPE65 mutations showed intact visual pathways, which became responsive and strengthened after treatment. Functional MRI results independently revealed the efficacy and durability of a 1-time subretinal injection. The fMRI results paralleled those recently reported during the long-term clinical evaluations of the same patients. Results from this study demonstrated that fMRI may play an important role in providing complementary information to patients' ophthalmic clinical evaluation and has usefulness as an outcome measure for future retinal intervention studies.

578,16441620,"There is a strong correlation between naevus number and prospective melanoma risk. Melanoma is one of the most rapidly increasing cancers in Estonia and primary prevention programmes for melanoma that target risk behaviour in the sun have so far not been launched. The naevus profile was examined in 549/700 9-year-old Estonian children (282 boys and 267 girls) and the presence of active atopic dermatitis (AD) was registered. There was a wide range of naevi (4-121) and a median total body count of 26. There was no difference in naevus count between boys and girls. No dysplastic naevi were found. Thirty-nine of 549 children (7%) had at least one lesion clinically diagnosed as a congenital naevus. Boys had more naevi on the face (median 4) and trunk (median 12) than girls (median 3 and 9, respectively, P < 0.001). Girls had more naevi on the legs compared with boys (median 4 and 3, respectively, P < 0.01). Fifty-four out of 549 (9.8%) had naevi on the palms and 18/549 (3.3%) on the soles. Children with fair skin, freckles and light hair and eye colours had significantly more naevi than those with darker colours. Thirty-one of 549 (6%) children had AD diagnosed on the examination day and they had a lower total naevus count (median 20) compared with children with no AD (median 27, n = 518, P < 0.05). The naevus situation in Estonian children today might constitute a starting point for evaluating the efficiency of coming preventive measures as a change of naevus number in children might serve as an early marker for a change in melanoma incidence.

580,20149514,"Although sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) can be initially established after resuscitation from non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in some children, many of the children lose spontaneous circulation during hospital stay and do not survive to discharge. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical features during the first hour after ROSC that may predict survival to hospital discharge. We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of 228 children who presented to the emergency department without spontaneous circulation following non-traumatic OHCA during the period January 1996 to December 2008. Among these children, 80 achieved sustained ROSC for at least 20 min. The post-resuscitative clinical features during the first hour after achieving sustained ROSC that correlated with survival, median duration of survival, and death were analyzed. Among the 80 children who achieved sustained ROSC for at least 20 min, 28 survived to hospital discharge and 6 had good neurologic outcomes (PCPC scale=1 or 2). Post-resuscitative clinical features associated with survival included sinus cardiac rhythm (p=0.012), normal heart rate (p=0.008), normal blood pressure (p<0.001), urine output>1 ml/kg/h (p=0.002), normal skin color (p=0.016), lack of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)-induced rib fracture (p=0.044), initial Glasgow Coma Scale score>7 (p<0.001), and duration of in-hospital CPR<or=10 min (p<0.001). Furthermore, these variables were also significantly associated with the duration of survival (all p<0.05). The most important predictors of survival to hospital discharge in children with OHCA who achieve sustained ROSC are a normal heart rate, normal blood pressure, and an initial urine output>1 ml/kg/h.

581,36254375,"Climate change is a significant public health crisis that is both rooted in pre-existing inequitable socioeconomic and racial systems and will further worsen these social injustices. In the face of acute and slow-moving natural disasters, women, and particularly women of color, will be more susceptible to gender-based violence, displacement, and other socioeconomic stressors, all of which have adverse mental health outcomes. Among the social consequences of climate change, eco-anxiety resulting from these negative impacts is also increasingly a significant factor in family planning and reproductive justice, as well as disruptions of the feminine connection to nature that numerous cultures historically and currently honor. This narrative review will discuss these sociologic factors and also touch on ways that practitioners can become involved in climate-related advocacy for the physical and mental well-being of their patients.

582,28538724,"The organization of the eukaryotic cell into discrete membrane-bound organelles allows for the separation of incompatible biochemical processes, but the activities of these organelles must be coordinated. For example, lipid metabolism is distributed between the endoplasmic reticulum for lipid synthesis, lipid droplets for storage and transport, mitochondria and peroxisomes for β-oxidation, and lysosomes for lipid hydrolysis and recycling. It is increasingly recognized that organelle contacts have a vital role in diverse cellular functions. However, the spatial and temporal organization of organelles within the cell remains poorly characterized, as fluorescence imaging approaches are limited in the number of different labels that can be distinguished in a single image. Here we present a systems-level analysis of the organelle interactome using a multispectral image acquisition method that overcomes the challenge of spectral overlap in the fluorescent protein palette. We used confocal and lattice light sheet instrumentation and an imaging informatics pipeline of five steps to achieve mapping of organelle numbers, volumes, speeds, positions and dynamic inter-organelle contacts in live cells from a monkey fibroblast cell line. We describe the frequency and locality of two-, three-, four- and five-way interactions among six different membrane-bound organelles (endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, lysosome, peroxisome, mitochondria and lipid droplet) and show how these relationships change over time. We demonstrate that each organelle has a characteristic distribution and dispersion pattern in three-dimensional space and that there is a reproducible pattern of contacts among the six organelles, that is affected by microtubule and cell nutrient status. These live-cell confocal and lattice light sheet spectral imaging approaches are applicable to any cell system expressing multiple fluorescent probes, whether in normal conditions or when cells are exposed to disturbances such as drugs, pathogens or stress. This methodology thus offers a powerful descriptive tool and can be used to develop hypotheses about cellular organization and dynamics. "
583,26429183,"The precise prevalence of molluscum contagiosum (MC) is still unknown. The pediatric studies showed a cumulative incidence of 17% in children less than 15 years, but there are no studies available for Romania. The papular skin lesions are generally less than 5 mm, but the immunocompromised patients may develop large uncommon lesions. The pediatric cases are located mostly on the limbs, trunk or the face. The lab investigations are not usually required because the clinical features are typical. A biopsy followed by a light microscopy may help in some cases. We are presenting the case of a 6-year-old boy suffering from MC since almost a year. When examined in our clinic, the child developed 2 to 4 mm dome-shaped flesh-colored papules with central umbilication on his trunk diagnosed as MC. The microscopic examination revealed bud-like proliferation of the epidermis, molluscum bodies and moderate chronic inflammation of the dermis. In about one month of treatment, all the lesions disappeared without other local or general complications. "

585,36149727,"T cell-mediated immunity plays an important role in controlling flavivirus infection, either after vaccination or after natural infection. The ""quality"" of a T cell needs to be assessed by function, and higher function is associated with more powerful immune protection. T cells that can simultaneously produce two or more cytokines or chemokines at the single-cell level are called polyfunctional T cells (TPFs), which mediate immune responses through a variety of molecular mechanisms to express degranulation markers (CD107a) and secrete interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-2, or macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α. There is increasing evidence that TPFs are closely related to the maintenance of long-term immune memory and protection and that their increased proportion is an important marker of protective immunity and is important in the effective control of viral infection and reactivation. This evaluation applies not only to specific immune responses but also to the assessment of cross-reactive immune responses. Here, taking the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) as an example, the detection method and flow cytometry color scheme of JEV-specific TPFs produced by peripheral blood mononuclear cells of children vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis were tested to provide a reference for similar studies.

587,23558836,"Color flow Doppler ultrasonography has been used to confirm caudal epidural injection, but its ability to detect accidental intrathecal injection is unknown. We hypothesized that, when using color flow Doppler, the injection of fluid into the epidural space would result in turbulent flow which would appear as a burst of color while intrathecal injection would show an absence of a color flow Doppler signal. Two groups of pediatric patients (up to 6 years of age) were prospectively enrolled for this observational study during a 2-month period. One group (group E) consisted of patients suitable for elective surgery using caudal epidural analgesia, and the other (group I) included patients receiving lumbar puncture for intrathecal chemotherapeutic injection. After induction of general anesthesia and placement of the patient in the lateral position, an 8 MHz curved array probe (Sonosite TITAN, Bothell, WA) was applied to obtain a transverse image of the lumbar region (L1-L3). Real-time images using color flow Doppler were obtained and recorded during initial injections of 2 consecutive (20 seconds apart) aliquots of 0.1 mL/kg medication of local anesthetic (0.25% bupivacaine) or chemotherapy drugs (mixture of methotrexate, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone) at a rate of 0.5 to 1.0 mL/s. After obtaining the study images, the rest of the medication was injected in standard fashion. A blinded anesthesiologist later evaluated the recorded images to determine a positive or negative result (positive = presence of turbulence as illustrated by a medley of color; negative = no turbulence or color). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated for those patients who had successful analgesia (group E) and intrathecal (group I) injections. Forty recorded images from 41 patients (group E, n = 21; group I, n = 20) were included in the analysis. The observed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive values were all 100%. The lower 95% confidence limits were 0.832. In the context of this study, color flow Doppler could differentiate epidural from intrathecal injection into the caudal space of children up to 6 years of age using a 0.1 mL/kg injection volume and injection rate of 0.5 to 1.0 mL/s.

588,30547360,"To report current results of vaginoplasty using the mucosa of the prepuce, and creating labia minora by penile skin in children with disorders of sex development (DSD). In 10 years, we have performed 22 vaginoplasties using the described technique of vaginoplasty, 21 patients with 46, XX DSD and 1 ovotesticular DSD. The assessment of the results of this technique of vaginoplasty was undertaken in several stages: (a) The evaluation of the cosmetic result. (b) The research for a urinary incontinence and urethrovaginal fistulas. (c) The research for a vaginal stenosis by the introduction of a lubricated feeding tube into the vaginal cavity. The labia minora was evaluated by three criteria: its skin should be thin and very supple, it should have a free edge which partially or totally covers the clitoris, urethral meatus, and vaginal orifice; and it is preferable that its color be darker than the rest of the skin. The cosmetic outcome was considered by parents and the surgeon as very satisfactory in 11 patients (50% of cases), satisfactory in 4 patients (18.2%), and unsatisfactory in 7 patients (31.8%). The postoperative complications were five cases of proximal stenosis (22.7%), one distal stenosis (stenosis of introitus) and two necrosis of the preputial flap. No urethrovaginal fistula and urinary incontinence were reported. In infant and young child, when it is difficult to make use of complete urogenital mobilization, the mucosa of the prepuce can be an alternative to create a neovagina, its histological constitution is identical to a vaginal wall, and it does not prevent to have a good labia minora.

We aimed to report the outcome of this technique in infants and children with duplex kidney in a 5-year retrospective multicentric international survey. Data on 50 children who underwent RPN (41 upper-pole nephrectomies and 9 lower-pole nephrectomies) were retrospectively collected in this six-institution survey. Median age at surgery was 3.3 years. There were 35 girls and 15 boys. The left side was affected in 28 patients, versus the right side in 22 patients. We assessed intraoperative and postoperative morbidity. Follow-up (median, 2.5 years; range, 12 months-5 years) was based on clinical controls and echo color Doppler renal ultrasound scans. Median duration of surgery was 255 minutes. Surgery was always performed with the patient in a lateral position. Special hemostatic devices were used for dissection and parenchymal section in all centers. Three patients from two centers (6%) required conversion to open surgery. We recorded seven complications (six peritoneal perforations, one opening of the remaining calyxes) in the 50 cases. Re-operation rate was 0%. Average length of hospital stay was 4.1 days. Our survey shows that RPN remains a challenging procedure with a long learning curve, performed only in pediatric centers with huge experience in this field. In our survey operative time was longer than 4 hours. The complication rate remains high (7/50, or 14%), with complications classified as Grade II according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. They did not require further surgery, but they were associated with a prolonged hospital stay. "
591,9021563,"Pyriform sinus fistula recurs when a complete excision of the fistula has not been made. As a supportive technique for this radical operation, the authors performed an intraoperative endoscopic examination of the pyriform sinus for the cannulation or dye injection of the tract in four cases. In three cases, the sinuses were relatively long and ran outside the thyroid cartilage. The cannulation of the tract with a guide wire, in these cases, was useful for identifying the thin membranous tract. In one of these three cases sinus fistula recurred, but a complete excision of the tract was then performed by introducing a 10F Nelaton catheter over a guide wire, which allowed for easy handling of the remnant tract. In the remaining case, cannulation proved not to be useful because the tract was short and ran inside the thyroid cartilage. A short tract embedded within the inferior constrictor muscle could only be found through careful observation after repeated dye injections. The proper selection of the optimum supportive techniques as described above, are considered to be essential for performing a complete excision. "
592,25951999,"In animal studies, the inhibition of VEGF activity results in high mortality and impaired renal and glomerular development. Mechanical stimuli, like mechanical stretch in respiratory and circulatory systems, results in an elevated expression of VEGF. In animal models, the experimental urinary obstruction is associated with stretching of tubular cells and activations of the renin-angiotensin system. This results in the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and TNF-alfa. Tissue samples from urinary tract obstruction were collected and immunohistochemistry was performed in 14 patients (average age: 7.1±4.1 years). The control histology group consisted of ureteropelvic junction tissue from 10 fetuses after midtrimester artificial abortion. The fetuses did not have any failure at ultrasound screening and pathological examination. The mean gestational age was 20.6 weeks of gestation (±2.2SD). Expression of VEGF was detected with immunohistochemistry method. Expression of VEGF was found in varying intensity in the submucosa and subserosa layers, but only in the test tissue (placental tissue). The tissue of the patients with urinary obstruction and the tissue of the fetal ureteropelvic junction without urinary obstruction were negative for expression of VEGF. The repeated examination showed negative cells and no color staining. The pressure due to congenital urogenital obstruction resulting in mechanical stress in cells did not increase the expression of VEGF in young children in our study. To find a correlation between urogenital tract obstruction and increased expression of VEGF, we need to perform more examinations because the connection may be of therapeutic significance. "

594,17686741,"In July 2003, a consortium of three USAID partners launched a project to promote the correct use of color-coded, age-specific, prepackaged drugs (PPDs) to treat malaria promptly in preschool-aged children in Aba, Abia State, Nigeria. A 3-pronged promotional approach included training of patent medicine vendors (PMVs), home visits by community health promoters, and mass media. Five hundred seventy respondents were interviewed in February-March 2004. People heard about the PPDs from medicine sellers (33.4%), health workers (24.3%), the electronic mass media (18.4%), and friends or relatives (13.5%). Most children (81.1%) took Robaquine (chloroquine-CQ), while 108 (18.9%) took Fansidar (sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine-SP). The median amount paid for Robaquine was 50 naira (dollars 0.36) and for Fansidar, 80 naira (dollars 0.57). Respondents rated the effectiveness of the PPD treatment as very effective (86.8%). Most respondents had something positive to say about the drug (94.9%) and the packaging (93.8%). Only 19.5%) had a complaint about either the drug or the packaging. Overall, 454 (83.9%) received the correct age-appropriate packet. Continuing education is needed for the PMVs to ensure that they obtain accurate age information about the child and sell the age-specific packet. Underdosing is just as serious a concern as overdosing in Nigeria where parasite resistance is rapidly developing for both drugs. "
595,36190168,"This study hypothesizes using color Doppler ultrasound to measure ureteral jet angles (UJA) as a diagnostic screening tool for reflux. The present prospective cohort study included 122 patients and 238 renal unit pediatric patients suspected of VUR who presented to our hospital between 2019 and 2021. All patients underwent ultrasonography and VCUG, and the UJA was measured color Doppler evaluation of the ureteral jet. The UJA was compared with the VCUG findings in patients with and without reflux. SPSS 26 was used to analyze the data. A total of 96 patients and 139 renal units exhibited reflux. The mean ureteral jet angle in refluxing units was 60.47 + 16.66 degrees, whereas, it was 42.59 + 13.26 degrees in non-refluxing units, a significant difference between the two groups (P < .001). The mean ureteral jet angle was 42.59, 45.89, 60.32, 68.23, and 56.16, for reflux grading from 0 to 5 (except grade 1), respectively. The angle value in each reflux grade increased significantly except for grade 5. For reflux detection (grade I-V), a cut-off angle of 50 degrees was associated with sensitivity and specificity of 70 and 79, respectively. Grade IV/V reflux can be diagnosed with a sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 84% using a cut-off angle of 68 degrees or greater. UJA detection via color Doppler ultrasound demonstrates high accuracy, is non-invasive method can be utilized as an alternative primary diagnostic tool or in follow-up cases of VUR in children. "

A total of 222 procedures of superficial manual KTP and superficial automated KTP were performed. The procedures were divided into 2 groups: first and second-stage procedures. The patients' cosmetic appearance and satisfaction were evaluated and graded as excellent, good, or poor. A total of 222 procedures were performed, 57.2% were superficial automated KTP, 22.5% were superficial manual KTP, and 20.3% included the combination of superficial KTP with other KTP techniques. Six procedures were purely cosmetic, 16 therapeutic functional, and 200 therapeutic cosmetic. Superficial KTP, as a second-stage procedure, was performed in 13 eyes that were previously pigmented by intrastromal techniques. Superficial KTP as an initial indication (first-stage procedure) alone or in combination with another KTP technique in the same surgery was performed in 123 eyes, in which 44.7% of them were reoperated once or more. Best-corrected visual acuity changed insignificantly, and the intraocular pressure decreased significantly in all the studied groups. No intraoperative complications were observed, 11.2% of eyes with a follow-up time of more than 3 months developed postoperative complications. Most of the patients (98.5%) were satisfied. The modern superficial KTP procedure provides the possibility to improve the cosmetic appearance of impaired eyes, as an alternative to evisceration, enucleation, prosthetic contact lenses, or keratoplasty.

597,29359391,"The purpose of this study was to review the outcomes following the percutaneous carotid arterial (PCA) approach in infants and children with congenital heart disease. PCA access is becoming more commonly adopted following reports demonstrating it is a safe alternative to surgical carotid cutdown and even the femoral arterial route. However, follow-up outcomes after PCA remain unreported. We reviewed all cases with PCA access and follow-up catheterizations which included carotid artery (CA) angiography between May 2012 until December 2016. We examined for evidence of CA stenosis at follow-up angiography and assessed any other CA complications associated with vascular access. There were 61 PCA catheterizations performed in 55 unique patients. Follow-up CA imaging with angiography was available in 43 patients (78%, 43/55). There was no vessel stenosis nor lumen irregularity in 28 (65%) patients. In 15 cases (35%), there was a mild degree of irregularity or narrowing by angiography (median 4.1%, range 2.3%-12.5%). Nine patients underwent repeat PCA catheterizations. Seven of these had no visible vascular stenosis on follow-up angiographic imaging, including a patient who was accessed three separate times from the CA. No statistically significant risk factors for developing mild CA stenosis were identified. PCA access for pediatric interventional catheterization appears to be safe with a very low rate of mild stenosis, and very few complications. Follow-up outcomes in our series are excellent, with a CA patency rate of 100%, even after multiple procedures. Mild CA stenosis was not associated with patient size or sheath introducer caliber. While the acute results from percutaneous CA catheterization have proven safe in recent literature, longer-term outcomes remain unreported. At our institution, the outcomes following percutaneous carotid access are associated with an excellent patency rate of 100%, even after multiple procedures on the same vessel. A low incidence of mild vessel stenosis can be appreciated on follow-up angiography. "
598,10823457,"Mesenteric cyst (MC) is a relatively rare disease, and its sonographic characteristics have not been sufficiently analyzed. We studied the sonographic findings of eight patients with MC, with attention paid to its size, shape, internal echoes, and especially the presence or absence of lateral shadowing and the mode of back echoes. In four cases, the sound velocity and acoustic impedance of cystic fluid were also measured. The mode of blood flow was evaluated by color Doppler sonography. Six cases showed an oval or comma-shaped mass. Internal echoes were present in six cases, and two of them showed a pseudosolid pattern. In these cases, M-mode sonography confirmed the movement of these internal echoes. Only one case showed a posterior echo enhancement, and no case showed lateral shadowing. Sound velocity measured in four cases was 1,515-1,537 m/s, with an acoustic impedance of 1.550-1.576 kg/m2/s. No blood flow signals were obtained from the lesion. MC exhibits so many patterns on ultrasound that we should consider the possibility of MC when encountering an avascular oval mesenteric mass. "
599,27131100,"Gastroenteritis is a common pediatric illness. Electrolyte maintenance solution is recommended to treat and prevent dehydration. Its advantage in minimally dehydrated children is unproven. To determine if oral hydration with dilute apple juice/preferred fluids is noninferior to electrolyte maintenance solution in children with mild gastroenteritis. Randomized, single-blind noninferiority trial conducted between the months of October and April during the years 2010 to 2015 in a tertiary care pediatric emergency department in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Study participants were children aged 6 to 60 months with gastroenteritis and minimal dehydration. Participants were randomly assigned to receive color-matched half-strength apple juice/preferred fluids (n=323) or apple-flavored electrolyte maintenance solution (n=324). Oral rehydration therapy followed institutional protocols. After discharge, the half-strength apple juice/preferred fluids group was administered fluids as desired; the electrolyte maintenance solution group replaced losses with electrolyte maintenance solution. The primary outcome was a composite of treatment failure defined by any of the following occurring within 7 days of enrollment: intravenous rehydration, hospitalization, subsequent unscheduled physician encounter, protracted symptoms, crossover, and 3% or more weight loss or significant dehydration at in-person follow-up. Secondary outcomes included intravenous rehydration, hospitalization, and frequency of diarrhea and vomiting. The noninferiority margin was defined as a difference between groups of 7.5% for the primary outcome and was assessed with a 1-sided α=.025. If noninferiority was established, a 1-sided test for superiority was conducted. Among 647 randomized children (mean age, 28.3 months; 331 boys [51.1%]; 441 (68.2%) without evidence of dehydration), 644 (99.5%) completed follow-up. Children who were administered dilute apple juice experienced treatment failure less often than those given electrolyte maintenance solution (16.7% vs 25.0%; difference, -8.3%; 97.5% CI, -∞ to -2.0%; P < .001 for inferiority and P = .006 for superiority). Fewer children administered apple juice/preferred fluids received intravenous rehydration (2.5% vs 9.0%; difference, -6.5%; 99% CI, -11.6% to -1.8%). Hospitalization rates and diarrhea and vomiting frequency were not significantly different between groups. Among children with mild gastroenteritis and minimal dehydration, initial oral hydration with dilute apple juice followed by their preferred fluids, compared with electrolyte maintenance solution, resulted in fewer treatment failures. In many high-income countries, the use of dilute apple juice and preferred fluids as desired may be an appropriate alternative to electrolyte maintenance fluids in children with mild gastroenteritis and minimal dehydration. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01185054.

600,10756242,"Coronary artery stenosis (CAS) and coronary ostial stenosis (COS) are potentially life-threatening conditions. The echocardiographic diagnosis of CAS and COS in children has not been described. We report on the transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) findings of CAS and COS in children. Six patients, aged 1 week to 12 years, with clinically confirmed COS (n = 5) and CAS (n = l) were diagnosed by TTE. Their echocardiographic findings were compared with 26 healthy control subjects of a similar age range. Left COS was associated with an aberrant left coronary artery (CA) from the contralateral aortic sinus (n = 2), an intramural left CA with d-transposition of the great vessels (n = l), and supravalvular aortic stenosis (n = l). Right COS was present in a patient with aortic valvular stenosis. Acquired left main CAS was diagnosed in the sixth patient 3 years after orthotopic heart transplantation. Coronary ostial stenosis was recognized when a color flow acceleration signal was present proximal to and extending into the coronary ostium (CO). Coronary artery stenosis was detected when a coarctated color flow stream was present within the stenosed CA segment with turbulent distal flow. These findings were not detected in the control cohort who demonstrated laminar CA and CO flow signals. All patients had increased spectral velocity in the CA distal to the stenosed segment (patients = 50 +/- 5 cm/s, controls = 24 +/- 6 cm/sec; P <.01). Delayed peak diastolic velocity seemed to indicate severe stenosis. We conclude that (1) CO acceleration signals and turbulent coarctated CA flow signals are abnormal findings in TTE coronary Doppler assessment. They indicate COS and CAS, respectively. (2) Knowledge of the normal TTE CA flow velocity patterns is essential so that abnormal velocity signals such as seen with CAS and COS can be recognized and a timely diagnosis made. "
601,31939929,"Leukemia cutis (LC) is a rare condition that results from infiltration of neoplastic cells into the skin in patients with leukemia, mainly described in case reports or small case series. This study aimed to characterize the clinical presentation of LC and its association with leukemia evolution and prognosis. A single-institution retrospective review of medical records of patients with LC was performed. Biopsy-proven LC cases diagnosed in patients with leukemia were analyzed for a variety of clinical characteristics and prognosis; 46 patients met inclusion criteria. Leukemia cutis most commonly presented in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), though lesions were seen in several other leukemia types. Most LC lesions were identified at initial presentation of underlying leukemia but also occurred with leukemia relapse and at other stages of treatment. Most patients died within 1 year of LC diagnosis. The clinical presentation of LC is highly variable. Lesions occur in different anatomic regions; can present as papules, nodules, or plaques; and have different associated colors and symptoms. Duration between diagnosis of leukemia and death in patients who develop LC, and between LC diagnosis and death, are highly variable. Early detection of lesions might help provide a diagnosis in patients with leukemia and potentially improve prognosis if doing so results in earlier initiation of chemotherapy. "

The aim of this viewpoint is to discuss epidemiological data from Tanzania on overall health indicators and the burden of malaria and HIV. Is the situation in Tanzania improving or deteriorating? Are the health-related millennium development goals (MDG) on reducing under-five mortality, reducing maternal mortality and halting HIV and malaria within reach? Child mortality and infant mortality rates are decreasing quite dramatically. Malaria prevention strategies and new effective treatment are being launched. The MDG 4 on child mortality is clearly within reach, and the same optimism may apply to MDG 6 on combating malaria. "
603,38729862,"The prevalence of mental health conditions in pediatric patients in the United States is approximately 15%. Concerningly, nearly half go untreated, with lower treatment rates among children of color. Collaborative care can increase access to care and has an emerging evidence base for pediatrics. We present retrospective results from a collaborative care program that accepted referrals for a variety of conditions. Pediatric patients seen in an academic, urban collaborative care program from July 2019 to December 2021 were tracked in a registry. Demographics, presenting problem(s), symptoms, treatment, and discharge dispositions were examined. Descriptive data were analyzed, including changes in reported symptoms via paired t-tests. Three hundred nineteen patients were seen. Racial and ethnic diversity in our clinic's population was similar to that of the surrounding community, with half belonging to a minoritized racial or ethnic group. Symptom comparisons demonstrated clinically and statistically significant improvements from intake to discharge. Collaborative care can improve access to care and outcomes for a diverse pediatric population. Our clinic served racial and ethnic patient populations that were representative of the demographics of the metropolitan area. Further study is necessary to determine if collaborative care increases access for these underserved groups. "
604,24486748,"Two children (male, 10 years, and female, 13 years one month) with tumours of the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of the brain were studied post-surgically for their abilities to carry out a short-term memory test. This involved: differences in colour, number and shape of small plastic objects; differences in receptacles where these objects should be placed and in ways in which this placement should be done; a procedural task involving differences either in colour or in size of wooden rings employed in the task. Their performances in these tests, and those of patients with tumours of other encephalic areas, were compared with the performances of normal controls. The subjects with IT tumours spent a significantly greater amount of time than normal subjects of their age in carrying out the procedural task involving differences in colour. One of the IT subjects also spent a significantly greater amount of time in the procedural task involving size differences. Other differences in the performances of patients with encephalic tumours and the performances of normal controls were not significant. Results are discussed in relation to findings of colour and size perception and memory localized to the inferior temporal and middle temporal cortices. "
605,18568594,Population differences in tooth formation using radiographs can be determined if the entire developmental sequence of a single tooth is studied. The only developing tooth visible radiographically from initiation to root completion is the third molar or wisdom tooth. The timing of mandibular third molar formation was documented for two groups of children in England and two in South Africa. Panoramic radiographs of White and Bangladeshi children from London and Black African and Cape Coloured children from South Africa were examined (age 5-24). Mean age of entering third molar stages (crypt appearance to root completion) was calculated using logistic regression and compared between sex and group using a t-test. Average age of third molar stages was significantly (p < 0.001) later in three groups for almost all stages of the third molar compared to Black children. The average age of entering initial mineralization ranged from 7.97 to 9.74 years while average age of apex closed was 19.27-20.88. These results show for the first time a significant difference in the timing of maturation of the mandibular third molar between groups with South African Black children being earlier than other groups. 
606,38156748,"Poliosis is defined as the absence of melanin in hair, and hair graying typically occurs with hair melanin reduction. Poliosis can occur at any age but presents in childhood in certain genetic and acquired conditions, with many families seeking evaluation from a pediatric dermatologist. Poliosis presents as white hair typically restricted to a certain location of the scalp. Children may also present with a reduction of expected hair pigmentation, referred to as pigment dilution, or the development of hair graying. This review aims to provide a streamlined diagnostic approach for pediatric dermatologists when presented with these hair findings. Poliosis should be recognized as a potential diagnostic feature or initial sign in many syndromes and thus can guide clinicians in diagnosing and managing conditions earlier in a patient's care. Since many of the genetic and acquired conditions that present with poliosis or hair pigment dilution have extracutaneous manifestations, early diagnosis is vital in establishing multidisciplinary care.

608,21442400,"Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is characterized by irreversible diastolic dysfunction with preserved systolic function. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of impaired ventricular contractility even in the presence of normal ejection fraction (EF) in children with RCM. Longitudinal Doppler tissue velocities were obtained from apical 4-chamber view at three locations--the left-ventricular (LV) lateral wall, the septum, and the right ventricle--in 8 children age 3-17 years old with RCM who had LV EF >55%. Peak systolic velocity (S'), acceleration during isovolumic contraction (IVA), and myocardial performance index (MPI) were measured. Data from the RCM group were compared with those from 24 age- and sex-matched controls. Both S' and IVA were markedly lower at the septum (S' 6.2 ± 1.7 vs. 9.2 ± 1.6, P < 0.001; IVA 1.8 ± 0.5 vs. 3.9 ± 1.5, P < 0.001). MPI, a measure of both diastolic and systolic function, was statistically significantly greater in the RCM group at all 3 locations (P < 0.005). S' and IVA identify global subclinical systolic dysfunction in RCM with normal EF. These findings suggest that pre-ejection abnormality and subclinical systolic dysfunction coexist with diastolic dysfunction in children with RCM. "

610,25320961,"The purpose of this study was to report how verbal rehearsal speed (VRS), a form of covert speech used to maintain verbal information in working memory, and another verbal processing speed measure, perceptual encoding speed, are related to 3 domains of executive function (EF) at risk in cochlear implant (CI) users: verbal working memory, fluency-speed, and inhibition-concentration. EF, speech perception, and language outcome measures were obtained from 55 prelingually deaf, long-term CI users and matched controls with normal hearing (NH controls). Correlational analyses were used to assess relations between VRS (articulation rate), perceptual encoding speed (digit and color naming), and the outcomes in each sample. CI users displayed slower verbal processing speeds than NH controls. Verbal rehearsal speed was related to 2 EF domains in the NH sample but was unrelated to EF outcomes in CI users. Perceptual encoding speed was related to all EF domains in both groups. Verbal rehearsal speed may be less influential for EF quality in CI users than for NH controls, whereas rapid automatized labeling skills and EF are closely related in both groups. CI users may develop processing strategies in EF tasks that differ from the covert speech strategies routinely employed by NH individuals. "
611,16140644,"The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and significance of the proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) method in children with rheumatic mitral regurgitation (MR). Thirty-one children (mean age 12.3+/-3.1 years), with chronic MR, were evaluated by semiquantitative and quantitative Doppler, quantitative two-dimensional echocardiography and the PISA methods. Also, we compared the effective regurgitant orifice area, regurgitation volume and systolic left ventricular functions in mild-moderate and severe MR. There were no statistically significant differences in the regurgitant orifice area and regurgitant volume values obtained by the PISA method and the quantitative Doppler (p>0.05) but they were different from the same values obtained by two dimensional echocardiography (p<0.05). There were excellent correlations between the regurgitant orifice area, regurgitant volume and the radius of the proximal flow convergence hemisphere (r=0.882, r=0.925, r=0.880; p<0.05). We found a very good correlation between the regurgitant orifice area obtained by the PISA and left ventricular end-diastolic diameters, the ratio of the jet/left atrial area, grading with color Doppler imaging (r=0.763, r=0.745, r=0.618; p<0.05). It is concluded that MR can be accurately predicted in children by using the PISA method as like as the Doppler method. "
612,30602446,"To characterise the clinical and topographical features of circumscribed choroidal haemangioma (CCH) and to visualise the patterns of tumour extent in the ocular fundus. Data on the size, shape and location of 113 CCH were converted into a database of two-dimensional retinal charts by means of computer drawing software. The extent of the tumours was visualised by merging the charts and displaying the number of overlapping tumours on colour-coded maps. The mean largest tumour diameter was 7.2 mm (range, 2.5-11.0 mm), mean tumour height was 2.4 mm (range, 0.7-4.6 mm) and mean diameter/height ratio was 3.2 (range, 2.1-6.0). The mean distance from the posterior tumour margin to the foveola and optic disc margin was 1.7 mm (range, 0-15 mm) and 2.4 mm (range, 0-11 mm), respectively. The hemispheric location of the tumour centroid was temporal in 75 eyes (66%) and nasal in 38 (34%) (p=0.0005) and the distribution between the superior and inferior hemispheres was 68 (60%) and 45 (40%), respectively (p=0.03). The presence of subretinal fluid (SRF) was significantly associated with young age at diagnosis (p=0.0002), low tumour diameter/height ratio (p=0.0004), nasal hemisphere location (p=0.006) and close proximity to the optic disc (p=0.004). The superotemporal quadrant close to the macula is the most frequent location of CCH. The tumours are generally characterised by a diameter/height ratio of >2. Tumours in young patients, with marked elevation, in nasal hemisphere and in proximity to the optic disc are associated with SRF exudation. "

We conducted a clinical study of 668 patients with asymptomatic infections in which we analyzed the tongue and pulse features in the Shanghai New International Expo Center mobile cabin hospital. The medical records of the patients, including tongue color, tongue coating, and pulse manifestations, were reviewed by healthcare workers. In total, 668 COVID-19 cases were included in the study. Patient age ranged from 5 to 96 years, with a median of 44.0 (IQR 33.0-53.0) years. Among the patients, 6.14% had comorbidities. The most common comorbid condition was diabetes (1.65%), followed by hypertension (0.89%), coronary heart disease (0.89%), thrombotic diseases (0.89%), congestive heart failure (0.60%), and stroke (0.45%). Pink-red (75.4%) was the most common tongue color, followed by red (23.4%) and pale red (1.2%). Tongue coating color and thickness were classified as white fur (9.28%), thin and yellow fur (48.65%), white greasy fur (8.98%), yellow greasy fur (24.70%), and less coating (8.39%). In addition, a large number of patients ( 300, 44.91%) presented superficial and rapid pulses, and 250 patients (37.4%) exhibited a slippery pulse. Our preliminary results showed that wind, heat, and dampness were the main etiologies of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant infection in traditional Chinese medicine. Furthermore, the main symptoms of the disease may be wind-heat invading the lung syndrome or damp-heat with the exuberance of virulence syndrome, which is of most significance in COVID-19 treatment.

Kaunas city, Lithuania (latitude of 55 degrees 55 minutes). A random sample of 484 children aged 1 to 2 years, 4 to 5 years, and 9 to 10 years and adolescents aged 14 to 15 years. A questionnaire that provided information about the history of sunbathing and skin type. Atypical melanocytic nevi were defined according to the clinical criteria of the ABCDE rule. The median number of all common acquired melanocytic nevi was 12 in boys and 11 in girls; the median number of melanocytic nevi 2 mm or larger in boys and girls was 4. Twenty-seven percent of children experienced severe sunburns more than once. After adjustment for age and sex, it was found that children who had severe sunburns in summer and skin type I had a higher density of all melanocytic nevi and melanocytic nevi 2 mm or larger. The prevalence of atypical melanocytic nevi was 7% in all children and was age dependent (age 4-5 years, 1%; 9-10 years, 4%; 14-15 years, 16%). Three percent of children had congenital melanocytic nevi. The total number of common acquired melanocytic nevi in children increased with age. There was a positive association between severe sunburns, the tendency of the skin to burn, and the number of all melanocytic nevi and nevi 2 mm or larger. "
615,35833064,"In order to study the practical application value of abdominal ultrasonography in the diagnosis and treatment of acute abdomen in children, this study uses the method of collecting clinical actual cases and scientific analysis to estimate the clinical diagnostic value of high-frequency ultrasound and low-frequency ultrasound. In order to further clarify its curative effect and treatment advantages, a retrospective analysis of medical records was conducted, and 95 children with acute abdominal pain and suspected appendicitis who were admitted to a hospital from September 2021 to November 2021 were reviewed. ATIL HD15000 color Doppler ultrasound was used for diagnosis. The results are as follows: the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of low-frequency probe in the diagnosis of intussusception in children were 83.61%, 73.33%, 92.73%, and 52.38%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value in the diagnosis of mesenteric lymphadenitis were 80.00%, 81.97%, 52.17%, and 94.34%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of high-frequency probe in the diagnosis of intussusception in children were 93.44%, 80.00%, 95.00%, and 75.00%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value in the diagnosis of mesenteric lymphadenitis were 93.33%, 95.08%, 82.35%, and 98.31%, respectively. Among the children with appendicitis confirmed by operation and pathology, 69 cases were detected by high-frequency ultrasound and 4 cases were missed (including 3 cases of acute simple appendicitis and 1 case of perforated appendicitis). The false negative was 4%, there was no false positive, and the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 95%, 100%, and 96%. In the same cases, 28 cases were detected by low-frequency ultrasound, 45 cases were missed, the false negative was 61%, and there was no false positive. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 39%, 100%, and 53%. The sensitivity, accuracy, and false negative of high-frequency ultrasound in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis were significantly higher than that of low-frequency ultrasound. This study shows that ultrasound has high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Low-frequency ultrasound can show the whole picture of the disease and the situation in the abdominal cavity, which can better guide the clinical treatment. Color Doppler hemodynamics is a useful supplement to two-dimensional ultrasound, and ultrasound also plays a positive role in the differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis in children. "
616,36959728,"Like infants born very preterm (<32 weeks), late preterm (≥34 and <37 weeks) and early term (≥37 and <39 weeks) births have been associated with increased risk of developmental delay (DD); yet, the evidence remains heterogeneous across the continuum of gestational ages, hindering early identification and intervention. To estimate the association of gestational age at birth with early childhood trajectories of DD in early childhood for infants born ≥34 and <41 weeks, and determine how various maternal, pregnancy and infant characteristics relate to these trajectory groups. Analysis of mother-child dyad data with infants born ≥34 and <41 weeks gestational age within an observational pregnancy cohort in Alberta, Canada, from 2008 to 2011 (n = 2644). The association between gestational age and trajectories of the total number of Ages and Stages Questionnaire domains indicating risk of DD from 1 through 5 years of age were estimated using group-based trajectory modelling along with other perinatal risk factors. Three distinct trajectory groups were identified: low-risk, moderate-risk (transiently at risk of DD in one domain over time) and high-risk (consistently at risk of delay in ≥2 domains over time). Per week of decreasing gestational age, the risk ratio of membership in the high-risk group increases by 1.77 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.43, 2.20) or 1.84 (95% CI 1.49, 2.27) relative to the moderate-risk and low-risk respectively. Increasing maternal age, identifying as Black, indigenous or a person of colour, elevated maternal depressive symptoms in pregnancy, and male infant sex were associated with high- and moderate-risk trajectories compared to the low-risk trajectory. In combination with decreasing gestational age, poor maternal mental health and social determinants of health increase the probability of membership in trajectories with increased risk of DD, suggesting that additional monitoring of children born late preterm and early term is warranted.

617,10504366,"Intrapulmonary shunting (IPS) is frequently observed and causes hypoxaemia in liver cirrhosis. This study investigated the prevalence, predictors of reversibility and the effect of living-related liver transplantation (LRLT) on IPS using contrast echocardiography in patients with end-stage biliary atresia. Fifty consecutive patients with biliary atresia were examined for IPS using contrast echocardiography before and after LRLT until IPS disappeared. The severity of IPS was classified into five grades according to the extent of contrast in the left ventricle (0, none; 1, trivial; 2, apparent; 3, complete but less than in right ventricle; 4, as dense as in right ventricle). Thirty-two patients (grade 1, n = 15; grade 2, n = 7; grade 3, n = 4; grade 4, n = 6) had IPS before LRLT. Forty-four patients have survived for 9-26 months after LRLT. Among patients with grade 3 or 4 IPS (n = 8), there was a significant correlation between age at LRLT and the duration of IPS persistence after LRLT (P = 0.044). IPS takes longer to disappear in older children than in younger ones, but always disappears eventually. LRLT is an effective treatment for biliary atresia with IPS.

618,38413913,"Children and youth experienced marked impacts on day-to-day life in the COVID-19 pandemic that were associated with poorer familial and friend relationships, and greater mental health challenges. Few studies provide self-report data on mental health symptoms from children and youth themselves. We sought to examine the associations between social factors and child and youth self-reported symptoms of worsened mood, anxiety, and irritability during the COVID-19 pandemic. A nationally representative cross-sectional survey was administered online to collect self-report data across 10 Canadian provinces among children (11-14 years) and youth (15-18 years), April-May 2022. Age-appropriate questions were based on The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn & Child Health and the World Health Organization of the United Nations H6 + Technical Working Group on Adolescent Health and Well-Being consensus framework and the Coronavirus Health and Impact Survey. Associations between a priori defined social factors (e.g., relationship quality) and respondent self-reported mental health were evaluated using ordinal logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, and geographic location. We analyzed data from 483 (51.7%) children (11-14 years; 227, 47.0% girls) and 450 (48.3%) youth (15-18 years; 204, 45.3% girls). The parents of most children and youth had resided in Canada for over 20 years (678, 72.7%). Over one-quarter of children and youth self-identified as Black, Indigenous, or a Person of Color (134, 27.7%; 134, 29.8%, respectively). Over one-third of children and youth self-reported symptoms of worsened mood (149, 30.9%; 125, 27.8%, respectively), anxiety (181, 37.5%; 167, 37.1%, respectively), or irritability (160, 33.1%; 160, 35.6%, respectively) during, compared to pre-pandemic. In descending order of odds ratios (OR), for children and youth, worsened familial relationships (during compared to pre-pandemic) was associated with the self-reported symptoms of worsened mood (child: OR 4.22, 95%CI 2.51-6.88; youth: OR 6.65 95%CI 3.98-11.23), anxiety (child: OR 4.24, 95%CI2.69-6.75; youth: OR 5.28, 95%CI 3.17-8.86), and irritability (child: OR 2.83, 95%CI 1.76-4.56; youth: OR 6.46, 95%CI 3.88-10.90). Self-reported data from a nationally representative sample of children and youth suggest strong associations between social factors and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The present study was performed to elucidate the role of IgE bound on the basophil surface in the development of allergic responses during infancy and early childhood. IgE-binding and FcepsilonRI expression on basophils were evaluated by two-color flow cytometry. Basophil-bound IgE increased rapidly and reached adult levels during infancy in atopic patients, while it gradually increased with advancing age in parallel with serum IgE in normal controls. IgE-binding and FcepsilonRI expression in atopic children were higher than in normal controls among various age groups. They correlated with serum IgE levels but reached a plateau when serum IgE exceeded 300 ng/mL. A low, but significant level of FcepsilonRI expression was observed on cord blood basophils, although IgE-binding was usually undetectable. Incubation of cord blood with IgE rapidly saturated the preexisting IgE receptors and basophil-bound IgE levels increased. When neonatal basophils were cultured for 48 h with IgE, FcepsilonRI expression was upregulated dose-dependently and IgE-binding increased further. The up-regulation of FcepsilonRI was completely inhibited by cycloheximide, indicating that it was dependent on de novo protein synthesis. These results suggest that IgE-binding on basophils serves as a sensitive indicator of allergic sensitization, and that IgE functions as a positive regulator of FcepsilonRI expression in vivo. "
620,38506454,"Port wine birthmark (PWB) is a congenital vascular malformation of the skin. Pulsed dye laser (PDL) is the ""gold standard"" for the treatment of PWB globally. Hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME or hemoporfin)-mediated photodynamic therapy (HMME-PDT) has emerged as the first choice for PWB treatment, particularly for young children, in many major hospitals in China during the past several decades. To evaluate whether HMME-PDT is superior to PDL by comparing the clinical efficacies of both modalities. PubMed records were searched for all relevant studies of PWB treatment using PDL (1988-2023) or HMME-PDT (2007-2023). Patient characteristics and clinical efficacies were extracted. Studies with a quartile percentage clearance or similar scale were included. A mean color clearance index (CI) per study was calculated and compared among groups. An overall CI (C A total of 18 HMME-PDT studies with 3910 patients in China were eligible for inclusion in this analysis. Similarly, 40 PDL studies with 5094 patients from nine different countries were eligible for inclusion in this analysis. Over 58% of patients in the HMME-PDT studies were minors (<18 years old). A significant portion (21.3%) were young children (<3 years old). Similarly, 33.2% of patients in the PDL studies were minors. A small proportion (9.3%) was young children. The overall clearance rates for PDL were slightly, but not significantly, higher than those for HMME-PDT in cohorts with patients of all ages (C PDL shows overall albeit insignificantly higher clearance rates than HMME-PDT in patients of all ages; particularly statistical significance is nearly achieved in young children. Collectively, current evidence is insufficient to support HMME-PDT as the first choice of treatment of PWBs in young children given: (1) overall inferior efficacy as compared to PDL; (2) risk of off-target exposure to meningeal vasculature during the procedure; (3) administration of steriods for mitigation of side effects; -and (4) lack of long-term data on the potential impact of HMME on central nervous system development in young children.

Onset was in early childhood and the disease was historically present in 6 generations. Our objectives were to delineate the clinical and histopathologic features and mode of inheritance as a base for gene studies. Eighteen family subjects were studied. Twenty-six skin biopsy specimens were examined. A detailed pedigree was constructed. A complete literature search was done concerning diseases with generalized basaloid follicular hamartomas. The lesions were basaloid follicular hamartomas and other folliculocentric abnormalities. Inheritance was autosomal dominant. Extensive literature search confirmed the finding of a unique genodermatosis. A new genodermatosis termed dominantly inherited generalized basaloid follicular hamartoma syndrome was defined by delineating its clinical and histopathologic features and mode of inheritance and by extensive literature review.

624,19388923,"The objectives were to determine whether pretreatment with needleless jet-delivered lidocaine decreases self-reported pain in children undergoing needle insertion in the emergency department (ED) and to explore whether pretreatment with a jet device decreases self-reported pain in children undergoing needle insertion in the ED. This study examined needle insertion pain in children 5-18 years of age. In the first phase of this study, children received either pretreatment with jet-delivered lidocaine (0.2 mL of buffered 1% lidocaine; n = 75) or pretreatment with jet-delivered placebo (0.2 mL of preservative-free normal saline; n = 75) 60 seconds before undergoing needle insertion. This phase of the study had a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. In the second phase, an unblinded, nonconcurrent, nonintervention control group (n = 47) was examined to describe any effect of using the jet device. Patients reported pain upon administration of the jet device and at needle insertion using a 100-mm color analog scale (CAS). Patients also reported their satisfaction with this device. The physicians and nurses performing needle insertions were asked to rate their ability to visualize the vein and their satisfaction with the device. The mean (+/-standard deviation [SD]) needle insertion pain score for jet lidocaine, 28 (+/-7) mm, was similar to the mean needle insertion pain score for jet placebo, 34 (+/-7) mm. The mean needle insertion pain score for both the jet lidocaine and the jet placebo groups were lower than the needle insertion pain scores for the no device group, 52 (+/-8) mm. The majority of patients receiving the jet device reported that they would request this device for future needle insertions. Providers' ratings of their ability to visualize veins and the patient cooperation were similar in all three groups. Jet-delivered lidocaine is no more effective than jet-delivered placebo in providing local anesthesia for needle insertion. Jet lidocaine and jet placebo may provide superior analgesia compared to no local anesthetic pretreatment. "
625,36316388,"The incidence and prevalence of youth-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its complications are increasing worldwide. Youth-onset T2DM has been reported in all racial and ethnic groups, but Indigenous peoples and people of colour are disproportionately affected. People with youth-onset T2DM often have a more aggressive clinical course than those with adult-onset T2DM or those with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Moreover, the available treatment options for children and adolescents with T2DM are more limited than for adult patients. Intermediate complications of youth-onset T2DM, such as increased albuminuria, often develop in late childhood or early adulthood, and end-stage complications, including kidney failure, develop in mid-life. The increasing frequency, earlier onset and greater severity of childhood obesity in the past 50 years together with increasingly sedentary lifestyles and an increasing frequency of intrauterine exposure to diabetes are important drivers of the epidemic of youth-onset T2DM. The particularly high risk of the disease in historically disadvantaged populations suggests an important contribution of social and environmental factors, including limited access to high-quality health care, healthy food choices and opportunities for physical activity as well as exposure to stressors including systemic racism and environmental pollutants. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the development and aggressive clinical course of youth-onset T2DM is key to identifying successful prevention and management strategies. "
626,28673115,"This paper presents a novel application of an assistive robotic system with virtual assistance to enhance manual performance of individuals with cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy affects one's voluntary motor movements resulting in limited opportunities to actively engage in physical manipulative activities that require fine motor movements and coordination. Lack of object manipulation and environmental exploration can result in further impairments such as cognitive and social delays. The proposed assistive robotic system has been developed to enhance hand movements of people with disabilities when performing a functional task colouring. This paper presents the usability testing of the effectiveness of the developed system with an individual with cerebral palsy in a set of colouring tasks. Assisted and unassisted approaches were compared and analysed through quantitative and qualitative measures. The robotic-based approach was further compared with the participant's typical alternate access method to perform the same proposed tasks. The robotic system with virtual assistance was clinically validated to be significantly more effective, compared to both unassisted and typical approaches, by increasing the hand controllability, reducing the physical load and increasing the easiness of maintaining movements within the lines. Future studies will inform the use of the system for children with disabilities to provide them with assisted play for functional and playful activities. Implications for rehabilitation Robotic system can enhance manual performance in individuals with disabilities. Participating in a robot-mediated play activity could increase children's motivation and engagement. The developed robotic system can contribute to a basis for clinical and home-based implementation of the technology to promote manual play activities for children with disabilities. "
627,2641783,"Pulmonary regurgitation (PR) is a serious event following surgical repair for tetralogy of Fallot. For quantitative assessments of PR using noninvasive methods, we performed Doppler color flow imaging in 38 children, whose ages ranged from three to 15 years. All images were obtained from one to 10 years after surgery. The right ventricle and pulmonary valve were demonstrated in the parasternal short-axis view. The images of PR flow were in red and were frozen when the area of a signal was maximum (early to mid diastole). The PR distance index (PRDI), which is the maximum PR flow distance divided by square root of the body surface area, was measured. The PR area index (the maximum PR flow area/body surface area) (PRAI) was also calculated using a track ball. Cardiac catheterization was performed for 12 patients without residual L-R shunts or any apparent tricuspid regurgitation. PR was graded (0 = absent, 1 = trivial, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe) according to the projection of contrast medium in the right ventricle as seen on the main pulmonary arteriogram. The size of the right ventricle was expressed as the right ventricular end-diastolic volume (RVEDV; % of normal), as determined from the cineangiogram, and the tricuspid valve annulus diameter (TVD; % of normal) from a four-chamber view of the two-dimensional echocardiogram. There were significant differences between the PRDI and the PRAI of five patients with PR of grades 1-2 and those of seven patients with PR of grade 3-4 (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.01, respectively). There was significant correlation between the % RVEDV and the % TVD observed (r = 0.82, p less than 0.01). Significant negative correlations were observed between the PRDI and right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF), and the PRAI and RVEF (r = -0.68, p less than 0.02; r = -0.82, p less than 0.01, respectively). RVEF was below normal in all seven patients (100%) with PR of grade 3 or more and in one of five patients (20%) with PR of grade 2 or less. The PRDI of 2.5 or more, or the PRAI of 4.0 or more was equivalent to a PR of grade 3 or more and was a reliable index of significant PR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) "
628,9708718,"To assess the effectiveness of replantation in the treatment of nasal amputations. Retrospective chart review. A university medical center. In no case did the replant survive completely, and in all cases revision surgery was required. However, in all cases, the resulting deformity was less than the original defect. In our pediatric patients, reconstruction with cartilage grafting and a midline forehead flap was successful and demonstrated proportionate and appropriate growth. It is our belief that replantation serves many therapeutic functions. At the very least, there is the psychological/emotional factor that is involved in attempting to replace a native body part that has been severed. Also, it is difficult to persuade parents and patients that the amputated tissue that has been handled with kid gloves by paramedics, maintaining its pink ""alive"" color, is ultimately doomed to failure. Forehead flaps and conchal cartilage grafts are more willingly accepted after a ""failed"" replantation than as primary reconstructions. In every instance, we believe, the ultimate defect will be smaller than the original deformity. Certainly, the need for vestibular lining reconstruction is far less. Thus, the ultimate healed defect from the replantation greatly facilitates final nasal reconstruction. "
629,16455415,"We sought to investigate whether real-time (RT) 3-dimensional echocardiography (RT3D) using matrix-array technology could resolve a specific morphologic detail that could not be well resolved during conventional 2-dimensional (2D)/Doppler echocardiographic imaging of congenital heart disease. Although 2D echocardiography is currently the primary imaging modality of congenital heart disease, there are still some anatomic details that cannot be well delineated by that modality. In all, 70 patients underwent RT3D examination using matrix-array transducer. Applying the standard sweeping technique as for 2D imaging, freehand RT imaging was used for immediate feedback. The 2D examinations of the last 23 consecutive patients were used to validate the additional value of RT3D by 3 examiners blinded to the findings of RT3D. The adequacy of 2D imaging to resolve the morphologic detail in question ranged from 30% to 70%, whereas RT3D imaging was considered successful in delineating the morphologic detail in 80% to 100% of patients instantly. The image resolution was superior or equivalent to that obtained by 2D imaging. Heart valves, septal defects, and volumetric valvular and vascular color flow morphologies were well delineated by RT3D. Matrix-array RT3D is a significant breakthrough technology that allowed instant visualization of cardiac anatomic details that could not be well delineated by 2D imaging. Further improvements of some technical limitations should make RT3D matrix-array cardiac imaging a significant modality in the field of echocardiographic imaging of congenital cardiac anomalies. "
630,16911992,"The aim of this study was to characterise the postoperative cranial growth and morphology after a modified pi-plasty for sagittal synostosis. The shape of the skull of 82 patients with isolated premature synostosis of the sagittal suture (SS group) operated on with a modified pi-plasty was studied longitudinally. Forty-five children with unilateral incomplete cleft lip (UICL), evaluated longitudinally at the ages of 2.4 and 23.2 months were used as controls. A standardised radiocephalometric technique was used for image acquisition. The radiocephalograms were analysed using a modification of a method developed by Kreiborg, which included the digitisation of 89 landmarks of the calvaria, cranial base, and orbit (43 in the lateral and 46 in the frontal projections), the production of mean shape plots for each group, and the intergroup comparison of a series of 78 variables (linear distance between selected landmarks, and angles defined by groups of three landmarks). Paired and unpaired t tests were used to assess the differences between the variables studied. These were accepted as significant for values of p<0.01 and were presented as coloured segments or areas in the respective plots. In a comparative analysis with the mean UICL lateral plots, the mean preoperative lateral plots of the study group (SS) showed that the anterior slope of the forehead was more pronounced and it was also more convex. The vertex area was located more anteriorly and was less convex. The occipital curvature was more prominent. Comparison of the mean frontal plots showed a deficiency in convexity and lateral projection of the upper parietal regions, and the line of maximum skull width was lower. The postoperative mean lateral plots of the study group showed a correction of the exaggerated anterior inclination of the forehead and a reduction of the abnormal occipital convexity. However, there was little change in the vertex region and it remained flatter than in the control group. In the mean frontal plots, the increase in convexity and in the lateral projection of the upper parietal areas led to a shape that was similar to that of the UICL group. The mean (SD) cephalic index changed from 64.9% (1.8%) to 71.4% (3.5%) (p<0.001). The longitudinal comparison between the mean postoperative plots at 3 and 5 years of age showed that there had been little change in cranial shape. In conclusion, after a modified pi-plasty for sagittal synostosis, significant objective changes in cranial shape towards normality were produced. The postoperative profile cranial shape was improved except in the vertex area, which remained flatter than normal. In the frontal projection an almost normal shape was obtained. The postoperative cranial shape obtained at 3 years of age had remained stable at the age of 5 years. "

633,34495815,"The coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in educational disruption of historic breadth and duration. The authors describe early studies and interim standardized assessment reports to highlight effects of educational disruption and present critical questions for neuropsychologists. A summary of pre-pandemic and interim literature was compiled, including analyses of national and local assessment data and preliminary studies on academic gains related to remote learning, educational and school services disruption, chronic absenteeism, and child and adolescent mental and physical health during 2020-2021. Ten major themes were identified in the early reports on impacts of educational disruption. Preliminary information indicates prolonged educational disruption has resulted in attenuated learning gains, most remarkably for those already at risk for educational disparities: students of color, students with disabilities, English learners, and students from low-income households. There have also been increased mental and physical health challenges for some youth during the pandemic. Other literature highlights challenges such as diagnosis of learning disabilities, reliance on normative data and development of academic recovery programs. The effects of prolonged educational disruption and psychological stressors on learning and mental health should be considered in the neuropsychological evaluation of children and adolescents, especially marginalized students. Normative data collected prior to the pandemic may be insufficient for interpretation of scores, and evaluation and treatment may be delayed due to backlog and increased demand. Clinical practice considerations are presented. "
634,24218469,"To establish longitudinal validation of a new tool, the Asthma Symptom Tracker (AST). AST combines weekly use of the Asthma Control Test with a color-coded graph for visual trending. Prospective cohort study of children age 2 to 18 years admitted for asthma. Parents or children (n = 210) completed baseline AST assessments during hospitalization, then over 6 months after discharge. Concurrent with the first 5 AST assessments, the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) was administered for comparison. Test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation) was moderate, with a small longitudinal variation of AST measurements within subjects during follow-ups. Internal consistency was strong at baseline (Cronbach's α 0.70) and during follow-ups (Cronbach's α 0.82-0.90). Criterion validity demonstrated a significant correlation between AST and ACQ scores at baseline (r = -0.80, P < .01) and during follow-ups (r = -0.64, -0.72, -0.63, and -0.69). The AST was responsive to change over time; an increased ACQ score by 1 point was associated with a decreased AST score by 2.65 points (P < .01) at baseline and 3.11 points (P < .01) during follow-ups. Discriminant validity demonstrated a strong association between decreased AST scores and increased oral corticosteroid use (odds ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.16, P < .01) and increased unscheduled acute asthma visits (odds ratio 1.23, 95% confidence interval, 1.18-1.28, P < .01). The AST is reliable, valid, and responsive to change over time, and can facilitate ongoing monitoring of asthma control and proactive medical decision-making in children. "
635,8264256,"Using DNA staining with highly stable osmium-ammine-B, the blasts of AMKL were observed under an electron microscope, in comparison with AML, ALL, CML-MK crisis and TMD. The DNA within the nucleus of the megakaryoblasts was observed as a high electron-density substance and tended to be uniformly dispersed within the nucleus. DNA, associated with nucleoli, could be roughly divided in four types based on the presence or absence of peri-nucleolar clumps and intra-nucleolar clumps. In cases of AMKL, we often observed a type that did not have peri-nucleolar DNA clumps but did have DNA flecks within the nucleoli. By analytical evaluation there were no differences among cells from several subtypes of megakaryocytic leukemia, such as AMKL in children with Down's syndrome, AMKL in children without Down's syndrome, AMKL in adults, and CML-MK crisis. The DNA distribution of TMD blasts, which were self-limited and not malignant, resembled that of AMKL blasts. "
636,18614327,"Malfunctioning or dislodged gastrostomy tubes (G-tubes) often require urgent replacement and reinsertion in the Emergency Department (ED). Few data exist regarding the best technique for bedside catheter replacement and verification, and individual operator preferences vary. Although a few reports have described the use of ultrasound guidance during the initial percutaneous insertion, no data are available concerning its role during subsequent G-tube replacements. We sought to investigate the utility of bedside ultrasonography during G-tube replacements in the ED. This was a prospective pilot study conducted at a Level 1 Trauma Center with an annual census of 90,000 patients. Seven adults and three children with malfunctioning G-tubes were enrolled. Three tubes were cracked and leaking, and seven tubes had been dislodged. Under ultrasound, a new G-tube was inserted through the previously fashioned tract. After insertion, color Doppler was applied over the catheter tip to enhance visualization during gentle tube oscillation. Ultrasound successfully visualized G-tube replacement in all 10 patients. Application of color Doppler over the G-tube tip during catheter oscillation enhanced placement confirmation. Sonographic findings were corroborated with gastric content aspiration, contrast-enhanced radiographs, and successful use of the new G-tubes. No false tracts were identified during ultrasound-guided insertion, post-procedure sonographic confirmation, or subsequent radiographs. The improper replacement of a G-tube can lead to devastating consequences. Verifying appropriate placement through aspirate evaluation can be misleading, and post-procedure radiographs increase radiation exposure and ED wait times. Bedside ultrasonography can be used to guide catheter insertion while providing a safe and quick adjunct to confirm proper G-tube placement. "
637,14971523,"To survey the prevalence of the long QT syndrome (LQTS), especially Jervell-Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS), in Thai children (The first such study). LQTS is a rare inherited disease with a prevalence of 0.21 per cent in children with congenital deafness from other reports. These patients carry a high risk of recurrent syncope and fatal ventricular arrhythmia. Cross-sectional survey from January 2000 to August 2000. A total of 276 children with congenital sensori-neural hearing loss were included. A questionnaire was employed and all children were examined by a pediatric cardiologist to rule out organic heart disease. EKGs were obtained and QTc intervals were blindly measured using standard methods in L2, V5 or any other leads with the longest QTc interval by three pediatric cardiologists. If QTc interval is prolonged, additional EKG (up to 3) were done to confirm the finding. Schwartz criteria was used to identify index cases with LQTS after repeated EKGs, and exercise stress tests. Also, echocardiography were done in patients suspected of having LQTS. A total of 14 children needed a third EKG and more work ups due to persistent long QTc interval after 2 consecutive EKG studies with QTc intervals ranged from 456 msec to 466 msec, and Schwartz score from 1.5 to 2.5. There were 6 twins and no triplets in the study. Finally, two subjects (not twins or siblings) had persistent prolonged QTc intervals after 3 EKG studies. After the exercise stress test, both still had a prolonged QTc interval, not corrected to the normal QTc interval even at the exercise peak. There was no cardiac abnormality either structurally or functionally from the 2D echocardiogram and Doppler color flow study. The possible prevalence of JLNS was 0.7 per cent (2/276). Both children were in the low-risk group for having LQTS. "
638,39429382,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) significantly impacts children's neurological development, behaviour, and overall well-being, affecting academic performance and social interactions. This systematic review investigates the effectiveness of dietary interventions (DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, Vitamin D3 supplementation, magnesium, and impact of artificial food colors and marine oils) and supplements alongside standard pharmacotherapy in managing ADHD symptoms. Adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines, we extensively searched various databases for studies published from 2016 to 2022. Out of an initial pool of 7873 records, 14 randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria following rigorous screening. Our findings suggest that gluten-free diets may alleviate ADHD symptoms despite negative celiac serology, highlighting the role of non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Moreover, vitamin and mineral supplements like vitamin D and magnesium showed varying degrees of effectiveness in improving behavioural and emotional symptoms. Innovative treatments, such as combining saffron with methylphenidate and using marine oil extracts, also demonstrated potential in enhancing behaviours associated with ADHD. The review underscores the importance of dietary approaches, such as the DASH diet and specific exclusions (e.g., a few foods diet and an oligoantigenic diet), in managing symptoms by addressing nutritional factors. Studies on probiotics and interventions targeting gut microbiota composition yielded mixed results, necessitating further exploration. Limitations include study diversity and short-term outcome assessments, cautioning against broad generalizations. Integrating personalized dietary assessments and interventions into ADHD treatment strategies could optimize therapeutic outcomes and potentially reduce reliance on pharmacotherapy alone. In summary, this systematic review highlights the potential benefits of dietary modifications and supplements in managing ADHD symptoms. Future research should prioritize long-term efficacy, interactions with conventional medications, and personalized dietary approaches to refine ADHD treatment strategies. "
639,29331681,"The measurement of hair cortisol is increasingly used to measure long-term cumulative cortisol levels and investigate its role as an important stress mediator. In this study a comparative statistical analysis of five independent studies (all analyzed in our laboratory) was performed to investigate baseline ranges of cortisol values in hair and evaluate potential influences of sex, age and hair color. Cortisol concentrations in hair of 554 subjects were measured and a comparative statistical analysis was performed. The analysis showed that cortisol levels significantly differ depending on age. The toddler group (7 months (0.6 years) to 3 years) showed significantly higher values (median 10pg/mg, p-value<0.0001, d=0.78) than the adolescent group. The adolescent groups showed significantly lower (p-value<0.0001, d=0.58 and p<0.0001, d=0.13) values (median 2.4pg/mg and 2.8pg/mg) than the adult group (median 5.8pg/mg). Furthermore, in the adult group men showed significantly higher cortisol values than women (p-value<0.05, d=0.17). This effect could not be seen in the adolescent group. Black hair showed higher cortisol concentrations than blond hair (p-value<0.0001, d=1.3). In addition, two rounds of interlaboratory comparisons for hair cortisol samples between four laboratories revealed very consistent results. Our results demonstrate that baseline cortisol levels are generally low in hair thus making a standardized and well-elaborated analytical method indispensable for accurate determination. Age-dependent normative baseline cortisol levels (toddlers, adolescents and adults) are highly recommended based on the comparative analysis comprising five independent studies. "
640,9845787,"To evaluate the efficacy of power doppler ultrasonography in depicting increased vasculature and hyperemia around the superficial soft tissue abscess. 21 patients with soft tissue abscess were evaluated with gray scale imaging, color doppler sonography, power doppler sonography and computed tomography. In each case attempts were made using power doppler sonography to demonstrate any areas of increased vascularity around the lesion. The results were compared with computed tomographic findings. Peripheral hyperemia and increased vasculature were demonstrated with power doppler sonography in 19 of 21 patients with soft tissue abscess. The hyperemic area demonstrated around the wall of the abscess by power doppler sonography was similar to the enhanced area shown by computed tomography performed after contrast administration. Power doppler sonography shows increased vasculature and hyperemia in the wall of abscesses. Therefore, power doppler sonography can be used to assist with the diagnosis of superficial soft tissue abscess. "
641,9496664,"The concentrations of 11 elements: Pb, Mn, Fe, Cd, Cu, Ni, Cr, Zn, Na, K and Ca in hair were determined by AAS. Hair samples (n = 266) were collected between 1990 and 1994 from inhabitants of the Silesian Beskid in the south of Poland (non-industrialised region). The effects of age (1-30 years old, 31-80 years old), sex (male, female) and colour of hair on the heavy metal levels were determined. Using statistical methods of cluster analysis, multiple regression analysis and factor analysis we obtained information concerning relations among metals in the hair. The strongest relations between metals in the hair are as follows: Fe-Mn, Cr-K and Cd-Pb in the first cluster and Zn-Ni in the second cluster. For our population (n = 266, non-industrialised region in Poland) we obtained a factor loading > 0.7. Factor 1 was contributed by Na and K; Factor 2 by Pb, Cd, Mn and Fe; Factor 3 by Ca (a negative correlation); Factor 4 by Ni; Factor 5 by Cu; Factor 6 by Co, Cd and K; and Factor 7 by Cr, Pb, Mn, Fe and K. These seven factors explain 77.7% variance. We obtained linear multiple dependence (P < 0.05) as follows: Mn = f (Cd, Fe, Ca); Na = f (Zn, K, -Ca); K = f (-Zn, Cr, Na); Pb = f (Cd, Zn, Cr, Fe); Zn = f (Ni, Na, -Cr, -K); Fe = f (Pb, Mn); Cr = f (Pb, K, -Zn); Co = f (Cd, Cr); and Ca = f (Mn, -Zn, -Na). These relations can be useful to explain relationships among the metals in man. "
642,29205687,"Transperineal pudendal nerve block guided by nerve stimulator is used in pediatric anesthesia as an alternative to caudal analgesia in perineal surgery. The risk of rectal puncture or intravascular injection is inherent to this blinded technique. We described a new technique of transperineal pudendal nerve block, with ultrasound guidance, to improve safety of the technique. The first goal of this study was to describe this new technique and to test its feasibility. The second objective was to evaluate intra operative effectiveness and postoperative pain control. After parental and children consent, this prospective descriptive study included children aged 1-15 years, ASA status I-III, scheduled for general anesthesia associated with bilateral pudendal nerve block for an elective perineal surgery. After standardized general anesthesia, the anesthesiologist performed pudendal nerve block under ultrasound guidance with ""out of plane"" approach and evaluated the visualization of anatomical structures (ischial tuberosity, rectum, and pudendal artery), of the needle and of the local anesthetic spread. Pudendal nerve block failure was defined as an increase in mean arterial blood pressure or heart rate more than 20% compared to baseline values after surgical incision. In the postoperative period, the need for rescue analgesia was noted. During the study period, 120 blocks were performed in 60 patients, including 59 boys. Quality of the ultrasonographic image was good in 81% of blocks, with easy visualization of ischium and rectum in more than 95% of cases. Localization of the tip of the needle was possible for all pudendal nerve blocks, directly or indirectly. The spread of local anesthetic was seen in 79% of cases. The block was effective in 88% of cases. The new technique of ultrasound-guided pudendal nerve block, described in this study, seems to be easy to perform with a good success rate, and probably improves safety of the puncture and of the injection by real-time visualization of anatomical structures and local anesthetic spread.

645,32410108,"In an examination of three unwrapped mummified children from the Graeco-Roman Period of ancient Egypt there was an unexpected finding of fair hair. In the majority of unwrapped ancient Egyptian mummified bodies the hair was not fair but rather dark brown or black. To determine if exposure to natron during the mummification process was responsible for the fair hair color an experiment was carried out to partially replicate the environment in which bodies were desiccated. Fourteen samples of modern hair from various age groups, sex and ethnicity were subjected to synthetic natron for a period of 40 days to replicate the time taken to mummify a body. Macroscopic and microscopic examinations of samples were employed to ascertain any significant changes in hair color after treatment. Ancient wigs were studied for evidence of post mortem changes to hair color since construction over 2,000 years ago. Results of the study showed no significant lightening of hair color and in several samples the hair significantly darkened as the result of exposure to the natron. There was not any evidence that hair lightened as the result of natural post mortem changes and this was confirmed by the study of the natural hair wigs that had not changed color post mortem. This study concluded that the fair hair observed in the three child mummies was not the result of exposure to natron or post mortem changes but rather it was probably due to ancestry because of the presence of diverse genomes that were introduced into ancient Egypt during the Greco-Roman Period.

646,24089114,"The outcome of children with traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is poor, and the information regarding survival in the postresuscitative period is limited. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical features during the early postresuscitative period that may predict survival or neurologic outcomes in children with traumatic OHCA. Information on 362 children (<19 years) who presented to the emergency departments of three medical centers and experienced traumatic OHCA during the study period (January 2003 to December 2010) were retrospectively included. The postresuscitative clinical features during the early postresuscitative period, defined as the first hour after achieving sustained return of spontaneous circulation, which correlated with survival and neurologic outcomes were analyzed. Among 152 children (42%) who achieved sustained return of spontaneous circulation, 34 (9.4%) survived to discharge, and 11 (3%) had good neurologic outcomes (Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category Scale, 1 or 2). Early postresuscitative clinical features, which reflected initial cardiac output and end-organ perfusion, can predict the chance of survival. Such features included the following: high or normal blood pressure, normal heart rate, sinus rhythm, urine output of more than 1 mL/kg per hour, and noncyanotic skin color (all p < 0.05). Initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of greater than 7 predicted a good neurologic outcome in survivors (p = 0.008). Predictors of survival were high or normal blood pressure, normal heart rate, sinus rhythm, urine output of more than 1 mL/kg per hour, and noncyanotic skin color. Most importantly, initial GCS score of greater than 7 predicted a good neurologic outcome in survivors. Prognostic study, level III. "

Through a population based, cross sectional study, 4565 Tehran citizens were studied in the Tehran Eye Study. The findings from the participants (n = 3834) aged 10 years and older free of glaucoma diagnosis or suspicion who had undergone applanation tonometry examination are presented. All participants received a standardised protocol including applanation tonometry, fundus examination, demographic data, and an interview. IOP measurement was used to evaluate its distribution by age, sex, and some eye parameters. Mean (SD) IOP was 14.5 (2.6) mm Hg in the total population, 14.4 (2.7) in men, and 14.5 (2.5) in women. Mean (SD) IOP in people > or =40 years was 15.1 (2.9) mm Hg. IOP increased significantly with age and cup:disc ratio except for a fall in old age. This relation was also observed when individuals without diabetes or hypertension history were analysed. IOP increased with darker eye pigmentation except for blue/grey eyes. There was a non-linear increase in IOP from emmetropic to high myopic eyes. Age, iris colour, and cup:disc ratio were related to IOP but not to sex. The distribution of IOP in this study was different from various other studies in different geographical regions and it seems advisable to employ a geographical approach to normal IOP interpretation.

649,11490288,"We reviewed the literature of the last 40 years and report our experience with treating high flow priapism with fistula embolization in prepubertal boys. Two boys had blunt perineal trauma and 1 had penile trauma (ages 6, 6 and 10 years). Painless priapism developed within 24 hours and lasted for 4 to 7 days before the patients presented to the hospital. Primary diagnosis was made on color Doppler ultrasound. When high flow priapism was diagnosed angiography of the internal iliac artery and embolization of the arteriocavernosal fistula were performed. Mean followup was 26 months. Color Doppler ultrasound revealed bilateral arteriocavernosal fistulas in 2 boys and a unilateral fistula in 1. Angiography showed fistulas of the branches of the internal pudendal artery in 2 patients and fistulas of the bulbourethral artery in 1. Microcoils were used in the bulbourethral artery and a gelatin sponge was used in other penile arteries. Complete detumescence with restored erectile function was achieved in all cases. High flow priapism in children can be diagnosed easily by typical clinical features combined with color Doppler ultrasound. In children with posttraumatic priapism embolization of the arteriocavernosal fistula is superior to surgical or medical procedures and should be the first line therapy. Embolization using microcoils for bulbourethral arteries and a gelatin sponge for other penile arteries has proved to be safe and successful therapy. "

652,27086129,"Due to their locations, vertebral arteries (VA) are structures that are rarely injured after traumas. Formation of vertebral pseudo-aneurysm (PA) because of pieces of shrapnel is also rare. It causes clinical findings like cervical mass after the injury CASES PRESENTATION: Two Syrian 12- and 17-year-old male patients were admitted to the Department of Ear, Nose and Throat with the complaint of swelling in the left lower cervical region. In their USG examination which was ordered to investigate the cervical lesion, a lesion consistent with PA which shows a prominently thick wall structure due to circumferential thrombus formation and fibrotic tissue, chaotic flow, and ying-yang appearance in the centrally located cavity of the lesion in a color Doppler examination was detected. Later, multi-detector computed tomography angiography (MDCTA) was planned to demonstrate pseudo-aneurysms (PAs). Because there was no report on the development of giant pseudo-aneurysms secondary to shrapnel injury to date and because we thought these cases are demonstrative, we found the cases suitable for presenting as case reports.

654,34153495,"Indirect exposure to racism experienced by a caregiver (ie, vicarious racism) is associated with poor outcomes for children, but mechanisms of vicarious racism transmission are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between experiences of racial discrimination and parenting among African American mothers and to identify psychological mediators and moderators of this relationship. African American mothers (N = 250) with young children (mean age = 3.7 years old) reported on perceived racial discrimination (Race-Related Events Scale), parenting (Parenting Stress Index, Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire), coping (Coping Strategies Index), and mental health (Stress Overload Scale, Beck Depression Inventory). Multivariable linear regression was used to examine associations between perceived racial discrimination and parenting and to test coping as a moderator of these relationships. Ordinary least-squares regression-based path analysis with bootstrapping was used to examine mediation by stress overload and depressive symptoms. At least one experience of racial discrimination was reported by 57% of women. Experiences of racial discrimination were associated with increased parenting stress (β = 0.69, p = .02), and this relationship was mediated by stress overload (95% CI [0.35, 1.09]) and depressive symptoms (95% CI [0.27, 1.18]). Racial discrimination was not associated with parenting styles, and coping strategies largely did not moderate the relationships examined. Racial discrimination has harmful intergenerational effects on African American children and families. Systemic-level interventions are needed, including adoption of policies to promote racial justice and eliminate structural racism in the United States. Future research on coping strategies specific to racism-related stress is needed to inform approaches to intervention. "
655,34896323,"To explore the effect of patients' age, baseline visual acuity (VA), and intraoperative foveal detachment on outcomes of subretinal voretigene neparvovec-rzyl (Luxturna) therapy and to assess patients' perceptions of the treatment effect. Multicenter, retrospective, consecutive case series, and cross-sectional prospective survey. All 41 consecutive patients treated with voretigene neparvovec-rzyl after Food and Drug Administration approval at 3 institutions between January 2018 and May 2020. A retrospective chart review of operative reports, clinical notes, ancillary testing, and complications, comparing data at baseline and at 1, 2 to 3, 6 to 9, and 10 to 15 months after subretinal surgery was conducted. A survey was administered to adult patients and parents of pediatric patients. Changes in best-corrected VA and retinal morphology and in patients' perceptions. Seventy-seven eyes of 41 patients (16 adults and 25 pediatric patients; age range, 2-44 years; mean follow-up, 10 months [range, 1 week to 18.5 months]) were analyzed. There was no statistically significant vision change for the adults, whereas there was a trend of improvement for pediatric patients, which reached statistical significance for some time points. The baseline VA did not affect the posttherapy VA (P = 0.23). The central foveal thickness decreased mildly in both pediatric patients and adults, without significant differences between the populations. The fovea was detached by voretigene neparvovec-rzyl in 62 (81%) eyes. The inner segment-outer segment junction remained unchanged in 91% of 54 eyes with gradable OCT, with or without foveal detachment. Thirty-two (78%) patients were reached for the survey an average of 1.15 ± 0.50 years (range, 0.31 to 2.31) after the surgery in the first eye. Improvement in night, day, or color vision was reported by 23 (72%), 22 (69%), and 18 (56%) patients, respectively. This study is limited by the large variability in follow-up time. There were no persistent statistically significant vision changes. A decrease in foveal thickness was noted in most eyes, but the long-term significance of this remains to be determined. "
656,23789601,"Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) has a worldwide distribution. Delayed and incorrect diagnosis may cause the significant spread of this disease and consequent increases in morbidity and drug resistance. We aimed to determine dermoscopic features of CL that may help to improve the accuracy of clinical diagnosis of the disease. A total of 145 lesions in 102 patients were evaluated dermoscopically. Following the diagnosis of CL, all lesions were evaluated by experienced dermoscopists. A total of 51 papules, 40 nodulo-ulcerative lesions, 31 plaques, and 23 nodules were evaluated by dermoscopy. Generalized erythema appeared in all lesions (100%), yellow tears in 58 lesions, both crust and ulcer in 51 lesions, white starburst-like patterns in 27 lesions, ovoid salmon-colored structures in 19 lesions, and a perilesional hypopigmented halo pattern in four lesions. Various vascular structures were present in 126 lesions. The most common vascular structure observed was an irregular linear pattern in 78 lesions, followed by a tree-like pattern in 53 lesions. The rest of the vascular structures included hairpin vessels in 25 lesions, glomerulus-like vessels in 24 lesions, dotted vessels in 23 lesions, comma-shaped vessels in six lesions, and polymorphous/atypical vessels in four lesions. We did not identify the types of parasite involved. Yellow tears, white starburst-like patterns and salmon-colored ovoid structures seem to appear specifically in CL lesions. In geographical areas in which CL is common, dermoscopy may be utilized as a useful diagnostic tool that is practical and non-invasive. "
657,22581030,"Racial and ethnic disparities are disturbing facets of the American healthcare system that document the reality of unequal treatment. Research consistently shows that patients of color experience poorer quality of care and health outcomes contributing to increased risks and accelerated mortality rates relative to their white counterparts. While initially conceptualized as an approach for increasing the responsiveness of children's behavioral health care, cultural competence has been adopted as a key strategy for eliminating racial and ethnic health disparities across the healthcare system. However, cultural competence research and practices largely focus on improving provider competencies, while agency and system level approaches for meeting the service needs of diverse populations are given less attention. In this article we offer seven essential strategies for promoting and sustaining organizational and systemic cultural competence. These strategies are to: (1) Provide executive level support and accountability, (2) Foster patient, community and stakeholder participation and partnerships, (3) Conduct organizational cultural competence assessments, (4) Develop incremental and realistic cultural competence action plans, (5) Ensure linguistic competence, (6) Diversify, develop, and retain a culturally competent workforce, and (7) Develop an agency or system strategy for managing staff and patient grievances. For each strategy we offer several recommendations for implementation. "

659,23577822,"In this study, we measure the radial artery internal diameter (RAID) in children up to 4 years of age before and after the induction of anesthesia. A B-mode portable color Doppler ultrasound was used to measure the RAID. Three sets of measurements were taken for each child before and after the induction of anesthesia and with the wrist in the neutral and dorsiflexed positions. The reliability of the mean value of the RAID in the three sets in 24 patients was established. There were discrepancies between the RAID and the proposed catheter size in some individuals, which may not only render placement difficult but also have potential for arterial injury. There are good reasons to measure the RAID in small children prior to insertion of an intra-arterial catheter. "
660,18025945,"Complementary and alternative medicine therapies are frequently combined with conventional medical treatment and can significantly affect patient care. In the following case, an adjunctive modality posed a significant health risk to the patient. An 11-year-old boy with cystic fibrosis reported a bluish skin color after he began ingesting a colloidal silver solution to facilitate mucus clearance. Serum silver level was elevated to more than twice the upper limit of normal. This finding is highly suggestive of argyria, a typically permanent discoloration of the skin due to dermal silver deposits. In this child, however, the discoloration was transient and the silver level normalized when the therapy was discontinued. Although a diagnosis of argyria was not formally made, this case reviews the known dangers associated with silver ingestion. Complementary and alternative medicine therapies are common and can both augment and interfere with the traditional standard of care. Informed providers who inquire about the use of these therapies can then discuss the risks and benefits of each utilized modality. "
661,25164789,"We investigated whether preschool children with specific language impairment (SLI) exhibit the shape bias in word learning: the bias to generalize based on shape rather than size, color, or texture in an object naming context ('This is a wek; find another wek') but not in a non-naming similarity classification context ('See this? Which one goes with this one?'). Fifty-four preschool children (16 with SLI, 16 children with typical language [TL] in an equated control group, and 22 additional children with TL included in individual differences analyses but not group comparisons) completed a battery of linguistic and cognitive assessments and two experiments. In Experiment 1, children made generalization choices in object naming and similarity classification contexts on separate days, from options similar to a target object in shape, color, or texture. On average, TL children exhibited the shape bias in an object naming context, but children with SLI did not. In Experiment 2, we tested whether the failure to exhibit the shape bias might be linked to ability to detect systematicities in the visual domain. Experiment 2 supported this hypothesis, in that children with SLI failed to learn simple paired visual associations that were readily learned by children with TL. Analyses of individual differences in the two studies revealed that visual paired-associate learning predicted degree of shape bias in children with SLI and TL better than any other measure of nonverbal intelligence or standard assessments of language ability. We discuss theoretical and clinical implications. "
662,38294146,"Age estimation methods through developmental atlases are simplified by image comparison using radiographs. Atlas-based methods have been utilized to create population-specific charts addressing population diversity. To tackle the absence of a dedicated atlas for the Brazilian population, the objective of the present study was to create a new atlas for dental development in Brazil based on the London Atlas chart. The new atlas (RP Atlas) is based on the median of tooth development, eruption, and resorption in individuals aged 5 to 23. The sample (567 individuals) was divided between females (n = 290) and males (n = 277). The RP Atlas was handcrafted, scanned, colored, and clustered in two atlases divided by sex. The development of a specific atlas for the Brazilian population has the potential to enhance the accuracy of age estimation in forensic scenarios, notably in a mixed country like Brazil. Further research is needed to assess the suitability of the newly developed atlas for the Brazilian population. "
663,30571200,"Background Pediatric patients with atrioventricular valve disease have limited options for prosthetic valve replacement in sizes <15 mm. Based on successful experience with the stented bovine jugular vein graft (Melody valve) in the right ventricular outflow tract, the prosthesis has been modified for surgical valve replacement in pediatric patients with atrioventricular dysfunction with the intention of subsequent valve expansion in the catheterization laboratory as the child grows. Methods and Results A multicenter, retrospective cohort study was performed among patients who underwent atrioventricular valve replacement with Melody valve at 17 participating sites from North America and Europe, including 68 patients with either mitral (n=59) or tricuspid (n=9) replacement at a median age of 8 months (range, 3 days to 13 years). The median size at implantation was 14 mm (range, 9-24 mm). Immediately postoperatively, the valve was competent with low gradients in all patients. Fifteen patients died; 3 patients underwent transplantation. Nineteen patients required reoperation for adverse outcomes, including valve explantation (n=16), left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (n=1), permanent pacemaker implantation (n=1), and paravalvular leak repair (n=1). Twenty-five patients underwent 41 episodes of catheter-based balloon expansion, exhibiting a significant decrease in median gradient ( P<0.001) with no significant increase in grade of regurgitation. Twelve months after implantation, cumulative incidence analysis indicated that 55% of the patients would be expected to be free from death, heart transplantation, structural valve deterioration, or valve replacement. Conclusions The Melody valve is a feasible option for surgical atrioventricular valve replacement in patients with hypoplastic annuli. The prosthesis shows acceptable short-term function and is amenable to catheter-based enlargement as the child grows. However, patients remain at risk for mortality and structural valve deterioration, despite adequate early valvular function. Device design and implantation techniques must be refined to reduce complications and extend durability. Clinical Trial Registration URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

664,25424497,"Multiple histologic measurements are commonly used to assess degenerative changes in intervertebral disc (IVD) structure; however, there is no consensus on which stains offer the clearest visualization of specific areas within the IVD. The objective of this study was to compare multiple tinctorial stains, evaluate their ability to highlight structural features within the IVD, and investigate how they influence the capacity to implement a degeneration scoring system. Lumbar IVDs from seven human autopsy specimens were stained using six commonly used stains (Hematoxylin/Eosin, Toluidine Blue, Safranin-O/Fast Green, Extended FAST, modified Gomori's Trichrome, and Picrosirius Red Alcian Blue). All IVDs were evaluated by three separate graders to independently determine which stains (i) were most effective at discerning different structural features within different regions of the IVDs and (ii) allowed for the most reproducible assessment of degeneration grade, as assessed via the Rutges histological scoring system (Rutges et al. A validated new histological classification for intervertebral disc degeneration. Osteoarthritis Cartilage, 21, 2039-47). Although Trichrome, XFAST and PR/AB stains were all effective at highlighting different regions of whole IVDs, we recommend the use of PR/AB because it had the highest degree of rater agreement on assigned degeneration grade, allowed greater resolution of degeneration grade, has an inferential relationship between color and composition, and allowed clear differentiation of the different regions and structural disruptions within the IVD. The use of a standard set of stains together with a histological grading scheme can aid in the characterization of structural changes in different regions of the IVD and may simplify comparisons across the field. This collection of human IVD histological images highlights how IVD degeneration is not a single disease but a composite of multiple processes such as aging, injury, repair, and disease, each of which are unique to the individual.

665,30243749,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of rare inherited retinal disorders characterized by diffuse progressive degeneration of the retina that typically presents bilaterally. Unilateral RP has not often been reported in children. We present a series of cases that illustrate discrimination between unilateral and asymmetric disease and between dystrophy and acquired degeneration. Four patients (9-15 years of age; 3 females) were referred to our institution for possible unilateral RP based on fundus appearance and unilateral symptoms. All underwent full-field electroretinography (ERG), spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), widefield and color fundus photography, and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging. Genetic testing and a vitamin and essential fatty acids panel were also conducted in 1 patient. Unilateral retinal degeneration was confirmed in 2 patients, whose fellow eyes showed no abnormalities on ERG or imaging. The other 2 patients were found to have highly asymmetric retinal degeneration based on ERG, wide-angle images, and repeated examinations (range, 0.3-9.8 years). Genetic testing and blood testing in 1 unilateral case were negative. Childhood-onset ""unilateral RP"" remains a difficult and uncertain diagnosis. ERG testing and longitudinal and widefield fundus examination are necessary to exclude asymmetrical disease. Although unilateral degeneration may exist in some children, its inherited or acquired etiology remains poorly understood. "
666,35512482,"Venipuncture is a common procedure resulting in intense discomfort, anxiety, and pain in children. In this regard, we examined the effectiveness of a simple and practical art-based intervention on pain and anxiety in children who underwent venipuncture procedures. In this parallel randomized control trial, children aged 6-12 years were randomly allocated to either an intervention or a control group. The intervention group (n = 73) received an art-based intervention called Trace Image and Coloring for Kids-Book (TICK-B) during the venipuncture procedure compared to no intervention in the control group (n = 71). The children, their parents, and an observer nurse rated the outcomes 1-2 min after the venipuncture procedure was finished. The patients in the intervention group had a substantially lower mean value of pain and anxiety-as rated by children, their parents, and an observer nurse-compared to the control patients. The average values of pain reported by the children, parents, and observer nurse were 3.50, 3.52, and 3.49 in the intervention group in contrast to 6.53, 6.59, and 6.45 in the control group (a large effect). Similarly, the patients in the intervention group had significantly lower mean values of anxiety compared to the control group: 0.88, 1.43, and 1.42 vs. 3.09, 2.52, and 2.52, respectively. This study showed that TICK-B is an effective technique to reduce the levels of pain and anxiety in children undergoing venipuncture procedures. The TICK-B can be used easily by nurses to relieve the pain of children during venipuncture procedures. Clinical Trial Registry, NCT04690257. Registered on December 30, 2020. "
667,9044136,"The presence of squamous epithelium in the cyst wall of children with large splenic cysts has generally been thought to require complete resection of the cyst lining to prevent recurrence. The risks of major bleeding or possible total splenectomy necessitates a simplified procedure to preserve splenic function without cyst recurrence. Six patients treated for splenic cyst over a 10-year period underwent partial splenic decapsulation retaining the hilar portion of the spleen. The patient group, including five girls, ranged in age from 6 to 18 years (mean, 13 years). Presenting findings were splenomegaly (n = 4), progressive cyst enlargement (n = 4), left upper quadrant pain (n = 2), ultrasound for unrelated condition (n = 2), and prior history of trauma (n = 1). Cyst location varied from peripheral to deep cortical and ranged in size from 5 to 20 cm containing from 200 to 1,700 mL of sterile straw-colored to dark brown-colored liquid. Palpable splenomegaly resolved in all patients with progressive decrease in size of the splenic remnant, and return of vascularity to normal was confirmed by Doppler ultrasound. Each patient remains asymptomatic without recurrence of the splenic cyst from 1 to 10 years after surgery. Squamous epithelial lining cells found in sheets and clusters were seen within the cyst lining of all patients. Immunohistochemistry of the paraffin-embedded tissue showed that these cells expressed keratin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), but were negative for BerEP4 (conventionally positive in cells of epithelial origin). The authors conclude that splenic decapsulation is an effective treatment for splenic epithelial cysts, which both preserves splenic function and prevents recurrence despite retention of hilar cyst lining. Epithelial metaplasia of the mesothelial-mesodermal undifferentiated cells from exposure to an unidentified irritant may explain the histological presence of squamous epithelium within the cyst wall.

668,11156877,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the feasibility and potential value of the computer-controlled, 3D, echocardiographic reconstruction of the color Doppler-imaged vena contracta (CDVC) and the flow convergence (FC) region as a means of accurately and quantitatively estimating the severity of a ventricular septal defect (VSD). We performed a 3D reconstruction of the CDVC and the FC region in 19 patients with an isolated VSD using an ultrasound system interfaced with a Tomtec computer. The variable asymmetric geometry of the CDVC and the FC region could be 3D-visualized in all patients. The 3D-measured areas of CDVC correlated well with volumetric measurements of the severity of VSD (r=0.97, P:<0.001). Regression analysis between the shunt flow rate (calculated from the product of the area of CDVC and the continuous Doppler-derived velocity time integral) and the corresponding reference results (calculated by cardiac catheterization) demonstrated a close correlation (r=0.95, P:<0.001). There was also a good correlation between shunt flow rates calculated using the conventional 2D, 1-axis measurement of the FC isovelocity surface area with the hemispheric assumption (r=0.95, P:<0.001); shunt flow rates calculated using 3D, 3-axis measurements of the FC region (r=0.97, P:<0.01); and reference results by cardiac catheterization. However, the 2D method substantially underestimated the actual shunt flow rate. The 3D reconstruction of the CDVC and the FC region may aid in quantifying the severity of VSD. "
669,33430062,"This study investigated the influence of white vs. 12 background and overlay colors on the reading process in twenty-four school-age children. Previous research reported that colors could affect reading skills as an important factor in the emotional and physiological state of the body. The aim of the study was to assess developmental differences between second and third grade students of an elementary school, and to evaluate differences in electroencephalography (EEG), ocular, electrodermal activities (EDA) and heart rate variability (HRV). Our findings showed a decreasing trend with age regarding EEG power bands (Alpha, Beta, Delta, Theta) and lower scores of reading duration and eye-tracking measures in younger children compared to older children. As shown in the results, HRV parameters showed higher scores in 12 background and overlay colors among second than third grade students, which is linearly correlated to the level of stress and is readable from EDA measures as well. Our study showed the calming effect on second graders of turquoise and blue background colors. Considering other colors separately for each parameter, we assumed that there are no systematic differences in reading duration, EEG power band, eye-tracking and EDA measures. "
670,27644481,"Polyunsaturated fatty acids are essential nutrients for the normal development of the brain. We investigated the associations between plasma polyunsaturated fatty acids and cognition in normal weight and overweight children. The study recruited 386 normal weight children and 58 overweight children aged six to eight years and blood samples were drawn after a 12-hour fast. We assessed plasma polyunsaturated fatty acids using gas chromatography, cognition using Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices, and overweight and obesity using the age-specific and sex-specific cut-offs from the International Obesity Task Force. The data were analysed by linear regression analyses adjusted for age and sex. Higher proportions of eicosapentaenoic acid in plasma triacylglycerols (β = 0.311, p = 0.020, p = 0.029 for interaction) and docosahexaenoic acid in plasma triacylglycerols (β = 0.281, p = 0.038, p = 0.049 for interaction) were both associated with higher Raven's scores in overweight children but not in normal weight children. Higher eicosapentaenoic acid to arachidonic acid ratios in triacylglycerols (β = 0.317, p = 0.019) and phospholipids (β = 0.273, p = 0.046) were directly associated with the Raven's score in overweight children but not in normal weight children. These findings suggest that increasing the consumption of fish and other sources of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid may improve cognition among overweight children. "
671,38493391,"Virtual reality (VR) may be a viable method to observe and describe signals of implicit bias. Using the context of the human papillomavirus vaccine counseling, we sought to describe physicians' communication practices exploring differences when counseling parents with different skin colors. Physicians (N = 90) at an academic primary care center were recruited for a VR study in which they counseled dark or light-skinned parent avatars who expressed hesitation about human papillomavirus vaccination for their adolescent child. Investigators coded previously recorded simulations. Associations between communication and parent skin color were examined using t-tests and Chi-square tests. Both direct (e.g., addressing the concern immediately) and circuitous (e.g., providing alternative information) communication patterns were observed. Physicians used passive voice less commonly when counseling dark-skinned versus light-skinned avatars (p < .05). VR demonstrated feasibility in capturing clinicians' communication behaviors including measuring eight distinct indicators of implicit bias. "
672,32320520,"Childhood vitiligo is commonly encountered. Pattern and distribution of childhood vitiligo were not clearly described in past. To study clinical characteristics of vitiligo among Egyptian children in relation to epidemiological data and compare them with those of adolescents and adults. Recruited clinically diagnosed vitiligo patients were categorized into three groups: I (children): <12 years old (yo), II (adolescents): 12-18 yo, and III (adults): 18-30 yo. Patients were subjected to history taking, general and dermatological examination to determine skin phototype, type, presentation, and distribution of vitiligo, percentage of body area involved using vitiligo extent score (VES), associated mucosal involvement, presence of leukotrichia, koebnerization, and halo nevi. A total of 483 vitiligo patients were included: 220 children, 123 adolescents, and 140 adults. The most common form of vitiligo was nonsegmental vitiligo (NSV). Segmental and active vitiligo were more common in children than in adolescents and adults. The most common site of distribution of NSV in children was the face (periocular) vs arms and forearms in adults followed by thighs and legs in both. The mean age of onset of vitiligo in children was 6.18 (SD 2.93) yo, while mean duration of disease was 2.12 (SD 2.21) y. Face was the most common site of onset of vitiligo in children and adolescents vs arms and forearms in adults. Childhood vitiligo differs from adult onset vitiligo regarding several features as type, site of onset, distribution, extent, and activity of disease. "
673,10598843,"To investigate the interrelationships between the bronchial and pulmonary circulations including the existence of precapillary bronchopulmonary arterial anastomoses. CT of bronchial arteriography (BAG-CT) was performed in 10 patients and BAG-CT during a pulmonary artery block test (PA-block) in 5 patients with lung cancer. Bronchial and pulmonary circulations were evaluated in 5 autopsied normal lungs by injecting silicone rubber with different colors into the bronchial and pulmonary arteries. BAG-CT correlated well with the findings at silicone rubber injection into lung autopsy samples. BAG-CT demonstrated inflow of contrast medium into the pulmonary artery during PA-block in all cases, while no inflow was observed before and following reversal of PA-block. Mixed silicone rubber was observed in the lobar to subsubsegmental bronchial arteries in all cases and in the subsubsegmental pulmonary artery in one case. Precapillary bronchopulmonary arterial anastomoses may exist at the level of the lobar bronchi to the periphery. If either the pulmonary or bronchial circulation is disturbed, flow occurs inside the anastomoses to supplement the other flow, especially flow from the bronchial to the pulmonary arteries via the anastomoses, which occurs within 30 min.

674,31385820,"A near vision game has been developed for the autostereoscopic screen of the Nintendo 3DS console. Ease of use and time for testing by non-English-speaking patients was not known. Adult and pediatric patients in a remote Burma clinic were compared with US military staff with each performing conventional near acuity, Stereo Fly, and Ishihara color in addition to PDI Check game, so results could be correlated and timed. Seventeen Burma adults (aged 19-58), 20 Burma children (aged 7-15), and 14 US military staff (aged 21-36) completed the testing. Conventional testing correlated with PDI Check for stereo (P < 0.001), acuity oculo dexter (P < 0.01), acuity oculo sinister (P < 0.01). For visual acuity and stereopsis, the intraclass coefficient was 0.55 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28-0.72] and 0.62 (95% CI 0.41-0.77) respectively, but with few color deficient cases color was 0.30 (95% CI -0.05 to 0.60). The time in seconds to complete near vision testing with PDI Check (172 ± 27, overall; 198 ± 34, Burma; 99 ± 20, military) was significantly (25% ± 18%) briefer than conventional testing (226 ± 31, overall; 270 ± 34, Burma; 126 ± 20, military). The Burma patients took significantly longer than the military staff (234 ± 25 vs 112 ± 14, P < 0.01). Time for Burma children did not differ from Burma adults for PDI (109 ± 47 vs 217 ± 54, P = 0.42) and for conventional testing (266 ± 51 vs 275 ± 52, P = 0.80). Non-English-speaking Burma children and adults were able to reliably perform 3 types of near vision testing with a Nintendo 3DS game 25% quicker than the 2 to 3 minutes for conventional methods. They were slower than experienced US military staff adults. "
675,38523874,"Chicago's lead problem has been shown to disproportionately affect populations of color and lower socioeconomic status (SES). The disproportionate effects on low-income areas and communities of color can be traced back to several key decisions in Chicago's history. A search of the National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE/PubMed as well as Google, and Google Scholar was performed to find all articles relating to lead poisoning in Chicago, lead utilization, Chicago's municipal and political history, and lead physiology between May 2020 and May 2023. Additionally, several studies and textbooks were reviewed regarding the latest advancements in lead poisoning. The study identified several key political moves over the course of Chicago's history that have resulted in disproportionate toxicity in minority populations and those of lower SES. Lead is more readily absorbed in the pediatric population. Additionally, prior regulations had published acceptable blood lead levels (BLLs) in children, but more recent evidence indicates a myriad of detrimental effects in BLLs below that cutoff. There is substantial evidence to suggest that there is no acceptable BLL. Lead toxicity is generally improving nationally but there still exists a considerable need for improvement. Programs should be expanded to ensure that individuals living in communities most at risk of lead exposure have the means to both, replace lead-contaminated infrastructure, and to be able to supply these communities with affordable housing. From a physician and clinician standpoint, knowing the increased risk of lead poisoning in these populations should prompt earlier testing. "
676,26743296,"The use of dermatoscopy increases melanocytic nevi diagnostic accuracy, and is important for dermoscopic monitoring of atypical lesions, allowing to find significant changes in the earliest stage. Dermoscopic diagnosis of melanocytic nevi type in a group of patients and their follow-up with the assessment of changes occurred during dermoscopic monitoring. Dermoscopically, we followed the nevic size and pattern, the color and pigment distribution. Follow-up visits were scheduled depending on the type of the melanocytic lesions and the patient's compliance. The nevi that have shown significant dermoscopic changes were excised and histopathologically examined. The study was performed on a group of 92 patients, mostly females (56.5%), mean age of 29.1 years. Of the total of 1544 melanocytic nevi examined, 27.4% were atypical and 72.6% common nevi. The average dermoscopic examination interval was 14.1 months. During monitoring, 35.5% atypical nevi and 22.5% common nevi have modified, especially changes in pigmentation and color (31% atypical nevi and 9.9% common nevi) and the appearance of new dermoscopic structures (12.7% atypical nevi and common nevi 8.5%). Of the total nevi monitored, 3% showed significant changes and were excised and examined pathologically, without diagnose of any malignant transformation. In our study, dermoscopic changes appeared in atypical as well as in common nevi. The dermoscopic monitoring of melanocytic-pigmented lesions remains an accessible method of assessment the evolution of nevi and can reduce the risk of appearance of malignant melanoma in the general population.

677,21781062,"  In vitiligo, the melanocyte of the hair follicle is one of the major sources for repigmentation. Segmental vitiligo seems to be often associated with white hairs. However, in the case of small vellus hairs, it is often difficult or impossible to detect hair color. Thus, the real incidence of leukotrichia in segmental vitiligo has not been known.   In this study, we investigated the existence of white hairs in the lesional skin of 82 patients with segmental vitiligo. When it was difficult to detect hair color with the naked eye or a magnifier, a digital microscope with 30× magnification was used.   Interestingly, all 82 patients showed leukotrichia in segmental vitiligo independent of age and disease duration. Some patients had more than 90% white hairs in the lesional skin, and they showed poor response to medical treatment.   Based on our results, a very high percentage of patients with segmental vitiligo may be associated with leukotrichia. Many white hairs in segmental vitiligo may contribute to the lack of response with medical treatment. The examination of hair color with a digital microscope may be very useful for the prediction of treatment outcome and decision of treatment modalities. "
678,10845193,"We evaluated diagnostic X-ray and endoscopic examination findings in 486 patients with esophageal achalasia. Concerning the association between the duration of disease and the X-ray dilatation type, the duration was 1-4 years in more than 50% of patients with the Sp type, a mean of 8.5 years in those with the F type, and frequently more than 10 years in those with the S type. Endoscopy is generally used to determine the presence or absence of abnormal movement. In achalasia, the endoscope can be inserted into the stomach despite resistance at the stenotic site, and the mucosal surface is normal. Squamous cell carcinoma as a complication was observed in 21 patients (4.3%). The carcinoma complication rate was higher with a longer duration of disease and a longer observation period. The mean total course including the postoperative course was 27 years. Long-term and periodic X-ray and endoscopic observation of the disease course is important, and iodine staining is indispensable for early detection of esophageal cancer. "
679,33084367,"Suppurative acute thyroiditis is caused by pyriform sinus fistula (PSF), and PSF frequently elicits deep neck abscess. However, complete fistulectomy is the ideal management of PSF, and studies on surgical findings of PSF are exceedingly rare. This study aimed to reveal the origins of PSF, each route, and clinical presentation. This is a multicenter study. We have conducted 19 complete fistulectomies of PSF in Japan, analyzed routes of the fistulas, estimated the origins, and investigated their histological and clinical findings. No recurrence was observed in all cases. Five of 12 cases showed thymic and/or parathyroid tissues around the fistulas, passing inside the inferior horn of thyroid cartilage, were regarded as having 3rd pouch origin, and tended to have low frequency of severe deep neck abscess. The remaining 7 cases originated from the 4th pouch running outside of the horn and showed frequent severe infection. PSF have 2 different routes depending on their generation and may present different clinical manifestations. "
680,35751533,"Uncombable hair syndrome presents with frizzy hair in early childhood. Isolated hair manifestations are usually observed; however, systemic involvement of the nervous system, eyes, and ears have also been reported. The syndrome has been classified into three subtypes, correlating with the three mutated genes: peptidyl arginine deiminase, type III; transglutaminase 3; and trichohyalin. This article presents the clinical picture of uncombable hair syndrome with special attention to its systemic manifestations. It also addresses its molecular aspects. Google Scholar was used to retrieve relevant publications. Clinical and molecular data were tabulated and frequencies were calculated. At least 127 cases were identified. Congenital hair defects were reported in two-thirds of cases, in which hair texture (83%), color (52%), density (15%), and growth (11%) were impaired. Uncombable hair rarely involves the eyebrows and eyelashes, and it may co-occur with loose anagen hair syndrome, androgenic alopecia, alopecia areata, and scarring alopecia. Pathologies of the skin, nails, and teeth were reported among 63%, 28%, and 25%, respectively. Systemic abnormalities were not uncommon. Dysmorphic features (n = 8), and neuropsychiatric/developmental (n = 8), ophthalmic (n = 7), otic (n = 4), and cardiopulmonary (n = 3) manifestations were also reported. Molecular genetic analysis of all patients is recommended to identify genotype-phenotype correlation. A general pediatric review might be needed to rule out any potential systemic association. "
681,34403290,"Purpose A meaning-oriented auditory training program for children who are deaf or hard of hearing (d/hh) was assessed with regard to its efficacy in promoting novel word learning. Method While administering the auditory training program, one of the authors (Elizabeth Mauzé) observed that children were learning words they previously did not know. Therefore, we systematically assessed vocabulary gains among 16 children. Most completed pretest, posttest, and retention versions of a picture-naming task in which they attempted to verbally identify 199 color pictures of words that would appear during training. Posttest and retention versions included both pictures used and not used during training in order to test generalization of associations between words and their referents. Importantly, each training session involved meaning-oriented, albeit simple, activities/games on a computer. Results At posttest, the percentage of word gain was 27.3% ( "
682,22790432,"To characterise longitudinal progressive retinal changes in achromatopsia. Ultrahigh-resolution spectral optical coherence tomography (Copernicus, 3 μm axial resolution) was used to obtain tomograms of the fovea from five children and three adults with achromatopsia. Each patient was scanned twice with a mean follow-up time of 16 months. Progressive changes in reflectivity at the inner segment/outer segment (IS/OS) junction, the central macular and outer nuclear layer thickness were analysed. Younger patients (<10 years; patient 1-5) showed progressive morphological changes at the IS/OS junction between visits 1 and 2. However, older patients (>40 years; patients 6-8) did not have any changes in the retinal morphology between visits 1 and 2. In patients 1 and 2, IS/OS discontinuities (visit 1) developed into a hyper-reflective zone confined to the fovea (visit 2). In patient 3, the hyper-reflective zone (visit 1) progressed to form an IS/OS disruption and early formation of a small hypo-reflective zone (visit 2). Patients 4 and 5 had a hypo-reflective zone (visit 1) which subsequently increased in size (visit 2). There was a decrease in central macular and outer nuclear layer thickness between visits 1 and 2 in children. For the first time, we show progressive longitudinal changes in retinal morphology in achromatopsia. Early changes include subtle IS/OS reflectivity alterations. The dynamic retinal changes in younger patients provide evidence that it represents a progressive disorder, and implementation of gene therapy during the early stages of the disease may provide best prognosis.

683,35502047,"Methylphenidate hydrochloride, which blocks the reuptake mechanisms of dopamine and norepinephrine, is used in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treatment. Methylphenidate has many general side effects including ocular findings. In this study, we investigated the long-term effects of methylphenidate treatment on functional and structural ocular parameters. In this prospective study, children with ADHD were evaluated. All patients underwent a detailed ophthalmic examination before methylphenidate treatment. All patients were examined in the 3 A total of 22 children were included in this study. The best-corrected visual acuities (BCVA) of all patients for both eyes were 0.0 logMAR, and 90.9% of patients had blue-purple color weakness before the treatment. After 1 year of treatment, none of the patients had any change in BCVA and color vision. However, an increase in myopic values of static retinoscopy and a decrease in hyperopic values of cycloplegic retinoscopy were found. Additionally, accommodation capacities were found to be decreased and AL was found to be increased significantly for both eyes. Pupil diameter, IOP, and ACD values did not change significantly. Our results suggest that patients with ADHD may have blue color vision deficiencies because of the decreased retinal dopamine levels. Additionally, structural and ocular parameters, especially accommodation capacity, may be affected by methylphenidate treatment. "
684,29370000,"The use of a porous high-density polyethylene implant for ear reconstruction is gradually gaining acceptance because it allows for a pleasing ear reconstruction in young children before they enter school. In response to this growing interest, the authors decided to write an article clarifying in detail all the steps of this challenging procedure. In this article, the authors also answer all the common questions that surgeons have when they come to observe the operation, or when they go back to their respective practices and start performing this procedure. The authors describe in detail the operative steps that allow for a successful ear reconstruction using porous high-density polyethylene. The key parts of this operation are to meticulously harvest a well-vascularized superficial temporoparietal fascia flap and to use appropriate color-matched skin grafts. This method allows for a pleasing ear reconstruction with excellent definition, projection, symmetry, and long-term viability. The use of porous high-density polyethylene with a thin superficial temporoparietal fascia flap coverage is the authors' preferred method of ear reconstruction because it can be performed at an earlier age, in a single stage, as an outpatient procedure, and with minimal discomfort and psychological trauma for the patients and parents.

685,16505796,"Granular cell tumor is a relatively uncommon benign hamartomatous lesion occurring in almost any part of the body. The tongue and the buccal mucosa are common intra oral sites. Granular cell lesions may be found in other diverse sites such as the jaw, skin, gastro intestinal tract and respiratory tract. The histogenesis of the lesion still remains unknown. However, histochemical and ultra structural studies propose the origin of the lesion from schwann cells, striated muscle, mesenchymal cells, histiocytes and epithelial cells. The tumor generally occurs in middle or older aged adults. The lesion is typically seen as an uninflammed asymptomatic mass measuring about two cms in diameter with a yellowish surface coloration. As most of the granular cell tumors are benign, surgical excision of the lesion is the treatment of choice. We describe a case of granular cell tumor of the tongue in a 6 year old girl along with a brief review of literature on granular cell tumors. "

687,11425086,"Post-traumatic intrasplenic pseudoaneurysms are very rare in children. Since pseudoaneurysms may expand a splenic hematoma and cause delayed splenic rupture, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial. In this report, we describe the case of a 12-year-old boy with a delayed splenic rupture caused by a splenic hematoma containing 2 pseudoaneurysms. Abdominal sonography showed free intraperitoneal fluid and a mildly enlarged spleen with a large heterogeneous area occupying the upper half of the organ. Two anechoic lesions (15 and 4 mm) were seen inside the hematoma near the splenic hilum. Color Doppler sonography demonstrated turbulent arterial flow within the lesions, suggesting pseudoaneurysms. On CT, the lesions enhanced simultaneously with the splenic artery in the arterial phase of contrast enhancement. CT also showed an intrasplenic arterial branch leading to the larger of the 2 pseudoaneurysms. "

689,29621281,"Otitis media (OM) remains a common paediatric disease, despite advances in vaccinology. Susceptibility to recurrent acute OM (rAOM) has been postulated to involve defective cell-mediated immune responses to common otopathogenic bacteria. We compared the composition of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 20 children with a history of rAOM (otitis-prone) and 20 healthy non-otitis-prone controls, and assessed innate and cell-mediated immune responses to the major otopathogen nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). NTHi was a potent stimulator of inflammatory cytokine secretion from PBMC within 4 hours, with no difference in cytokine levels produced between PBMC from cases or controls. In the absence of antigen stimulation, otitis-prone children had more circulating Natural Killer (NK) cells (p<0.01), particularly NKdim (CD56lo) cells (p<0.01), but fewer CD4+ T cells (p<0.01) than healthy controls. NTHi challenge significantly increased the proportion of activated (CD107a+) NK cells in otitis-prone and non-otitis-prone children (p<0.01), suggesting that NK cells from otitis-prone children are functional and respond to NTHi. CD8+ T cells and NK cells from both cases and controls produced IFNγ in response to polyclonal stimulus (Staphylococcal enterotoxin B; SEB), with more IFNγ+ CD8+ T cells present in cases than controls (p<0.05) but similar proportions of IFNγ+ NK cells. Otitis-prone children had more circulating IFNγ-producing NK cells (p<0.05) and more IFNγ-producing CD4+ (p<0.01) or CD8+ T-cells (p<0.05) than healthy controls. In response to SEB, more CD107a-expressing CD8+ T cells were present in cases than controls (p<0.01). Despite differences in PBMC composition, PBMC from otitis-prone children mounted innate and T cell-mediated responses to NTHi challenge that were comparable to healthy children. These data provide evidence that otitis-prone children do not have impaired functional cell mediated immunity. "
690,35507726,"Handwriting difficulties are common in children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and they have been associated with lower academic achievement and self-esteem. Our aim in this study was to determine if training coordination of the head, eyes, and arm and engaging in the necessary visual concentration associated with table tennis would improve executive functions and school-based handwriting among children with ADHD. We designed a randomized controlled trial to explore the therapeutic efficacy of this table tennis training and recruited 48 children with ADHD that we randomly assigned to one of three equal-sized training groups: (a) actual table tennis, (b) simulated table tennis (exergame), or (c) a control group receiving no additional training. The training intervention lasted 12-weeks in which the two different table tennis trainings (i.e., actual or simulated) were scheduled for three one-hour sessions per week. Outcome measures included a computerized handwriting evaluation, the Stroop test, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Participants in each table tennis training group showed significant improvements in handwriting performance, response time, and required time to achieve automation. Both intervention groups also showed significant improvements on the Stroop Color-Word test, but only the actual table tennis training group showed a significant improvement on the WCST. This study provided evidence of at least short-term improvements in executive functions and handwriting problems in children with ADHD through their participation in table tennis motor coordination activities.

691,34430199,"A 2 month old, full term, previously healthy male, with known COVID-19 infection 3 weeks prior to arrival presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with complaints of 5-6 episodes of non-bilious and non-bloody emesis. According to the child's parents, the emesis was mostly associated with feeding. His parents endorsed that the patient had one episode of diarrhea that was maroon in color and appeared different than typical stools. Abdominal exam at that time was non distended with no tenderness and no other significant findings. The patient was observed while feeding in the ED and was noted to have some minimal spit up with arching of his back. A presumptive diagnosis of reflux was made, and the patient was discharged home with education on feeding. The infant was brought back to the ED the following day due to worsening emesis. Additionally, his parents noted more episodes of bloody stools. His abdomen appeared mildly distended with moderate tenderness on abdominal examination. During evaluation, a large ""currant jelly"" stool was observed (Fig. 1). An abdominal ultrasound was obtained, which demonstrated an ileocolic intussusception with a possible enlarged lymph node as lead point. The patient received an air contrast enema with successful reduction. Repeat ultrasound was obtained which confirmed resolution, and the patient was admitted for overnight observation. The patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using polymerase chain reaction testing. He was discharged the following day after successful advancing of diet, normal serial abdominal exams, and observed normal bowel movements. "

693,33973910,"Methods and frequency of vision screenings for school-aged children vary widely by state, and there has been no recent comparative analysis of state requirements. This analysis underscores the need for developing evidence-based criteria for vision screening in school-aged children across the United States. The purpose of this study was to conduct an updated comprehensive analysis of vision screening requirements for school-aged children in the United States. State laws pertaining to school-aged vision screening were obtained for each state. Additional information was obtained from each state's Department of Health and Education, through their websites or departmental representatives. A descriptive analysis was performed for states with data available. Forty-one states require vision screening for school-aged children to be conducted directly in schools or in the community. Screening is more commonly required in elementary school (n = 41) than in middle (n = 30) or high school (n = 19). Distance acuity is the most commonly required test (n = 41), followed by color vision (n = 11) and near vision (n = 10). Six states require a vision screening annually or every 2 years. Although most states require vision screening for some school-aged children, there is marked variation in screening methods and criteria, where the screening occurs, and grade levels that are screened. This lack of standardization and wide variation in state regulations point to a need for the development of evidence-based criteria for vision screening programs for school-aged children. "

Chest radiograph showed a nodule in left lower lobe; echocardiogram was normal, but chest computed tomography showed 2 nodules in left lower lobe. Arteriography showed 2 large arteriovenous fistulas in left lower lobe. Patient underwent left lower lobectomy, and surgical outcome was excellent. At hospital discharge, mucosal color was normal and O(2) saturation was 96% on room air. Congenital pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas should be suspected in children with cyanosis but no cardiac malformations. Symptomatic congenital pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas should be treated with embolization when fistulas are small and multiple, or with lung resection when they are large and localized. "
695,34809993,"Parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity is important to physiological regulation. Limbic structures are important in determining what information the PNS receives, potentially influencing concurrent physiological responsivity and, ultimately, shaping PNS development. Yet, whether individual differences in these structures are linked to PNS activity in early childhood remains unclear. Here, in an exploratory capacity, we examined the association between neonatal limbic structures (i.e., the left and right amygdala and hippocampus) and preschoolers' resting-state respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). RSA is a measure of heart-rate variability, a physiological marker that reflects fluctuation in the PNS and is often found predictive of emotion regulation and psychological wellbeing. Data were extracted from the ""Growing Up in Singapore towards Healthy Outcomes"" (GUSTO) cohort (n = 73, 39 girls). Neonatal limbic volume was collected within two weeks after birth while infants were asleep. Resting-state RSA was collected during a coloring session at 42 months of age. After controlling for potential confounders, a Bonferroni-corrected significant association between neonatal left hippocampal volume and resting-state RSA emerged wherein larger hippocampal volume was associated with higher resting-state RSA. No significant associations were present between resting-state RSA and right or left amygdala, or right hippocampal volume. These findings contribute to an increasing body of evidence aiming at enhancing our understanding of neurobiological underpinnings of parasympathetic activity and modulation. Results are also discussed with reference to ideas concerning biological sensitivity to context, as both left hippocampal volume and resting-state RSA were previously found to moderate associations between adversity and psychological function.

696,29476678,"Oral manifestations are common in neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), and include jaws and teeth alterations. Our aim was to investigate the craniomaxillofacial morphology of Brazilian children, adolescents and adults with NF1 using cone beam computed tomography. This study was conducted with 36 Brazilian individuals with NF1 with ages ranging from 4 to 75. The participants were submitted to anamnesis, extra and intraoral exam and cephalometric analysis using cone beam computed tomography. Height of the NF1 individuals was compared to the length of jaws and skull base. The results of the cephalometric measurements of the NF1 group were compared with a control group paired by age, gender and skin color. Individuals with NF1 had lower maxillary length (p<0.0001), lower mandibular length (p<0.0001), lower skull base length (p<0.0001). In children and adolescents, the mandible was more posteriorly positioned (p=0.01), when compared with the control group. There was no association between jaws and skull base length with the height of the individuals with NF1. Brazilian children, adolescents and adults with NF1 have short mandible, maxilla and skull base. Moreover, children and adolescents present mandibular retrusion. "
697,20332010,"The use of food dyes is at least controversial because they are only of essential role. Moreover many of them have been related to health problems mainly in children that are considered a very vulnerable group. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of oral administration of Amaranth, Sunset Yellow and Curcumin for 4 weeks at doses of 47, 315 and 157.5 mg/kg b. wt. and after 2 weeks all animals were immunostimulated by intra peritoneal injection of sheep RBCs 10% (1 ml/rat). Body weight, relative body weight, total and differential leukocytes count, mononuclear cell count, delayed hypersensitivity, total protein and serum fractions were determined. Results revealed that oral administration of Amaranth, Sunset Yellow and Curcumin did not affect the body weight gain or the spleen weight. On the other hand Sunset Yellow and Curcumin significantly decreased the weight of thymus gland of the rats. Total leukocyte count were not affected while Amaranth and Curcumin-treated rats revealed a significant decrease in neutrophiles and monocytes and a compensatory increase in lymphocytes. Moreover, oral administration of Sunset Yellow revealed a significant decrease in monocyte percent. Amaranth, Sunset Yellow and Curcumin significantly decreased the delayed hyper sensitivity. Total serum protein, albumin, total globulin and albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio were not affected by administration of the colouring agents. Oral administration of Amaranth increases the density of albumin band. On the other hand oral administration of Curcumin decreases the density of the albumin band. Oral administration of any of the tested colouring agents did not change the density of globulin region as compared to control group. In conclusion we found that both synthetic (Amaranth and Sunset Yellow) and natural (Curcumin) colouring agents used at doses up to 10 times the acceptable daily intake exerted a depressing effect on the cellular but not humoral immune response.

698,33118264,"Dementia education for healthcare providers has gained growing attention in China. This study aimed to explore the current dementia care practices in care home setting in China because people with dementia have increased need for residential care as the cognitive function worsens. An exploratory qualitative study was conducted among care staff and residents with dementia in four care homes in a metropolitan city in China between May and August 2019. Participant observations were conducted to understand how the care environment and activities affect residents with dementia. Care records were reviewed to explore the kind of care provided. In-depth individual interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 15 care staff members of different ranks to clarify the care practices and understand their training needs with dementia care. Field notes of observations, nursing care records and interviews transcripts were triangulated for qualitative content analysis. The theme emerged is 'suboptimal dementia care practices'. Four categories about dementia care practices in care homes were identified: (a) care environment (hospital-like layout, inappropriate lighting, environmental noise, inappropriate use of colour and unclear signage), (b) care culture (being medical-oriented, overlooking individual uniqueness and privacy), (c) attitudes towards dementia (treating as children, being authoritative, adopting punitive approaches, trying to respect the residents and having a positive learning attitude) and (d) dementia care competence (questing for specific training and resources, questing for culturally specific practices and strengthening communication with family). Creating a dementia-friendly and enabling environment, shifting the care culture paradigm from disease-oriented to person-centred and developing culturally sensitive care practices are imperative. Dementia care education for care home staff using a systematic, comprehensive approach is fundamental to achieve these goals. "
699,39008276,"The purpose of the study was to assess and compare the masticatory performance in children receiving preformed metal crown by Hall technique and conventional technique. Children having teeth indicated for restorative/endodontic therapy and belonging to the age group of six to ten years were invited to participate in the study. Eighteen children received preformed metal crowns (PMCs) by Hall technique. Meanwhile, nineteen children received preformed metal crowns by the conventional technique. Their masticatory performance (MP) was assessed at T0 (pre-intervention), T1 (day 1 post-intervention), T2 (1 week), T3 (2 weeks), T4 (1 month) and T5 (3 months) using Hue-check Gum® (University of Bern, Switzerland). The chewing gum samples were scanned within 24 h of their collection and processed in the ViewGum Software©. The software calculated the hue value (VOH) which indicated the masticatory performance of the individual. A questionnaire was given to the parents at T4 and T5 to assess any discomfort or pain associated with PMCs placed in both groups. The evaluation of masticatory performance using the two-color chewing method revealed reduction in MP on day 1 post-intervention (p < 0.001) for both groups. However, the MP values recorded at T5 were comparable to the baseline values at T0 (p = 0.009). No significant discomfort or pain was reported in both groups. The findings of the current clinical study indicate that placement of PMCs by both conventional and Hall technique in children deteriorates their MP which equilibrates within 1 month.

700,15124165,"The videoendoscope has a small charge-coupled device (CCD) chip built into its tip that provides a clear image. This report concerns office-based pharyngeal and laryngeal foreign-body management using a videoendoscope. Three types of videoendoscopes (videoendoscopes equipped with and also without a hood at their tips and a rigid videoendoscope) were used in this study. Seventeen patients who complained of pharyngeal and laryngeal foreign bodies were treated with these videoendoscopes. The advantages of this intervention were (1) videoendoscopes presented clear dynamic color images on a color video monitor and provided excellent resolution and recording and thus yielded high diagnostic accuracy and fine intervention; (2) the videoendoscope's diameter was relatively small and resulted in less discomfort for patients, even for children; (3) patients could be examined and treated in a sitting position on a procedure chair at the otolaryngology outpatient clinic, which obviated general anesthesia; (4) the videoendoscope equipped with a hood enabled treatment in a closed cavity like the hypopharynx; (5) minute foreign bodies located at the portion of the pharynx, which were hard to examine, could be depicted clearly; (6) pernasal endoscopy allowed the doctor to examine patients who had a strong gag reflex; and (7) good image documentation on the color video monitor allowed the physician to carry out safe intervention. A disadvantage of this procedure was that the extraction of different kinds of foreign bodies was limited, but it depended in part on the efficacy of the forceps. Foreign-body extraction using a videoendoscope is one of the reliable procedures that has widened the indications for office-based endoscopy. "
701,8542636,"Transcatheter closure of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) using the Rashkind occluder or the buttoned device is accompanied with a 7-38% incidence of residual shunt. Closure of the residual shunt with a second device is expensive, associated with possible morbidity, can be technically challenging, and occasionally does not completely eliminate the shunt. Our objective was to assess the immediate and short-term results of transcatheter closure of residual PDA after the Rashkind device using single or multiple Gianturco coils. Five patients (one male/four female) underwent transcatheter closure of residual PDA at a median age of 8.4 yr (range 2-10.1 yr) and median weight of 23 kg (range 11.8-32 kg). A 4F catheter was used for delivery of the coils in all patients. Three patients underwent multiple coil and two single coil closure with complete elimination of the shunt. There was complete elimination of the shunt as documented by repeat angiography immediately after the coil closure. The median fluoroscopy time was 24 min (range, 22-55 min). All patients were discharged home on the same day. There were no complications Follow-up evaluation was performed with color flow mapping of the main pulmonary artery within 4 hr after closure and 6 weeks later with echocardiography and chest radiography. We conclude that transcatheter closure is an effective therapy for patients with residual PDA after the Rashkind device using the single or multiple coil technique. This technique can be performed on an out-patient basis without the need for general anesthesia and at a lower expense than a repeat occluder device or surgery. "
702,31786547,"Advances in 3-dimensional (3D) printing technology permit the rapid creation of detailed anatomical models. Integration of this technology into neurosurgical practice is still in its nascence, however. One potential application is to create models depicting neurosurgical pathology. The goal of this study was to assess the clinical value of patient-specific 3D printed models for neurosurgical planning and education. The authors created life-sized, patient-specific models for 4 preoperative cases. Three of the cases involved adults (2 patients with petroclival meningioma and 1 with trigeminal neuralgia) and the remaining case involved a pediatric patient with craniopharyngioma. Models were derived from routine clinical imaging sequences and manufactured using commercially available software and hardware. Life-sized, 3D printed models depicting bony, vascular, and neural pathology relevant to each case were successfully manufactured. A variety of commercially available software and hardware were used to create and print each model from radiological sequences. The models for the adult cases were printed in separate pieces, which had to be painted by hand, and could be disassembled for detailed study, while the model for the pediatric case was printed as a single piece in separate-colored resins and could not be disassembled for study. Two of the models were used for patient education, and all were used for presurgical planning by the surgeon. Patient-specific 3D printed models are useful to neurosurgical practice. They may be used as a visualization aid for surgeons and patients, or for education of trainees. "
703,10809979,"A previously healthy 7-year-old white boy presented to St. Louis Children's Hospital with a 1-day history of headache, malaise, temperature of 38.7 degrees C, and a progressively erythematous, tender calf with central dusky purpura. On the morning of admission, his mother noticed a 2-mm crust on the patient's right calf with a 3-cm x 3-cm area of surrounding erythema. No history of recent trauma or bite was obtained. He had suffered two episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis during the last day. In addition, over the previous 12 h, he presented brown urine without dysuria. His mother and brother had suffered from gastroenteritis over the previous week without bloody diarrhea. On initial physical examination, there was a 6-cm x 11-cm macular tender purpuric plaque with a central punctum on the right inner calf, which was warm and tender to the touch, with erythematous streaking towards the popliteal fossa (Fig. 1). The inguinal area was also erythematous with tender lymphadenopathy and induration, but without fluctuance. Laboratory studies included an elevated white blood cell count of 20, 800/microL with 6% bands, 86% segs, and 7% lymphocytes, hemoglobin of 12.5 g/dL, hematocrit of 35.1%, and platelets of 282,000/microL. The prothrombin time/activated partial tissue thromboplastin was 10. 4/28.0 s (normal PT, 9.3-12.3 s; normal PTT, 21.3-33.7 s) and fibrinogen was 558 mg/dL (normal, 192-379 mg/dL). Urinalysis showed 1+ protein, 8-10 white blood cells, too numerous to count red blood cells, and no hemoglobinuria. His electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatine were normal. The urine culture was negative. Blood culture after 24 h showed one out of two bottles of coagulase negative Staphylococcus epidermidis. The patient's physical examination was highly suggestive of a brown recluse spider bite with surrounding purpura. Over the next 2 days, the surrounding rim of erythema expanded. The skin within the plaque cleared and peeled at the periphery. The coagulase negative staphylococci in the blood culture were considered to be a contaminant. Cefotaxime and oxacillin were given intravenously. His leg was elevated and cooled with ice packs. The patient's fever resolved within 24 h. The lesion became less erythematous and nontender with decreased warmth and lymphadenopathy. The child was discharged on Duricef for 10 days. Because the patient experienced hematuria rather than hemoglobinuria, nephritis was suggested. In this case, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis was the most likely cause. His anti-streptolysin-O titer was elevated at 400 U (normal, <200 U) and C3 was 21.4 mg/dL (normal, 83-177 mg/dL). His urine lightened to yellow-brown in color. His blood pressure was normal. Renal ultrasound showed severe left hydronephrosis with cortical atrophy, probably secondary to chronic/congenital ureteropelvic junction obstruction. His right kidney was normal. "
704,37867800,"Immunostaining is an antibody-based tool used to visualize proteins in tissue. Enzymes or fluorochromes conjugated to antibodies are used to detect proteins of interests. Fluorescent immunostaining can be used in human tissue, however due to the high autofluorescence of non-perfused human tissue, enzymatic immunostaining is better suited. Enzymes produce a colored product that is detectable by light microscopes. Here we describe a successful triple immunochemistry protocol to enzymatically label three distinct populations of interneurons (Parvalbumin+, Calbindin+, and Calretinin + interneurons) in non-perfused formalin fixed human brain cerebral cortex. Signal was achieved using a combination of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) enzymes and color was generated using the insoluble chromogens: 3,3'- Diaminobenzidine (DAB, Brown), Vector Blue (Blue), and Vector VIP (Pink). There were no noticeable background and minimal signal overlap between the different colors. We were able to successfully stain human cortical tissue and distinguish morphological properties of the three interneuron (IN) populations. "
705,31236613,"We report two cases of prenatally diagnosed double aortic arch with dominant right arch and a left-sided ductus arteriosus, consistent with a complete vascular ring. Postnatal transthoracic echocardiogram and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a spontaneous closure of the ductus arteriosus and obliteration of the left aortic arch distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery in both cases. Spontaneous closure of the ductus arteriosus involving extended ductal tissue in the left aortic arch likely led to obliteration of the distal left arch after birth. One patient presented with recurrent symptoms suggestive of dysphagia and underwent a successful surgical repair of the vascular ring with resolution of symptoms. The other patient has been asymptomatic and is 4 years old at the time of this report. "
706,39147113,"Ancestrally admixed populations are underrepresented in genetic studies of complex diseases, which are still dominated by European-descent populations. This is relevant not only from a representation standpoint but also because of admixed populations' unique features, including being enriched for rare variants, for which effect sizes are disproportionately larger than common polymorphisms. Furthermore, results from these populations may be generalizable to other populations. The South African Cape Coloured (SACC) population is genetically admixed and has one of the highest prevalences of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) worldwide. We profiled its admixture and examined associations between ancestry profiles and FASD outcomes using two longitudinal birth cohorts (N=308 mothers, 280 children) designed to examine effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on development. Participants were genotyped via MEGAex array to capture common and rare variants. Rare variants were overrepresented in our SACC cohorts, with numerous polymorphisms being monomorphic in other reference populations (e.g., ∼30,000 and ∼ 221,000 variants in gnomAD European and Asian populations, respectively). The cohorts showed global African (51 %; Bantu and San); European (26 %; Northern/Western); South Asian (18 %); and East Asian (5 %; largely Southern regions) ancestries. The cohorts exhibited high rates of homozygosity (6 %), with regions of homozygosity harboring more deleterious variants when lying within African local-ancestry genomic segments. Both maternal and child ancestry profiles were associated with higher FASD risk, and maternal and child ancestry-by-prenatal alcohol exposure interaction effects were seen on child cognition. Our findings indicate that the SACC population may be a valuable asset to identify novel disease-associated genetic loci for FASD and other diseases. "
707,10980218,"Quantitative assessment of ventricular function in patients with congenital heart disease is often challenging due to distorted ventricular geometry. A myocardial performance index (MPI) has been reported in adults and children that is a Doppler-derived nongeometric measure of ventricular function. The MPI measures the ratio of isovolumic time intervals (isovolumic contraction time and isovolumic relaxation time) to ventricular ejection time. The effects of altered ventricular preload or afterload on the MPI have yet to be determined. This study assesses the impact of altered preload or afterload on right ventricular (RV) function and the RV MPI in the clinical setting of congenital heart disease. Patient groups were compared with normal pediatric and adult populations before and after repair of their congenital heart lesion. Patients with large atrial septal defects (ASDs) represented the clinical setting of increased ventricular preload, whereas patients with isolated pulmonary valve stenosis represented increased RV afterload. Patients with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (CC-TGA) with severe left atrioventricular valve regurgitation represented a combined increase in RV preload and afterload. The RV MPI in 152 normal children (ages 3 to 18 years) and 37 adults (ages 18 to 51 years) was 0.32 +/- 0.03 and 0.28 +/- 0.04, respectively. In pediatric patients (n = 45) and adult patients (n = 40) with ASD, the RV MPI was 0.35 +/- 0.09 (p = NS) and 0.38 +/- 0.04 (p < 0.01 compared with normal adults), respectively. Patients with pulmonary stenosis (n = 21, ages 1 day to 19 years) had a RV MPI of 0.32 +/- 0.06 (p = NS). CC-TGA patients had a RV MPI of 0.72 +/- 0.17 (p < 0.001). No significant change in the RV MPI was seen in any postoperative patient group despite relief of RV volume or pressure overload. Thus, the MPI is a quantitative measure of RV performance that is appears to be relatively independent of changes in preload or afterload in the clinical setting. "
708,12879320,"Although there is much evidence supporting a relationship between primary varicocoele and venous incompetence of the saphenofemoral junction in adults, there is no evidence for such a relationship during adolescence. Because of the effect of age and future occupation (standing upright for long periods) on the aetiology, pathogenesis and frequency of varicose veins of the lower extremity and incompetence of saphenofemoral junctions in adulthood, a comparison during adolescence is appropriate. On the basis of a close physiopathological and haemodynamic relationship between primary varicose veins and primary varicocoele, we decided to evaluate the competence of the saphenofemoral junctions in a selected group of adolescents affected by primary varicocoele and compare these results with age-matched healthy adolescents. Twenty-five adolescents with primary varicocoele and 23 age-matched healthy controls were included in the study. In all cases physical examination and colour Doppler US was used to diagnose or exclude the presence of primary varicocoele and to evaluate the continence of the saphenofemoral junction. On the right side, 10 of 25 varicocoele patients and on the left side 11 of 25 varicocoele patients had incompetence of the saphenofemoral junction. For the control patients the incidence was 2/23 on the right side and 4/23 on the left side. The difference is statistically significant. We demonstrated high concurrence of varicocoele and valvular incompetence of the saphenofemoral junction in a particular adolescent group. We suggest clinical examination and US assessment of the saphenofemoral junctions of adolescents affected by varicocoele in order to detect the early diagnosis of venous insufficiency of the lower limbs among these patients.

709,38226515,"Identification of children with latent rheumatic heart disease (RHD) by echocardiography, before onset of symptoms, provides an opportunity to initiate secondary prophylaxis and prevent disease progression. There have been limited artificial intelligence studies published assessing the potential of machine learning to detect and analyze mitral regurgitation or to detect the presence of RHD on standard portable echocardiograms. We used 511 echocardiograms in children, focusing on color Doppler images of the mitral valve. Echocardiograms were independently reviewed by an expert adjudication panel. Among 511 cases, 229 were normal, and 282 had RHD. Our automated method included harmonization of echocardiograms to localize the left atrium during systole using convolutional neural networks and RHD detection using mitral regurgitation jet analysis and deep learning models with an attention mechanism. We identified the correct view with an average accuracy of 0.99 and the correct systolic frame with an average accuracy of 0.94 (apical) and 0.93 (parasternal long axis). It localized the left atrium with an average Dice coefficient of 0.88 (apical) and 0.9 (parasternal long axis). Maximum mitral regurgitation jet measurements were similar to expert manual measurements ( Artificial intelligence has the potential to detect RHD as accurately as expert cardiologists and to improve with more data. These innovative approaches hold promise to scale echocardiography screening for RHD. "

711,14653366,"Asahi Optical Co, Ltd (Tokyo, Japan), has manufactured a trial thin videoendoscope with an instantaneous RGB (red-green-blue) system. We have developed a new laryngostroboscopic system using this videoendoscope. In this article, we report the performance of the clinical trial of this new and useful videoendoscopic system for stroboscopy, and compare it to conventional stroboscopy using a flexible fiberscope or rigid endoscope. This new thin videoendoscope has the following characteristics. A small charge-coupled device (CCD) chip is built into the tip of this endoscope, and an instantaneous RGB system is used. The outer diameters of its tip (4.1 mm) and the insertion tube (3.7 mm) of the videoendoscope are relatively small. The videoendoscope system is compact. Stroboscopic observation was conducted with this videoendoscope in conjunction with a laryngostroboscope. Compared to stroboscopy with a conventional flexible fiberscope or rigid endoscope, this stroboscopic system has several clear advantages. It presents clear dynamic color images on a color video monitor and provides excellent resolution and recording, thus yielding high diagnostic accuracy. The diameter of the videoendoscope is relatively small and results in less discomfort for patients, even for children. The videoendoscope allowed the doctors to perform pernasal endoscopy. Therefore, there is less limitation in the range of subjects for examination. Patients are able to phonate holding a normal head position, and are thereby able to produce varying vocal sounds in the habitual or normal manner during examination. The new stroboscopy system using a videoendoscope is a very useful examination tool that has the advantages of both a conventional flexible fiberscope and a rigid endoscope. "
712,3691294,"Three patients in a family with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) were studied especially electrophysiologically. Two cases showed abnormal ERG, namely reduction of amplitude of oscillatory potentials, a and b wave of bright white flash ERG, scotopic and photopic b waves. One case showed reduced Light peak/Dark trough ratio of EOG. Next, the electrophysiological findings of cases with FEVR reported in the literature were analyzed. The result was that FEVR has electrophysiological varieties but a statistical significant relationship between electrophysiological findings and visual acuity. That is, cases with abnormal ERG or EOG have more impaired visual acuity than normal ones. Furthermore, there was a tendency that eyes with abnormal ERG or EOG showed more disturbed color vision and advanced fundus findings than normal ones. These results seemed to be understandable by anatomically characteristic fundus feature of FEVR. "
713,34937249,"To estimate prevalence of common ocular morbidities including color blindness among school-attending children of an urban foothill town of Uttarakhand State in Northern India. A cross-sectional study was conducted among school-going children of age group 6-16 years of standard I-XII. Schools were selected using population proportionate to the size sampling technique. Detailed ocular examination including color vision and unaided or aided visual acuity for various ocular morbidities was done. Data was entered into MS excel with statistical analysis using SPSS version 23 with significant P value <0.05. In total, 13,492 students (mean age 10.9 ± 2.7 years) with almost equal male to female ratio were screened. Overall prevalence of ocular morbidity was 23.2%, with refractive error (18.5%) on top, followed by color blindness (2.2%). The later was observed more among males (3.0%) as compared to females (1.4%) with significantly higher odds, OR = 2.3 (1.7-2.9) (P < 0.001). Refractive error has been the most common ocular morbidity, followed by color blindness. Earliest detection can prevent permanent disability and disappointment among youngsters when rejected from entering certain professions due to color vision defect. "
714,35989518,"Detection of classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) neoplastic cells using flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FCI) remains limited. We hypothesized that characterization of the reactive infiltrates could assist in diagnosing cHL in children. FCI using four-color staining approaches was performed on 156 lymph node specimens with the following histopathologic diagnoses: cHL (25 cases), reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (RLH, 44 cases), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (87 cases). The overall concordance of FCI data with the histopathologic results of these cases was 81.4%. A reactive expansion of T-cells with increased expression of CD45RO was present in the reactive infiltrate of cHL (CD45RO/CD3, 67.5%) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infected RLH (62.7%) but not in EBV-negative RLH (28.0%). The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD7 was higher for cHL and differed significantly from EBV-positive RLH (138.5 vs. 63.8). A proposed diagnostic algorithm markedly elevated the overall concordance rate from 81.4% to 97.4%. Immunophenotyping the reactive infiltrate of lymphoid tissue using flow cytometry is a reliable supplement to histopathology for the rapid diagnosis of pediatric cHL. "
715,36617246,"Leptin and adiponectin play important roles in systemic metabolic homeostasis, beginning in utero. Limited data exist on the levels and trajectories of these 2 hormones at birth and in childhood and their biological and social determinants. We examined the longitudinal trajectories of leptin and adiponectin from birth to early childhood, along with influential prenatal and infancy factors, and whether the trajectories and risk factors differ by preterm birth status. We included mother-infant pairs in the Boston Birth Cohort, a predominantly Black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) study population. We measured infant plasma leptin and adiponectin levels at birth and in early childhood. We examined longitudinal trajectories and the associated prenatal maternal and infancy factors. We analyzed 716 infants (158 preterm) who had leptin and adiponectin measured at birth and in early childhood (mean corrected age 2.18 years [interquartile range, 0.4-10.4]). Cord leptin was higher in term infants (40 230 vs 20 481 in preterm, P < 0.0001) but childhood leptin did not differ by prematurity (4123 in term vs 4181 in preterm, P = 0.92). Adiponectin was higher in term infants at birth (18 416 vs 11 223, P < 0.0001) and in childhood (12 108 vs 10532, P = 0.04). In stepwise regression, Black race was associated with higher childhood leptin and lower childhood adiponectin. Female sex was associated with higher childhood leptin levels and lower childhood adiponectin levels in multivariable regression models. Our results highlight preterm status, race, and biological sex as predictors of adipokine trajectory throughout childhood. These findings raise the possibility that early life programming of adipokines may contribute to higher metabolic risk in life, especially among Black children born preterm. "

717,36940202,"Superficial infantile hemangiomas (IH) are benign vascular tumors common in children characterized by bright red ""strawberry"" lesions on the skin. In order to optimize the treatment for this disease, there is a need to develop objective tools to assess treatment response. Since a color change in the lesion is a good indicator of treatment response, we have developed a digital imaging system to quantify the values of red, green, and blue (RGB) difference and RGB ratio between the tumor and normal tissue to take into account the variations in color between different skin types. The efficacy of the proposed system in assessing treatment response in superficial IH was evaluated in relation to established visual and biochemical tools used to grade hemangiomas. As the treatment progressed, the RGB ratio was almost 1, while the RGB difference was close to 0, which indicates a good response to treatment. There was a strong correlation between the RGB score and the other visual grading systems. However, the correlation between the RGB scoring system and the biochemical method was weak. These findings suggest that the system can be used clinically to objectively and accurately evaluate disease progression and treatment response in patients diagnosed with superficial IH. "

719,18554649,"The American population continues to increase in ethnic diversity. However, the medical work force has lagged behind these population trends. We evaluated the extent of diversity and perceived barriers to multicultural training in American urology programs. A 25-question nonvalidated diversity questionnaire was distributed electronically to 112 American urology residency program directors. A total of 62 program directors (55%) responded, representing all American Urological Association geographic regions nationwide. Of the respondents 92% were male and 90% were older than 40 years. During their residency 44% of respondents reported no female co-residents and 51% reported no co-residents of color. As faculty, 40% of respondents reported no female colleagues and 49% reported no colleagues of color. Of the respondents 75% identified no formal process to recruit faculty of color. With regard to current residency training 36% of respondents reported 1 or fewer female residents, 66% reported at least 1 black resident and 42% reported at least 1 Hispanic resident in their program. Of the respondents 75% stated that multicultural training is important for residents and 46% reported no barriers to multicultural training. However, 75% of program directors reported no formal multicultural program training. Most urology program directors trained with few minority or female co-residents. This paucity of diversity has continued with current faculty members. Residents are increasingly diverse but few urology residency programs have a formal curriculum or mentors to address diversity issues. Therefore, current residency training may not encourage diversity at academic centers or adequately prepare residents to serve an increasingly diverse patient population. "
720,31300841,"Risk of superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction following repair of anomalous right upper pulmonary veins in children is unclear. The incidence and outcome of subclinical obstruction remained unknown. Retrospective single institutional study (07/1993-02/2017) in a pediatric population (N = 42, median age 3.9-year, range 0.1-15.3 years). 33 (79%) children had repair without SVC translocation (""non-Warden"") and 9 (21%) had Warden-type surgery. Echocardiographic SVC obstruction was defined as (I) turbulent flow across SVC and (II) continuous flow pattern without return to baseline velocity (0 m/s); severe obstruction was defined as loss of distinct biphasic profile ± mean gradient ≥ 5 mmHg. 3 (7%) patients required intra-operative revision due to obstruction (non-Warden: 1, Warden: 2). After discharge, 2 (5%) patients required reintervention (3 and 6-month post-op) for severe symptomatic obstruction (non-Warden: 1, Warden-type: 1). Both patients responded to balloon angioplasty with symptomatic resolution (one required repeat catheter reintervention). 10 (24%) patients had subclinical echocardiographic obstruction (2, 22% Warden vs. 8, 24% non-Warden; p = 1.0; 8 of 10 patients had mild gradient), which resolved and remained well without reintervention. At follow-up (mean 7.2-year, range 0-23 years), all patients were alive. Freedom from SVC reintervention at 10 and 20-year is 95% (97% at 10, 20-year in non-Warden and 89% at 5, 8-year in Warden-type group; log-rank p = 0.34). Surgical repair for anomalous right upper pulmonary veins is associated with risk of SVC obstruction in children. The need for reintervention for severe obstruction is rare at late follow-up. Patients with subclinical obstruction remain asymptomatic and demonstrate echocardiographic improvement. "
721,31581879,"Post-traumatic headache is common after pediatric traumatic brain injury and affects thousands of children every year, but little is known about how headache affects recovery after traumatic brain injury in other symptom domains. We aimed to determine the association between headache and other common symptoms after pediatric traumatic brain injury and explore whether subjective complaints of headache are associated with objective deficits on specialized neurocognitive testing. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children ages 3-19 years following traumatic brain injury with a completed Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) questionnaire. Post-traumatic headache was defined by a score more than 2 on the SCAT question for headache and define headache groups for comparison. In our cohort, we analyzed data from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System and the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, Second Edition (WASI-II). Headache was reported in 40 (33%) patients presenting for post-traumatic brain injury care among 121 pediatric traumatic brain injury patients and did not differ by injury severity. Median total SCAT symptom score in the headache group was 5-fold higher compared to patients without headache (median 45.5 vs 9;  "

Two-thirds were exposed to the sun 1-2 hours a day and 13% 4 hours a day or more. Only about 15% used sunscreen while shopping, 69% used it at the beach, and less than half applied it to children being sent to school. Sunscreen use was greater in women (p < 0.000001), especially those with sensitive skin (p < 0.0001) and red hair (p < 0.0001). No significant association was found with age, education or country of birth. "

724,16354111,"To assist standardization of procedures, facilitate comparisons, and help guide research efforts to optimally inform development of appropriately targeted interventions, there is a need to review methods used to quantify child and adolescent solar ultraviolet radiation (UV) exposure, related outdoor activities and sun-protective practices. This holistic approach is essential for comprehensive research that will provide all-inclusive, informative and meaningful messages for preventive measures of harmful UV exposure. Two databases were searched and 29 studies were retrieved, and these studies report measurement or assessment techniques documenting UV exposure patterns and related outdoor activities. Polysulfone film badges were the main measurement instrument used in 10 studies, with questionnaire, survey data, observation, a model, electronic dosimeters, biological dosimeters, colorimeter and UV colouring labels used in the remaining studies. Methods used to record activities included self-report, parental report, a logbook and observation. Measurement duration and unit of UV exposure varied in most studies, but a method common to 15 studies was measured UV exposure as a percentage of ambient UV. The studies reviewed do not provide sufficient information for the development and evaluation of targeted youth sun protection programs. Studies are required which document precise UV exposure, concurrent activities and sun protection usage for children and adolescents. "
725,20426951,"Monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) is proven to be increasingly valuable for predicting relapse and outcome of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and is used to identify patients' risk groups in several current clinical trials. However, the limitation is that most studies focused on the cut-off value at 10(-4) and the time point after induction. The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive values of different MRD levels detected at different chemotherapy phases in childhood ALL. One hundred and two patients were enrolled in this study from January 2002 to December 2004 in our hospital. All the patients were treated with modified National Protocol of Childhood ALL in China 1997. MRD levels were detected on the 15th day, 29th day, at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after initial chemotherapy. All samples were stained with a panel of four colour combinations of fluorochrome conjugated monoclonal antibodies according to the leukemia-associated immunophenotype (LAIP) defined at diagnosis and analyzed by multi-parametric flow cytometry. CD45CD19CD34CD10, CD45CD19CD34CD20 and CD45CD19CD10CD20 were the most common combinations in B lineage ALL, while CD45CD2CD3CD7 and CD45CD2CD3CD34 were the most frequently used immunophenotypes for T lineage ALL. The median follow-up time was 63.3 months ranged from 40.6 to 87.5 months. Of the 102 patients, 64 were male and 38 were female, with a median age of 5.7 (0.2 - 14.8) years. Eighty-eight cases were diagnosed as B lineage ALL and the remaining 14 were T-ALL. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate and event free survival (EFS) rate for this cohort were (86.9 +/- 3.4)% and (79.9 +/- 4.0)%, respectively. Twelve patients underwent relapse. Among the 102 patients, 14.3% had negative MRD (MRD < 10(-4)) on day 15, 43.9% on day 29, 39.1%, 39.7% and 45.6% had negative MRD at the third, sixth and twelfth month after chemotherapy. Patients who could achieve negative MRD within one year had superior outcome to the others [5-year EFS rates: (92.5 +/- 3.2)% vs. (58.3 +/- 8.6)%, P < 0.001]. The EFS for patients based on MRD levels measured at different stages of therapy were compared by Kaplan-Meier analyses. MRD was predictive of outcome at all 5 time points at a range of thresholds. The optimum threshold, selected for each time point on the basis of log rank analysis, progressively dropped from 10(-2) of day 15 [5-year EFS rates (79.8 +/- 10.3)% vs. (28.6 +/- 17.1)%, P < 0.001], to 10(-3) of day 29 [5-year EFS rates (88.3 +/- 4.9)% vs. (51.3 +/- 14.4)%, P < 0.003], to 10(-4) at 3 [5-year EFS rates (92.4 +/- 5.1)% vs. (65.5 +/- 7.5)%, P < 0.015], 6 [5-year EFS rates (96.3 +/- 3.6)% vs. (65.4 +/- 7.5)%, P < 0.003] and 12 [5-year EFS rates (100.0 +/- 0.0)% vs. (67.7 +/- 8.4)%, P < 0.002] months. And the hazard ratios for relapse and death at higher MRD level groups were 5.91 (95%CI: 1.9 - 18.9), 5.02 (95%CI: 1.5 - 16.5), 5.21 (95%CI: 1.2 - 22.9) and 11.10 (95%CI: 1.5 - 84.5) on day 15, day 29, at month 3 and month 6, respectively. And MRD >or= 10(-2) on day 15 was proven to be an independent predictor by multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression model. Dynamic MRD detection by multi-parametric flow cytometry is highly predictive of outcome for childhood ALL, and the cut-off values at different time points were different. "
726,29360899,"Periorificial dermatitis (POD) has been documented in the pediatric population in patients as young as 3 months, with a slight predominance in girls compared to boys. Many patients have a personal or family history of atopic disorders. Periorificial dermatitis typically presents with erythematous to flesh-colored papules and rarely pustules near the eyes, nose, and mouth. Although the etiology is unknown, many patients have had recent exposure to a topical or less commonly an inhaled or systemic corticosteroid. Although steroids may initially control the skin lesions, disease often rebounds after discontinuing therapy. Diagnosis of POD is clinical. Laboratory tests are not helpful in making the diagnosis, and the histology of POD resembles rosacea. It is important to rule out other acneform diagnoses based on the age of the patient, clinical history, and presentation of the lesions. Topical metronidazole has been successful in the pediatric population. For pediatric patients with extrafacial skin lesions or more severe disease, oral antibiotics such as tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, azithromycin, and erythromycin can be used, depending on the age of the patient.

727,18956135,"We assessed the usefulness of transthoracic Doppler-derived indexes obtained in the proximal pulmonary artery (PA) branch for estimating pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in 45 children with congenital heart disease (CHD) and 23 normal control subjects. The acceleration time, inflection time (InT), deceleration index, and peak velocity, which were measured from the systolic PA flow velocity curve obtained at the sites of the main PA, and right and left PA, were compared with the PVR in patients with CHD. In addition, changes in either Doppler-derived indexes or PVR during 100% oxygen administration were compared in 22 patients showing a baseline PVR >or=4.6 U/m(2) (high PVR). The heart-rate-corrected InT (InTc) values obtained in the left PA in the high PVR group were significantly lower than those in the main PA (4.7 +/- 1.5 vs. 7.5 +/- 3.0; p < 0.001). The InTc obtained from the left PA separated patients with high and low PVR (4.7 +/- 1.4 vs. 9.9 +/- 2.4; p < 0.001) and no significant differences in InTc were found between the low PVR and the control groups. An increase in InTc to >6 during 100% oxygen administration for the high PVR group indicated good PA reactivity with a sensitivity of 93%, specificity of 100%, and agreement of 95% (kappa = 0.83). Moreover, this InTc index correlated inversely with PVR (r = -0.80). In conclusion, our method can noninvasively separate high and low PVR and assess the PA reactivity for high PVR in children with CHD. "
728,27717724,"Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a heterogeneous disease, characterised by hypogammaglobulinaemia leading to recurrent infections and various complications. The aim of this study was to classify CVID patients based on four known classifications (Paris, Freiburg, EUROclass, and B-cell patterns) by measurement of B-cell subsets and to assess the relation of each classification with clinical manifestations. We measured all B-cell subsets as both absolute count and percentage in 30 CVID patients and 30 healthy individuals using four-colour flow cytometry. Moreover, we evaluated antibody responses to pneumococcal vaccine in patients. A significant reduction in percentage of terminal B-cell subsets (total, marginal zone-like, switched memory, IgM-only memory, total memory B-cells and plasmablast) and absolute count of all B-cell subsets along with a strong increase in CD21 Classification of patients could provide useful information to guide clinicians in long-term follow-up of CVID patients. Our data demonstrate that it may be more accurate to use absolute counts of B-cell subpopulations in CVID patients because absolute counts of B-cell subsets are more associated with clinical manifestations compared with their percentage and also four known classifications.

729,9382008,"Feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of transcatheter occlusion of atrial septal defect (ASD) with the buttoned device has been demonstrated. Despite its effectiveness in occluding secundum ASD with left-to-right shunt and patent foramina ovalia, presumably responsible for paradoxic embolism, it has limitations in effectively occluding ASD with evident right-to-left shunts. Therefore, the device was modified so that the square-shaped occluder component of the device is on the right atrial side, the inverted buttoned device. This study determines the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of inverted buttoned device occlusion of atrial defects with right-to-left shunts. During a 17-month period ending August 1996, 12 patients, aged 1.6 to 39.0 years, underwent occlusion of residual ASD after repair of pulmonary atresia/stenosis with intact ventricular septum (n = 5), modified or fenestrated Fontan for tricuspid or pulmonary atresia (n = 5), and double-inlet left ventricle (n = 2). The systemic arterial oxygen saturation increased (p <0.001) from 82 +/- 7% (range 72% to 90%) to 94 +/- 3% (range 88% to 98%). There was no change in heart rate or cardiac index measured by Fick. Right atrial pressure increased by 1 to 4 mm in 5 of 12 patients (42%). There was trivial (n = 5) or no (n = 7) residual shunt by color Doppler study. Six- to 18-month (median 12) follow-up in all 12 patients revealed stable oxygen saturations (92 +/- 3%) by pulse oximetry. Color Doppler studies revealed small (n = 1), trivial (n = 1), or no (n = 10) residual shunt at follow-up. Based on these data, it is concluded that transcatheter occlusion of ASD with right-to-left shunts with inverted buttoned device is feasible in relieving arterial hypoxemia. Further clinical trials in a larger number of patients and careful evaluation of follow-up results are indicated to examine its safety and longer term effectiveness. "
730,15093988,"The natural history of valvular regurgitation detected by echocardiography in Sydenham's chorea has been lacking. Clinical assessment and transthoracic color Doppler echocardiography were independently performed for each patient with an initial attack of Sydenham's chorea and also for each normal control (Khon Kaen University, Thailand; 1991-2001) at the time of their presentations. Serial clinical examinations and echocardiography were done for each patient at 1- and at 5-year follow-up. Of 44 patients, 17 (39%) had carditis (valvulitis) evident by auscultation at the time of the initial attack. Three (11%) of the 27 patients with no clinical evidence of carditis had echocardiographic evidence of acute mitral regurgitation (subclinical valvulitis). All 17 patients with carditis had echocardiographic evidence of acute mitral regurgitation. None of the 88 control children had evidence of pathologically significant valvular regurgitation. Of the 15 patients with carditis regularly followed, the persistence of a mitral regurgitation murmur and of pathologically significant valvular regurgitation by echocardiography were 33% (5/15) and 60% (9/15), respectively, at 1-year follow-up, but the persistence of both was 25% (1/4) at 5-year follow-up. Color Doppler echocardiography is a useful tool in the early diagnosis of rheumatic carditis (valvulitis) and at 1-year follow-up of rheumatic valvular heart disease in the patients with initial Sydenham's chorea but the incremental benefit beyond 5 years after the initial attack might be minimal.

732,21132291,"To describe the characteristic US and MR findings of subcutaneous epidermal inclusion cysts. Seventy-nine patients with subcutaneous epidermal inclusion cysts underwent US (n = 70), MR (n = 7), or both (n = 2). On US, the margin, shape, echogenicity, through-transmission, wall, internal debris and vascularity were evaluated. On MR, the shape, wall, signal intensity, internal debris, and enhancement pattern were evaluated. On US, characteristic findings were well circumscribed (n = 69, 96%), ovoid-shaped (n = 56, 78%), heterogeneously and mildly echogenic (n = 66, 92%), increased through-transmission (n = 66, 92%) and low echoic rim (n = 48, 67%). Internal debris was seen in 31 cases (43%) and often contained linear echogenic reflections (n = 12, 17%), dark clefts (n = 13, 18%), or a mixture (n = 5, 7%). Most masses showed no Doppler flow (n = 70, 97%). On MR, all cases demonstrated a well-demarcated oval-shaped mass with a surrounding rim. On T1-weighted image (WI), the mass showed slightly high T1 signal in 4/9 (44%) and iso-signal in 5/9 (56%). On T2WI, the mass showed high signal in 6/9 (67%), intermediate in 2/9 (22%), and a target appearance in 1/9 (11%). Internal linear dark T2 signal debris was observed in 4/9 (44%). All lesions showed peripheral rim enhancement without central enhancement. On US, subcutaneous epidermal inclusion cysts are usually well-circumscribed, oval-shaped, mildly echogenic masses with occasional linear anechoic and/or echogenic reflections, increased through-transmission, hypoechoic rim and no Doppler flow. On MR, an intermediate to high T2 signal mass with occasional low signal debris and no central enhancement can strengthen the diagnosis. "
733,37202915,"BACKGROUND This case illustrates the challenges in diagnosing linear scleroderma (LS) in a child who presented to a primary care setting. Diagnosis of LS is easily missed due to the lack of prominent symptoms, subtle visible skin changes, and under-recognition of this condition. CASE REPORT A 7-year-old boy presented with a linear, painless, non-itchy rash at the center of his forehead, which has been present for 6 months. The rash extends vertically from the hairline to the bridge of the nose. The color gradually evolved from reddish to purplish-grey and shiny within 3 months. He had underlying eczema, allergic rhinitis, and allergic conjunctivitis since birth. His condition remained unrecognized despite consultations with various medical specialties, including family medicine specialist, ophthalmologist, otorhinolaryngologist, and a general pediatrician. Six months after the onset of his lesion, he was subsequently referred to a pediatric dermatologist and pediatric rheumatologist, who made the diagnosis of LS. Laboratory investigations for autoimmune disease showed that negative antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and inflammatory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), were normal. Skin biopsy provided a tissue confirmation of the diagnosis. MRI of the lesion showed no extension into the underlying muscle or bone erosions. The patient was initially treated with intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone for 3 days, followed by oral methotrexate weekly and prednisolone. The lesion improved after 1 month of treatment, and after 15 months it was less pigmented and less noticeable. CONCLUSIONS LS is the commonest form of localized scleroderma in children. LS on the forehead can erode into the underlying tissues and is sometimes associated with extensive hemifacial atrophy. Treatment should be instituted early to prevent late irreversible fibrotic sequelae. This report aims to highlight the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of an uncommon but potentially disfiguring condition. "
734,33871422,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has exacerbated the longstanding racial/ethnic health disparities in the USA, with a disproportionately negative effect on children of color. This review summarizes recently published studies that describe the clinical epidemiology and racial/ethnic disparities associated with SARS-CoV-2 in children. Children with SARS-CoV-2 infections manifest with a wide spectrum of disease. Most are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic with fever, gastrointestinal, and/or upper respiratory disease. Some children can progress to develop severe lower respiratory disease or a hyper-inflammatory, Kawasaki-like syndrome leading to cardiovascular shock. Although SARS-CoV-2-related deaths in children are rare, more children died within the first nine months of the pandemic than have died during any influenza season over the last decade.Black and Hispanic children represent less than 41% of the US population but account for three out of every four SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalizations and deaths in the USA. The drivers of these disparities in children are complex and likely a combination of societal, biological, and behavioral influences. This pandemic brought to light longstanding health disparities in historically marginalized populations, and minority children have suffered tremendously. It provides an opportunity to understand how a virus hijacked deep-rooted inequities, address these inequities, and work to prevent this outcome in future pandemics/epidemics. "
735,27747454,"Renovascular disease (RVD) is found in about 10 % of secondary childhood hypertension. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is the gold standard to diagnose RVD. Non-invasive imaging methods like Doppler ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and computed tomography angiography (CTA) are increasingly used. Our aim was to evaluate the role and accuracy of US, MRA, and CTA compared to DSA in diagnosing RVD in children. A retrospective review of 127 children with suspected renovascular hypertension was performed in children referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital between 2006 and 2014 due to clinical suspicion of renovascular hypertension and/or findings on US and/or MRA or CTA. Ninety-nine of 127 children (78 %) were diagnosed with renovascular disease and 80 were treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty during the same procedure. The median age at presentation was 5.6 (range, 2.5-10.6) years. Thirty-six children had unilateral renal artery stenosis in major extraparenchymal vessels, 47 bilateral stenosis and 16 intrarenal small vessel disease. US had a sensitivity of 63 % and specificity of 95 %. MRA and CTA were performed in 39 and 34 children, respectively. CTA sensitivity was slightly higher than that of MRA, 88 vs. 80 %, and specificity 81 vs. 63 %. The sensitivity of MRA and CTA is still too low to reliably rule out renovascular disease in children with a strong suspicion of this diagnosis. DSA remains the gold standard to diagnose renovascular hypertension and is recommended when clinical and laboratory criteria are highly suggestive of renovascular disease even with normal radiological investigations from non-invasive methods.

736,27794132,"The purpose of this study was to determine the usefulness of ultrasound elastography in the evaluation of enlarged cervical lymph nodes in comparison with B-mode and color Doppler sonography. A total of 220 lymph nodes in 168 consecutive patients who were referred for sonography of the neck were included in this study. B-mode sonograms were evaluated according to short-axis diameter, long-to-short-axis ratio, hilum, echogenicity, and microcalcification. For color Doppler sonography, 5 different patterns were defined according to vascularity. Elastographic patterns of the lesions were categorized to 5 main types. The mean strain index values were calculated for all lymph nodes. Histopathologic findings, clinical and laboratory data, and imaging findings were used as reference standards for the diagnosis of benign and malignant lymph nodes. Of the 220 lymph nodes, 69.5% were diagnosed as benign, and 30.5% were diagnosed as malignant. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of B-mode sonography were 97.0%, 31.4%, and 51.3%, respectively; the values were 76.1%, 82.4%, and 80.5% for color Doppler sonography and 82.1%, 56.2%, and 64.1% for elastography. The strain index cutoff value for the differentiation of benign and malignant lymph nodes was accepted as 1.7. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the strain index were 71.6%, 76.5%, and 75.0%. Ultrasound elastography adds no additional value to combined B-mode and color Doppler sonography for differentiation of benign and malignant cervical lymph nodes. "
737,12940667,"The present report describes how minor foreign bodies in the pharynx can be detected and extracted with a videoendoscope. A videoendoscope and biopsy forceps were used for the extraction of minute pharyngeal foreign bodies. The patients were examined and treated in a sitting position. The endoscope was inserted through the nasal passage. Ten minute pharyngeal foreign bodies (all fish bones) were extracted by this method. The advantages of this intervention were that 1) the videoendoscope showed clear dynamic color images of the minute foreign body on a color video monitor and provided excellent resolution and recording, and thus, its diagnostic accuracy was high; 2) minute fish bones located in the pharynx, which are hard to examine, could be well documented; 3) accurate and fine interventions could be performed, and all of the foreign bodies could be extracted quickly; 4) foreign bodies as thin as 0.15 mm could be extracted; 5) the diameter of this videoendoscope was relatively small, resulting in less discomfort for patients, even children; and 6) pernasal endoscopy allowed the physician to examine patients who had a strong gag reflex. Extraction of minute pharyngeal foreign bodies with a videoendoscope is a reliable procedure of office-based endoscopy of the pharynx. "
738,27257015,"Anomalous origin of the left main coronary artery from the noncoronary sinus (LCANS) is a rare variant of anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery that is not characterized by an interarterial course. Despite the absence of an interarterial course, there are rare reports of LCANS presenting with sudden death, life-threatening arrhythmia, exercise-induced myocardial ischemia, premature ventricular contractions, and syncope. We report a patient with LCANS presenting with acute myocardial infarction who recovered completely with emergent surgical unroofing of the coronary artery. "
739,15044866,"Myocardial acceleration during isovolumic contraction (IVA) by Doppler tissue imaging has been proposed to be a new index of right ventricular contractile function that is unaffected by ventricular shape or loading conditions. We sought to assess the use of IVA to evaluate right ventricular contractile function. In all, 22 pediatric patients with pulmonary regurgitation (PR) after repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) (8 +/- 3 years) and 27 age-matched children were examined. The degree of PR (mild, moderate, and severe) for patients with TOF was on the basis of pulsed and color Doppler findings. Using Doppler tissue imaging, the peak myocardial velocities during early diastole, late diastole, systole, and isovolumic contraction were recorded. Compared with healthy children, Doppler tissue imaging velocities for patients with TOF showed decreased myocardial velocities during early diastole (P =.007), late diastole (P <.0001), systole (P <.0001), and isovolumic contraction (P <.0001). Patients with TOF had a lower IVA when compared with healthy children (P <.0001). There was a stepwise decrease in the IVA from mild to severe PR. We found a significant relationship between the IVA and the degree of PR (r = -0.86, P <.0001). The analysis of IVA allows the assessment of right ventricular contractile function for patients with repaired TOF and various degrees of PR. "

The CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science data sources were searched. A random effects meta-analysis was conducted. Fourteen studies, involving 3544 participants, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The risk of bias and concern regarding applicability were considered high in four studies. The pooled sensitivity was 0.37 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.40], specificity 0.81 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.83), positive likelihood ratio 2.0 (95% CI 1.61 to 2.50), negative likelihood ratio 0.75 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.86), diagnostic odds ratio 3.03 (95% CI 2.10 to 4.37) and area under the curve 0.72. There is no evidence that renal and bladder ultrasonography should be recommended as a test to predict a vesicoureteral reflux in children with their first urinary tract infection. "
741,11781557,"Recent advances in Doppler and color echocardiographic techniques enable coronary flow dynamics to be estimated even in children. To assess quantitatively left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) volumetric flow and to determine its relation to age and left ventricular (LV) mass, healthy children participated in a study that used high-frequency transthoracic echocardiography. We also studied whether Doppler echocardiography can reliably measure LAD flow in a clinical setting. In 57 healthy children, 2-dimensional echocardiography was used to measure the diameter and cross-sectional area of the LAD and LV mass. LAD peak flow velocity, flow velocity integral, and flow volume were measured by Doppler echocardiography. We then calculated the ratio of LAD cross-sectional area to LV mass and the ratio of LAD flow volume to LV mass. In 12 patients with Kawasaki disease, LAD flow velocity and flow velocity integral were measured by Doppler echocardiography at the time of Doppler guide wire examination. There were significant correlations between echocardiographic and Doppler guide wire methods for flow velocity and flow velocity integral (r = 0.77 and 0.83, P <.01, respectively). The LAD flow velocity decreased significantly with age (r = -0.43, P <.01). The LAD flow volume per minute increased significantly with age (r = 0.55, P <.01). However, LAD flow volume/LV mass ratio in younger infants was high and decreased significantly with age (r = -0.66, P <.01). This study shows that LAD flow patterns can be reliably assessed by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography in the majority of pediatric subjects. In the current study, the LAD flow velocity and the ratio of LAD flow volume to LV mass in infants was high and decreased with age, suggesting high myocardial perfusion. High LAD peak velocity in infants may be related with high resting coronary flow. Age-related changes in the LAD flow characteristics must be taken into consideration in the study of the coronary circulation in children. "
742,10928398,"To describe a pediatric patient who developed a clinical cyanotic appearance after receiving an excessive amount of blue food coloring. An 11-year-old white girl with cerebral palsy was admitted for unresolving aspiration pneumonia and dehydration. Antibiotics and intravenous fluids were administered. During the hospital course, enteral nutrition containing blue food coloring was also administered. Twelve hours after the start of enteral nutrition, the patient appeared cyanotic despite a regular respiratory rate and normal oxygen saturation. The pediatric code response team was called. Enteral nutrition was stopped and then restarted without blue food coloring. Over the next 24 hours, the cyanotic appearance resolved and no further complications developed. At our institution, blue food coloring is used with enteral nutrition for detecting aspiration of stomach contents. The dietary department supplies food coloring to each nursing unit in pint-sized medicine bottles. Nurses place an unstandardized amount of blue food coloring into each enteral nutrition bag. This child received an unspecified amount of FD&C Blue No. 1 food coloring. No toxicity studies exist for acute or human ingestion, but the National Academy of Sciences lists 363 mg/d of FD&C Blue No. 1 as a safe level for humans. We estimated this child ingested 780-3,940 mg of dye over a 12-hour period. This is the first known report of an adverse effect from blue food coloring. To prevent similar occurrences within our institution, the blue food coloring for tube feedings will be dispensed by the pharmacy department in standardized units. "
743,26771400,"Little is known about the prevalence of refractive error, binocular vision, and other visual conditions in Australian Indigenous children. This is important given the association of these visual conditions with reduced reading performance in the wider population, which may also contribute to the suboptimal reading performance reported in this population. The aim of this study was to develop a visual profile of Queensland Indigenous children. Vision testing was performed on 595 primary schoolchildren in Queensland, Australia. Vision parameters measured included visual acuity, refractive error, color vision, nearpoint of convergence, horizontal heterophoria, fusional vergence range, accommodative facility, AC/A ratio, visual motor integration, and rapid automatized naming. Near heterophoria, nearpoint of convergence, and near fusional vergence range were used to classify convergence insufficiency (CI). Although refractive error (Indigenous, 10%; non-Indigenous, 16%; p = 0.04) and strabismus (Indigenous, 0%; non-Indigenous, 3%; p = 0.03) were significantly less common in Indigenous children, CI was twice as prevalent (Indigenous, 10%; non-Indigenous, 5%; p = 0.04). Reduced visual information processing skills were more common in Indigenous children (reduced visual motor integration [Indigenous, 28%; non-Indigenous, 16%; p < 0.01] and slower rapid automatized naming [Indigenous, 67%; non-Indigenous, 59%; p = 0.04]). The prevalence of visual impairment (reduced visual acuity) and color vision deficiency was similar between groups. Indigenous children have less refractive error and strabismus than their non-Indigenous peers. However, CI and reduced visual information processing skills were more common in this group. Given that vision screenings primarily target visual acuity assessment and strabismus detection, this is an important finding as many Indigenous children with CI and reduced visual information processing may be missed. Emphasis should be placed on identifying children with CI and reduced visual information processing given the potential effect of these conditions on school performance. "
744,33651019,"The study sought to determine whether extended forehead flap by using part of the scalp combined with laser hair removal is a practical approach when repairing distal nasal defect. A retrospective study was conducted with 6 patients who underwent reconstruction of nasal defects with extended forehead flaps (including scalp combined with subsequent laser hair removal) at Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital between June 2016 and December 2018. Surgical data collected included age, causes of defects, sizes of defects, invaded nasal subunits, implantation of tissue expander, time elapsed between the formation of defects and surgical treatments, sessions of laser hair removal, and follow-up results. All patients had nasal defects after removal of a benign nevus (diameter, >1.5 cm), which invaded distal nasal subunits (including the nasal tip, soft triangle, columella, and nasal ala) and could not be repaired using adjacent tissue. Preoperative and postoperative assessments of esthetic outcomes were analyzed, including skin color and texture match, appearance deformity, and scar appearance. All 6 female patients (ages 4 to 24 years) accepted the extended forehead flap technique and subsequent laser hair removal treatments. Among the 6 patients, 2 had nasal tip defects, 1 had a columella nasi defect, one had an alar defect, and 2 had multiunit defects. All transferred forehead flaps survived with no necrosis and underwent 2 to 5 subsequent laser hair removal treatments. The color and texture of the transferred flaps was similar to the adjacent skin in all patients. All patients were satisfied with the final outcome of the reconstructed nose with no obvious scarring during follow-up. Extending the forehead flap using the scalp is a practical and safe approach for the repair of large and distal nasal defects. Subsequent laser hair removal can eliminate the hair follicles of the scalp and improve the appearance and color of the flap. "
745,9860071,"To describe the recent epidemic of photosensitive seizure that occurred in relation to an episode of the television animation program ""Pocket Monsters,"" we report four patients who experienced seizures while watching the episode in question. We also report some technical aspects of the program episode. We investigated the clinical symptoms of the four patients and performed routine EEGs with intermittent photic stimulation (IPS). If IPS provoked no photoparoxysmal response (PPR) during the routine EEG examination, a second EEG was performed with the photic stimulator placed 10 cm from the patient's eyes. In addition, we reviewed the ""Pocket Monsters"" episode, focusing our attention on the visual techniques used with reference to the Independent Television Commission (ITC) guidelines. One patient who had myoclonic jerks before the convulsion in question was diagnosed as having juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and the diagnosis of another patient was pure photosensitive epilepsy. The remaining two patients had their first seizures, which could be occasional seizures, and we therefore could not reach a diagnosis of epilepsy. In our four patients, only one showed PPR on the routine EEG. Two patients revealed PPR on the second EEG, and the remaining patient showed no PPR. Rapid changes in color are believed to be responsible for the photosensitive seizures because all four patients had seizures at around 18:50, when seconds of deep red and bright blue flashes, alternating at a frequency of 12 Hz, were shown. Regulations for technical aspects of children's programming, including the use of colors, are urgently needed in Japan to prevent a repeated incident. In addition, the IPS procedure needs to be standardized, especially for patients who are suspected to have photosensitivity. "

747,25716758,"Management of full-thickness facial burns remains one of the greatest challenges. Controversy exists among surgeons regarding the use of early excision for facial burns. Unfortunately, delayed excision of deeper burns often results in more scarring and subsequent reconstruction becomes more difficult. A collagen-elastin matrix is used to improve the quality of the reconstructed skin, to reduce scarring and to prevent wound contraction. It serves as a foundation for split thickness skin graft and enhances short and long-term results. We report the usage of a collagen-elastin matrix during single-step wound closure technique of severe full-thickness facial burns in 15 children with large burned body surface area, and also we review the literature about pediatric facial burns. There were 15 pediatric patients with severe facial burns, 8 girls and 7 boys ranging in age from 10 months to 12 years, mean age 7 years and 6 months old. The facial burn surface area (FBSA) among the patients includes seven patients with 100%, five with 75%, and three with 50%. The average total body surface area (TBSA) for the patients was 72%, ranging between 50 and 90%. 5 of the patients' admissions were late, more than four days after burns while the rest of the patients were admitted within the first four days (acute admission time). The burns were caused by flame in eight of the patients, bomb blast in four, and scalding in three. All patients were treated by the simultaneous application of the collagen-elastin matrix and an unmeshed split thickness skin graft at Turgut Özal Medical Center, Pediatric Burn Center, Malatya, Turkey. After the treatment only two patients needed a second operation for revision of the grafts. All grafts transplanted to the face survived. The average Vancouver scar scales (VSS) were 2.55±1.42, ranging between one and six, in the first 10 of 15 patients at the end of 6 months postoperatively. VSS measurements of the last 5 patients were not taken since the 6 months postoperative period was not over. In regard to early results, graft quality was close to normal skin in terms of vascularity, elasticity, pliability, texture and color. Esthetic and functional results have been encouraging. This study shows us that the collagen-elastin matrix as a dermal substitute is a useful adjunct, which may result in quick healing with satisfying esthetic and functional results. It also may enhance short and long-term results in after burn facial wound closure in children. "
748,19755398,"Dolichoarteriopathies consist of tortuosity, kinking, or coiling of the extracranial carotid arteries. Some authors consider these alterations a consequence of atherosclerotic vessel remodeling, while others ascribe them to anatomical variations of embryological origin. The objective was to establish whether carotid dolichoarteriopathies belonged to a congenital origin or to acquired conditions. Color Doppler ultrasonography of neck vessels was performed in 885 participants, whose age ranged from 1-day-old infants to 90-year-old adults. Prevalence of kinking and coiling was evaluated, and it was related to the presence of cardiovascular risk factors. Prevalence of either kinking or coil of carotid arteries showed no increase with age, as it was comparable across all ages; furthermore, frequency of these alterations showed no relationship to cardiovascular risk factors nor to the presence of atheromatous plaques. These findings suggest that carotid dolichoarteriopathies are a result of alterations in embryological development rather than vascular remodeling secondary to aging and/or atherosclerosis. "
749,9514332,"The plantar skin is considered suitable for skin grafting onto the volar aspect of the digits and hand. However, this method is not widely used because it is associated with problems at the donor site. To solve these problems, a new method was developed in which two different layers of the plantar skin are harvested from the same site. In this method, a split-thickness skin graft of the upper layer including the corneal layer of epidermis and a dermal graft of the lower layer are harvested from the same plantar skin. The split-thickness skin graft is returned to the original donor site, whereas the dermal graft is used for the palmar skin defects on the digits and hand. To prevent drying, the dermal graft was covered with a wound-covering material to achieve good graft takes. Reconstruction was performed for 17 patients using this method, involving digit-only reconstruction in 8 patients, and wider reconstruction in the other 9. Excellent color and texture match of the graft and donor sites were obtained with no noticeable marginal scarring, and the durability of the skin was satisfactory. This method was useful for skin grafting to the digits and palms with minimal sacrifice to the donor site. "
750,38244968,"Exposure to air pollution during childhood has been linked with adverse effects on cognitive development and motor function. However, limited research has been done on the associations of air pollution exposure in different microenvironments such as home, school, or while commuting with these outcomes. To analyze the association between childhood air pollution exposure in different microenvironments and cognitive and fine motor function from six European birth cohorts. We included 1301 children from six European birth cohorts aged 6-11 years from the HELIX project. Average outdoor air pollutants concentrations (NO In pooled analysis we observed high correlation (rs = 0.9) between air pollution exposures levels at home and school. However, the cohort-by-cohort analysis revealed correlations ranging from low to moderate. Air pollution exposure levels while commuting were higher than at home or school. Exposure to air pollution in the different microenvironments was not associated with working memory, attentional function, non-verbal intelligence, and fine motor function. Results remained consistently null in random-effects meta-analysis. No association was observed between outdoor air pollution exposure in different microenvironments (home, school, commute) and cognitive and fine motor function in children from six European birth cohorts. Future research should include a more detailed exposure assessment, considering personal measurements and time spent in different microenvironments. "
751,37739628,"This article explores how race, sex, and gender are better thought of as a continuum rather than binary categories. Starting with a discussion of intersectionality, we examine the importance of ethnic-racial identity and explore unique cultural considerations for working with Black, Latinx, and AAPI transgender and nonbinary youth. We then examine intersex youth and variations of sex development, as well as specific challenges they face. Finally, we explore nonbinary gender identities and the importance of individually tailoring affirming interventions. For all sections, we highlight the strengths and resilience of the youth and offer clinical recommendations for child and adolescent providers. "
752,33497062,"Exposure to surgery and anesthesia in early childhood has been found to be associated with an increased risk of behavioral deficits. While the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned against prenatal exposure to anesthetic drugs, little clinical evidence exists to support this recommendation. This study evaluates the association between prenatal exposure to general anesthesia due to maternal procedures during pregnancy and neuropsychological and behavioral outcome scores at age 10. This is an observational cohort study of children born in Perth, Western Australia, with 2 generations of participants contributing data to the Raine Study. In the Raine Study, the first generation (Gen1) are mothers enrolled during pregnancy, and the second generation (Gen2) are the children born to these mothers from 1989 to 1992 with neuropsychological and behavioral tests at age 10 (n=2024). In the primary analysis, 6 neuropsychological and behavioral tests were evaluated at age 10: Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices (CPM), McCarron Assessment of Neuromuscular Development (MAND), Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), Symbol Digit Modality Test (SDMT) with written and oral scores, Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF) with Expressive, Receptive, and Total language scores, and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) with Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total behavior scores. Outcome scores of children prenatally exposed to general anesthesia were compared to children without prenatal exposure using multivariable linear regression models adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates (sex, race, income, and maternal education, alcohol or tobacco use, and clinical diagnoses: diabetes, epilepsy, hypertension, psychiatric disorders, or thyroid dysfunction). Bonferroni adjustment was used for the 6 independent tests in the primary analysis, so a corrected P value <.0083 (P = .05 divided by 6 tests, or a 99.17% confidence interval [CI]) was required for statistical significance. Among 2024 children with available outcome scores, 22 (1.1%) were prenatally exposed to general anesthesia. Prenatally exposed children had higher CBCL Externalizing behavioral scores (score difference of 6.1 [99.17% CI, 0.2-12.0]; P = .006) than unexposed children. Of 6 tests including 11 scores and subscores, only CBCL Externalizing behavioral scores remained significant after multiple comparisons adjustment with no significant differences found in any other score. Prenatal exposure to general anesthetics is associated with increased externalizing behavioral problems in childhood. However, given the limitations of this study and that avoiding necessary surgery during pregnancy can have significant detrimental effects on the mother and the child, further studies are needed before changes to clinical practice are made.

753,32475824,"Alagille syndrome (AGS) is a multisystem disorder classically involving liver and heart failure, characteristic vertebral and facial features and ocular abnormalities. AGS is caused by heterozygous mutations in JAG1 or NOTCH2, with variable phenotype penetrance. We report two cases of AGS in children with tooth defects characterised by green discolouration and hypomineralisation. The role of hyperbilirubinaemia (HB) in this atypical colour, a classical feature of AGS, has been well described. However, it does not totally explain the dental phenotype. As JAG1 and NOTCH2 mutations can affect bone development and considering common physiological pathways between bone and tooth mineralisation, both mutations could participate in this unusual dental phenotype. The role of HB and genetics in the development of the dental phenotype of AGS is discussed in two prototypical cases. Future research should focus on the underlying genetic component of tooth abnormalities. "
754,9464435,"A diagnostic tool to detect early renal dysfunction before it becomes irreversible would be useful in cirrhosis. This study was carried out to evaluate the role of Doppler sonography and Tc-99m DTPA renography in the detection of early renal dysfunction in patients with different grades of liver cirrhosis. Renal arteries of 43 patients with cirrhosis and normal renal function tests were compared with 15 age and gender matched normal subjects as a control group using colour Doppler sonography and Tc-99m DTPA scintigraphy. The patients were categorized into three groups, A (14), B (14) and C (15), according to a modified Child's classification that assesses the severity of liver cirrhosis. Doppler results revealed a highly significant increase in both the pulsatility and resistive indices in groups B and C compared with either group A patients or control subjects and in group C compared with group B (P < 0.001) in the main renal arteries as well as in the interlobar and arcuate arteries. Insignificant differences were observed between group A and controls (PI: control 0.96+/-0.08, group A 0.95+/-0.07, group B 1.26+/-0.06, group C 1.48+/-0.06; RI: control 0.57+/-0.02, group A 0.58+/-0.02, group B 0.66+/-0.01, group C 0.72+/-0.02). Abnormal renograms in the form of delayed appearance (34+/-14.6 s), diminished blood flow bilaterally with prolonged secretory (12+/-4.5 min) and excretory phases (> 30 min) and poor response to intravenous frusemide were only observed in group C patients. Radionuclide computed glomerular filtration rate was within the normal range in patients of group A (81+/-9.5 ml/min) and group B (78+/-8.4 ml/min) and reduced only in patients of group C (34+/-14.5 ml/min). Thus Doppler sonography can detect an increase in renal vascular resistance in patients with moderately severe cirrhosis (Child grade B) when renography was normal. We conclude that Doppler sonography can be used for earlier identification of cirrhotic patients with a higher risk of impending renal failure earlier than renography and may also be used to guide therapeutic approaches.

755,22483330,"This study was aimed to illustrate the significance of minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment on day 22 in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. MRD were measured on day 22, day 36, week 12, month 6 and month 12 by four-color flow cytometry. The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was significantly different for patients with MRD levels of <0.01%, 0.01-0.1%, 0.1-1.0% and ≥ 1.0% on day 22: 6.9 ± 2.6%, 16.7 ± 5.5%, 25.8 ± 6.2% and 58.4 ± 13.4% (P < 0.001). MRD on day 22 was more powerful than other parameters including NCI risk. However, other time points after induction, although predictive as well, were not accurate enough due to false positivity. "

A seven-year-old male child from poor socioeconomic status was admitted with chief complaints of fever, 3 episodes of vomiting and passage of cola coloured urine. Based on clinical and laboratory findings, diagnosis was established. However, ADAMTS13 levels and genetic studies required for diagnosis could not be performed due to financial constraints and non-availability of these tests. TPE kits were arranged from charitable organizations. Six TPE procedures were performed using Cobe Spectra cell separator. Central venous catheter was placed in femoral vein. TPE kit was primed with compatible packed red blood cells before each procedure. Patient was non-cooperative and irritable in first three procedures and was sedated. A total of 1300ml plasma was exchanged in each procedure with group specific fresh frozen plasma. After second TPE procedure, patient started improving with decrease in plasma discoloration and periorbital edema. Renal function tests along with hematological parameters became normal after 6th TPE procedure. Patient was discharged in a stable condition. On follow up, C3 levels were normal with adequate platelet count and normal renal functions suggesting complete remission. "

Children between the ages of 6 and 18 years who experienced ear pain (otalgia) and who were diagnosed with eardrum problems associated with AOM were randomly assigned to be treated with Otikon or Anaesthetic ear drops, which were instilled into the external canal(s) of the affected ear(s). Ear pain was assessed using 2 visual analog scales: a linear scale and a color scale. Pain assessment took place throughout the course of 3 days. The mean score of pain reduction was used to measure outcome. Primary pediatric community ambulatory centers. One hundred three children aged 6 to 18 years who were diagnosed with otalgia associated with AOM. Each of the 2 treatment groups were comparable on the basis of age, sex, laterality of AOM, and the effectiveness of ameliorating symptoms of otalgia. The 2 groups were also comparable to each other in the initial ear pain score and in the scores at each application of Otikon or Anaesthetic drops. There was a statistically significant improvement in ear pain score throughout the course of the study period (P =.007). Otikon, an ear drop formulation of naturopathic origin, is as effective as Anaesthetic ear drops and was proven appropriate for the management of AOM-associated ear pain. "
759,19012232,"The study was performed to assess the benefit of gradual traction for the management of abdominal testis by lengthening instead of dividing the testicular vessels. After approval by the ethical committee of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Alexandria, and after parents signed a detailed informed consent, ten children with unilateral intra-abdominal testis were operated upon laparoscopically. The gubernaculum and the lower pole of the testis were attached with a 2/0 Prolene stitch which exited above the contralateral anterior superior spine. Gradual traction on the tension stitch was achieved over 14 days. A laparoscopy was performed after 14 days to check the new position of the testis and to locate the testis intrascrotally. Follow-up was done after 6-12 months to check the position and size of the testis, and color Doppler was performed to check the vascularity. Ages ranged between 1 and 5 years (mean 2.3 yrs). Three testes were right-sided and 7 left-sided. In one case slipping of the traction suture occurred and the patient had conversion to a conventional Fowler-Stephens technique. Nine cases showed adequate elongation after traction and were successfully positioned in the scrotum. Follow-up was 6-12 months (mean 8.7 months). On follow-up, 9 testes were found intrascrotally with a normal size and consistency. Doppler study showed normal vascularity, both venous and arterial. This preliminary study showed that the technique of gradual controlled traction on the testicular vessels is very promising to achieve elongation and medialization of the testicular vessels instead of division. The measurable elongation allowed intrascrotal placement of the testis without tension. The technique cannot yet be recommended for routine use. Further comparative studies with a larger patient series are mandatory before the technique can be generally recommended. "
760,24394952,"This study had two purposes. The first was to develop a method to measure horizontal gaze tracking errors (based on synchronized eye and head tracking recordings) as subjects viewed many pitched balls. The second was to assess horizontal eye, head, and gaze tracking strategies of a group of Division 1 college baseball players. Subjects viewed, but did not swing a bat at, tennis balls projected by a pneumatic pitching machine. Subjects were to call out numbers and the color of these numbers (black or red) on the balls. The trajectory of each pitch was very predictable. Eye and head movements were monitored with a video eye tracker and an inertial sensor, respectively, and these movements were synchronized with ball position using an analog recording device. Data were analyzed for 15 subjects. Eye rotation, head rotation, gaze errors (GEs), and unsigned gaze errors (UGEs) were calculated at various elapsed times. On average, subjects tracked the pitched ball with the head throughout the pitch trajectory, while the eye was moved very little until late in the pitch trajectory. On average, gaze position matched the target position throughout the pitch trajectory. There was some variability in the mean amplitudes of head and eye movement between subjects. However, the eye and head were related by a common rule (partial rotational vestibulo-ocular reflex suppression) for all subjects. Although the mean amplitudes of the GE and UGE varied between subjects, these means were not consistent with anticipatory saccades for any subject. On average, Division 1 college players tracked the pitched ball primarily with the head and maintained gaze close to the ball throughout much of the pitch trajectory. There was variability between subjects regarding the head and eye movement amplitudes and GEs, but, overall, all subjects maintained gaze close to the ball throughout the pitch trajectory despite the fact that these individuals were not batting.

761,2627421,"Literature reports of good correlation between two-dimensional color Doppler and ventriculography for estimation of the severity of atrioventricular valve regurgitation have appeared. Local experience has been variable. The purpose of this study was to evaluate three factors for their effect on two-dimensional color Doppler display of the apparent area of regurgitant flow. The factors studied were instrument gain setting, pulse repetition frequency (PRF), and carrier frequency. Sixteen regurgitant valves were examined with high quality commercial instrumentation from two manufacturers. Electrocardiographic-triggered image gating was used for recording and planimetry of maximal imaged flow area (IFA). Examinations were performed at two gain settings with constant carrier frequency and PRF, at three carrier frequencies (2.5, 3.5, and 5 MHz) at constant gain, and at differing PRF (3.0 to 12 kHz). Reduction in gain setting made little difference in asthetic quality of regurgitant jets, but their areas decreased by 29%. Carrier frequency was found to greatly affect IFA, with each higher carrier frequency giving significantly smaller IFAs. PRF also affected IFA consistently, with progressively smaller IFAs at each higher PRF. There was no useful correlation between IFA of a single jet evaluated on the two instruments at generally similar settings. It is concluded that instrument gain setting, PRF, and carrier frequency each significantly affects the size of IFA within a single instrument and between different instruments. Given the variety of instruments and settings employed within the cardiology community, it is unlikely that even moderately accurate grading of severity of regurgitation based on IFA can be done unless instrument settings are specified and standardized. There is a clear need for annotation of instrument settings during color Doppler examinations and a need for concensus regarding ""optimal"" settings. Finally, the consistency of reduction in IFA with increasing carrier frequency and PRF within each of the instruments tested suggests investigation of ""normalization"" of IFA displays. "
762,32919901,"Based on our previous qualitative work, we created a web-based decision aid (DA) prototype to facilitate shared decision-making regarding hypospadias. The objective of this study was to obtain rapid feedback on the prototype as part of an iterative, human-centered design process. We conducted this study at a statewide, pediatric educational conference in May 2019, recruiting attendees by verbal/written announcements. The DA consisted of: hypospadias overview and surgery ""storyboard,"" frequently asked questions, parent testimonials, and a values clarification exercise. Participants viewed the DA on a tablet as they participated in semi-structured, qualitative interviews covering website acceptability, usability, and preference for surgical photographs versus illustrations. Three coders used qualitative content analysis to identify themes and resolved disagreements by consensus. Of 295 conference attendees, all 50 who approached us agreed to participate. Responses from 49 participants were available for analysis: 67% female, ages 20-69, 65% Caucasian, 55% MDs. 96% of participants thought the website design matched its purpose; 59.1% preferred surgical illustrations, 8.2% preferred photos, 30.6% preferred both and 2.0% did not like either. Participants recommended improvements in: a) usability/accessibility (e.g. site navigation, visual layout, page length), b) content coverage (e.g. epidemiology, consequences of no/delayed surgery, lifelong risks), c) parent-centeredness (e.g. reading level/writing style) and d) implementation (provider tools, printable handouts). The Extended Summary Figure shows a revised image of the first step of a hypospadias repair based on feedback about participants' preferences for illustrations rather than photographs. The main strength of our study was the valuable feedback we obtained to inform critical revisions of the DA prototype. We also demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of a conducting a usability evaluation of a web-based DA in a medical conference setting. One limitation of this study is that the relatively small population sampled limits generalizability and our findings may not reflect the views of all providers who care for hypospadias patients. The vast majority of providers thought that the design of the Hypospadias Homepage matched its purpose and most preferred surgical illustrations rather than photos to demonstrate the steps of hypospadias surgery. Based on their feedback, we plan to focus our efforts in the following areas: 1) improvement of navigation/menus, 2) reduction in the amount of text per page, 3) expansion of specific content coverage and 4) inclusion of ""parent-friendly"" visuals such as infographics to represent quantitative data and colorful illustrations to depict hypospadias and its surgical repair.

This work is analogous to that of a city engineer surveying traffic to understand flow patterns, efficiency, congestion, and even the influence of city-wide conditions (eg, snowfall). Yet, the engineer further considers a factor long neglected in human neuroscience-the roads. Functional connectivity does not take place across the intercellular ether, but across a nexus of millions of interconnected axonal pathways or white matter (WM), so named for the color given by the fatty myelin surrounding the axons. Insight into the role of these tracts in the pathology of psychiatric illness continues to be limited, in contrast to the functional connectivity they support. WM tracts are among the last components of the brain to reach maturity, and their malleability in youth may play a key role in the manifestation of psychopathology in children. An emerging body of research suggests that pediatric psychopathology may be caused in part by WM alterations at both the global and the regional levels. "
766,38237634,"The CME review presented here is intended to explain the significance of pleural sonography to the interested reader and to provide information on its application. At the beginning of sonography in the 80 s of the 20th centuries, with the possible resolution of the devices at that time, the pleura could only be perceived as a white line. Due to the high impedance differences, the pleura can be delineated particularly well. With the increasing high-resolution devices of more than 10 MHz, even a normal pleura with a thickness of 0.2 mm can be assessed. This article explains the special features of the examination technique with knowledge of the pre-test probability and describes the indications for pleural sonography. Pleural sonography has a high value in emergency and intensive care medicine, preclinical, outpatient and inpatient, in the general practitioner as well as in the specialist practice of pneumologists. The special features in childhood (pediatrics) as well as in geriatrics are presented. The recognition of a pneumothorax even in difficult situations as well as the assessment of pleural effusion are explained. With the high-resolution technology, both the pleura itself and small subpleural consolidations can be assessed and used diagnostically. Both the direct and indirect sonographic signs and accompanying symptoms are described, and the concrete clinical significance of sonography is presented. The significance and criteria of conventional brightness-encoded B-scan, colour Doppler sonography (CDS) with or without spectral analysis of the Doppler signal (SDS) and contrast medium ultrasound (CEUS) are outlined. Elastography and ultrasound-guided interventions are also mentioned. A related further paper deals with the diseases of the lung parenchyma and another paper with the diseases of the thoracic wall, diaphragm and mediastinum. Die hier präsentierte CME-Übersichtsarbeit erläutert die Aussagekraft der Pleurasonografie und gibt Hinweise zu deren Anwendung. Aufgrund der Impedanz-Unterschiede kann die Pleuralinie gut abgegrenzt werden. Mit hochauflösenden Geräten kann auch eine normale Pleura mit einer Dicke von 0,2 mm beurteilt werden. In diesem Artikel werden die Besonderheiten der Untersuchungstechnik mit der Kenntnis der Vortestwahrscheinlichkeit erläutert und die Indikationen der Pleurasonografie beschrieben. Die Pleurasonografie hat einen hohen Stellenwert: sowohl in der Notfall- und Intensivmedizin, präklinisch, ambulant und stationär, in der Hausarzt- wie auch in der Spezialarzt-Praxis der Pneumologen. Dargestellt werden die Besonderheiten in der Kindheit (Pädiatrie), wie auch in der Geriatrie. Das Erkennen eines Pneumothorax, auch in schwierigen Situationen, wie auch die Beurteilung des Pleuraergusses werden erläutert. Aufgrund der heutigen hochauflösenden Technik können sowohl die Pleura selbst wie auch kleine subpleurale Veränderungen beurteilt und diagnostisch verwertet werden. Sowohl die direkten wie auch indirekten sonografischen Zeichen und Begleiterscheinungen werden beschrieben und es wird der konkrete klinische Stellenwert der Sonografie dargestellt. Dargelegt werden zudem die Bedeutung und die Kriterien des konventionellen helligkeitskodierten B-Bildes, der Farbdoppler-Sonografie (CDS), mit oder ohne Spektralanalyse des Dopplersignals (SDS), sowie des Kontrastmittel-Ultraschalls (CEUS). Auch die Elastografie und ultraschallgestützte Interventionen sollen Erwähnung finden. Eine zugehörige weitere Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit den Erkrankungen des Lungenparenchyms und eine weitere Arbeit mit den Erkrankungen der Thoraxwand, des Zwerchfells und des Mediastinums. "
767,15194534,"The t(5;14)(q35;q32) is a novel cryptic translocation in pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), involving HOX11L2 or CSX on 5q35. The 14q32 breakpoints are heterogeneous. Because the t(5;14)(q35;q32) is hard to detect using conventional karyotyping, it is easily missed in routine diagnostics. Here we describe the development and application of split signal fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays for both HOX11L2 and CSX, for detection of t(5;14) possibly present in T-ALL patients. We developed and validated two split signal FISH assays for metaphase and interphase detection of t(5;14) in T-ALL patients. We also investigated the involvement of IGH on 14q32. In addition, HOX11L2 and SIL-TAL1 expression was studied using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The FISH assays were validated on cell lines and T-ALL patients. We did not identify cases with a t(5;14)(q35;q32) involving CSX, but we did identify 5 cases of t(5;14) involving HOX11L2 out of 32 T-ALL cases studied; in each case the 14q32 breakpoint was found to be centromeric to the IGH region. All 5 positive cases showed HOX11L2 expression, as did 1 case without t(5;14)(q35;q32). Cases with t(5;14)(q35;q32) involving HOX11L2 did not show TAL1 abnormalities, whereas 5 HOX11L2 negative cases did. Using the newly developed and validated FISH probe sets, we identified 5 new cases of t(5;14) involving HOX11L2 both on metaphases and interphases. The incidence of the t(5;14)(q35;q32) involving CSX is probably low. RT-PCR results suggest that TAL1 and HOX11L2 expression, or TAL1 aberrations and the t(5;14)(q35;q32) involving HOX11L2 are mutually exclusive. "
768,9493230,"The contribution of the Imaging modalities to the diagnostic work-up of urologic pathology in the pediatric age has been greatly affected, in the last twenty years, by the development of new diagnostic means, notably sonography. This has lead to a true revolution in the study of the small patient, aimed at reducing as much as possible the radiation exposure. The further evolution of nuclear medicine exams has allowed a great gain in the functional evaluation of the urinary system; the more recent development of color doppler sonography as well as of the more sophisticated power doppler is opening new horizons in this area. On the contrary, the resort to multiplanar Imaging modalities (CT, MRI) plays a limited role in pediatric urology, being confined to very special and complex cases. "
769,19237787,"Data on eye diseases among school children is not readily available. Considering the fact that one-third of India's blind lose their eyesight before the age of 20 years and many of them are under five when they become blind, early detection and treatment of ocular morbidity among children is important. To estimate the prevalence of ocular morbidity among school children of age 6-16 years. Government and private coeducational schools in urban area of Shimla. Cross-sectional. Government and private coeducational schools selected by stratified random sampling. About 1561 school children, studying in elementary through secondary class in these schools were examined from August 2001 to January 2002 in Shimla. A doctor did visual acuity and detailed ophthalmic examination. The Chi-square test was used to test differences in proportions. Differences were considered to be statistically significant at the 5% level. Prevalence of ocular morbidity was 31.6% (CI=29.9-32.1%), refractive errors 22% (CI=21.1-22.8%), squint 2.5% (CI=2.4-2.6%), color blindness 2.3% (CI=2.2-2.4%), vitamin A deficiency 1.8 % (CI=1.7-1.9%), conjunctivitis 0.8% (CI=0.79-0.81%). Overall prevalence of ocular morbidity in government and private schools did not show any statistical significant difference. Prevalence of conjunctivitis was significantly (P< 0.5) more in government schools. A high prevalence of ocular morbidity among high-school children was observed. Refractive errors were the most common ocular disorders. "

The results indicate that this technique is useful for acceptance as one of the examinations to evaluation of lymphedema. "
771,25992287,"Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) was recently endorsed and recommended for screening for acute malnutrition in the community. The objective of this study was to determine whether a colour-banded MUAC strap would allow minimally trained mothers to screen their own children for malnutrition, without locating the mid-point of the left upper arm by measurement, as currently recommended. A non-randomised non-blinded evaluation of mothers' performance when measuring MUAC after minimal training, compared with trained Community Health Workers (CHW) following current MUAC protocols. The study was conducted in 2 villages in Mirriah, Zinder region, Niger where mothers classified one of their children (n = 103) aged 6-59 months (the current age range for admission into community malnutrition programs) using the MUAC tape. Mothers' had a sensitivity and specificity for classification of their child's nutritional status of > 90% and > 80% respectively for global acute malnutrition (GAM, defined by a MUAC < 125 mm) and > 73% and > 98% for severe acute malnutrition (SAM, defined by a MUAC < 115 mm). The few children misclassified as not having SAM, were classified as having moderate acute malnutrition (MAM). The choice of arm did not influence the classification results; weighted Kappa of 0.88 for mothers and 0.91 for CHW represent almost perfect agreement. Errors occurred at the class boundaries and no gross errors were made. Advanced SAM is associated with severe complications, which often require hospital admission or cause death. Mothers (with MUAC tapes costing $0.06) can screen their children frequently allowing early diagnosis and treatment thereby becoming the focal point in scaling-up community management of acute malnutrition. The trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov (Trial number NCT01790815). "
772,27695660,"This paper considers the ethical, legal, and social issues raised by the prospect of increasing use of psychiatric genetic data in child custody litigation. Although genetic tests cannot currently confirm a parent or child's psychiatric diagnosis, it is likely that as relevant findings emerge, they will be introduced in family courts to challenge parental capacity. Here, we draw on three projected, but plausible, scenarios for obtaining psychiatric data about parents -- imposed genetic testing, access to medical records, and genetic theft -- then consider the use of psychiatric genetic data of children, to highlight the issues that judges, child custody evaluators, and clinicians who may provide treatment for parents or children with mental health issues will need to consider. These include: genetic privacy, stigma, genetic surveillance, and judicial and health professionals' bias. We argue that the unchecked introduction of psychiatric genetic data may have a detrimental effect on the administration of justice. In particular, the article highlights the risk that the (mis)use of psychiatric genetic data in custody disputes would 1) exacerbate stigma and treatment-avoidance among parents and incentivize privacy violations to pressure parents to relinquish parental rights; 2) disproportionately affect poor parents and single mothers of color involved with Child Protective Services; and 3) detract attention from social and environmental factors impacting mental health to the detriment of the families involved. Awareness of these issues and an understanding of the meaning of genomic data by judges and custody evaluators will be pivotal in ensuring that justice is served. "

A longitudinal retrospective review was performed. Data were collected from medical records on presenting signs and symptoms, dietary management and clinical outcome. data were collected on 32 patients from 21 families. 50% were females (16/32). Median age at diagnosis was 4 y (5 days-35 y) with 12 patients diagnosed in the neonatal period with neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis (NICCD), eight later in childhood (FTTDCD) and 12 by family screening based on index cases from five families. No patient had adult-onset type II citrullinemia. The patient age at the time of data collection was a median of 11 y (1-44 y). 91% (29/32) of patients had normal physical and neurological development, 47% (15/32) experienced recurrent unexplained abdominal pain and 9% (3/32) episodes of hypoglycaemia. Siblings had different phenotypes (5 families had > 1 affected patient). Most patients preferred high protein foods, limiting sugar-containing foods. Only 41% (13/32) were prescribed a low CHO, high protein, high fat diet (restriction varied) and two used medium chain triglyceride (MCT) supplements. No patient was prescribed drug therapy. Twenty-five per cent (8/32) of patients were underweight and 41% (13/32) had height <-1 z-scores. patients presented with various phenotypes, symptoms and suboptimal growth. Symptoms and biochemical markers improved with age, but height remained low in some.

775,36730336,"Micronutrient deficiency (MD) is associated with deficits in cognitive functioning of children. However, no comprehensive multicentric study has been conducted in India to explore the role of multiple MD in cognition of children and adolescents. The present study aimed to explore association of MD with level of general intelligence and specific cognitive functions, in urban school-going children and adolescents across ten cities of India. Cross-sectional multicentric study, enrolled participants aged 6-16 years. Blood samples were collected for biochemical analysis of calcium, iron, zinc, selenium, folate, vitamin A, D and B12. Colored Progressive Matrices / Standard Progressive Matrices (CPM/SPM), Coding, Digit Span and Arithmetic tests were used for the assessment of cognitive functions of participants. Height and weight measures were collected along with socio-economic status. From April-2019 to February-2020, 2428 participants were recruited from 60 schools. No MD was found in 7.0% (134/1918), any one MD in 23.8% (457/1918) and ≥ 2 MD in 69.2% (1327/1918) participants.

777,36670679,"Creativity offers new, interesting, and valuable things that can be intangible (ideas, a theory, songs, etc.) or physical objects (a painting, invention, machine). Creativity implies a lot of qualities of the creator such as imagination, creative work, and innovation and it also improves learning and memory. Many of history's most important discoveries are the results of creative activity. Repetition leads to mastery of a concept through understanding and produces increased self-confidence. Confidence increases the willingness to act on creativity-to explore, discover, and learn. This positive cycle of learning is fueled by the curiosity and enjoyment that comes from discovery and understanding. We are social creatures, so the greatest reward and pleasure comes from the admiration and support received from loved and respected people. Stimulating children's interest through play also defines solving through exploration regarding the accumulation of new essential information for knowing values and other useful information, by stimulating curiosity and creativity as well as discovering new resources that generate creative ideas, allowing the acquisition of practical skills. All these aspects are oriented and define the premises for the harmonious development of children towards a new existential stage. Thus, taking these aspects into account will have future effects on self-confidence, work strategies, school results, as well as the desire to study and the ability to store and organize accumulated information. The approach of the case study presents through the game, a motivational alternative, staged regarding the generation of creative ideas in the development and materialization of the concept. It is well known that during childhood, many things are acquired by children through selective association and depending on the sensory perception of objects, namely preferred colors, functions, and predefined shapes, proportional to the anthropometric dimensions specific to preschool age. The article proposes the creative approach and generation of ideas on the design of children's toys; namely, a case study is presented: children's toy set-teacup. "
778,24448310,"The aim of this study was to determine whether eyebrow and eyelash whitening is an effective parameter in age estimation. We evaluated 1545 patients. Age groups were 1-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80, and 81-90 years. Level of whitening was categorized as level 0: no whitening, level 1: 1-3 strands, level 2: 3-10 strands, level 3: 10 strands-2/3 whitening, level 4: >3/4 whitening. Mean age was 42.39 ± 20.01. While there was no eyebrow whitening in 87% of the subjects, level 4 whitening of eyebrows was observed in 0,8% of the subjects. There was no eyelash whitening in 97,7% of the subjects and no level 4 eyelash whitening was detected in any subject. Men had significantly more level 1, 2, 3, and 4 eyebrow whitening compared with women. There was no gender difference in terms of eyelash whitening level. There was no eyebrow and eyelash whitening in subjects age 1-40 years; whitening began in the 41-50 years age group and increased with age in other groups. Mean age was 39.59 ± 19.63 years in subjects with no eyebrow whitening; 59 years in level 1, 61 years in level 2, 63 years in level 3, and 69 years in level 4 eyebrow whitening. Mean age was 41.85 ± 19.87 in subjects with no eyelash whitening; and 63.57 ± 10.75 in those with whitening. Particularly after 41-50 years of age, level of eyebrow and eyelash whitening may be among a useful age estimation parameter. "

We tested this notion among multiplex families participating with the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) Consortium, using scores on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Third Edition (N = 204 families), the Ravens Colored Progressive Matrices (N = 226 families), and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (N = 348 families). Intraclass Correlation Coefficients revealed that siblings with autism/autism spectrum disorders (ASD) were more similar on measures of verbal and nonverbal IQ and adaptive functioning than were unrelated children with autism/ASD. Preliminary twin correlations indicated strong genetic effects for some skill domains and the influence of shared environmental factors for others. "
781,34963124,"The mirror-gazing task (MGT) is an experimental paradigm inducing anomalous perceptions and anomalous experiences of self-face (ASEs) in the general population, ranging from changes in light and color, to face deformation, to experiencing one's specular image as another identity. Subclinical ASEs have been related to the emergence of the risk for developing psychotic disorders, and inducing such states in the general population could shed light on the factors underlying interindividual differences in proneness to these phenomena. We aimed to examine the influence of schizotypal personality traits on proneness to experiencing induced ASEs from a developmental perspective, from childhood to adulthood. Two hundred and sixteen children, adolescents, and young adults participated in the MGT, and their schizotypal personality traits were assessed with the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire. Statistical analyses assessed the relationship between schizotypy dimensions and induced ASEs, and we further tested their dynamic relationship as function of age (from childhood to adulthood). Results confirmed the developmental trajectory of the different schizotypy dimensions, with scores peaking during adolescence, and proneness to induced ASEs seemed to follow a similar developmental trajectory. Moreover, positive (p = 0.001) and disorganized (p = 0.004) dimensions were found to contribute to the proneness to experiencing induced ASEs. Finally, the developmental model showed that positive schizotypy (p = 0.035) uniquely distinguished between experiencing other-identity phenomena between childhood and adulthood. This study has the potential to inform research on early detection of psychosis through a developmental approach and links the concept of schizotypy with processes of perceptual self-distortions. "

783,20573038,"The pathogenesis of edema in nephrotic syndrome is not entirely understood. The aim of this study was to contribute to the discussion on edema pathogenesis in nephrotic syndrome by following changes in volume and sodium retention for the course of the disease in children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS). Forty-one children with SSNS were included in the study. The patients were divided into three groups (group I: relapse-edematous; group II: relapse-edema free; group III: remission). We investigated the value of the significance and area of sodium retention and vasoactive hormones. In addition, we measured parameters such as inferior vena cava collapsibility index, left atrium diameter, and total body water (TBW) to determine the volume load and cause of edema in children with SSNS. TBW increased in the relapse-nephrotic syndrome group and the difference was statistically significant among groups (P < 0.001). However, inferior vena cava collapsibility index and left atrium diameter were not different among groups. Fractional sodium excretion was lower in children with relapse nephrotic syndrome (P < 0.05). Although TBW increases in children with SSNS, intravascular volume is normal. In addition, hypoalbuminemia and sodium retention of the proximal tubule cause edema in children with SSNS. "
784,33518485,"Obesity has been steadily rising in the last few decades and to some extent, have been linked to exposure of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). ACEs are intense stressors or traumatic events experienced or witnessed by children, ranging from all types of abuse (physical, emotional, and sexual), neglect, substance abuse or community violence. These traumatic events deprive the sense of safety and stability of a child, leaving psychological and physiological effects that span into adulthood. The prevalence of ACEs is common across developed and developing countries alike, though the rates differ across ethnicities. Using the United States as an example, the prevalence of ACEs experienced by communities of color is higher than white children. Children around the world could all be exposed to ACEs, hence the original questionnaire capturing the score of ACE has been adapted to different cultural situations. The mechanism linking ACEs to obesity during adulthood include biological, psychological, and environmental factors. Nevertheless, a higher ACE score heightens the risk of poor mental health, attempted suicide and development of obesity and diabetes in adulthood. Prevention of ACEs starts from building positive relationships within families, developing healthy relationship skills, and screening of ACEs during early and routine pediatrician's and primary care visits. Intervention needs to include case management services and psychosocial support programs. When these risk factors are intervened early, it lessens the risk of obesity and diabetes in adulthood. "
785,25008486,"We evaluated the hemodynamic status of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) by measuring vena contracta width (VCW) and effective shunt orifice area (ESOA) using proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) on color Doppler imaging. METHODS AND RESULTS: Study subjects were 21 patients with PDA (mean age, 3.6 years). We measured VCW (mm/m(2)) and ESOA (cm(2)) by the PISA method using echocardiography. Color images were obtained from parasternal long-axis views. VCW (mm/m(2)) was measured at the narrowest region of PDA flow. ESOA by PISA (PDA-ESOA) was defined on color Doppler flow imaging as a hemispheric area of laminar flow with aliased velocities [PDA-ESOA (cm(2))=2π[PDA radius (cm)]^2×aligning velocity (cm/s)/PDA peak velocity (cm/s)]. Upon examining the relationships with catheterization parameters by univariate analysis, VCW correlated with diastolic blood pressure (DBP), % left ventricular end-diastolic volume (%LVEDV), pulmonary blood flow index, pulmonary blood flow/systemic blood flow ratio (Qp/Qs), left-right (LR) shunt ratio, left atrial to aortic root ratio (LA/AO), chest-thoracic ratio and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP); and PDA-ESOA correlated with DBP, Qp/Qs, average pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary/systemic pressure ratio, %LVEDV, LR shunt ratio, LA/AO and NTproBNP. When stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was performed with the correlations that were significant on univariate analysis, significant correlations with Qp/Qs were noted (VCW; R(2)=0.836, β=0.914, P<0.001, PDA-ESOA; R(2)=0.621, β=0.788, P<0.001). Measurement of VCW and PDA-ESOA by the PISA method can noninvasively evaluate the hemodynamic status of PDA. "
786,38191396,"Postgraduate pediatric dental residents' competency, to perform dental rehabilitation procedures under General anesthesia (GA), at different levels of training is challenging for operation time control. An adequate operation time (OT) for children decreases morbidity risk and improves hospital time utilization efficiency. The aim of the study is to assess the effect of pediatric dental resident training level on OT for pediatric dental rehabilitation procedures under GA at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC). A cross-sectional study included pediatric dental rehabilitation performed under GA by pediatric dental residents at (KAMC) -Jeddah from October/2015 to September/2022. The primary outcome was OT, and the predictive variable was resident training levels. A linear regression analysis was used to compare OT between procedures performed by junior (years 1-2) or senior (years 3-4) trainees, adjusting for patient and operative factors. One thousand seven pediatric dental rehabilitation cases were performed under GA by junior (13) and senior (31) residents. The univariant analysis indicated that OT for senior residents was significantly longer (13 min) than for junior residents. However, the linear regression analysis showed that senior residents had a significantly shorter OT when considering the more dental procedures performed per case under GA than junior residents. Senior residents took significantly more radiographs and performed more primary pulp therapies and multi-surface anterior colored restorations under GA than junior residents. The OT for pediatric dental rehabilitation procedures under GA is associated with resident training level. The total OT was significantly longer based on procedure number, type, and resident level. The study indicated that senior residents could manage more complex cases in a shorter time. The finding emphasizes the importance of assigning GA cases to residents based on their level and the case's complexity. Additionally, it helps standardize the resident privileges under GA and understand the impact of residency training on hospital efficiency. "

It is often difficult to identify and completely resect all cystic components, especially when the lesion becomes infected and/or gigantic. Incomplete excision increases the likelihood of recurrences. We reported a simple technique to facilitate the BrCC resection. Tisseel fibrin glue (FG: Baxter AG, Vienna, Austria) was mixed with methylene blue dye in inverse portion to the cyst size and/or the FG volume before injecting into the cystic lumen. After polymerisation of the dyed glue, the lesion was better visualised and extirpated in toto with the aid of the dye colour and gelatinisation by FG. An up-to-date diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for BrCC was also presented. "
789,26912817,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are complex, and severe heterogeneous neurodevelopmental pathologies with accepted but complex immune system abnormalities. Additional knowledge regarding potential immune dysfunctions may provide a greater understanding of this malady. The aim of this study was to evaluate the CD57(+)CD3(-) mature lymphocyte subpopulation of natural killer cells as a marker of immune dysfunction in ASD. Three-color flow cytometry-based analysis of fresh peripheral blood samples from children with autism was utilized to measure CD57(+)CD3(-) lymphocytes. A reduction of CD57(+)CD3(-) lymphocyte count was recorded in a significant number of patients with autism. We demonstrated that the number of peripheral CD57(+)CD3(-) cells in children with autism often falls below the clinically accepted normal range. This implies that a defect in the counter-regulatory functions necessary for balancing pro-inflammatory cytokines exists, thus opening the way to chronic inflammatory conditions associated with ASD.

Echocardiography and cardiopulmonary exercise testing were performed at BL and at early (median 6 months) and midterm FU (median 2.5years) after TPVR. Patients with RVOT obstruction (n=22, median age 17years) were studied. The max RVOT Doppler gradient fell from BL to early FU (60±24 to 26±8mm Hg, P<.001). Left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic and stroke volume increased at early FU (both P<.001) without further change, whereas LV ejection fraction improved throughout FU (P<.001). LV end-systolic and diastolic eccentricity (leftward septal displacement) improved early (both P≤.003), and end-diastolic eccentricity improved further at midterm FU (P=.02). Furthermore, whereas mitral inflow A wave velocity increased (P=.003), the LV A' velocity declined early (P=.007) without further change at midterm. RV systolic and early diastolic function was impaired at BL. Whereas RV strain improved partially at early and midterm FU (P≤.02), RV E' velocity did not improve throughout FU. Mildly impaired LV strain at BL fully recovered by midterm FU (P≤.002). Peak oxygen uptake improved at early and midterm FU (all P≤.003). Patients with RVOT obstruction had biventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction at BL. Relieving RVOT obstruction with TPVR reduced adverse ventricular and compensatory atrioventricular interaction, resulting in progressive biventricular functional improvement and remodeling at early and midterm FU.

791,27409497,"To define the clinical phenotype of a cohort of patients affected with choroideremia. A retrospective study of patients with choroideremia included two centers. Data collected included age, visual acuity, refractive error, color vision, kinetic perimetry, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and genotype information. Sixty male participants were recruited. Genotype information was available for 58 cases, and nonsense mutations were most commonly observed. Eight novel mutations were identified including a missense mutation. The mean age at the first visit was 30.1 years (range, 5-65 years) and thirty-seven patients (61%) had more than one visit with a mean follow-up period of 10.3 years (range, 1-23 years). Visual acuity was not associated with age for patients younger than 30 years (P = 0.46) but significantly associated with age for the age group above 30 years (P < 0.0001). Central retinal thickness was significantly associated with visual acuity (P = 0.03) and with age (P = 0.0014). The extent of visual field documented by kinetic perimetry showed a negative correlation with age to tested stimuli; the smallest target used (I-4e) showed the earliest and most rapid deterioration below the age of 20 years (P = 0.0032). Color vision was abnormal in 46.7% of cases (mean age, 36.3 years; range, 18-61 years), which was associated with older age (P = 0.0039). Central OCT images were abnormal in all cases, as early as age 10 years. Outer retinal tubulations were observed in all but five patients. No genotype-phenotype correlation was observed. This comprehensive structural and functional characterization of a large cohort of patients with molecularly confirmed choroideremia indicates that certain parameters are not changing significantly with time while others are. The latter warrants a prospective natural history study, ultimately to be considered as outcome measures for interventional clinical trials. "
792,39056078,"In recent years, suicide rates in Brazil have increased, but little is known about the temporal behavior and characteristics of suicides due to intentional self-poisoning by medicines. The aim of the present study was to provide an overview of sociodemographic characteristics and place of death related to suicide due to intentional self-poisoning by medicines, to evaluate the trend of mortality rates in Brazil between 2003 and 2022, and its relationship with regional and global crises. Ecological time series study with data from the Mortality Information System of the Brazilian Ministry of Health, related to individuals aged 10 years and over, who committed suicides due to intentional drug overdose, in the period from 2003 to 2022. The analyses were performed in the R environment in RStudio. Between 2003 and 2022, there was a predominance of deaths in women (55.5%), individuals aged 30-49 years (47.2%), of White race/color (53.2%), occurring in health facilities (67.0%), using drugs or unspecified substances (40.4%); a higher concentration in the southern region (22.8%) and a positive trend in mortality rates due to intentional drug overdose, especially from 2016 onwards. A rise of 264% was observed in the comparison of 2022 and 2003. A peculiar sociodemographic profile was observed in the victims of intentional self-poisoning by medicines and a positive temporal trend in mortality rates, especially in a period marked by regional and global crises.

793,34761544,"This scoping review aimed to identify and map the signs and symptoms-apart from vital signs-that trigger nurses' concerns about the deteriorating conditions of hospitalized paediatric patients. A scoping review was conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. Six databases, including MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, Swemed and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses databases, were searched systematically. Of 5795 citations, seven matched the inclusion criteria. Objective observations, such as the patient's colour, pain-level changes, and behavioural observations, were identified as signs that would trigger nurses' concerns. Nurse's intuitive feelings or gut feelings when seeing a patient was also identified as an important factor for identifying a deteriorating paediatric patient. A ""gut feeling"" was described as both a reaction to patient signs and a feeling based on the nurse's intuition gained through experience. The signs or symptoms that would trigger this ""gut feeling"" were not identified. "
794,19007570,"Bronchiectasis is the end result of several different diseases that share principles of management. The clinical course usually involves chronic bronchial infection and inflammation, which are associated with progression. The cause of bronchiectasis should always be investigated, particularly when it can be treated. We recommend evaluating etiology, symptoms, bronchial colonization and infection, respiratory function, inflammation, structural damage, nutritional status, and quality of life in order to assess severity and to monitor clinical course. Care should be supervised by specialized units, at least in cases of chronic bronchial infection, recurrent exacerbations, or when there is a cause that is likely to respond to treatment. Improving symptoms and halting progression are the goals of management, which is based on treatment of the underlying cause and of acute or chronic infections and on the drainage of secretions. Complications that arise must also be treated. Antibiotic prescription is guided by how well infection is being controlled, and this is indicated by the color of sputum and a reduction in the number of exacerbations. We recommend inhaled antibiotics in cases of chronic bronchial infection that does not respond to oral antibiotics, when these cause side effects, or when the cause is Pseudomonas species or other bacteria resistant to oral antibiotics. Inhaled administration is also advisable to treat initial colonization by Pseudomonas species. "
795,39277309,"The US child mental health care system requires a revival and reimagination. We need to shift toward healing-centered models of care and prioritize access to high-quality mental health care through policy changes and resource allocation. Funding community-based programs that provide culturally responsive, antiracist, and equitable (CARE) systems is essential. Policies must be implemented to reduce barriers to accessing mental health services for underresourced communities. By prioritizing (CARE) over control, we can build a just workforce that is equipped to address the needs of a growing diverse population and ensure that all children and families can heal and thrive.

796,32081864,"Very-early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) is a heterogeneous phenotype associated with a spectrum of rare Mendelian disorders. Here, we perform whole-exome-sequencing and genome-wide genotyping in 145 patients (median age-at-diagnosis of 3.5 years), in whom no Mendelian disorders were clinically suspected. In five patients we detect a primary immunodeficiency or enteropathy, with clinical consequences (XIAP, CYBA, SH2D1A, PCSK1). We also present a case study of a VEO-IBD patient with a mosaic de novo, pathogenic allele in CYBB. The mutation is present in ~70% of phagocytes and sufficient to result in defective bacterial handling but not life-threatening infections. Finally, we show that VEO-IBD patients have, on average, higher IBD polygenic risk scores than population controls (99 patients and 18,780 controls; P < 4 × 10 "
797,11765162,"Determination of pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) is essential for the diagnosis, and the timing and type of management of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). Usually cardiac catheterization, an expensive and invasive technique, is required for accurate measurement. A number of noninvasive methods for the assessment of PASP have been developed, one of which is estimation of PASP using contrast-enhanced tricuspid regurgitation Doppler signals (TRDS). In this study, right ventricular systolic pressures (RVSP) and PASP of 36 patients (19 girls, 17 boys; aged 5 months to 15 years) with CHD were estimated by TRDS before and after galactose solution (GS) and were compared with catheterization measurements. Significant TRDS (> 1 m sec.) were obtained in nine of 36 (25%), patients before GS and in 23 of 36 patients (64%) after GS. TRDS were increased significantly by contrast agent. Estimated RVSP and PASP were significantly different from the measured pressures before and after GS. There were significant correlations between the estimated RVSP and PASP and measured RVSP after GS. Estimated pressures were underestimated. We conclude that it is better to use the estimated PASP on patients with significant TRDS for the classification of PASP. "
798,8741316,"A 2 month old boy with Kawasaki disease developed the rare complication of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). He was followed up over 7 years by ultrasonography (2D-ECHO) with and without Doppler flow evaluation, angiography and computed tomography. Calcification was noted 33 months after the onset of the disease but the aneurysm did not decrease in size. 2D-ECHO was adequate for evaluating the size of an aneurysm, but did not show thrombus formation or calcification. Doppler flow studies did not show abnormally high blood flow velocities either at the inflow or outlet of aneurysms, which are indicative of stenosis. On the other hand an abdominal aortogram provided information regarding the luminal shape and abnormalities in flow pattern suggestive of thrombus formation. Fluoroscopy cannot demonstrate calcification in the early stages. Computed tomography (CT) was the imaging method of choice for the evaluation of obstructive or calcific changes; an organizing thrombus was clearly demonstrated and early detection of calcification was possible.

799,27075018,"Trauma is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in childhood, and blunt trauma accounts for 80-90 % of abdominal injuries. The mechanism of trauma is quite similar to that of the adults, but there are important physiologic differences between children and adults in this field, such as the smaller blood vessels and the high vasoconstrictive response, leading to the spreading of a non-operative management. The early imaging of children undergoing a low-energy trauma can be performed by CEUS, a valuable diagnostic tool to demonstrate solid organ injuries with almost the same sensitivity of CT scans; nevertheless, as for as urinary tract injuries, MDCT remains still the technique of choice, because of its high sensitivity and accuracy, helping to discriminate between an intra-peritoneal form a retroperitoneal urinary leakage, requiring two different managements. The liver is the most common organ injured in blunt abdominal trauma followed by the spleen. Renal, pancreatic, and bowel injuries are quite rare. In this review we present various imaging findings of blunt abdominal trauma in children. "
800,12072083,"We describe a Japanese girl with generalized lichen nitidus. She had been exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis at 6 years of age via her teacher. At 8 years of age, she developed severe contact dermatitis on sun-exposed areas after contact with Japanese lacquer trees. Shortly after, numerous tiny, shiny, flesh-coloured papules developed over the upper part of her body. At 10 years of age, she was exposed to a school outbreak of M. tuberculosis. Her eruption showed no response to topical corticosteroids or oral tranilast, but most of the papules completely disappeared after she had received oral isoniazid for 6 months. "

We report a case of child, who had unilateral leucokoria. This child's fundoscopic examination showed a white mass on the optic nerve that extended over to adjacent retina. Performed ultrasound that remained a doubt with the following diagnostic hypotheses: persistent hiperplastic primary vitreous, granuloma (toxocara), astrocytic hamartoma and retinoblastoma. The diagnosis was only established when the doppler ultrasound showed a blood flow inside of the membrane, thus confirming the diagnosis of persistent hiperplastic primary vitreous associated with the Bergmeister'spapilla.

We report a case of EVHCs in 4-year-old identical triplet girls. Our aim is to present another rare case of autosomal-dominant inheritance of EVHCs and to emphasize the utility of dermoscopy as a diagnostic aid for EVHCs that may be misdiagnosed clinically. "
803,8260169,"Endomyocardial biopsy has had limited utilization for the diagnosis of myocardial disease in the pediatric population. Through the use of echocardiography for guidance, we attempted 155 consecutive biopsies in 33 patients. A successful biopsy was performed 151 times, including 48 (31%) in infants less than 6 months of age. Biopsies were performed with a right internal jugular approach using 3F, 5F, and 7F bioptomes. A combination of apical four-chamber and parasternal short-axis views could visualize the passage of the bioptome into the ventricle and the action of the jaws. There was no case of ventricular perforation. After biopsy one transplant recipient was left with an increase in the amount of preexisting tricuspid regurgitation by color flow mapping echocardiography. These results demonstrate that echocardiographically guided endomyocardial biopsies may be safely performed over a wide range of patient sizes. The increased portability, lack of radiation exposure, and the simultaneous visualization of the bioptome and chamber wall combined with these results indicate that echocardiographically guided endomyocardial biopsies should be considered the technique of choice for the pediatric population.

804,1293175,"The neurofibromatoses are a heterogenous set of conditions having clinical manifestations such as skin, nervous system, bone and eye disorders. The clinical pictures of the patients will obviously differ, and there is considerable variation of manifestations even within a family. During the last twenty-five years, one thousand and two hundred patients with neurofibromatosis were personally examined. Almost all our patients had classical von Recklinghausen disease. But in addition to these cases, there are 28 cases of NF-2 and 10 patients which we call multiple neurilemmomatosis. Also, there are related groups of patients with conditions which were not neurofibromatosis, such as 40 cases of localized multiple neurofibromas and 61 cases of localized café-au-lait spots. The features of neurofibromatosis in Japan are not different, compared with foreign countries, except increased pigmentation is more common. In addition to café-au-lait spots, some 20% of Japanese neurofibromatosis patients have pigmentary conditions which I termed hairy fuscoceruleus spots. These spots are blue-brown in colour, and one can see coarse hairs in them. Our recent study indicates that the patients with neurilemmomatosis have loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 22, the same position as the site of patients with NF-2. Neurilemmomatosis may be classified as an NF-2 without acoustic tumors. "
805,27476041,"The Fontan operation is a widely used palliative procedure in patients with single-ventricle anatomy that results in liver injury. As timely identification of liver fibrosis may result in management changes to Fontan patients, the aim of our study was to identify clinically meaningful semi quantitative/quantitative pathologic parameters for biopsy assessment. We performed a retrospective review of 74 liver needle biopsies from Fontan patients. Fibrosis was assessed using quantitative % collagen deposition by Sirius red image analysis, METAVIR, congestive hepatic fibrosis score, sinusoidal fibrosis score, and sinusoidal dilation score. Contemporaneous laboratory, hemodynamic, and ultrasound data were collected. Centrilobular and peri sinusoidal fibrosis was observed in all cases, with 39.2% high grade. Portal fibrosis was observed in 93.2%, with 36.2% high-grade (METAVIR F3-F4). Cirrhosis was observed in 5.4%. % Collagen deposition was increased over control tissue (P < .001) and correlated with time from Fontan (r = 0.3, P = .009) and prothrombin time (r = 0.25, P = .034). Mildly elevated prothrombin time/international normalized ratio was the only measure of liver function consistently associated with multiple high-grade fibrosis scores (METAVIR P = .046, sinusoidal fibrosis P = .018). Abnormal liver echotexture on ultrasound was associated with high-grade congestive hepatic fibrosis score (P = .03). Pathologic gradings and %CD correlated with each other (r = 0.48-0.8, P < .001). Hepatic fibrosis in Fontan patients in our study is universally present, appears to be time dependent, and correlates with few laboratory measurements of liver function. Careful assessment of needle liver biopsies lends a more meaningful measure of liver fibrosis in the Fontan patient than clinical and laboratory data, allowing for appropriate changes to patient management.

806,12049967,"The purpose of this study was to explore the sequential imaging and histologic alterations of tumor blood vessels in the patient with solid malignancies after extracorporeal treatment of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). A total of 164 patients underwent extracorporeal HIFU ablation of malignant solid tumors. After HIFU treatment, enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), color Doppler ultrasound (US) imaging, dynamic radionuclide scanning, digital subtraction angiography, and histologic study were performed to monitor the response of tumor vessels to HIFU ablation. Compared with tumor images in the patients before HIFU, clinical images showed an abrupt interruption, followed by the cessation of blood flow within the tumor vessels after HIFU treatment. The histologic examination indicated that not only the treated tumor cells showed coagulative necrosis, but also small tumor vessels were severely damaged by the HIFU treatment. The results strongly imply that the damaged tumor vessels might play a critical role in secondary tumor cell death, and then indirectly strengthen the destructive force of focused US beams on tumor tissue. It is concluded that tumor vessel damage can be induced by HIFU, which may be a promising strategy in the treatment of patients with solid malignancies. "
807,8223112,"An unusual form of scotopic electroretinogram with a bright white stimulus, which consisted of a rectangular a-wave of normal amplitude and a b-wave of supernormal amplitude, was recorded in three patients with cone dysfunction. In addition to poor visual acuity, abnormal color vision and reduced amplitude of the photopic electroretinogram, these patients showed a 2-log unit elevation of the dark-adaptation threshold. Funduscopic examination and fluorescein angiography revealed fine granular pigment disturbances at the macula. The relationship between the response of the dark-adapted electroretinogram versus stimulus intensity was unique to these patients. The b-wave thresholds were elevated by 1 log unit. The b-waves were reduced in amplitude and markedly delayed in implicit time to dim stimuli, but supernormal in amplitude and normal in implicit time to bright stimuli. "
808,37713854,"To analyze the clinical manifestations of children with Kawasaki disease (KD), and risk factors of coronary artery lesion (CAL). A total of 223 patients admitted to Anhui Children Hospital from January 2017 to December 2019 were enrolled. According to the clinical data, the children with KD were divided into complete Kawasaki disease (CKD) and incomplete Kawasaki disease (IKD) groups. According to the results of the cardiac color ultrasound, the children were divided into the CAL and nCAL groups. The clinical symptoms of children with KD were compared between the CKD and IKD groups. The risk factors of CAL were analyzed by univariate and binary logistic regression analyses. The incidence constituent ratio of KD increased annually from 2017 to 2019 (P < .05). The proportion of fever duration no longer than 10 days, chapped lips, fingertip decrustation, perianal desquamation, and fever combined with rash in the CKD group was significantly higher compared to the IKD group (P < .05), while intravenous immunoglobulin non-response and CAL were significantly lower than those in the IKD group (P < .05). The proportion of males, age <1 year, fever duration longer than 10 days, and IKD in the CAL group were significantly higher compared to the nCAL group, while hemoglobin levels were significantly lower than that in the nCAL group (P < .05). Sex, age, fever duration, atypical KD, and hemoglobin levels were risk factors for CAL in children with KD. Persistent fever, conjunctival hyperemia, chapped lips, and rash were common clinical symptoms in children with KD. The risk of CAL was relatively higher in children with low hemoglobin levels and IKD, whose ages were <1 year old and whose fever time was more than 10 days, which requires high clinical vigilance. "
809,27871358,"A 10-year-old girl presented with three asymptomatic raised lesions over the dorsal aspect of her left index finger present for the past 7 years. On examination, there were three skin-colored nodules overlying the middle and distal phalanx of her left index finger, without any attachment to the underlying structures (Figure 1) The nodule over the distal phalanx was the largest with a cobblestone-like surface. All the nodules were firm to touch. Cutaneous, mucosa, hair, nails, and systemic examinations were within normal limits. The two smaller nodules were excised under local anesthesia and sent for histopathologic examination. Histologic study from one of the representative lesion showed type B nevus cells (lymphocytoid), located in the expanded papillary dermis (Figures 2 and 3). "
810,3231433,"Forty-two subjects with classic features of Williams syndrome were evaluated to ascertain the prevalence and severity of the ophthalmologic features associated with the disorder. Twenty-six (62%) had a stellate pattern of the anterior iris stroma which was observed only in individuals with blue or hazel iris color. Twelve (29%) had strabismus, most commonly esotropia. Hypermetropic discs were noted in 18 of 33 patients (55%), a simplex vertical branching of the central retinal vessels at the disc in 23 (70%), and situs inversus vasorum in 5 (15%). No subject had accentuated vascular tortuosity, which has been reported previously as a hallmark of this syndrome. No ocular manifestation of infantile hypercalcemia was noted in any subject. "
811,17297274,"Lichen nitidus (LN) is an uncommon chronic inflammatory skin disease composed of numerous, tiny, shiny, flesh-colored papules that are predominantly observed on the chest, abdomen, glans penis and upper extremities. The distribution of LN is most often localized, but in some cases it can become generalized. Because LN tends to be asymptomatic and presents spontaneous resolution within several years, it usually does not require treatment except in symptomatic, persistent and generalized cases. We describe a 28-yr-old man and a 7-yr-old boy with generalized LN where both cases improved with narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) phototherapy plus topical steroid ointment. Both patients noted improvement within the first three treatments and showed almost complete resolution after 18 and 20 treatments, respectively. NB-UVB phototherapy may be an effective alternative therapy for the treatment of generalized LN, even for those patients in their childhood. "
812,34694628,"Climate change is one of the major global health threats to the world's population. It is brought on by global warming due in large part to increasing levels of greenhouse gases resulting from human activity, including burning fossil fuels (carbon dioxide), animal husbandry (methane from manure), industry emissions (ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide), vehicle/factory exhaust, and chlorofluorocarbon aerosols that trap extra heat in the earth's atmosphere. Resulting extremes of weather give rise to wildfires, air pollution, changes in ecology, and floods. These in turn result in displacement of populations, family disruption, violence, and major impacts on water quality and availability, food security, public health and economic infrastructures, and limited abilities for civil society to maintain citizen safety. Climate change also has direct impacts on human health and well-being. Particularly vulnerable populations are affected, including women, pregnant women, children, the disabled, and the elderly, who comprise the majority of the poor globally. Additionally, the effects of climate change disproportionally affect disadvantaged communities, including low income and communities of color, and lower-income countries that are at highest risk of adverse impacts when disasters occur due to inequitable distribution of resources and their socioeconomic status. The climate crisis is tilting the risk balance unfavorably for women's sexual and reproductive health and rights as well as newborn and child health. Obstetrician/gynecologists have the unique opportunity to raise awareness, educate, and advocate for mitigation strategies to reverse climate change affecting our patients and their families. This article puts climate change in the context of women's reproductive health as a public health issue, a social justice issue, a human rights issue, an economic issue, a political issue, and a gender issue that needs our attention now for the health and well-being of this and future generations. FIGO joins a broad coalition of international researchers and the medical community in stating that the current climate crisis presents an imminent health risk to pregnant people, developing fetuses, and reproductive health, and recognizing that we need society-wide solutions, government policies, and global cooperation to address and reduce contributors, including fossil fuel production, to climate change.

813,32169527,"The purpose of this study was to use social indicators to compare adolescent health disparities across neighborhoods in Baltimore, Maryland, circa 2017. Neighborhoods heavily influence adolescent health outcomes. Baltimore remains a hypersegregated city along racial boundaries with a recently growing population of Latino immigrant youth. This segregation may promulgate adolescent health disparities, yet the magnitude of needs and how they may differ among Baltimore's minoritized adolescents remain unknown. The most predominantly white, black, and Latino neighborhoods in Baltimore were analyzed across six indicators relevant to adolescent health: teen birth rate, high school achievement, poverty, health insurance, youth mortality rate, and lead paint violation rate. The indicators were used to create a composite adolescent deprivation index. Measures of absolute and relative disparity were then calculated between white, black, and Latino neighborhood clusters. Both black and Latino neighborhoods had similar adolescent deprivation relative to white neighborhoods. Latino neighborhoods had the highest teen birth rate and children without health insurance. Black neighborhoods had the lowest educational achievement and the highest poverty, youth mortality, and lead paint violation rate. The overall magnitude of social deprivation is similar across communities of color in Baltimore. However, black adolescents tend to live in neighborhoods with greater physical deprivation and youth mortality that limits within-group bonding capacity, whereas Latino adolescents tend to live in neighborhoods with limited health and social resources that prevent between-group bridging capacity. These indicators thus orient policies and programs to promote differential asset-based strategies for positive youth development. "
814,32986887,"Low calcium intake is common worldwide and can result in nutritional rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Calcium-fortified foods could improve calcium intake. However, there is limited calcium fortification experience, with technical and practical issues that may hamper its adoption. The objective of this landscape review is to summarize these issues to help policymakers guide the planning and design of calcium fortification as a public health strategy. One challenge is the low bioavailability of calcium salts (∼20-40%); thus, large amounts need to be added to food to have a meaningful impact. Solubility is important when fortifying liquids and acidic foods. Calcium salts could change the flavor, color, and appearance of the food and may account for 70-90% of the total fortification cost. Safety is key to avoid exceeding the recommended intake; so the amount of added calcium should be based on the target calcium intake and the gap between inadequate and adequate levels. Monitoring includes the quality of the fortified food and population calcium intake using dietary assessment methods. Calcium fortification should follow regulations, implemented in an intersectorial way, and be informed by the right to health and equity. This information may help guide and plan this public health strategy. "
815,11288150,"It is clear that the late clinical symptomatology and the patency of forearm arterial repairs have been contradictory. This study, during which the relationship between the symptomatology and patency has been studied, explores the influence of the local hemodynamic changes and the effect of microsurgical technique on patency rates. Thirty-five patients with a total of 44 arterial injuries were treated. Hemodynamic studies were done intraoperatively, and all patients were evaluated postoperatively with a neurologic, vascular, clinical examination and by radiodiagnostic methods. An overall patency of 77.2% was found. Color-Doppler ultrasonography (CDU) failed by 14.2% as compared with angiography, which did not fail. High blood pressure on the distal stump led to significantly reduced patency rates. Eight patients without nerve problems were found to be symptomatic as a result of the poor patency rate. Many factors are observed to influence patency rate. The nonpatent forearm artery can be symptomatic in anatomically and hemodynamically varied hands. CDU was more reliable for hemodynamic evaluation; conversely, angiography was more dependable for arterial morphology. The results of this study suggest that to correlate the clinical symptomatology and the patency rates, all arterial repairs should be assessed both clinically and radiodiagnostically. "
816,18367278,"Human arm movements need 'online' corrections due to noise in perception and action. A Step-Perturbation paradigm explored online corrections in control children and children with DCD aged between 7 and 13 years. Control children found the task straightforward: a distracter had no effect and they managed to stop relatively quickly. Children with DCD found the task difficult and the apparatus was modified accordingly (decreased postural and force production demands). The distracter affected some children with DCD and some found it difficult to stop. All of the DCD population showed poorer performance in both the perturbation and non-perturbation condition. Nevertheless, there was no interaction between group and condition. Thus, this study found no evidence for specific deficits in online correction mechanisms in DCD. We suggest that: (i) fundamental problems in generating basic movements can account for the documented difficulties in correcting on-going movements, and (ii) such fundamental difficulties make it very difficult to pinpoint specific mechanism deficits.

817,33869558,"The traditions, strengths, and resilience of communities have carried Indigenous peoples for generations. However, collective traumatic memories of past infectious diseases and the current impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in many Indigenous communities point to the need for Indigenous strengths-based public health resources. Further, recent data suggest that COVID-19 is escalating mental health and psychosocial health inequities for Indigenous communities. To align with the intergenerational strengths of Indigenous communities in the face of the pandemic, we developed a strengths- and culturally-based public health education and mental health coping resource for Indigenous children and families. Using a community-engaged process, the Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health collaborated with 14 Indigenous and allied child development, mental health, health communications experts and public health professionals, as well as a Native American youth artist. Indigenous collaborators and Indigenous Johns Hopkins project team members collectively represented 12 tribes, and reservation-based, off-reservation, and urban geographies. This group shared responsibility for culturally adapting the children's book ""My Hero is You: How Kids Can Fight COVID-19!"" developed by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Reference Group on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergency Settings and developing ancillary materials. Through an iterative process, we produced the storybook titled ""Our Smallest Warriors, Our Strongest Medicine: Overcoming COVID-19"" with content and illustrations representing Indigenous values, experiences with COVID-19, and strengths to persevere. In addition, parent resource materials, children's activities, and corresponding coloring pages were created. The book has been disseminated online for free, and 42,364 printed copies were distributed to early childhood home visiting and tribal head start programs, Indian Health Service units, tribal health departments, intertribal, and urban Indigenous health organizations, Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health project sites in partnering communities, schools, and libraries. The demand for and response to ""Our Smallest Warriors, Our Strongest Medicine: Overcoming COVID-19"" demonstrates the desire for Indigenous storytelling and the elevation of cultural strengths to maintain physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health during the COVID-19 pandemic.

818,30138244,"One of the major challenges faced in minimally invasive pediatric cardiac surgery is cannulation strategy for cardiopulmonary bypass. Central aortic cannulation through the same incision has been the usual strategy, but it has the disadvantage of cluttering of the operative field. We hereby present the results of femoral cannulation in minimally invasive pediatric cardiac surgery in terms of adequacy and safety. From January 2013 to June 2016, 200 children (122 males) with mean ± SD age of 9.2 ± 4.51 years (median = 6 years, range = 3-18 years) and weight of 19.22 ± 8.49 kg (median = 15 kg, range = 8-45 kg) were operated for congenital cardiac defects through anterolateral thoracotomy. The most common diagnosis was atrial septal defect (144 patients). In all the patients, femoral artery and femoral vein were cannulated along with direct superior vena cava cannulation for institution of cardiopulmonary bypass. There were no deaths or any major complications related to femoral cannulation. Femoral artery cannulation provided adequate arterial inflow, whereas femoral vein with direct superior vena cava cannulation provided adequate venous return in all the patients. No patient required vacuum-assisted venous drainage. No patient required conversion to sternotomy or developed vascular, neurological complications. At discharge and at 1-year follow-up, both femoral artery and vein were patent without a significant stenosis on color Doppler ultrasonography in all the patients. At mean ± SD follow-up period of 30.63 ± 10.09 months, all the patients were doing well without any wound-related, neurological, or vascular complications. Femoral arterial and venous cannulation is a feasible, reliable, and efficient method for institution of cardiopulmonary bypass in minimally invasive pediatric cardiac surgery. "
819,12859870,"To explore the expression of CD(117) on different types of leukemia and its significance. CD(117) expression was analysed by three-color flow cytometry with CD(45)/SSC gating strategy. CD(117) was expressed in 68% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 80% of chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis (CML-BC) cases, but in only 2% of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases. CD(117) was negative in CML in chronic phase and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Cases in AML, CD(117) was expressed in 72% of M(0)/M(1), 88% of M(2), 50% of M(4), 75% of M(5a), 100% of M(6) and 100% of M(7) cases but was less expressed in M(3) (39%) and M(5b) (29%) cases. Expression of CD(117) was more frequent than CD(34) and HLA-DR in M(3) and some M(2) cases. There was a significant inverse relationship between CD(117) and CD(14) expression in AML. Analysis of CD(117) expression may be of help in distinguishing myeloid from lymphoid leukemia and leukemia clone from normal cells. "
820,26138373,"To investigate mid- to long-term outcomes in children with coronary artery fistula (CAF). We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients seen between September 1996 and August 2011. We enrolled those diagnosed with CAF via echocardiography (Philips SONOS 7500 system and Philips IE33) or angiography. The mean follow time was 42.58 ± 3.4 months (range, 1-166 months). For comparative purposes, participants were grouped as acquired versus congenital, and symptomatic versus asymptomatic. We also measured the size of the coronary artery (CA) in patients with CA dilatation (CAD). Out of 122 CAF patients, spontaneous closure was detected in 37 patients at 21.59 ± 3.45 months after diagnosis. This timeframe did not differ between the acquired and congenital groups (21.64 ± 6.26 months vs. 21.57 ± 4.15 months; p = 0.991). Ninety patients were asymptomatic and remained so; their spontaneous closure rate was 28.89%. Moreover, 24 patients had CAD, including 17 with Kawasaki disease and seven with congenital CAF. The CAs of all congenital-CAF-plus-CAD patients were initially > 5 mm; these patients underwent percutaneous transcatheter intervention, and their CA sizes decreased significantly (6.11 ± 0.79 mm vs. 3.76 ± 0.36 mm; p = 0.002). With the advanced sensitivity of echocardiography, CAF can be detected more easily than ever before. Most patients with small CAFs are asymptomatic and may experience spontaneous closure. Therefore, management of CAF depends on symptoms; if patients are asymptomatic and have small CAFs, intervention may not be necessary, especially in acquired cases. However, if patients present with symptoms or persistent dilatation of the proximal CA, surgical or percutaneous closure should be performed. "
821,8137901,"In order to determine whether there were any differences in distribution of nuclear DNA between acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), the localization of DNA in blasts from the bone marrow or buffy coat of 30 patients with ALL and 30 patients with AML was examined ultrastructurally by staining with osmium ammine B. By the ultrastructural cytochemistry, DNA in ALL cells was clumped in the nuclei, while in AML cells, it was dispersed. DNA had accumulated around the nucleoli of some blasts, and flecks of DNA were observed in nucleoli of a majority of blasts. The perinucleolar and intranucleolar DNA distribution could be classified into four types. The types with abundant perinucleolar DNA were frequently observed in ALL blasts, while the majority of AML blasts showed scant perinucleolar DNA. The types with intranucleolar flecks of DNA were more prominent in leukemic cells than in normal immature leukocytes. In conclusion, the pattern of distribution of DNA in the nuclei of leukemic cells differs between ALL and AML. "
822,16924711,"To assess the accuracy of echocardiography in diagnosis of total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC). A combination of suprasternal, parasternal, subcostal and apical views were employed to diagnose TAPVC and to trace the course of the anomalous pulmonary venous connection, the direction of the inter-atrial shunt, enlargement of right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV), superior and inferior vena cava. All pediatric patients underwent surgical repair. The results of echocardiography were compared with surgical findings. A total of 28 consecutive pediatric patients with suspected TAPVC were included in this study. The TAPVC diagnosis was confirmed in 26 cases after surgery, partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection (PAPVC) in one case, and Cor Triatriatum and possible TAPVC in another. The diagnostic accuracy of TAPVC by echocardiography in the study was 92.86%. There were 17 supracardiac TAPVC, 11 intracardiac TAPVC. In all patients, enlargement of the RA and RV, inter-atrial right-to-left shunt via atrial septal defects were documented in parasternal and subcostal views. Common pulmonary vein or four pulmonary vein direct to RA or via coronary sinus to RA were the draining sites of intracardiac TAPVC. The enlargement of left innominate vein-right superior vena cava draining to RA was seen in supracardiac TAPVC. A combination of suprasternal and subcostal multi-views in echocardiography can increase the diagnostic accuracy of TAPVC in pediatric patients. "

T-lymphocytes perform and regulate many of the immune processes and play a major role in immune homeostasis. Studies have shown that GD causes impairment in T-lymphocyte functions, although the role and status of T-lymphocytes in GD are still under investigation. It is still not fully known how GD leads to the altered biochemical and immunological cellular functions observed in the disease. Our study aimed to evaluate the variations of regulatory T-lymphocytes (Tregs) in 20 Egyptian children with GD under enzyme replacement therapy, managed in Assiut University Hospitals.

824,11495190,"To examine seasonal variations in the presentation of acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) in a previously unstudied population in Cape Town, South Africa. A descriptive study of all presenting cases of ANUG at a health center over 6 years; patients were examined at one point in time. A clinic-based cross-sectional study was carried out among patients presenting routinely to the oral medicine clinic at the University of the Western Cape. Patients at this clinic were mostly colored and black people, and were of low socioeconomic status. All patients presenting to the periodontal clinic were examined during the period from 15 March 1992 to 15 March 1998 and interviews were conducted. A comprehensive clinical intra-oral and peri-oral examination was carried out using a dental mirror and blunt probe by three trained calibrated dental examiners. The minimum criteria for inclusion as an ANUG patient were painful, bleeding gums with irreversible destruction of the interdental papillae (cratering) and marginal gingiva. Patients with multiple small ulcerations not restricted to the gingiva, but including other oral sites such as the tongue and buccal mucosa were diagnosed as herpetic stomatitis. Other distinguishing characteristics of ANUG included presence of a pseudomembrane, odor, a strange taste in the mouth, and hypersalivation. Swabs and biopsies taken to verify the diagnosis when necessary. If there was any doubt as to the diagnosis of the lesion it was not included among the ANUG cases. Presence of ANUG. Among the 19944 patients presenting for periodontal treatment, 684 were found to have ANUG. The ANUG patients consisted of 58% males; 73% of the ANUG patients were between the ages of 5 to 12 years. The majority of ANUG patients presented during the summer (55.4%), 27.7% in autumn and 8.4% during both winter and spring. Significant differences were evident between the numbers seen during the different seasons. This study demonstrated a significant seasonal variation in the occurence of ANUG in Cape Town, South Africa. "
825,20479298,"To characterize the clinical changes in clinically distinctive scalp nevi over time in children to help guide management and avoid misdiagnosis as melanoma. Cohort study. Washington University School of Medicine pediatric dermatology clinics. Patients Of 93 patients younger than 18 years with photographically documented, clinically distinctive scalp nevi, 28 (30%) consented to participate. Minimum follow-up from the initial visit was 1 year. Collectively, these patients had 44 scalp nevi at the initial visit. No patient had a personal diagnosis of melanoma or dysplastic nevus syndrome. Clinical changes in scalp nevi as determined using the ABCDE scoring system (ie, asymmetry, border irregularity, color variegation, diameter >6 mm, and evolution/elevation from initial to follow-up images) on initial and follow-up photographs of scalp nevi. Overall, 77% of the clinically distinctive scalp nevi (34 of 44) showed clinical signs of change during mean follow-up of 2.8 years. Of those with changes, 18 (53%) became more atypical and 16 (47%) became less atypical since the initial examination. None of the changes were concerning for melanoma. The mean total scalp nevus count was 2.6. Scalp nevi represented approximately 6% of total-body nevi. The number of scalp nevi increased with age. Boys had 1.5 times the number of scalp nevi as girls (P = .03). Scalp nevi are clinically dynamic in childhood. These changes include an increase or a decrease in atypical features and occur in all age groups. This preliminary study does not support excisional biopsies but does support physician evaluation of scalp nevi evolution and serial photography of clinically distinctive lesions. "
826,27759657,"To study the clinical presentation and treatment outcome among children in South Western China with retinoblastoma (RB) and to determine factors predictive of poor outcome.A retrospective review of children diagnosed with RB from 2006 to 2015 at West China Hospital was undertaken. Demographic and clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes were studied.A total of 253 patients (unilateral 80.2%, bilateral 19.8%) were studied. Twenty six patients (10.3%) were from minority ethnic groups of China. The median onset age was 21 months. Leukocoria was the most common presenting sign (71%). Tumors were intraocular in 91.3% cases, extraocular in 8.7% cases. Extraocular RB patients had a longer median lag period than intraocular patients (9 months vs 2 months, P < 0.0001). In the intraocular group, 89.5% were advanced group D or E diseases. Enucleation was the major treatment for intraocular RB. However, over 10 years, the enucleation rate decreased constantly while more patients received chemotherapy. The Kaplan-Meier survival probability was 87.8%, 81.4%, and 74.8% at 3 years, 5 years, and 10 years, respectively. On Cox regression analysis, extraocular RB (P = 0.0008) and treatment abandonment (P < 0.0001) were associated with poor outcome; bilateral RB (P = 0.0116) and advanced pathological grade pT4 (P = 0.0011) were associated with poor outcome of intraocular RB.Most RB patients from South Western China were diagnosed at advanced clinical stage. Delayed presentation is related to extraocular RB which is a risk factor for poor outcome. Chemotherapy increased the eye salvage but had no effects to overall survival. Education for parents and general physicians for the early signs of RB (such as leukocoria), therapeutic strategy and treatment outcomes of RB may promote early diagnosis, improve the compliance, and outcome.

827,1930002,"The prevalence of use of sunscreens was assessed in an environment of high ultraviolet (UV) exposure by surveying 117 males and 126 females on two Queensland beaches. Using a questionnaire, information was obtained about their application of sunscreen on the day of participation in the study, thus eliminating recall error. It was found that 71% of the female and 68% of the male beach-goers sampled had applied sunscreen, 47% of which had the maximum Sun Protection Factor (15+) rating. There was no significant association found between usage and either skin colour or socio-economic status. Although 88% used a waterproof formulation, only 61% reapplied the sunscreen directly after swimming. Sunscreen was not applied to all exposed body parts, with over half of the subjects neglecting ears and lower limbs. Reported major reasons for use were to avoid skin cancer (44%), and to avoid sunburn (43%). The results of this study can assist in evaluating the effectiveness of present sun-protection campaigns in the short term. "
828,14610491,"Peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets need to be determined in a large, urban, minority-predominant cohort of healthy children to serve as suitable control subjects for the interpretation of the appearance of these cells in several disease conditions, notably pediatric HIV-1 infection. We sought to determine the distribution of lymphocyte subsets in healthy urban-dwelling infants, children, and adolescents in the United States. Lymphocyte subsets were determined by means of 3-color flow cytometry in a cross-sectional study of 807 HIV-unexposed children from birth through 18 years of age. Cell-surface marker analysis demonstrated that age was an extremely important variable in 24 lymphocyte subset distributions measured as percentages or absolute counts--eg, the CD4 (helper) T cell, CD8 (cytotoxic) T cell, CD19 B cell, CD4CD45RACD62L (naive helper) T cell, CD3CD4CD45RO (memory helper) T cell, CD8HLA-DRCD38 (activated cytotoxic) T cell, and CD8CD28 (activation primed cytotoxic) T cell. The testing laboratory proved to be an important variable, indicating the need for using the same laboratory or group of laboratories to assay an individual's blood over time and to assay control and ill or treated populations. Sex and race-ethnicity were much less important. The results of this study provide a control population for assessment of the effects of HIV infection on the normal development and distribution of lymphocyte subsets in children of both sexes, all races, and all ethnic backgrounds from birth through 18 years of age in an urban population. This study's findings will also prove invaluable in interpreting the immune changes in children with many other chronic diseases, such as primary immunodeficiency, malignancy, rheumatoid arthritis, and asthma.

830,10971482,"Ota's naevus is a fairly common pigmentary disorder in Asians. Recently, encouraging results in the treatment of Ota's naevus have been obtained, but most of these concerned the white skins of Caucasian patients. Our purpose was to examine the clinical features of Ota's naevus in Koreans and to assess the clinical outcomes and histological changes induced by a Q-switched alexandrite laser at 755 nm. Eighty-seven Koreans with Ota's naevus were studied; the peak age of onset was during the first decade and adolescence. The infraorbital area was the most frequent site and black or dark brown colours predominated. Improvements were achieved in 52 patients (77%). Better results were obtained in unilateral lesions and patients who received a greater number of treatments. Mild hyperpigmentation after treatment was noticed in 14 patients and mild hypopigmentation in eight patients. However, all of these were reversed in time. Hypertrophic scarring or secondary infection did not occur. The histology of laser-irradiated lesions showed selective thermal damage of melanocytes in the upper dermis and the elimination of upper dermal pigmentation. Our clinical data demonstrate the usefulness of the Q-switched alexandrite laser for the treatment of Ota's naevus in brown skin. "
831,30855420,"The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the vascularization index (VI) obtained using superb microvascular imaging (SMI) technique in the diagnosis of Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT). The thyroid glands of 80 patients with HT and 107 healthy, asymptomatic participants were examined using SMI. The thyroid parenchyma echogenicity was evaluated, and the thyroid gland volume was measured. Vascularization index measurements were performed by manually drawing the contours of the thyroid parenchyma using the free region of interest with color 2-dimensional SMI VI mode. The quantitative VI values of the patients and the asymptomatic group were compared. Correlations between VI values and thyroid autoantibodies and thyroid hormone levels were analyzed. The mean VI value of the thyroid gland was 4.74% ± 1.96% in the asymptomatic group and 12.45% ± 5.87% in HT patients with a statistically significant difference (P < 0.001). Hashimoto thyroiditis can be diagnosed with 86.3% sensitivity and 82.2% specificity when 6.00% VI value was designated as the cutoff value. There was a positive significant correlation between the VI value and the thyroid-stimulating hormone, antithyroglobulin antibodies, anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody levels (P < 0.05); however, no significant correlation was found between the VI values and thyroglobulin and free thyroxine levels (P > 0.05). There was a significant negative correlation between the VI values and the parenchyma echogenicity and positive significant correlation between the thyroid gland volume and the antithyroglobulin antibody and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody levels (P < 0.05). The VI obtained using the SMI technique can be effectively used as an imaging method for the diagnosis of HT because of its high sensitivity and specificity in representing objective, quantitative numerical values.

832,23411943,"When used to cover facial skin defects, skin grafts and local flaps have limitations such as color mismatch, volume depletion, and long scar. We used skin-fat composite grafts harvested with enough fat tissue over the whole plane to cover full-thickness facial skin defects. This study enrolled 15 composite grafts, and the results were rated by 2 investigators on a scale of 1 to 5 based on skin texture, color, and volume. Skin color analysis using a spectrophotometer was performed on 9 grafts using the L*a*b* score. There were no major complications, but 1 partial loss. The clinical assessment score ranged from good to excellent. Color assessment using a spectrophotometer showed that there were no significant statistical differences in the L* and a* scores between the grafts and the adjacent skin. Skin and fat composite tissue grafts can be a good option for covering full-thickness facial skin defects. "
833,36818922,"Colorectal juvenile polyp as a pathologic entity was first described by Verse. These non-neoplastic lesions are most commonly found in children and infants, while in older children after the age of 14 and adults are a rare phenomenon. A 75-year-old female underwent colonoscopy. There was a pedunculated polyp in the transverse colon. Complete endoscopic electroresection of this polyp was performed and the polyp was sent for histopathologic analysis. Macroscopically, the polyp was described as a fragment of irregular round shape, size of about 2.5x2x1 cm, with fine-grained, reddish surface, showing dark red color on serial sections. Histologic examination of the polyp showed some irregularly distributed glands, some of which were cystically dilated. All glandular formations were coated with normal intestinal epithelium. The surface of the polyp was partially eroded and replaced by non-specific cellular granulation tissue. There were some signs of hemorrhagic infarction in the stroma of the polyp. Histopathologic examination indicated that histopathologic characteristics of this polyp corresponded to juvenile polyp. Juvenile polyps are very rarely found in adults. Therefore, we describe a case of this patient in her eighties with juvenile polyp localized in the transverse colon. "
834,9309509,"Mid-term follow-up results of coil embolization for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) were evaluated in 19 patients aged from 2 years 9 months to 13 years (median: 5 years and 10 months) who underwent coil embolization for PDA. The minimum diameter of PDA ranged from 1.0 to 3.5 mm (mean 2.3 +/- 0.8 mm). Coil embolization was performed by the retrograde approach in 16 patients and the anterograde approach in 3, using a Gianturco coil in 11 and a Jackson detachable coil system in 8. Sixteen patients underwent single coil embolization and three patients received two coils simultaneously with detachable coil systems. Follow-up evaluation was performed with color flow mapping and pulsed Doppler echo to identify residual shunt or acquired left pulmonary artery stenosis after embolization at 1 day, 1 week, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, and every 6 months thereafter. In two patients, a coil had migrated into the distal left pulmonary artery immediately after implantation, and could be safely retrieved. Minimum residual shunt was found in six patients (32%) on the day after the procedure. Spontaneous closure was noted in all patients within 6 months. Recanalization of completely occluded PDA was observed in one patient at 1 month after embolization. However, spontaneous closure of the residual shunt was found at 1 year and 6 months of follow-up. There was no evidence of acquired left pulmonary artery stenosis during the follow-up period (14.5 +/- 5.8 months). Coil embolization is an effective and safe therapy for PDA. Small residual shunt may be observed immediately after the coil embolization, but will close spontaneously during the follow-up. Recanalization occurred after complete coil occlusion, so careful follow-up with color flow mapping is mandatory. "
835,16140691,"Diaper dermatitis is a common problem in outpatient pediatric office settings. Although most diaper rashes represent a form of contact dermatitis in response to irritants in the diaper environment, other rashes may be the result of an allergen in the diaper. On the basis of clinical examination results for 5 patients and patch testing results for 2 patients, we suspect that the patients demonstrated allergic contact dermatitis in response to the various blue, pink, and green dyes in diapers. Although topically administered corticosteroids are useful in the treatment regimen, the preferred treatment for allergic contact dermatitis in the diaper area is the use of dye-free diapers for allergen avoidance. Patch testing may also be valuable in identifying the allergen, because allergen avoidance is the key to prevention of recurrent disease. "
836,29926438,"The bacterium Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) can cause severe and life-threatening infections such as epiglottitis and meningitis. The course of the disease can be very rapid, resulting in sudden death. The incidence of Hib-induced epiglottitis in children has declined since the introduction of vaccinations in countries where such vaccinations are routinely administered. We herein present a case involving a 2.5-year-old boy who died suddenly at home. He had developed acute-onset throat and abdominal pain and a high fever. Despite an emergency cricothyrotomy due to a complicated intubation because of a massively swollen epiglottis, the efforts to resuscitate the child were unsuccessful. He was a previously healthy toddler, but he had not yet been vaccinated. Microbiologic analysis revealed the pathogenic bacterium Hib. The main autopsy finding was acute epiglottitis with swelling and cherry-red coloring of the epiglottis. Postmortem cultures of the cerebrospinal fluid and heart blood also revealed Hib as the pathogenic agent. Acute pneumonia was also diagnosed microscopically. The present report describes a rare case of Hib-induced acute epiglottitis and presents the key findings of forensic investigations in this type of disease. "

It generally occurs in children, and is not known to be associated with systemic disease. The authors report histopathological and clinical findings in 14 cases of subepidermal calcified nodule of the eyelid, including 3 older patients with unique microscopic features. Clinical records and pathological materials were critically reviewed in each case, including von kossa, CD3, CD20, and CD68 stains. The 14 cases presented clinically as nodular eyelid lesions. All were treated with surgical excision. The authors found 2 distinct histopathological patterns which correlated with the patients' age. In young patients, the authors observed multiple, small calcified bodies within the dermis surrounded by chronic inflammation and granulomatous foreign body reaction. On the other hand, in elderly patients, lesions were characterized by a single, large, well-demarcated amorphous calcified deposit surrounded by fibrous tissue, without chronic inflammation or foreign body reaction. One of these patients, a 70-year-old man, also suffered from gout. The presence of subepidermal calcified nodule was not documented as a preoperative diagnostic possibility in any of the cases. Subepidermal calcified nodule of the eyelid is a rare condition, but should be considered in any patient presenting with a painless white to yellowish colored nodule of the ocular adnexa, particularly during the teenage years. Clinicians and pathologists should be aware that this entity has a distinct appearance and could be associated with systemic conditions in elderly patients. "

The Expressive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised and the Rapid Color Naming subtest of the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing were administered to 5- to 7-year-old children (n = 22) as part of a comprehensive research or clinical protocol. African American children scored lower than European American children (p < .05) on both procedures. The observed performance difference emerged despite the fact that there were no group differences in age, immunologic clinical categories, intellect, level of maternal education, or CD4+ percentage and after using stringent exclusionary criteria, including history of enrollment in special education services and the presence of other chronic medical conditions. The implications of such findings are discussed within biological and demographic frameworks. "

The aim of this study was to assess the ownership and utilization of ITNs and the knowledge of malaria and their effects on malariometric and haematological indices in children living in the Mount Cameroon area. A community-based cross-sectional study involving a total of 405 children aged between 6 months and 14 years living in Batoke-Limbe was carried out between July and October 2017. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to document demographic status, knowledge on malaria and ITN ownership and usage. Venous blood sample was collected from each child to determine the prevalence and intensity of parasitaemia by Giemsa-stained microscopy and full blood count by auto haematology analysis to obtain white blood cell (WBC) and red blood cell (RBC) counts, haemoglobin (Hb) level, haematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC). A multilinear regression model was used to determine the relationship between haematological parameter as dependent variable and the independent variables. The overall prevalence of parasitaemia, anaemia, knowledge about malaria, ITN ownership, usage and effective usage was 46.7%, 54.7%, 40.7%, 78.8%, 50.9% and 29.9%, respectively. The prevalence of parasitaemia was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in children who ineffectively utilized ITNs (54.9%) than effective users (27.3%). Having knowledge of malaria, negatively correlated with WBC counts (P = 0.005), but positively correlated with Hb levels (P < 0.001), RBC counts (P < 0.001), Hct (P < 0.001), MCV (P < 0.001) and MCH (P < 0.001). ITN use positively correlated with WBC counts (P = 0.005) but negatively with Hb levels (P = 0.004), RBC counts (P = 0.006), and MCH (P < 0.001). Meanwhile, parasitaemia negatively correlated with Hb levels (P = 0.004), RBC counts (P = 0.01), Hct (P = 0.04) and MCHC (P = 0.015). There is need for more sensitization on the benefits of using the ITNs to meet up with the intended and expected impact of the free distribution of ITNs. "
845,38002411,"There are currently limited treatment options for aniridia. In this context, 3D printed iris implants may provide a cost-effective, cosmetically acceptable alternative for patients with aniridia. The purpose of this study was to develop a proof-of-concept workflow for manufacturing 3D printed iris implants using a silicone ink palette that aesthetically matches iris shades, identified in slit lamp images. Slit lamp iris photos from 11 healthy volunteers (3 green; 4 blue; 4 brown) were processed using k-means binning analyses to identify two or three prominent colors each. Candidate silicone inks were created by precisely combining pigments. A crowdsourcing survey software was used to determine color matches between the silicone ink swatches and three prominent iris color swatches in 2 qualifying and 11 experimental workflows. In total, 54 candidate silicone inks (20 brown; 16 green; 18 blue) were developed and analyzed. Survey answers from 29 individuals that had passed the qualifying workflow were invited to identify ""best matches"" between the prominent iris colors and the silicone inks. From this color-match data, brown, blue, and green prototype artificial irises were printed with the silicone ink that aesthetically matched the three prominent colors. The iris was printed using a simplified three-layer five-branch starburst design at scale (12.8 mm base disc, with 3.5 mm pupil). This proof-of-concept workflow produced color-matched silicone prosthetic irises at scale from a panel of silicone inks using prominent iris colors extracted from slit lamp images. Future work will include printing a more intricate iris crypt design and testing for biocompatibility. "
846,28819144,"Cortisol concentrations in hair are used to create hormone profiles spanning months. This method allows assessment of chronic cortisol exposure, but might be biased by hair pigmentation: dark hair was previously related to higher concentrations. It is unclear whether this association arises from local effects, such as increased hormone extractability, or whether the association represents systemic differences arising from population stratification. We tested the hypothesis that hair pigmentation gene variants are associated with varying cortisol levels independent of genetic ancestry. Hormone concentrations and genotype were measured in 1674 children from the Generation R cohort at age 6. We computed a polygenic score of hair color based on 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms. This score was used to predict hair cortisol concentrations, adjusted for genetic ancestry, sex, age and corticosteroid use. A 1-standard deviation (SD) higher polygenic score (darker hair) was associated with 0.08 SD higher cortisol levels (SE = 0.03, p = 0.002). This suggests that variation in hair cortisol concentrations is partly explained by local hair effects. In multi-ancestry studies this hair pigmentation bias can reduce power and confound results. Researchers should therefore consider adjusting analyses by reported hair color, by polygenic scores, or by both. "

We hypothesized that FLG mutations affect immune cell composition in a general pediatric population. Therefore, we investigated whether school-aged children with and without FLG mutations have differences in T- and B-cell subsets. This study was embedded in a population-based prospective cohort study, the Generation R Study, and included 523 children of European genetic ancestry aged 10 years. The most common FLG mutations in the European population (R501X, S1085CfsX36, R2447X, and S3247X) were genotyped. Additionally, 11-color flow cytometry was performed on peripheral blood samples to determine helper T (Th), regulatory T (Treg), and CD27 FLG mutations were observed in 8.4% of the total population and in 15.7% of the AD cases. Children with any FLG mutation had higher Th22 cell numbers compared to FLG wild-type children in the general and non-AD population. Children with and without FLG mutations had no difference in Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg, or memory B-cell numbers. Furthermore, in children with AD, FLG mutation carriership was not associated with differences in T- and B-cell subsets. School-aged children of a general population with FLG mutations have higher Th22 cell numbers, which reflects the immunological response to the skin barrier dysfunction. FLG mutations did not otherwise affect the composition of the adaptive immunity in this general pediatric population. "
849,30865233,"It is challenging to differentiate melanoma from melanocytic nevus on the volar skin in the absence of typical dermoscopic patterns. To identify the frequency and clinical and dermoscopic characteristics of melanocytic lesions on the volar skin not displaying a parallel furrow pattern, lattice-like pattern, fibrillar pattern, or parallel ridge pattern on results of dermoscopy. In this retrospective cohort study, a total of 504 melanocytic lesions on the volar skin were evaluated in the Shinshu University Hospital department of dermatology between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2012. Dermoscopic images were independently assessed by 3 dermoscopists for the presence of established dermoscopic criteria. Statistical analysis was performed from October 1, 2017, to April 30, 2018. Frequency of dermoscopic criteria and corresponding clinical (patient age and size and location of lesion) and histopathologic features. Of 504 lesions, 110 (21.8%) (melanocytic nevus, 97; melanoma, 8; and equivocal melanocytic lesion, 5) from 108 patients (68 female and 40 male patients; mean age, 40.1 years [range, 1-86 years]) did not show a parallel furrow pattern, lattice-like pattern, fibrillar pattern, or parallel ridge pattern. Among them, the mean patient age was significantly higher for melanoma than for melanocytic nevus (65.3 vs 38.0 years; P < .001), as was mean maximum lesion diameter (11.8 vs 5.7 mm; P < .001). Melanomas and equivocal melanocytic lesions tended to be distributed on weight-bearing areas of the foot sole, such as the heel, while nevi were spread over non-weight-bearing regions. Dermoscopically, 95 melanocytic nevi (97.9%) were symmetrical in 1 or 2 axes while melanomas were not. A total of 91 melanocytic nevi (93.8%) had 1 or 2 colors per lesion, and 4 melanomas (50.0%) had more than 2 colors. Vascular structures were seen in 3 melanocytic nevi (3.1%) and 3 melanomas (37.5%). Blue-white structures were seen in 18 melanocytic nevi (18.6%) and 3 melanomas (37.5%). Dots and globules were seen in 22 melanocytic nevi (22.7%) and 4 melanomas (50.0%). Vascular structures, blue-white structures, and dots and globules were irregularly distributed in the melanomas. Ulcer, hyperkeratosis, and irregular streaks were observed only in melanomas. More than one-fifth of melanocytic lesions on the volar skin did not display typical dermoscopic patterns. Asymmetry, numerous colors (≥3), and other melanoma-specific dermoscopic findings were more frequently observed for melanomas. Clinical information, including patient age and lesion size and location, was helpful in differentiating melanoma from melanocytic nevus. Further prospective clinical studies are warranted to clarify the diagnostic accuracy of dermoscopy combined with clinical information. "
850,11801699,"Capabilities of color and power Doppler sonography (DS) were prospectively evaluated for diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis and for prediction of scarring by comparison with 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA). Fifty-seven children (mean age, 5 +/- 3 y) with acute pyelonephritis were investigated by biologic testing, DS (DS 1), and DMSA (DMSA 1). Patients who were <6 mo old or had high-grade reflux or obstruction were excluded. Forty-five children had a clinical follow-up examination, biologic testing, DS (DS 2), and DMSA (DMSA 2) at a mean of 7 +/- 2 mo after acute infection. Sonography (gray-scale and DS) was performed by 1 experienced radiologist who was unaware of patient data. DMSA studies were interpreted by 2 physicians who were unaware of patient data. Temperature, neutrophil count, and C-reactive protein value were significantly higher in patients with abnormal DMSA 1 findings than in those with abnormal DS 1 findings (P < 0.05). When compared with DMSA 1, DS 1 had a sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 81%, respectively. At follow-up, all clinical and biologic data had normalized. Scarring after infection occurred in 51% of children. When compared with DMSA 2, DS 1 had positive and negative predictive values of 57% and 75%, respectively, and DMSA 1 had respective values of 62% and 100%. Reflux was not considered a good predictor of scarring. DS and DMSA results were concordant in 81% of kidneys with acute pyelonephritis. The predictive value of DS for renal scarring was not considered sufficiently high for DS to be used in routine practice. "

853,30654833,"Graphic health warnings on tobacco packaging and the plain packaging of tobacco products are key tobacco control interventions. This systematic review investigates the perceptions of adolescents towards these packaging interventions. Published, original-research, English-language articles from 1 January 2000 to 1 September 2017 were identified through a systematic literature search of the PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Articles describing investigations into the perceptions of adolescents aged 11 to 19 years towards graphic health warnings and/or plain-packaged cigarettes were included in this review. Nineteen articles, involving 15,935 adolescent participants, of which 72.85% were non-smokers or ex-smokers and 27.15% occasional or daily smokers, met the eligibility criteria. Graphic health warnings were perceived as more effective than text-only warnings, with warnings depicting lung cancer, and oral diseases being perceived as particularly effective. Health warnings increased viewer fear, anxiety, shock, and guilt and were considered effective in preventing non-smokers from experimenting with tobacco and prompting current smokers to quit. Plain packaging reduced the attractiveness and other positive attributes of cigarette packaging, with darker colours found to be the most effective. When used in combination, plain packaging increased the visibility of graphic health warnings, with participants also perceiving them as having an increased tar content and having more serious health risks, and increased thoughts of quitting amongst smokers. Graphic health warnings and plain packaging appear to increase adolescent awareness of the dangers of tobacco use. Further research into the most effective warnings to use in combination with plain packaging is needed to ensure the greatest reduction in tobacco use and prevent tobacco-attributable morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable population.

854,23269715,"The goals of this study were to investigate the difference in carotid arterial stiffness in obese children compared to healthy children and to study the correlation between carotid arterial stiffness parameters and obesity using ultrasound (US) radiofrequency (RF) data technology. Carotid artery stiffness parameters, including the compliance coefficient, stiffness index, and pulse wave velocity, were evaluated in 71 obese patients and 47 healthy controls with US RF data technology. In addition, all participants were evaluated for fat thickness in the paraumbilical abdominal wall and fatty liver using abdominal US. Compared to the control group, the blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), fat thickness in the paraumbilical abdominal wall, presence of fatty liver, and carotid stiffness parameters (stiffness index and pulse wave velocity) were significantly higher in the obese group, whereas the compliance coefficient was significantly lower in the obese group. Furthermore, the pulse wave velocity was weakly positively correlated with the BMI, systolic BP, diastolic BP, and paraumbilical abdominal wall fat thickness, whereas the compliance coefficient was weakly negatively correlated with the systolic BP, BMI, and paraumbilical abdominal wall fat thickness. The presence of a fatty liver was moderately positively correlated with the BMI and weakly positively correlated with the pulse wave velocity. Ultrasound RF data technology may be a sensitive noninvasive method that can be used to accurately and quantitatively detect the difference in carotid artery stiffness in obese children compared to healthy children. The detection of carotid functional abnormalities and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in obese children should allow early therapeutic intervention, which may prevent or delay the development of atherosclerosis in adulthood.

855,29238106,"Fall in hospitalized patients can cause trauma and fractures, which can reduce ADL and QOL, whereas prevention of fall decreases medical expenses. The purpose of this study is to examine prevention of fall due to intervention from a fall working group established in our hospital. The working group focused on three main points. First, colored wrist bands for patients classified as grade 3 risk for fall are used to alert medical staff. Second, information on fall prevention was distributed to patients. Third, standardization of two bed fences and reduced use of slippers for inpatients have been introduced. We investigated falls during hospitalization for 5 years from April 2012 to March 2017. The risk of fall was evaluated as grade 1 (mild) to grade 3 (severe) using an assessment sheet developed by the working group. The incidence of fall decreased over time, with a significant decrease from 2.1% in 2012 to 1.3% in 2016 (p<0.01). Slipper use in fall cases showed a significant decrease from 45.8% in 2012 to 11.0% in 2016 (p<0.01). Among all falls, the percentage of cases with fall risks grade 1 and 2 decreased, while that for grade 3 risk increased from 32.0% in 2012 to 40.3% in 2016 (p<0.05). These results support the efforts of the fall working group have reduced the overall incidence of fall. However, fall in patients with grade 3 risk has not decreased, which suggests that better sharing of information is needed for patients at high risk for fall. "
856,37838485,"Evidence is accumulating, both in the US and abroad, of the apparent serious health impacts of various environmental exposures tied to climate change. High ambient temperature, or heat, is a worsening global health risk. Heat risk is affected by many factors such as the magnitude, duration, and timing of exposure - such as specific, critical windows during pregnancy. This article focuses on the association of heat with both adverse pregnancy and newborn health outcomes. Regarding pregnancy, studies link heat and preterm birth, low birth weight and stillbirth. Multiple potential mechanisms support the biological plausibility of these associations. Emerging evidence suggests that heat, via epigenetics, may affect maternal health far beyond pregnancy. For newborn health impacts, heat is associated with increased hospitalization, neurologic and gastrointestinal dysfunction, and infant death. Research gaps include the need to study neonates separately from children and determining the mechanisms linking heat to adverse outcomes. We also highlight disparate adverse reproductive health outcomes for communities of color and low income tied to disproportionate exposures to environmental stressors like heat. Finally, we summarize educational and clinical tool resources for clinicians, information for patients, and opportunities for near-term action using the precautionary principle framework. "

There is a large variety of medicinal mushrooms which possess significant therapeutic properties and are used as medications for various diseases because they contain several novel highly bioactive components. Medicinal mushrooms can be identified based on their morphology, size, mass, and the color of the stalk, cap and spore, and attachment to the stalk. Medicinal mushrooms possess a variety of important biological activities and are used as antioxidants, hepatoprotectors, anticancer, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antiaging, antiviral, antiparasitic, and antimicrobial agents, among others. This review provides a basic overview of the chemical scaffolds present in mushrooms and their therapeutic implications in the human body. "
858,35115103,"As the cardiac community strives to improve outcomes, accurate methods of risk stratification are imperative. Since adoption of International Classification of Disease-10th Revision (ICD-10) in 2015, there is no published method for congenital heart surgery risk stratification for administrative data. This study sought to develop an empirically derived, publicly available Risk Stratification for Congenital Heart Surgery (RACHS-2) tool for ICD-10 administrative data. The RACHS-2 stratification system was iteratively and empirically refined in a training dataset of Pediatric Health Information Systems claims to optimize sensitivity and specificity compared with corresponding locally held Society of Thoracic Surgeons-Congenital Heart Surgery (STS-CHS) clinical registry data. The tool was validated in a second administrative data source: New York State Medicaid claims. Logistic regression was used to compare the ability of RACHS-2 in administrative data to predict operative mortality vs STAT Mortality Categories in registry data. The RACHS-2 system captured 99.6% of total congenital heart surgery registry cases, with 1.0% false positives. RACHS-2 predicted operative mortality in both training and validation administrative datasets similarly to STAT Mortality Categories in registry data. C-statistics for models for operative mortality in training and validation administrative datasets-adjusted for RACHS-2-were 0.76 and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.72-0.80 and 0.80-0.89); C-statistics for models for operative mortality-adjusted for STAT Mortality Categories-in corresponding clinical registry data were 0.75 and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.71-0.79 and 0.79-0.89). RACHS-2 is a risk stratification system for pediatric cardiac surgery for ICD-10 administrative data, validated in 2 administrative-registry-linked datasets. Statistical code is publicly available upon request. "

860,23635974,"Hemangiomas are among the most common tumors found in children and are characterized by an excess of blood vessels. They most often affect the area of the head and neck, occur with greater frequency among women and Caucasians, and can be found in the oral cavity-especially on the lips, tongue, or mucosa. Clinically, hemangiomas present as asymptomatic red or blue-colored lesions that grow rapidly and are capable of spontaneous regression. When they are found on the tongue, they can result in clinical problems as well as recurrent trauma due to biting of the tongue and tooth-brushing, resulting in bleeding, obstruction of the upper airways, and difficulty with chewing, deglutition, and speaking. The purpose of this article was to present a case study of a 4-year-old child with a diagnosis of hemangioma of the tongue, emphasizing the oral changes found as a result of this lesion, as well as the dental treatment used to minimize these changes.

861,29101603,"Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is characterised by the fear of anxiety-related symptoms and is a risk factor for the development of anxiety-related disorders. We examined whether genetic variation in three stress response genes, CRHR1, NR3C1, and FKBP5, interact with childhood trauma (CT) to predict AS in South African adolescents. Xhosa (n = 634) and Coloured (n = 317) students completed self-report measures of AS and CT, and a total of eighteen polymorphisms within CRHR1, NR3C1, and FKBP5 were genotyped. Differences in AS based on genetic variation and CT were analysed within population and gender groups using multiple linear regression. Associations were found between AS and FKBP5 rs9296158 (p = 0.025) and rs737054 (p = 0.045) in Coloured males. Analysis of gene x CT interactions indicated that NR3C1 rs190488 CC-genotype, NR3C1 rs10482605 G-allele addition, and FKBP5 rs3800373 C-allele addition protect against AS with increasing CT in Xhosa females (p = 0.009), Xhosa males (p = 0.036) and Coloured males (p = 0.049), respectively. We identified two different protective single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) combinations in a four-SNP CRHR1 haplotype in Coloured males. An analysis of the interaction between CT and a six-SNP FKBP5 haplotype in Coloured males revealed both protective and risk allelic combinations. Our results provide evidence for the influence of both genetic variation in CRHR1, NR3C1 and FKBP5, as well as CT x SNP interactions, on AS in South African adolescents. This study reinforces the importance of examining the influence of gene-environment (G X E) interactions within gender and population groups. "
862,24771489,"Axonal guidance disorders are a newly recognized group of diseases of the human central nervous system. These disorders are characterized by white matter tracts with abnormal course and failure to cross the midline or presence of ectopic white matter tracts. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fiber tractography are suitable neuroimaging tools to detect morphological abnormalities in the course, decussation, and location of white matter tracts. We report on a 6.5-year-old child with significant global developmental delay. Axial color-coded fractional anisotropy (FA)-maps revealed absence of (1) the midline ""focal red dot"" at the level of the pontomesencephalic junction representing absence of decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncles and (2) the dorsal component of the transverse pontine fibers. These findings are highly suggestive of an axonal guidance disorders. The complete neuroimaging phenotype of this child does not match well-known diseases with similar DTI findings. We show how DTI reveals important information of microstructural brain malformations that may go undetected or remains underestimated and consequently DTI may suggest the possible pathomechanism. We conclude that this child may be suffering from a not yet described subtype of an axonal guidance disorder. "
863,31421839,"For vascular anomalies, when clinical findings are not sufficient, auxiliary examination is essential. In this study, we characterize and differentiate the ultrasound (US) findings of deep infantile hemangioma (DIH) and venous malformation (VM). A total of 135 patients (140 lesions) with clinically proven DIH and VM were analyzed. The following US characteristics were assessed: size, shape, border, echogenicity, echotexture, vascularity, and lesion softness. One-way analysis of variance, nonparametric test, χ On gray-scale US images, DIH and VM were more common in subcutaneous soft tissue, but VM could invade the muscle. Most DIHs were expressed as hyperechoic structures (47.0%), had a well-defined border (74.2%), and were homogeneous (53%), whereas the majority of VMs showed mixed echoic with anechoic structures (87.8%), had an ill-defined border (58.1%), and were heterogeneous (100%). On color Doppler US, most DIHs (90.9%) showed high vascular density, whereas only a few blood flow signals were found in most VMs (98.6%). On elastic US, VM was softer than DIH (2.9 ± 0.8 vs 2.6 ± 0.5; P = .048). After DIH involution, the distance from the body surface increased (P = .015); the lesion's vertical diameter, peak arterial systolic velocity, and Vmax were significantly decreased (P = .006, P = .047, and P = .026, respectively). Also, early VM (<18 months) has the typical US performance of VM. Compared with elastic US, gray-scale and Doppler US provided stronger evidence for differential diagnosis. DIH and VM have different US manifestations that can provide evidence for diagnosis and differential diagnosis of DIH and early VM. "

865,30015751,"The artificial intelligence and image processing technology can develop automatic diagnostic algorithm for pediatric otitis media (OM) with accuracy comparable to that from well-trained otologists. OM is a public health issue that occurs commonly in pediatric population. Caring for OM may incur significant indirect cost that stems mainly from loss of school or working days seeking for medical consultation. It makes great sense for the homecare of OM. In this study, we aim to develop an automatic diagnostic algorithm for pediatric OM. A total of 1,230 otoscopic images were collected. Among them, 214 images diagnosed of acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME) are used as the database for image classification in this study. For the OM image classification system, the image database is randomly partitioned into the test and train subsets. Of each image in the train and test sets, the desired eardrum image region is first segmented, then multiple image features such as color, and shape are extracted. The multitask joint sparse representation-based classification to combine different features of the OM image is used for classification. The multitask joint sparse representation algorithm was applied for the classification of the AOM and OME images. The approach is able to differentiate the OME from AOM images and achieves the classification accuracy as high as 91.41%. Our results demonstrated that this automatic diagnosis algorithm has acceptable accuracy to diagnose pediatric OM. The cost-effective algorithm can assist parents for early detection and continuous monitoring at home to decrease consequence of the disease. "
866,20514315,"There has been no report about hereditary and clinical features of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in Koreans. To evaluate these, data were collected from 365 RP patients including age, gender, visual acuity (VA), spherical equivalent (SE) of refractive errors, funduscopic findings, color vision test, visual field score (VFS) obtained from Goldmann perimetry, and the inheritance patterns from pedigrees. Simplex RP was the most common inheritance pattern (61.9%); followed by autosomal recessive RP (17.3%), autosomal dominant RP (12.1%) and X-linked recessive RP (8.8%). Myopia was the most common refractive errors (77.5%) including 16.1% of high myopia. The most common cataract type was posterior subcapsular cataract (25.8%). Observed retinal findings included changes of retinal pigment epithelium (88.8%), bony spicule-like pigmentation (79.7%), attenuation of retinal vessel (76.2%), waxy disc pallor (12.6%), golden ring around optic disc (2.2%), epiretinal membrane (0.8%) and cystoid macular edema (0.5%). Corrected VA and refractive errors did not show any significant difference between the inheritance patterns. VFS was significantly worse in autosomal recessive RP than in autosomal dominant RP. Color vision defect was noted in 66.1% on Hardy-Rand-Rittlers color vision test. In conclusion, Korean RP patients have the indigenous hereditary and clinical features as well as the ordinary ones. "
867,30273499,"Marketing unhealthy foods and beverages to children (M2K) fosters poor dietary patterns, increasing obesity and noncommunicable disease risk. Federal restrictions on M2K have been under development in Canada since 2016; however, at present, M2K is mostly self-regulated by food companies. This study aimed to compare M2K on Canadian websites of food companies with and without voluntary policies or commitments in this area. A systematic content analysis of company websites was conducted in spring/summer 2017 for major packaged food (n = 16), beverage (n = 12), and restaurant chain (n = 13) companies in Canada. M2K policies were sourced from company websites and published corporate documents. Sixteen companies (43%) reported national and/or global M2K policies, while 21 companies (57%) had no published policies. The websites of Canadian companies (n = 154) were scanned for child-directed products and marketing; type and frequency of marketing techniques were recorded. Child-directed marketing appeared on 19 websites of 12 companies (32%), including 9 companies with M2K policies. Websites featured products with unconventional flavours, colours, shapes, or child-oriented packaging, and used promotional characters, contests, games, activities, or lettering and graphics appealing to children. The nutritional quality of products marketed to children was evaluated using a nutrient profile model developed by Health Canada for proposed M2K regulations. Of the 217 products marketed to children, 97% exceeded Health Canada's proposed ∼5% Daily Value threshold for saturated fat, sodium, and/or sugars, 73% of which were products from 9 companies with policies. These findings highlight the limitations of self-regulation in restricting M2K on food company websites, reinforcing the need for government regulations. "

869,7797661,"Using image-directed and color Doppler ultrasonography (ICDUS), we examined 65 patients with single kidney biopsy and diagnosed one arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in each of 8 kidneys. Three of them were associated with pseudoaneurysms. Three of the patients with AVF who presented with macrohematuria underwent angiography. Therapeutic percutaneous embolization was performed in 2 of them. The remaining 6 patients were followed up with ICDUS. All the lesions had disappeared at the end of a 6-month period. We conclude that ICDUS is an easy and noninvasive imaging technique in the diagnosis of postbiopsy native renal AVFs. "
870,31375852,"Acute femoral artery occlusion is common in pediatric patients following cardiac catheterization. A variety of means are utilized to assess lower extremity (LE) perfusion and arterial patency following cardiac catheterization including palpation of pulses, pulse oximetry, subjective assessment of lower extremity color and temperature, and ultrasound. We sought to evaluate the utility of Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) to monitor LE perfusion in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. INVOS pediatric sensors were placed on bilateral LE in all pediatric patients ≤ 40 kg undergoing cardiac catheterization. Data were recorded continuously from the start of the procedure until 4-6 h after completion of the procedure. NIRS readings were compared between the accessed versus non-accessed LE at baseline before start of case, time of vascular access, arterial sheath exchange when applicable, sheath withdrawal, and Safeguard application, deflation, and removal. 133 patients underwent 152 catheterizations with mean age 2.4 ± 2.3 years and mean weight 12.4 ± 13.2 kg. NIRS oximetry readings were significantly decreased in the LE with arterial access compared to non-accessed LE from time of sheath insertion until removal of the pressure assist device post procedure. A greater difference was noted in smaller patients. NIRS oximetry readings did not correlate with subjective assessment of lower extremity perfusion after arterial sheaths were removed. One patient had pulse loss 4 h post procedure with a decrease in oximetry readings noted at this point on review. Weight-based heparin protocol was initiated, and a gradual improvement in oximetry readings was noted over the next 5 h. Vascular ultrasound 12 h later showed no evidence of arterial thrombus. NIRS may be helpful in identifying patients who are risk for developing arterial thrombus post cardiac catheterization and for monitoring response to therapy; however, further study in these patients is warranted.

871,24043246,"The aim of this study was to assess both burn prevention knowledge and the effectiveness of educational intervention in alleviating the current knowledge deficit in Zambian youth. In one rural Zambian district, a burn prevention program was implemented in June 2011. Children at two elementary schools completed a 10-question survey that aimed to assess knowledge regarding burn injuries. After completing the survey, children received a burn and fire safety presentation and a burn prevention coloring book. Children were reassessed in May 2012 using the same survey to determine program efficacy and knowledge retention. Burn knowledge assessments were also completed for children at other schools who did not receive the burn prevention program in 2011. Logistic regression analysis was used for statistical adjustment for confounding variables. Between June 2011 and May 2012, 2747 children from six schools were assessed for their burn knowledge, with 312 of them resurveyed after educational intervention since initial survey. Reassessed children performed significantly better on three questions after controlling for confounders. They did better on five questions but their performance on these failed to achieve statistical significance. Children performed significantly worse on one concept about first aid treatment of a burn. A majority of the children demonstrated knowledge deficit in three concepts, even after educational intervention. There is a large variation in first burn knowledge survey performance of children from different schools, with inconsistency between concepts. With half the questions, knowledge deficit did not improve with advancement in school grade. Low- and moderate-income countries (LMICs) face the largest burns burden. With the lack of adequate burn care facing LMICs, burn injury prevention is of particular importance in those countries. This study shows that burn educational intervention could be effective in reducing burn knowledge deficit; however, the residual deficit posteducation could still be large and potentially contributing to heightened burn injury incidence. Customized and integrated educational programs may be proposed regarding the epidemiological profile of burn knowledge deficit from various schools. This study represents one of the few reports on the effectiveness of a burn prevention program in an LMIC. Future epidemiological data will be needed from nearby healthcare facilities to determine whether this program decreased burn morbidity and mortality at the hospital level. "
872,24300210,"To explore the clinical application values of five-color flow cytometry for leukocyte differential count in peripheral blood. Leukocyte differentiation in 265 peripheral blood samples collected at Peking University First Hospital from September 2010 to December 2010 was detected by standard microscopic cytology as a reference method. Meanwhile, Beckman-Coulter LH750 hematology analyzer and FC500 flow cytometer were performed. Then the correlations were analyzed between microscopic cytology, hematology analyzer and flow cytometry. Forty blood samples collected at Peking University First Hospital, Beijing Daopei Hospital and General Hospital of Beijing Military Command from August 2010 to November 2010 were analyzed by standard microscopic cytology, Beckman-Coulter LH750 hematology analyzer and NAVIOS flow cytometer. Then the correlations between microscopy, hematology analyzer and flow cytometry were explored to analyze the clinical diagnostic efficiency of flow cytometry. Correlation of leukocyte differential count between FC500 flow cytometer and standard microscopic cytology was significant (all P < 0.01) . And it was superior in the detection of lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils (r = 0.955, 0.928, 0.876). Moreover, the correlation of leukocyte differential count between NAVIOS flow cytometer via manual gate and standard microscopic cytology was significant (r > 0.700, all P < 0.01) except for basophils. And it was superior in the detection of neutrophils, lymphocytes and blasts (r = 0.950, 0.915, 0.852). When 1% was set as the cut-off value of immature granulocytes on standard microscopic cytology, the sensitivity and specificity of flow cytometry was 87% and 76% respectively. When 0.5% was set as the cut-off value of blasts on standard microscopic cytology, the sensitivity and specificity of flow cytometry stood at 100% and 92% respectively. Five-color flow cytometry is well-correlated with standard microscopic cytology for leukocyte differential count in peripheral blood with different flow cytometers, and the sensitivity of detecting blasts and immature granulocytes is very excellent.

873,34928876,"Officially chartered in 1998, the J. Robert Gladden Orthopaedic Society (JRGOS) is a multicultural society dedicated to improving the diversity of the orthopaedic surgeon workforce and ending disparities in musculoskeletal health care. The purpose of this article is to discuss why an organization such as the JRGOS was needed within the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and highlight the key figures in orthopaedic history who supported the formation of the JRGOS. It also highlights the present efforts of the JRGOS, which include mentorship of Black, indigenous people of color medical students, residents and fellows in training, and support of research related to disparities in musculoskeletal care. As the JRGOS enters its third decade of existence, additional partnerships with the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, American Orthopaedic Association, AALOS, Orthopaedic Diversity Leadership Consortium, RJOS, Nth Dimensions, BWOS, and industry will help to realize the dream of making the orthopaedic workforce as diverse as the United States.

874,30403525,"The purpose of this study is to assess the diagnostic performance of the American College of Radiology (ACR) Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TIRADS) for malignancy risk in pediatric thyroid nodules. Two radiologists reviewed ultrasound images of 74 tissue-proven thyroid nodules in 62 children. Points were given for individual features and then added to determine the ACR TI-RADS category, ranging from 1 (benign) to 5 (high suspicion). Kappa coefficients were generated to assess intra- and interobserver agreement. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the odds of malignancy with construction of a supplementary ROC curve. Fifty-four nodules were benign and 20 were malignant, with a median ACR TI-RADS category of 4 (interquartile range, 4-5). Nineteen of 20 (95.0%) malignant nodules were rated as TI-RADS category 4 or 5. There was substantial intraobserver agreement (κ = 0.69-0.77; p < 0.001) and moderate interobserver agreement (κ = 0.37; p = 0.002) for TIRADS category. Univariable analysis showed that, with every 1-unit increase of TI-RADS category, the likelihood of malignancy increased 2.63 times (95% CI, 1.08-6.41; p = 0.03). After adjusting for nodule size, TI-RADS category remained marginally associated with malignancy (adjusted odds ratio, 2.27; 95% CI, 0.93-5.54; p = 0.07). The AUC was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.64-0.86). An optimal cut point of TI-RADS category 5 was selected, with TI-RADS category 5 nodules 10.44 times (95% CI, 2.71-40.21; p < 0.0001) more likely than categories 1-4 nodules to be malignant. ACR TI-RADS discriminates well between malignant and benign nodules in a pediatric population, particularly at TI-RADS category 5. "
875,27856672,"Executive functions (EFs) are critical for management of life activities, but few studies have evaluated EFs in children and adolescents with perinatally acquired HIV (PHIV), who are at risk for problems in academics, behavior, and medication adherence. We compared EFs in youth with PHIV and in perinatally HIV-exposed but uninfected (PHEU) youth. Four Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) subtests were administered to 173 youth with PHIV and 85 PHEU youth, aged 9 to <19 years, who were enrolled in the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS) Memory and Executive Functioning Study. Youth with PHIV, with or without history of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Class C (AIDS-defining) condition (PHIV/C [n = 45] and PHIV/non-C [n = 128], respectively), were compared with each other and with PHEU youth. Among youth with PHIV, associations with measures of current and past disease severity were evaluated using adjusted linear regression models. The PHIV/C group (mean age, 15.5 years), compared with the PHIV/non-C and PHEU groups (mean ages, 14.5 and 12.9 years, respectively), were significantly slower on the Inhibition and Color Naming/Reading Combined conditions of the Color-Word Interference subtest and made more errors on Inhibition; differences between the PHIV/C and PHEU groups persisted in adjusted models. No differences in adjusted means for fluency or problem-solving were found. The PHIV/non-C and PHEU groups did not differ on any measure. Associations of specific EF measures with HIV RNA viral load, CD4-positive T-lymphocyte percentage, and age at greatest disease severity were observed. Youth with PHIV and previous AIDS-defining conditions performed more poorly on some EF measures. Relationships of EF development with the degree and timing of disease severity require further study. Implications for long-term outcomes and interventions are important avenues for follow-up. "
876,29387614,"The aim of the present prospective study is to determine the effect of an intellectual colored game (ICG) on the severity of gag reflex (GR) and anxiety in children during dental alginate impression. Forty-one children, aging between 5 and 11 years, having a GR varying from normal to moderate had upper alginate impressions. The children's anxiety was evaluated with a facial image scale (FIS) before (T0) and after first failed impression (T1), then, after playing an intellectual colored game (ICG) at T2, while taking an upper alginate impression. 42.9 % of the children had a gag reflex of stage 2 and 31.0 % a facial scale of 3. Initial GR was not significantly associated with the final success of the impression ( This study highlights the clinical performance of the intellectual distraction approach in GR management. "
877,22296167,"This study evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of Haemoglobin Colour Scale (HCS), compared with clinical diagnosis, to detect anaemia and severe anaemia in preschool-age children attending primary healthcare clinics in rural Zanzibar. In all participants, haemoglobin (Hb) concentration was independently estimated by clinical examination for palmar pallor, HCS and HemoCue™. HemoCue was considered the reference method. Data collection was integrated into the usual health services and performed by local healthcare workers (HCWs). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were calculated for HCS and clinical examination for palmar pallor. The limits of agreement between HCS and HemoCue, and inter-observer variability for HCS, were also defined. A total of 799 children age 2-59 months were recruited to the study. The prevalence of anaemia (Hb<11 g/dl) and severe anaemia (<5 g/dl) were 71% and 0.8% respectively. The sensitivity of HCS to detect anaemia was 33% [95% confidence interval (CI) 29-36] and specificity was 87% (83-91). The sensitivity of HCS to detect severe anaemia was 14% (95% CI 0-58) and specificity was 100% (99-100). The sensitivity of palmar pallor to detect anaemia was low, but superior to HCS (58% vs. 33%, P<0.001); specificity was inferior to HCS (55% vs. 87%, P<0.001). There was no evidence of a difference in either sensitivity (P>0.1) or specificity (P>0.1) between HCS and palmar pallor to detect severe anaemia. Haemoglobin Colour Scale does not improve the capacity of HCWs to diagnose anaemia in this population. Accuracy is limited by considerable variability in the performances of test operators. However, optimizing the training protocol for those using the test may improve performance. "
878,36244574,"In silico approaches for next-generation sequencing (NGS) data modeling have utility in the clinical laboratory as a tool for clinical assay validation. In silico NGS data can take a variety of forms, including pure simulated data or manipulated data files in which variants are inserted into existing data files. In silico data enable simulation of a range of variants that may be difficult to obtain from a single physical sample. Such data allow laboratories to more accurately test the performance of clinical bioinformatics pipelines without sequencing additional cases. For example, clinical laboratories may use in silico data to simulate low variant allele fraction variants to test the analytical sensitivity of variant calling software or simulate a range of insertion/deletion sizes to determine the performance of insertion/deletion calling software. In this article, the Working Group reviews the different types of in silico data with their strengths and limitations, methods to generate in silico data, and how data can be used in the clinical molecular diagnostic laboratory. Survey data indicate how in silico NGS data are currently being used. Finally, potential applications for which in silico data may become useful in the future are presented. "
879,29492577,"The aim of this study is to assess visually the impact of duration and intensity of cerebrovascular autoregulation insults on 6-month neurological outcome in severe traumatic brain injury. Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected minute-by-minute intracranial pressure (ICP) and mean arterial blood pressure data of 259 adult and 99 paediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients from multiple European centres. The relationship of the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale with cerebrovascular autoregulation insults (defined as the low-frequency autoregulation index above a certain threshold during a certain time) was visualized in a colour-coded plot. The analysis was performed separately for autoregulation insults occurring with cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) below 50 mmHg, with ICP above 25 mmHg and for the subset of adult patients that did not undergo decompressive craniectomy. The colour-coded plots showed a time-intensity-dependent association with outcome for cerebrovascular autoregulation insults in adult and paediatric TBI patients. Insults with a low-frequency autoregulation index above 0.2 were associated with worse outcomes and below -0.6 with better outcomes, with and approximately exponentially decreasing transition curve between the two intensity thresholds. All insults were associated with worse outcomes when CPP was below 50 mmHg or ICP was above 25 mmHg. The colour-coded plots indicate that cerebrovascular autoregulation is disturbed in a dynamic manner, such that duration and intensity play a role in the determination of a zone associated with better neurological outcome.

880,16613800,"Emmy Gut was a psychotherapist who developed, in her later years, a unique theory distinguishing between ""productive"" and ""unproductive"" depression. Dr. John Bowlby was a leading psychoanalyst famous for his work on attachment theory. After the death of her second husband, Emmy contacted John because his work on mourning and grief spoke to her own depressed state. Although her views of the world and of her relationship with John were clearly coloured by bouts of depression, she was profoundly influenced by her personal, therapeutic, and intellectual involvement with him. Evidence of his influence is seen in the volumes of correspondence flowing between them beginning in 1971 and continuing until John's death in 1990. During that time, Emmy wrote more than 100-some very lengthy-letters to John. Much of her correspondence was devoted to discussions about their often ambiguous and conflicted therapeutic relationship. Through an analysis of attachment theory and the nature of the client-therapist alliance, this paper offers insights into the effects that imbalances in power, expectations, and shifting needs can play in the recovery process.

881,9029988,"The trend of decreasing annual births in South Dakota continued with a decline to 10,470 live births in 1995. The state's infant mortality rate (IMR) of 9.5 per 1,000 live births for 1995 decreased from 9.6 in 1994, but has essentially varied little over the past nine years and is currently higher than the nation's rate of 7.5. Neonatal mortality (zero to 27 days of life) in South Dakota decreased to 5.2 in 1995 from 5.5 in 1994 with the decline attributable to fewer deaths of newborns of color. Nonetheless, similar to 1994 this rate is higher than the provisional national 1995 rate of 4.8. Post neonatal mortality in the state increased in 1995 among both whites and infants of color. An examination of causes of infant deaths in South Dakota shows that the state's rates of infant deaths due to congenital anomalies and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) exceed those noted nationally. The US Public Health Service's ""Back to Sleep"" campaign, initiated in 1994, is described as a contributor to the recent declining national rate of SIDS and its acceptance is urged as a preventive measure to decrease tragic loss of new life in South Dakota.

882,24132734,"Despite medical advances, children with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) remain at high risk of death or need for cardiac transplantation. We sought to identify predictors of disease progression in pediatric DCM. The Pediatric Heart Network evaluated chronic DCM patients with prospective echocardiographic and clinical data collection during an 18-month follow-up. Inclusion criteria were age <22 years and DCM disease duration >2 months. Patients requiring intravenous inotropic/mechanical support or listed status 1A/1B for transplant were excluded. Disease progression was defined as an increase in transplant listing status, hospitalization for heart failure, intravenous inotropes, mechanical support, or death. Predictors of disease progression were identified using Cox proportional hazards modeling and classification and regression tree analysis. Of the 127 patients, 28 (22%) had disease progression during the 18-month follow-up. Multivariable analysis identified older age at diagnosis (hazard ratio=1.14 per year; P<0.001), larger left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic M-mode dimension z-score (hazard ratio=1.49; P<0.001), and lower septal peak systolic tissue Doppler velocity z-score (hazard ratio=0.81; P=0.01) as independent predictors of disease progression. Classification and regression tree analysis stratified patients at risk of disease progression with 89% sensitivity and 94% specificity based on LV end-diastolic M-mode dimension z-score ≥7.7, LV ejection fraction <39%, LV inflow propagation velocity (color M-mode) z-score <-0.28, and age at diagnosis ≥8.5 months. In children with chronic stable DCM, a combination of diagnosis after late infancy and echocardiographic parameters of larger LV size and systolic and diastolic function predicted disease progression.

From color M-mode scans, propagation velocity (V Age-wise comparisons of diastolic filling from 121 echocardiograms in 31 infants showed V Comprehensive analysis of transmitral color M-mode data is feasible in infants, enabling calculation of pressure drop between the LV base and apex and strength of propagation from two distinct slopes. Profound changes very early followed by relatively constant filling mechanics in later infancy indicate significant LV maturation occurring during the first month of life. We implemented sophisticated analytic methods for color M-mode echocardiography in infants to assess age- and dimension-dependent changes in left ventricular diastolic function. Comprehensive characterization of transmitral color M-mode flow was feasible, enabling calculation of pressure drop between left ventricular base and apex and strength of propagation. Left ventricular diastolic filling function has predictable maturational progression, with significant differences in the intraventricular pressure between infants from birth to 2 years. This study forms the basis for future studies to examine alteration of early diastolic filling in congenital heart disease. "
884,11314094,"Surgeons are used to obtaining bone grafts of calvaria, which are abundant and available. The outer table of the parietal bone can be split, usually at the level of the diploic interstice, with an osteotome. Inadvertently violating the inner table and the dura leads some surgeons to avoid using the outer table in the elderly. Sullivan and Smith measured the thickness of the outer tables, diploe, and inner table of 37 cadavers (average age, 59 years) and found each layer to be well preserved distinctly. However, they suggested that calvaria become brittle in patients older than 50 years of age. The current authors hypothesized that diploic composition is not changed, even in the elderly. The thickest part of the parietal bone of 49 Koreans and 30 whites were acquired, and undecalcified slides were made. Via light microscopy, using the National Institutes of Health image, the following measurements were made: the thickness of the parietal bone (PT), outer table (OT), diploe (DT), and inner table (IT); trabecular bone volume percent (TBV); trabecular thickness (TT); and trabecular separation (TS). There was no significant difference in the thickness of the OT, DT, and IT of the PT, TBV, TT, and TS among different ages. The PTs of women were thicker than men's. The PTs of whites were significantly thicker than Koreans'. This study disclosed that the DT is not different among varying age groups and is not sclerosed in the persons older than 80 years, and the OT of these individuals is not brittle. Thus, surgeons do not need to hesitate when taking the OT of the PT in older patients. However, the selection of the site is attentive to PT. The thickest posteromedial part of the PT is favorable and safe as a donor. "
885,2042045,"The goal of this research was to evaluate the conventional means of clinical (mirror and probe examination) and radiological diagnosis (bitewing radiographs) of occlusal caries of first permanent molars during the post eruptive period. These teeth showed colored or non-colored fissures, and none of them had conservative or preventive obturations, or dentinal caries. Four experienced dentists independently evaluated the trials, diagnosed the lesions and advised a treatment. The effective lesions were shown by opening minimal preventive cavities, which were then obturated with amalgam. The results showed the lack of precision for the early diagnostic means of initial pit- and fissures-caries, and differences and errors of evaluation performed by the dental professional with respect to their diagnosis and proposed therapeutic choice. The effective lesions demonstrated the high incidence of pit- and fissure-caries in permanent molars during the post eruptive period. "
886,32140704,"Observational studies have linked low vitamin D status to unfavorable cardiometabolic risk markers, but double-blinded vitamin D intervention studies in children are scarce. The aim was to evaluate the effect of different doses of a vitamin D supplement on cardiometabolic risk markers in young healthy Swedish children with fair and dark skin. Cardiometabolic risk markers were analyzed as secondary outcomes of a double-blind, randomized, milk-based vitamin D intervention trial conducted during late fall and winter in 2 areas of Sweden (latitude 63°N and 55°N, respectively) in both fair- and dark-skinned 5- to 7-y-old children. During the 3-mo intervention, 206 children were randomly assigned to a daily milk-based vitamin D3 supplement of either 10 or 25 µg or placebo (2 µg; only at 55°N). Anthropometric measures, blood pressure, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, apoA-I, apoB, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were analyzed and non-HDL cholesterol calculated at baseline and after the intervention. At baseline, serum 25(OH)D was negatively associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure (β = -0.194; 95% CI: -0.153, -0.013; and β = -0.187; 95% CI: -0.150, -0.011, respectively). At follow-up, there was no statistically significant difference in any of the cardiometabolic markers between groups. We could not confirm any effect of vitamin D supplementation on serum lipids, blood pressure, or CRP in healthy 5- to 7-y-old children. The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01741324). "
887,35773743,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) and blackwater fever (BWF) are related but distinct renal complications of acute febrile illness in East Africa. The pathogenesis and prognostic significance of BWF and AKI are not well understood. A prospective observational cohort study was conducted to evaluate the association between BWF and AKI in children hospitalized with an acute febrile illness. Secondary objectives were to examine the association of AKI and BWF with (i) host response biomarkers and (ii) mortality. AKI was defined using the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria and BWF was based on parental report of tea-colored urine. Host markers of immune and endothelial activation were quantified on admission plasma samples. The relationships between BWF and AKI and clinical and biologic factors were evaluated using multivariable regression. We evaluated BWF and AKI in 999 children with acute febrile illness (mean age 1.7 years (standard deviation 1.06), 55.7% male). At enrollment, 8.2% of children had a history of BWF, 49.5% had AKI, and 11.1% had severe AKI. A history of BWF was independently associated with 2.18-fold increased odds of AKI (95% CI 1.15 to 4.16). When examining host response, severe AKI was associated with increased immune and endothelial activation (increased CHI3L1, sTNFR1, sTREM-1, IL-8, Angpt-2, sFlt-1) while BWF was predominantly associated with endothelial activation (increased Angpt-2 and sFlt-1, decreased Angpt-1). The presence of severe AKI, not BWF, was associated with increased risk of in-hospital death (RR, 2.17 95% CI 1.01 to 4.64) adjusting for age, sex, and disease severity. BWF is associated with severe AKI in children hospitalized with a severe febrile illness. Increased awareness of AKI in the setting of BWF, and improved access to AKI diagnostics, is needed to reduce disease progression and in-hospital mortality in this high-risk group of children through early implementation of kidney-protective measures.

888,21705885,"Septic shock heterogeneity has important implications for clinical trial implementation and patient management. We previously addressed this heterogeneity by identifying three putative subclasses of children with septic shock based exclusively on a 100-gene expression signature. Here we attempted to prospectively validate the existence of these gene expression-based subclasses in a validation cohort. Prospective observational study involving microarray-based bioinformatics. Multiple pediatric intensive care units in the United States. Separate derivation (n = 98) and validation (n = 82) cohorts of children with septic shock. None other than standard care. Gene expression mosaics of the 100 class-defining genes were generated for 82 individual patients in the validation cohort. Using computer-based image analysis, patients were classified into one of three subclasses (""A,"" ""B,"" or ""C"") based on color and pattern similarity relative to reference mosaics generated from the original derivation cohort. After subclassification, the clinical database was mined for phenotyping. Subclass A patients had higher illness severity relative to subclasses B and C as measured by maximal organ failure, fewer intensive care unit-free days, and a higher Pediatric Risk of Mortality score. Patients in subclass A were characterized by repression of genes corresponding to adaptive immunity and glucocorticoid receptor signaling. Separate subclass assignments were conducted by 21 individual clinicians using visual inspection. The consensus classification of the clinicians had modest agreement with the computer algorithm. We have validated the existence of subclasses of children with septic shock based on a biologically relevant, 100-gene expression signature. The subclasses have relevant clinical differences. "
889,20923464,"A thorough characterization of the morphological structure and physical properties is essential for an understanding of human hair. A number of techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy have been used to study hair surfaces. Recently, atomic force microscopy (AFM) has emerged as an ideal method for the non-invasive examination of hair surfaces. To investigate the effects of aging on normal Korean hair diameter and surface features using AFM. We enrolled 60 Korean volunteers of various ages who had no hair diseases. We analyzed hair diameter, AFM images of the hair surface, cuticular descriptors and micro-scale mechanical properties for their associations with aging. Hair diameter was found to increase for the first 20-30 years of life, after which it began to decrease. AFM images of most of the younger subjects showed typical step-like topographic properties with clear scale edges. The AFM images of most of the older subjects revealed dilapidated structures, poorly demarcated scale edges and undulated surfaces. Among the cuticular descriptors, surface roughness increased significantly with age. Force to distance analysis demonstrated a dependence on age. These results suggest that aging causes changes in hair diameter and surface structure. "

891,27265430,"Inherited optic neuropathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by mild to severe visual loss, colour vision deficit, central or paracentral visual field defects and optic disc pallor. Optic atrophies can be classified into isolated or non-syndromic and syndromic forms. While multiple modes of inheritance have been reported, autosomal dominant optic atrophy and mitochondrial inherited Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy are the most common forms. Optic atrophy type 1, caused by mutations in the OPA1 gene is believed to be the most common hereditary optic neuropathy, and most patients inherit a mutation from an affected parent. In this study we used whole-exome sequencing to investigate the genetic aetiology in a patient affected with isolated optic atrophy. Since the proband was the only affected individual in his extended family, and was a product of consanguineous marriage, homozygosity mapping followed by whole-exome sequencing were pursued. Exome results identified a novel de novo OPA1 mutation in the proband. We conclude, that though de novo OPA1 mutations are uncommon, testing of common optic atrophy-associated genes such as mitochondrial mutations and OPA1 gene sequencing should be performed first in single individuals presenting with optic neuropathy, even when dominant inheritance is not apparent.

892,23412859,"Primary adrenal insufficiency, or Addison's disease, is very rare in the pediatric population. The diagnosis of Addison's disease is usually suspected in the presence of hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, or when adrenal crisis develops. Pediatricians often are unaware of other presenting symptoms of the disease. As a consequence, diagnosis is often delayed by months and even years. One of the presenting signs of adrenal insufficiency is hyperpigmentation. We present the diagnosis of Addison's disease in an 11-year-old boy complaining of skin color changes that were misinterpreted as ""progressive cyanosis"". When skin color changes occur in a child, pediatricians should think of hyperpigmentation as a presenting sign of adrenal insufficiency. "
893,23617512,"Testicular torsion is a common acute condition in boys requiring prompt accurate management. The objective of this article was to evaluate ultrasound accuracy, findings, and clinical predictors in testicular torsion in boys presenting to the Stollery pediatric emergency department with acute scrotal pain. Retrospective review of surgical and emergency department ultrasound records for boys from 1 month to 17 years old presenting with acute scrotal pain from 2008 to 2011 was performed. Clinical symptoms, ultrasound and surgical findings, and diagnoses were recorded. Surgical results and follow-up were used as the reference standard. Of 342 patients who presented to the emergency department with acute scrotum, 35 had testicular torsion. Of 266 ultrasound examinations performed, 29 boys had torsion confirmed by surgery. The false-positive rate for ultrasound was 2.6%, and there were no false-negative findings. Mean times from presentation at the emergency department to ultrasound and surgery were 209.4 and 309.4 minutes, respectively. Of the torsed testicles, 69% were salvageable. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for testicular torsion were 100%, 97.9%, and 98.1%, respectively. Sonographic heterogeneity was seen in 80% of nonviable testes at surgery and 58% of patients with viable testes (p = 0.41). Sudden-onset scrotal pain (88%), abnormal position (86%), and absent cremasteric reflex (91%) were most prevalent in torsion patients. Color Doppler ultrasound is accurate and sensitive for diagnosis of torsion in the setting of acute scrotum. Despite heterogeneity on preoperative ultrasound, many testes were considered to be salvageable at surgery. The salvage rate of torsed testes was high. "

We present five cases in which t(9;11), complex t(8;22), t(12;21) and t(11;14) were detected primarily using M-FISH and were confirmed using locus-specific probes. We conclude that M-FISH can be effective in complete characterization of critical gene rearrangements in haematological disorders. "
895,30770639,"Three-dimensional (3D) printing has been used to support organ transplantations. However, whether it helps remains unclear. This study aimed to present and assess the application of 3D-printed liver models in pediatric living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). The 3D images were printed to touchable liver models with transparent liver parenchyma, specifically colored hepatic vessels, and biliary structures. A total of 30 consecutive recipients were enrolled in the study: 10 were operated on with the support of 3D printing (3D-printing group) and 20 (control group) were operated on without it. Detailed photographs and data of the cases in the 3D-printing group were presented. One patient underwent auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation using the left lobe graft, in which the abdominal cavity model was also printed to test whether the planned graft fit the recipient's abdominal cavity. The 3D-printed models facilitated surgical planning and procedures, particularly in the management of hepatic veins and in the prevention of large-for-size syndrome. The operative time of donors in the 3D-printing group was significantly shorter compared with the control group (2.3 ± 0.4 versus 3.0 ± 0.4 hours; P < 0.001). Inpatient costs for donors in the 3D-printing group were 17.1% lower than those in the control group (34.6 ± 6.6 versus 41.7 ± 10.4 thousand ¥; P = 0.03). In conclusion, in small infants and complicated pediatric LDLT patients, 3D-printed models can help minimize the risk of large-for-size syndrome and graft reduction. The 3D-printed models may be conducive to liver graft procurement and intraoperative assistance in pediatric LDLT. "
896,30521412,"Advances in genetic sequencing and other diagnostic technologies have enabled the use of precision medicine in clinical cancer care, as well as the development of novel therapies that are targeted to specific molecular drivers of cancer. Developing these new agents and making them accessible to patients requires global clinical studies and regulatory review and approval by different national regulatory agencies. Whereas these global trials present challenges for drug developers who conduct them and regulatory agencies who oversee them, they also raise practical issues about patients with low-frequency cancers who need these therapies. A lack of uniform standards in both regulatory approval for marketing and reimbursement for approved agents across countries may make the newly developed agent either unavailable or inaccessible to patients in certain countries or regions, even if patients from those countries or regions participated in the clinical research that established the safety and efficacy of the agent. In an effort to further understand and address this need, we convened an international workshop in 2017 in North Bethesda, MD. After presentations of the individual regulatory pathways for marketing approval and reimbursement for individual nations, participants discussed expedited pathways and specific challenges for uncommon cancers. As a matter of justice, agents being developed for rare cancers, pediatric cancers, or uncommon molecular subsets of common cancers need a pragmatic, science-based regulatory policy framework to clearly specify the type and quantity of evidence needed to demonstrate efficacy from these trials and evidence to support accessibility.

897,9111583,"Peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at onset were studied for the expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor alpha-chain (CD25) by two-color flow-cytometric analysis. Stimulated with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) alone. CD25 expression was significantly suppressed in CD4+ T cells from 27 of 48 (56.3%) cases and in CD8+ T cells from 29 of 48 (60.4%) cases. When stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), CD25 expression was clearly restored in certain cases of ALL. When PMA plus ionomycin were used for stimulation of T cells. CD25 was inducible in a majority of cases. Interestingly CD25 expression upon anti-CD3 mAb stimulation was recovered after complete remission had been achieved. These observations suggest the presence in ALL children at onset of an in vitro defect in the signal transduction pathway of the T-cell-receptor/CD3 complex, resulting in inefficient CD25 expression. However, immune-staining analysis indicated that protein kinase C was normally translocated from the cytosol fraction to the cell membrane fraction. The mobilization of cytoplasmic free calcium is also normal. "
898,11045984,"Our goal was to establish normal values for quantitative color kinesis indexes of left ventricular (LV) wall motion over a wide range of ages, which are required for objective diagnosis of regional systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Color-encoded images were obtained in 194 normal subjects (95 males, 99 females, age 2 mo to 79 yr) in four standard views. Quantitative indexes of magnitude and timing of systolic and diastolic function were studied for age- and gender-related differences. Normal limits of all ejection and filling indexes were in a narrow range (< or =25% of the mean), with no major gender-related differences. Despite invariable ejection fractions, both peak filling and ejection rates decreased with age (30 and 20%, correspondingly) with a concomitant increase in mean filling and ejection times, resulting in five- and twofold increases in the late to early filling and ejection ratios, correspondingly. Diastolic asynchrony increased with age (from 4.7 +/- 2.0 to 6.4 +/- 3.2 from the 2nd to 7th decade). The normal values of color kinesis indexes should allow objective detection of regional LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction. "
899,33443377,"Carmine is a natural red dye that may cause allergic contact dermatitis. The aim of this study was to analyze patch test reactions to carmine (2.5% in petrolatum) and characterize carmine-positive patients. This study conducted a retrospective analysis of North American Contact Dermatitis Group data compiled between 2011 and 2012. Of 4240 patients patch tested to carmine, 132 (3.1%) had reactions with a final interpretation of ""allergic"" (positive). Carmine-positive patients were significantly more likely to be female (77.7% vs 68.3%; P = 0.0237) and have a final primary diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis (74.8% vs 47.2%; P < 0.0001). As compared with carmine-negative patients, carmine-positive patients were significantly more likely to have involvement of all facial sites combined (48.1% vs 29.9%; P < 0.0001) and the lips (7.6% vs 3.6%; P = 0.0166). At final reading, most carmine reactions were weak (+; 64.9%). Approximately half (53.4%) were currently clinically relevant; identified sources were primarily personal care products (77.1%), especially makeup (31.4%) and lip products (8.6%). Weak patch test reactions to carmine should be interpreted with caution. Allergic contact dermatitis to carmine should be suspected in women with facial and/or lip dermatitis, especially those using carmine-containing cosmetics. "
900,32514618,"Patients with pediatric cancers such as neuroblastoma (NB) are often unresponsive to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. One major factor in pediatric tumor resistance to immunotherapy is considered to be the low mutation rate of pediatric tumors. Another factor may be the overexpression of additional inhibitory pathways. While analyzing the RNA-sequencing database TARGET, we found that human NB tumors overexpress immune checkpoint molecule CD200. To determine its significance and impact on tumor immune microenvironment, we analyzed 49 cases of previously untreated, surgically removed NB tumors using immunohistochemistry and multi-color flow cytometry (FACS). We found that CD200 is overexpressed in more than 90% of NB tumors. In the tumor microenvironment of NB, CD200 is mainly overexpressed in CD45 "

The authors searched the literature for evidence of 1) if TCD provides useful information in specific clinical settings; 2) if using this information improves clinical decision making, as reflected by improved patient outcomes; and 3) if TCD is preferable to other diagnostic tests in these clinical situations. TCD is of established value in the screening of children aged 2 to 16 years with sickle cell disease for stroke risk (Type A, Class I) and the detection and monitoring of angiographic vasospasm after spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (Type A, Class I to II). TCD and TCCS provide important information and may have value for detection of intracranial steno-occlusive disease (Type B, Class II to III), vasomotor reactivity testing (Type B, Class II to III), detection of cerebral circulatory arrest/brain death (Type A, Class II), monitoring carotid endarterectomy (Type B, Class II to III), monitoring cerebral thrombolysis (Type B, Class II to III), and monitoring coronary artery bypass graft operations (Type B to C, Class II to III). Contrast-enhanced TCD/TCCS can also provide useful information in right-to-left cardiac/extracardiac shunts (Type A, Class II), intracranial occlusive disease (Type B, Class II to IV), and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease (Type B, Class II to IV), although other techniques may be preferable in these settings.

903,21073484,"Classical eyeblink conditioning (EBC) involves contingent temporal pairing of a conditioned stimulus (e.g., tone) with an unconditioned stimulus (e.g., air puff). Impairment of EBC has been demonstrated in studies of alcohol-exposed animals and in children exposed prenatally at heavy levels. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was diagnosed by expert dysmorphologists in a large sample of Cape Coloured, South African children. Delay EBC was examined in a new sample of 63 children at 11.3 years, and trace conditioning in 32 of the same children at 12.8 years. At each age, 2 sessions of 50 trials each were administered on the same day; 2 more sessions the next day, for children not meeting criterion for conditioning. Six of 34 (17.6%) children born to heavy drinkers were diagnosed with FAS, 28 were heavily exposed nonsyndromal (HE), and 29 were nonexposed controls. Only 33.3% with FAS and 42.9% of HE met criterion for delay conditioning, compared with 79.3% of controls. The more difficult trace conditioning task was also highly sensitive to fetal alcohol exposure. Only 16.7% of the FAS and 21.4% of HE met criterion for trace conditioning, compared with 66.7% of controls. The magnitude of the effect of diagnostic group on trace conditioning was not greater than the effect on short delay conditioning, findings consistent with recent rat studies. Longer latency to onset and peak eyeblink CR in exposed children indicated poor timing and failure to blink in anticipation of the puff. Extended training resulted in some but not all of the children reaching criterion. These data showing alcohol-related delay and trace conditioning deficits extend our earlier findings of impaired EBC in 5-year-olds to school-age. Alcohol-related impairment in the cerebellar circuitry required for both forms of conditioning may be sufficient to account for the deficit in both tasks. Extended training was beneficial for some exposed children. EBC provides a well-characterized model system for assessment of degree of cerebellar-related learning and memory dysfunction in fetal alcohol exposed children. "

905,21550692,"Morphea (circumcripted cutaneous scleroderma) can be difficult to assess for lesion activity. Because variable-frequency ultrasound with color Doppler provides details of skin morphology and function, it may help in the categorization of morphea. We sought to evaluate color Doppler ultrasound as a probing tool for assessing activity in morphea lesions. Consecutive patients with cutaneous morphea referred by dermatologists were studied with color Doppler ultrasound, and the assessment of lesion activity was compared with histologic findings. Normal skin controls were obtained by performing ultrasound scans of healthy subjects or of unaffected areas of the patients themselves. Measurements included cutaneous layer thickness, relative echogenicity, and blood flow with peak systolic velocity. Ultrasound sensitivity and specificity were determined for each phase of morphea activity and the results correlated with histology. Fifty-one patients had a total of 104 morphea lesions. Of the lesions, 20% were active, 22% were atrophic, and 58% were inactive. Five of the patients had the Parry-Romberg syndrome with ipsilateral parotid gland inflammatory involvement, and one had an asymptomatic but sonographically active morphea lesion. Sensitivity and specificity for ultrasound diagnosis were 100% and 98.8%, respectively. The most accurate sonographic signs of lesion activity were increased subcutaneous tissue echogenicity and increased cutaneous blood flow (sensitivity and specificity 100% and 100% for each one). Ultrasound cannot define lesions less than 0.1-mm deep. The morphologic and functional data obtained noninvasively and in real time with color Doppler ultrasound provide new insight into the pathogenesis of morphea. The technique represents a useful counterpart to histologic examination for the assessment of lesion activity. "

The influence of the variables place of residence, age, sex, fish and seafood consumption, number of dental amalgam fillings, hair color, parents' occupation, and smoking habits of the household members was also examined. The geometric mean mercury concentration in hair was 0.77 microgram/g. The place of residence, sex, and the frequency in consuming fish and seafood were the variables that significantly affected hair mercury concentrations. Girls had more mercury in their hair than boys, whereas hair mercury levels were significantly correlated with the frequency in the fish and seafood consumption, with the levels being more elevated when the fish and seafood consumption was also higher. Hair mercury concentrations were also affected by the place of residence, with school children of Flix showing lower mercury concentrations than those found in children from Tarragona and Tortosa.

909,30783257,"To assess the effect of reduced contrast sensitivity on three commonly used colour vision tests in order to establish key discrepancies that may be relevant for clinical practice. A prospective non-interventional clinical study of colour vision testing using three commonly used devices: Ishihara and Hardy-Rand-Rittler (H-R-R) pseudoisocochromatic plate tests, and Farnsworth D-15 arrangement test performed under progressively reduced contrast sensitivity conditions achieved with a neutral density filter bar. The Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity (PRCS) at which 5% of the population should first experience a 10% reduction in colour vision testing from baseline was calculated for each of the three colour vision devices: Farnsworth D-15 test: 1.81 log contrast sensitivity (CS), H-R-R test: 1.69 log CS, and Ishihara test: 1.34 log CS. Single factor repeated measures analyses, conducted separately at each contrast sensitivity level, revealed no difference between the colour vision testing devices at PRCS ≥1.80 log CS (P ≥ 0.367). However, in all PRCS ≤1.65 log CS, the differences were statistically significant (all P ≤ 0.004), demonstrating a significantly lower percentage of errors in the Ishihara test compared with both the Farnsworth D-15 (P < 0.023) and H-R-R (P < 0.035) tests. At high contrast sensitivities, all colour vision tests function almost equally; however, at decreased levels of contrast sensitivity, H-R-R and Farnsworth D-15 are more greatly affected. "

911,18537996,"The introduction of surgical techniques provided a major development in the management of resistant vitiligo and replaced other conventional unsuccessful therapies. Most of these procedures require special devices and experience that prevent many dermatologists from utilizing them. The aim of this work is to evaluate the introduction of a new simple technique that can be used in epithelial grafting for recalcitrant patches of vitiligo. Twenty vitiligo patients, nonresponding to classic phototherapy, were candidates in this study. A simple Chinese cupping device was used to induce blisters on the inner aspect of the thighs of the patients and the resulting blister roofs were used for grafting on dermabraded vitiliginous patches. The patients were followed up for 1 year. Blister roofs induced by Chinese cupping were able to repigment vitiliginous patches in 80% of the patients with admirable coloring match, and the donor areas did not show any cosmetic disfigurement at the end of the study. In conclusion, Chinese cupping is a simple and easy-to-use method to obtain epithelial grafts for vitiligo management. The author has indicated no significant interest with commercial supporters. "
912,27654560,"Rationale and key points An objective assessment of the patient's vision is important to assess variation from 'normal' vision in acute and community settings, to establish a baseline before examination and treatment in the emergency department, and to assess any changes during ophthalmic outpatient appointments. » Vision is one of the essential senses that permits people to make sense of the world. » Visual assessment does not only involve measuring central visual acuity, it also involves assessing the consequences of reduced vision. » Assessment of vision in children is crucial to identify issues that might affect vision and visual development, and to optimise lifelong vision. » Untreatable loss of vision is not an inevitable consequence of ageing. » Timely and repeated assessment of vision over life can reduce the incidence of falls, prevent injury and optimise independence.

This prospective observational study was conducted in the Department of Pediatrics, PGIMER and the associated Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi from August to December 2010. The study included 67 children (ages 3 months-14 years) who satisfied the WHO criteria for the diagnosis of probable dengue fever with warning signs or severe dengue and tested positive for dengue via immunoglobulin-M (IgM) capture enzyme-linked immunoassay (MAC-ELISA). The patients were subjected to a complete blood count, liver function tests, renal profile, electrocardiography, myocardial band enzymes of creatine phosphokinase (CPK-MB), chest x-ray, abdomen ultrasonography, and two-dimensional echocardiography with color-flow Doppler mapping. Ejection fraction and Tei index measurements were performed. Significantly fewer patients with severe dengue were found to have myocardial involvement at admission by ejection fraction (48 %) and E/E' (37 %), than by the Tei index (70 %). Of the 67 patients with severe dengue, one died, giving a case fatality rate of 1.5 %. At discharge, the Tei index persisted on the high side for patients with myocardial involvement, whereas the ejection fraction improved for the majority of them. Most of the patients with severe dengue had asymptomatic myocarditis, as evident by a deranged Tei index, which improved but did not normalize by the time of discharge, necessitating a longer follow-up period. For the majority of the patients, inotropic support was not required to maintain hemodynamic stability. "

We prospectively enrolled 758 children, 6-18 years old, who presented with DKA in a randomized multisite clinical trial evaluating intravenous fluid protocols for DKA treatment. DKA was moderate/severe in 430 children and mild in 328 children. A total of 392 children with DKA had new onset of type 1 diabetes, and the rest were previously diagnosed. Neurocognitive assessment occurred 2-6 months after the DKA episode. A comparison group of 376 children with type 1 diabetes, but no DKA exposure, was also enrolled. Among all patients, moderate/severe DKA was associated with lower intelligence quotient (IQ) (β = -0.12,  A single DKA episode is associated with subtle memory declines soon after type 1 diabetes diagnosis.

To describe and report a ""lateral"" (lateral to medial) approach for US-guided intraarticular hip injection. Cadaveric investigation. Academic institution, department of anatomy. One cadaveric specimen. Both hips of a single cadaver were injected using the US-guided lateral approach. In the left hip, the needle was inserted and kept in situ. The right hip was injected with white-colored water-diluted latex dye. Subsequently, a layer-by-layer anatomical dissection was performed. Presence and distribution of latex dye and location of needle tip within the joint capsule of the hip. Anatomical dissection of the left and right hips confirmed the correct intraarticular position of the needle tip and the placement of the latex dye, respectively. During layer-by-layer dissection of the left hip, positions of the lateral cutaneous nerve and the lateral circumflex femoral artery were observed anterior to the needle, 30 mm for the nerve and 8 mm for the artery. This preliminary study demonstrated that the US-guided lateral approach is a convenient technique to access the hip joint in a cadaveric specimen. Compared with the ""classical"" anterior technique, the lateral approach may provide several advantages, including improved needle visibility, theoretically decreased risk of vascular injury, and less risk of needle contamination. Because injury to the lateral epiphyseal arteries is possible when lateral approach is used, caution is required, especially in children.

919,7925538,"We describe an alternative technique using color flow Doppler sonography (CFDS) for detection of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). Twenty-one children, ages 2-16 years, were investigated for VUR using voiding cystourethrography (VCU) and CFDS. Forty-two ureterovesical junctions were studied and a total of 27 were found to be refluxing at VCU. Five of these 21 patients were operated for VUR and they were also reevaluated 3 and 6 months after the operation. With good diuresis ureteric jets could easily be detected with CFDS and if there was a reflux of urine into the ureter this could also be displayed. Afterwards, the patient was asked to urinate and if reflux into the ureter was detected, particular attention was paid to the detection of ureteral and pelvicalyceal dilatation by conventional gray-scale sonography. Taking VCU as the gold standard, CFDS revealed reflux in all cases except 1. There were 3 patients who had only one-sided reflux at VCU and bilateral reflux at CFDS examination (false-positive: 20%). Correlation of CFDS and VCU was 90, 100 and 75% in low grade, grade III and grade IV reflux, respectively. The results of CFDS correlated well with the results of VCU during the follow-up of 5 patients who had antireflux operations. As a conclusion, CFDS could be used as an adjunct to standard ultrasonography for detection of VUR. "

To contribute to the long term outcomes of ASD device closure with the STARFlex device. Results of a prospective FDA approved clinical trial (1999-2001) from a single institution of the STARFlex device for simple ASD was reviewed. The inclusion criteria included age >or=2 years, isolated secundum ASD, evidence of right ventricular volume overload, and maximum stretched diameter <22 mm. A retrospective review of the original study data with most recent follow-up was performed. Clinical success in the trial was defined as complete closure or residual leak <or=2 mm, absence of a severe complication and no need for an additional device or surgery to treat the ASD. Twenty seven (27) patients were prospectively enrolled in the study period with a procedural success in 23 (85%). There were two severe complications, both 40 mm device embolizations that underwent semiurgent surgical intervention for device removal and ASD closure (40 mm device subsequently withdrawn from trial). Device placement was unsuccessful in two patients due to malposition related to an insufficient retro-aortic rim, with elective surgical closure. Unsuccessful procedural outcomes were statistically associated with deficient rims (P < 0.01). Of the 23 long term follow-up device patients, 23 (100%) achieved clinical success: 22 (96%) had complete closure at 1 year and latest echocardiographic follow-up and one case had a small <2 mm residual defect that has persisted. There have been no late complications with normalization of RV volumes in 92% and no deleterious ECG changes. Device fractures occurred in 8/23 (35%) devices and were more common in the larger devices (P < 0.05) but had no sequelae. None required any further intervention to treat the ASD and there were no infectious or thrombotic issues. In this cohort the STARFlex device for secundum ASD closure provided procedural success in 85% with failures due to surgical referral. All 23 patients with a STARFlex device with available long term follow-up had clinical success. Further long term data is required. "

The development of dentition can also be affected by a number of systemic factors and metabolic diseases such as porphyria. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), also known as Gunther's disease, is a metabolic disease caused by a transformation in the gene that codifies uroporphyrinogen-3 synthesis, leading to porphyrin aggregation in urine, skin, bone, and dentin. A 21-month-old girl with erythrodontia was referred to Paediatric Dentistry Department in September 2017. A physical examination revealed blisters on her face, nose, hands, and feet. Laboratory findings showed highly elevated urine total uroporphyrin and total coproporphyrin I and III levels. Next-generation sequencing multigene panel testing for porphyria demonstrated a homozygous c.10C>T (p.L4F) mutation in the UROS gene. For curative therapy, the patient was admitted to the allogeneic bone marrow transplantation program. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria most commonly presents in the first few years of life. Manifestations can include reddish-colored urine, skin blistering, scarring, and erythrodontia. A timely diagnosis can prevent undesirable skin findings of the disease and death due to hematological involvement before a curative allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is performed. "

Ophthalmological examination revealed pigmented verrucous lesions on her upper and lower eyelids bilaterally. The patient had a history of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Dermatological examination revealed hyperpigmented verrucous plaques arranged along lines of Blaschko on the neck, trunk, and arms. On the basis of these findings, the diagnosis of epidermal nevus syndrome (ENS) was made. She had surgery for debulking of the lesions. Histological analysis revealed hyperkeratosis with foci of parakeratosis, acanthosis, and papillomatosis, consistent with linear verrucous epidermal nevus. Postoperative residual lesions did not respond to oral acitretin therapy (10 mg/kg/day for 2 months). Systematized ENS can rarely cause linear verrucous nevi on the upper and lower eyelids on both sides.

If Tay-Sachs disease, diabetes, hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease or other genetic diseases can be cured or prevented by ""gene surgery,"" then it is certainly permitted in Jewish law. Genetic premarital screening is encouraged in Judaism for the purpose of discouraging at-risk marriages for a fatal illness such as Tay-Sachs disease. Neonatal screening for treatable conditions such as phenylketonuria is certainly desirable and perhaps required in Jewish law. Preimplantation screening and the implantation of only ""healthy"" zygotes into the mother's womb to prevent the birth of an affected child are probably sanctioned in Jewish law. Whether or not these assisted reproduction techniques may be used to choose the sex of one's offspring, to prevent the birth of a child with a sex-linked disease such as hemophilia, has not yet been ruled on by modern rabbinic decisions. Prenatal screening with the specific intent of aborting an affected fetus is not allowed according to most rabbinic authorities, although a minority view permits it ""for great need.""

We report the case of a paediatric female patient with Berdon Syndrome with symptoms consistent with urinary tract infection and purple urine discolouration. Urine test revealed leukocyturia and bacteriuria. Several risk factors have been proposed regarding this syndrome. Among them the commonest are female gender, advanced age, kind of diet (increased dietary tryptophan), alkaline urine and diverse situations that leads to urinary retentions which allows bacteria to work on their substrate for a longer time. Although it is a process that is not associated with gravity, recognizing it is important as treatment is simple and can minimize patient and family distress. "
929,37547118,"Peripheral venous cannulation (PIVC) is one of the most common needle procedures associated with the therapies of pediatric patients, which causes pain and anxiety in children. Trace Image and Coloring for Kids-Book (TICK-B) is one of the arts-based interventions to relieve pain and anxiety, but none of the existing studies use the TICK-B to decrease children's pain intensity and anxiety levels during PICV. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the Trace Image and Coloring for Kids-Book (TICK-B) in decreasing children's pain and anxiety during PIVC. A parallel, randomized, double-blind controlled trial was used in this study. Children aged 6-12 years were randomly allocated to one of two groups: intervention or control. The intervention group ( Patients in the intervention group reported significantly reduced pain levels than those in the control group ( TICK-B is an effective technique for reducing children's pain and anxiety during PIVC. TICK-B is a simple, inexpensive, and effective technique that nurses can use to decrease the levels of pain and anxiety of pediatric patients during intravenous cannulation. "
930,16549217,"While investigators have reported that patients with GJB2-associated deafness and cochlear implants have preferable language development, the mechanisms of this phenomenon remains unknown. The goal of the present study was to assess higher brain functions of patients with GJB2-related and GJB2-unrelated deafness as a method of evaluating language development. Eight children with cochlear implants were subjected to genetic testing for GJB2 and underwent the Raven colored progressive matrices test, Rey's auditory verbal learning test, Rey's complex figure test, the standardized language test for aphasia, the picture vocabulary test, and the standardized comprehension test for abstract words. Three children were diagnosed with GJB2-related deafness, and five children were diagnosed with GJB2-unrelated deafness. All three GJB2-related cases demonstrated normal range higher brain functions and fair language development. By contrast, one GJB2-unrelated case showed a semantic disorder, another demonstrated a visual cognitive disorder with dyslexia, and another had attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder. Children with GJB2-unrelated deafness showed a high frequency of heterogeneous disorders that can affect proper language development. This difference between children with GJB2-related and GJB2-unrelated deafness may account for the improved language development in children with GJB2-related deafness and cochlear implants. Further, genetic diagnosis of the non-syndromic hearing loss represents a useful tool for the preoperative prediction of outcomes following a cochlear implant procedure. "
931,31357209,"Racism, segregation, and inequality contribute to health outcomes and drive health disparities across the life course, including for newborn infants and their families. In this review, we address their effects on the health and well-being of newborn infants and their families with a focus on preterm birth. We discuss three causal pathways: increased risk; lower-quality care; and socioeconomic disadvantages that persist into infancy, childhood, and beyond. For each pathway, we propose specific interventions and research priorities that may remedy the adverse effects of racism, segregation, and inequality. Infants and their families will not realize the full benefit of advances in perinatal and neonatal care until we, collectively, accept our responsibility for addressing the range of determinants that shape long-term outcomes.

932,20659179,"A common clinical finding is that many schoolchildren display a nonacceptable oral hygiene. To evaluate the tooth-brushing behaviour in children aged 6-12 years. The study used a cross-sectional descriptive design. Children aged 6, 8, 10, and 12 years in an elementary school in a middle class area in Umeå, a city in northern Sweden, were invited and 82 (82%) consented. Visible plaque on buccal surfaces of incisors and canines was recorded from photographs of the participant's teeth before and after brushing using the scores of the Green and Vermillion Oral Hygiene Index. Brushing technique was recorded with a video camera. A questionnaire was used to collect data about oral hygiene habits at home. The ratio between the sum of plaque scores after and before brushing was statistically significantly higher in the 6-year-old group compared with the 10-year olds, (P < 0.05). There was a negative correlation between time spent for brushing and the ratio between the sum of plaque scores after and before brushing (r = -0.31, P < 0.01). The lowest correlation was displayed in the youngest age group (r = 0.07, P > 0.05). Six-year olds spent statistically significantly less time for brushing than older children (P < 0.05). Plaque removal from buccal surfaces from brushing was poor and averaged 19% for 6-year olds and 30% for older children. The results of brushing for children aged 8-12 years could benefit from increasing tooth-brushing time. Children could be given an increasing responsibility from 7 to 8 year of age but parental help is motivated up to 10 years of age. "
933,24303754,"To observe the expression and distribution of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and caspase-3 in myocardium of persons who died from viral myocarditis and to explore its pathogenesis and death mechanism. Twenty cases died from viral myocarditis were selected as the experimental group. Ten cases died from traumatic shock and massive hemorrhage shock after traffic accidents were selected as the control group. The sections of myocardium were stained by immunohistochemistry for VCAM-1 and caspase-3, and observed under microscope. The positive expressions of VCAM-1 and caspase-3 of the two groups were compared with each other by image analysis and statistical analysis. (1) The vascular endothelial cells expressed VCAM-1 with dark-brown colors in the experimental group, and weak expression was observed in the control group. The average optical density in the experimental group was higher than that in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). (2) The caspase-3 positive cells were mostly inflammatory cells around the myocardial vessels with brown-red granules in the experimental group. The positive cell number in the experimental group was higher than that in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). VCAM-1 may play an important role in the inflammatory cells exudation caused by viral myocarditis, and may provide the reference for diagnosis of viral myocarditis in forensic pathology. However, the myocardial apoptosis mediated by caspase-3 doesn't affect the lethal mechanism in the late stage of viral myocarditis. "
934,32166705,"Since the beginning of this century, the use of postmortem computed tomography (PMCT) in forensic autopsies has increased. In this study we examined how similar dental charts created using PMCT as a solitary examination mode were to dental charts created using the conventional method of a clinical inspection including intraoral radiographs. A total of 100 previously performed dental identification cases were retrospectively included in the study. For each case, a dental chart was created solely based upon PMCT. The PMCT based dental chart was subsequently compared with the chart created from the previous conventional identification examination. Based upon the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values PMCT performed very well compared to the conventional method in the identification concerning presence or absence of teeth, the presence of crowns, bridges and endodontic treatments as well as the presence and types of fillings. PMCT performed poorly concerning the extension of fillings and identification of small, tooth-colored fillings. The use of PMCT is a valuable supplement to the conventional methods available for forensic odontologists and may be of great value for initial screening in mass fatalities. "
935,19040933,"Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has only been recently used for childhood neoplasms. We reviewed all patients younger than 19 years who underwent SLNB for 5 years. Twenty patients were identified (11 male, 9 female). Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed for 10 sarcomas (5 synovial, 3 rhabdomyosarcoma, 1 epitheliod, 1 other); 9 skin neoplasms (4 melanomas, 3 Spitz nevi, 2 melanocytomas); and 1 acinic cell carcinoma. All patients underwent Technetium 99m sulfur microcolloid injection and 4-quadrant subdermal injection with Lymphazurin 1% (Autosuture, Norwalk, Conn). Six patients required either sedation for lymphoscintigraphy. Intraoperative gamma probe was used. Primary lesions were found in lower extremity (n = 8), upper extremity (n = 6), trunk (n = 3), and head and neck (n = 3). The lymphatic basins were inguinal (n = 8), axilla (n = 8), neck (n = 3), and both inguinal and axilla (n = 1). At least one lymph node was identified in each procedure. Of 20 patients, 5 (25%) had metastatic disease (4 skin neoplasms and 1 sarcoma). There were no complications in our series, and all patients are alive with no recurrence at an average follow-up of 2.2 years. Sentinel lymph node biopsy allows for an accurate biopsy in children. However, some younger patients may require sedation, and it may be more challenging to isolate the sentinel node. "
936,39428149,"Environmental racism poses a significant threat to child health. It is a major contributor to disproportionate exposure to environmental hazards that are linked to adverse health outcomes. This narrative review shows the profound impact that environmental racism poses to healthy child development through 3 examples. Historical redlining provides compelling evidence of how historical policies continue to influence neighborhoods' physical and social conditions. Exploring chemicals in beauty products reveals how anti-Black perceptions of beauty work to expose children of color to endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Finally, by exploring childhood lead exposure, we see how decades of inequitable implementation of lead exposure prevention policies contribute to persistent disparities in the United States today. Fixing these structural issues is complex and will require political will and investment. Yet, individual clinicians play an important role in their local communities in protecting children from the harms of environmental racism, through education, genuine collaboration with the community, and advocacy.

937,28426528,"Disseminating cells of a primary solid tumor may represent the origin of metastases and relapses. We aimed at comparing the diagnostic efficacy of multicolor flow cytometry (MFC) and morphology/immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the detection of disseminated tumor cells in the bone marrow (BM) and body fluids of patients with solid tumors, and in pediatric neuroblastoma cases. We investigated 72 samples retrospecively from 50 patients by MFC. Morphology/IHC data were available in 48 cases. In the first cohort, 36 samples derived from 34 patients with various forms of suspected and proven solid tumors and in the second cohort, 36 samples of 16 children with suspected and proven neuroblastoma were analyzed at diagnosis or during follow-up in a 4-color setting by MFC, and the results were compared with those obtained by IHC. In the group of various solid tumors, we found 91% concordance between IHC and MFC, and it was 65% in the neuroblastoma group, and 77% overall. Detection of disseminated tumor cells was found to be more effective by MFC in de novo neuroblastoma samples (100% vs. 86%). The advantage of MFC was even more pronounced when minimal residual disease was evaluated (efficacy, 92% vs. 68%). In contrast, efficacy of IHC was 100% in the group of various solid tumors, whereas it was 91% for MFC. We conclude that MFC and IHC are both essential tools for examining infiltration of BM and body fluids by disseminating solid tumor cells. In the case of neuroblastoma, however, minimal residual disease detection by MFC in a hypoplastic/aplastic BM environment was more effective than IHC, as considerably more cells could be analyzed. "
938,16136750,"Intralesional fibrous septum (IFS), a histologic architecture that is typical of chordoma, consists of proliferating spindle-shaped, fibroblast-like cells with an abundance of collagen fibers. However, the histogenesis of IFS is still controversial. In a series of 122 chordomas, special emphasis was placed on the morphology of host tissues involved in IFS and on a transition between IFS and neighboring tissues. In 23 lesions, IFS was also characterized both histochemically and immunohistochemically. IFS was observed in 79 (64.8%) lesions. Occasionally, IFS contained bone fragments and hyalinized matrix with no lining of osteoblastic cells, suggesting degenerated rather than metaplastic bone tissue. Moreover, IFS occasionally showed a direct transition to host bone trabeculae. Histochemically and immunohistochemically, IFS included calcium deposits positive for Alizarin red S staining and expressed both type I and type III collagen. In extraosseous lesions extending to the adjacent soft tissues, IFS frequently involved muscle fibers or peripheral nerve fibers and displayed a smooth transition to neighboring soft tissues. We believe that IFS is induced by a tumor-host interaction that is based on the host bone trabeculae in intraosseous lesions or on soft tissues in extraosseous lesions. "
939,27747797,"Infantile hemangiomas are the most common childhood vascular tumors, occurring in 10 % of children aged less than 1 year. Propranolol, a β-adrenergic blocker mainly indicated for hypertension, has proven effective in treating these types of tumors. To evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of propranolol in Mexican pediatric patients diagnosed with infantile hemangioma, treated with an extemporaneously compounded solution of propranolol. An open prospective observational study at the Children's Hospital of the Californias in Tijuana, Mexico was performed on ambulatory pediatric patients between the ages of 3 and 12 months diagnosed with infantile hemangioma. Patients were treated with an oral solution of propranolol in doses ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 mg/kg/day. Children were monitored monthly by the physician in charge, at which time clinical and treatment data were collected. Over a period of 20 months, 31 patients were treated (36 % male and 64 % female).The majority of hemangiomas were superficial (55 %), located mainly on the face. Treatment had an average duration of 10.5 months. Ninety-six percent responded to the treatment, showing decreases in size and coloration of the hemangioma. Children who started therapy before 5 months of age had a significantly better response and shorter duration of treatment. The average therapeutic dose was 1.5 mg/kg/day. Five patients experienced mild adverse effects during the first month of therapy. Treatment with propranolol in this group of Mexican pediatric patients proved to be safe and effective at an average dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day, reducing the size and coloration of hemangioma with a minimum incidence of adverse effects.

940,9284623,"I studied two genetic diseases, retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and color vision anomaly, in Kamigoto, one of the off-shore islands in Nagasaki Prefecture. The Prevalance of RP patients in this island was estimated to be one in 473 persons. Among the RP patients observed, familial cases whose disorders are transmitted through successive generations comprised 25.7%. Although it seems that the inheritance mode of RP in these familial cases is autosomal dominant, an autosomal recessive fashion showing quasi-dominance cannot be ruled out, because inbreeding frequently occurs on this island. There were at least two types of RP, one with late onset (40 years of age or later) and the other with early onset, and patients with the latter RP tended to have a poor prognosis. Only a few RP patients had posterior subcapsular cataract, and none had pseudexfoliation in spite of advanced age. Color vision anomalies were found in 3.86% of high-school boys and in 0.41% of girls in this island, and they included protanopia (4.2%), protanomaly (10.4%), deuteranopia (37.5%), and deuteranomaly (47.9%). The prevalence in boys was comparable to that in the general Japanese population, but the prevalence in girls was higher in Kamigoto than in other districts. It is most likely that the unique findings regarding the two disorders reflect geographical and/or social features in Kamigoto island. "

942,26715637,"To explore the surgical strategy for postburn cervical scar contracture. Sixty-five patients with scar contracture as a result of burn injury in the neck were hospitalized from July 2013 to July 2014. Release of cervical scar contracture was conducted according to different demands of the 3 anatomic subunits of neck, i.e. lower lip vermilion border-supramaxillary region, submaxillary region, and anterior region of neck. After release of contracture, platysma was released. For some cases with chin retrusion, genioplasty with horizontal osteotomy was performed. The coverage of wound followed the principle of similarity, i.e. the skin tissue covering the wound in the neck should be similar to the characters of skin around the wound in terms of color, texture, and thickness. Based on this principle, except for the preschool children in whom skin grafting was performed, the wounds of the other patients were covered by local skin flaps, adjacent skin flaps, or free skin flaps. All patients underwent release of scar and platysma, while 9 patients underwent genioplasty with horizontal osteotomy. Wounds were covered with local skin flaps in 32 patients, with adjacent skin flaps in 7 patients, with free skin flaps in 11 patients, and with skin grafts in 15 patients. All skin grafts and flaps survived. Good range of motion was achieved in the neck of all patients, with the cervicomental angle after reconstruction ranging from 90 to 120°. All patients were followed up for 6 to 24 months. Six patients who had undergone skin grafting were found to have some degrees of skin contracture, while none of the patients who had undergone flap coverage showed any signs of contracture recurrence. Restoration of the cervicomental angle is critical in the treatment of postburn cervical scar contracture, and the release of scar contracture should conform to the subunit principle. The coverage of wound should be based on the principle of similarity, with repair by skin flaps as the first choice, and skin grafting as the second choice. Satisfactory effect of repair would be achieved by following the above surgical principles. "
943,28108115,"The popularity of the superficial circumflex iliac artery perforator (SCIP) flap has been limited by factors such as variable vascular anatomy and short arterial pedicle. This article aimed to delineate flap design and harvest strategies based around either the proximal or distal perforators of the superficial circumflex iliac artery (SCIA) and propose a set of strategies that can help deal with the limitations of the flap. From August 2011 to June 2015, the SCIP flap was used in 80 patients for soft tissue defects at our institution. We utilized vessel imaging navigation to get a detailed overview of the vascular anatomy preoperatively. Flaps were designed on the basis of either the proximal or distal perforators of the SCIA. Backup strategies and surgical maneuvers were suggested to solve the problems that emerged during surgery. In total, 51 flaps were raised on the basis of the proximal perforators of the superficial branch of the SCIA, whereas 25 cases were based on the distal perforators from the deep branch, and in four cases, the pedicle was switched to the superficial inferior epigastric artery. In eight cases, the arterial pedicle lengthen technique was applied with a maximum length of 10 cm. All donor sites were closed directly with inconspicuous scars. These surgical strategies simplified the intraoperative decision-making and overcame the shortcomings of the SCIP flap. We believe that the SCIP flap has a great potential to become a new workhorse flap in the field of reconstructive surgery. "
944,19159076,"This study aimed to determine the detection rate and clinical relevance of portosystemic collaterals. We studied 326 cirrhotics. Portosystemic collaterals, portal vein diameter, and splenic area were evaluated by color Doppler sonography; esophageal varices were detected by endoscopy. Of the cirrhotics, 130 had portosystemic collaterals (39.9% total, left gastric vein 11%, paraumbilical vein 7.4%, splenorenal shunts 13.8%, and combined shunts 7.7%). Cirrhotics without portosystemic collaterals or with a paraumbilical vein had a significantly narrower portal vein diameter than cirrhotics with a left gastric vein (P < 0.001). Cirrhotics with a paraumbilical vein had a significantly smaller splenic area than cirrhotics with a left gastric vein (P < 0.001), splenorenal shunts (P < 0.001), combined shunts (P < 0.001), or without portosystemic collaterals (P < 0.05). A significant association between portosystemic collaterals and Child's classes or presence and type of esophageal varices was found (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0004, respectively). The highest prevalence of Child's class C and large (F-3) esophageal varices was found in cirrhotics with a left gastric vein (41.7% and 36.1%, respectively), whereas esophageal varices were absent in 47.4% of cirrhotics without portosystemic collaterals and in 58.3% of cirrhotics with a paraumbilical vein. The left gastric vein is associated with some sonographic and clinical markers of disease severity, whereas the absence of portosystemic collaterals or the presence of paraumbilical veins seems to identify cirrhotics with markers predictive of a more favorable clinical course.

945,12838126,"Finger amputation with bone exposure when replantation is not feasible requires a procedure for closure and padding of the stump. To preserve the length and provide adequate coverage, various flaps are used. A situation may occur in which local flaps are not sufficient and distant flaps are preferred. However, distant flaps often require a two-stage procedure, prolonged immobilization, and skin grafts. Thus, a simpler approach for fingertip or stump reconstruction while maintaining the padding effect of a flap was designed. The composite of glabrous skin and subcutaneous fat provided such padding, was performed in a single stage, and the donor site morbidity was negligible. During a 5-year period from 1996 to September 2002, 15 cases of finger stumps were reconstructed using the hypothenar composite graft. The age of the patients ranged from 1 to 63 years (average, 30 years). The average follow-up was 35 months. The donor sites were closed primarily and there were no marked complications related to this site. The graft showed relatively good contour and color match to the adjacent field, with an average two-point discrimination of 5.7 mm, indicating satisfactory reinnervation. The hypothenar composite graft for reconstruction of finger stumps can provide protective padding, maximal stump length, and minimal donor site morbidity, leading to satisfactory aesthetic and functional recovery.

947,19435938,"To assess compliance and resultant radiation dose reduction with new pediatric chest and abdominal computed tomographic (CT) protocols based on patient weight, clinical indication, number of prior CT studies, and automatic exposure control. The study was institutional review board approved and HIPAA compliant. Informed consent was waived. The new pediatric CT protocols, which were organized into six color zones based on clinical indications and number of prior CT examinations in a given patient, were retrospectively assessed. Scanning parameters were adjusted on the basis of patient weight. For gradual dose reduction, pediatric CT (n = 692) examinations were performed in three phases of incremental stepwise dose reduction during a 17-month period. There were 245 male patients and 193 female patients (mean age, 12.6 years). Two radiologists independently reviewed CT images for image quality. Data were analyzed by using multivariate analysis of variance. Compliance with the new protocols in the early stage of implementation (chest CT, 58.9%; abdominal CT, 65.2%) was lower than in the later stage (chest CT, 88%; abdominal CT, 82%) (P < .001). For chest CT, there was 52.6% (9.1 vs 19.2 mGy) to 85.4% (2.8 vs 19.2 mGy) dose reduction in the early stage of implementation and 73.5% (4.9 vs 18.5 mGy) to 83.2% (3.1 vs 18.5 mGy) dose reduction in the later stages compared with dose at noncompliant examinations (P < .001); there was no loss of clinically relevant image quality. For abdominal CT, there was 34.3% (9.0 vs 13.7 mGy) to 80.2% (2.7 vs 13.7 mGy) dose reduction in the early stage of implementation and 62.4% (6.5 vs 17.3) to 83.8% (2.8 vs 17.3 mGy) dose reduction in the later stage (P < .001). Substantial dose reduction and high compliance can be obtained with pediatric CT protocols tailored to clinical indications, patient weight, and number of prior studies. "
948,29457209,"To evaluate the agreement between integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) and final diagnosis in patients presenting with cough at the second and third level health institutions. This cross-sectional study included 373 children aged 2-60 mo who presented with cough at the pediatric emergency and outpatient clinics in the Department of Pediatrics. After clinical examination of children, body temperature, respiratory rate, saturation, presence or absence of the chest indrawing, rales, wheezing and laryngeal stridor were recorded. Cases were categorized according to IMCI algorithm regarding the severity using the color code, such as red (urgent treatment), yellow (treatment in the hospital), or green (treatment at home). Final diagnosis after physical examination, laboratory analysis and chest X-ray was compared with the IMCI algorithm. Study agreement between IMCI classification and final diagnosis was 74.3% with kappa value 0.55 (moderate agreement). Similar agreement values were detected in both the second and third level health institutions. Health condition and gender did not affect agreement value. Agreement were found to be high in patients <24 mo of age (ĸ = 0.67), presence of fever and cough (ĸ = 0.54), tachypnea (ĸ = 0.93), chest indrawing (ĸ = 1.00) and oxygen saturation of <94%(ĸ = 0.90). Adding saturation level to the IMCI algorithmic diagnosis may increase agreement between IMCI classification and final diagnosis. "
949,28068858,"To engage users in the design of a regional child and youth health center. The perspective of users should be an integral component of a patient-centered, evidence-based approach to the design of health facilities. We conducted a discrete choice conjoint experiment (DCE), a method from marketing research and health economics, as a component of a strategy to engage users in the preconstruction planning process. A sample of 467 participants (290 staff and 177 clients or community stakeholders) completed the DCE. Latent class analysis identified three segments with different design preferences. A group we termed an enhanced design (57%) segment preferred a fully featured facility with personal contacts at the start of visits (in-person check-in, personal waiting room notification, volunteer-assisted wayfinding, and visible security), a family resource center with a health librarian, and an outdoor playground equipped with covered heated pathways. The self-guided design segment (11%), in contrast, preferred a design allowing a more independent use of the facility (e.g., self-check-in at computer kiosks, color-coded wayfinding, and a self-guided family resource center). Designs affording privacy and personal contact with staff were important to the private design segment (32%). The theme and decor of the building was less important than interactive features and personal contacts. A DCE allowed us to engage users in the planning process by estimating the value of individual design elements, identifying segments with differing views, informing decisions regarding design trade-offs, and simulating user response to design options.

950,3041579,"Sonography is nowadays a routine procedure when gallstones or a tumor of an abdominal organ are suspected. More recently with advance in technology it has become possible to image superficial structures. Modern high resolution realtime machines show soft tissue structure and movements. Duplex machines show simultaneously tissue structure and blood flow by gated Doppler. The most recent machines show coloured blood-flow. The superficial structures studied by sonography are: the abdomen in pediatrics, the brain and medulla under the age of 6 months, the eye, the breast, the testes, the small parts of the neck and the extremities, non-ossified skeleton. Imaging of these structures is quite well known. Diagnostic value of simultaneous blood-flow studies has to be explored. Miniaturization of ultrasound transducers allows applications during surgery and endoscopy. Practical use of these procedures has to be defined. Because of all that work in progress ultrasound is now in touch with most fields of somatic medicine. Basic knowledge of ultrasound has to be integrated in the training of the future doctors to the same extent as radiology "
951,31593114,"The aim of this study was to assess the bedside brain function monitoring of color density spectral array (CDSA) for early prognostic evaluation of coma patients in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).Forty-two consecutive pediatric coma patients were enrolled. The individual conscious state was evaluated according to the Glasgow coma scale (GCS). CDSA parameters including CDSA pattern (CDSAP), sleep-wake cycle (SWC), sleep stage (SS), and drug-induced fast wave activity (DIFWA) were recorded. Three months later, prognosis was evaluated according to pediatric cerebral performance category (PCPC) score, based on which the patients were divided into FP-group (favorable prognosis) and PP-group (poor prognosis).The changeable type of CDSAP, appearance of SWC, SS, and DIFWA were significantly correlated with favorable prognosis. Both GCS and SWC were significantly correlated with the prognosis. However, there was substantial overlap in GCS between FP-group and PP-group. Although the absence of SWC was statistically an independent risk factor for poor prognosis but with a high false positive rate (0.143), a linear logistic regression showed the odds ratio of GCS for predicting prognosis was 0.93 (95% confidence interval: 0.48-1.80; P = .83) and that of SWC was 0.12 (95% confidence interval: 0.03-0.47; P = .03). Furthermore, the absence of SWC was correlated with poor prognosis in nonintracranial infection patients.Our study found that several CDSA factors are associated with prognosis of coma patients in PICU. SWC may be a potential indicator for evaluating the prognosis of coma patients in PICU. "
952,8153340,"To determine whether the addition of color Doppler ultrasonography (US) to gray-scale US can help diagnose appendicitis in children. One hundred children with suspected appendicitis were evaluated with gray-scale and color Doppler US scanning. Color Doppler US scans were considered positive for appendicitis if increased vascularity was demonstrated in the appendiceal wall and positive for perforation with abscess if a hyperemic right lower quadrant mass was seen. Gray-scale US was positive for appendicitis if a blind-ending, noncompressible appendix larger than 6 mm in diameter, a loculated periappendiceal mass, or both were identified. Thirty-nine patients had acute appendicitis; 26 had uncomplicated appendicitis, and 13 had perforation. Acute appendicitis was identified in 34 of 39 patients (87%) on color Doppler US scans with a sensitivity of 87%, specificity of 97%, and accuracy of 93%. Gray-scale US sensitivity was 87%; specificity, 92%; and accuracy, 90%. Blood flow in the appendiceal wall or right lower quadrant mass on color Doppler US scans suggests appendicitis, but absence of flow cannot definitively distinguish a normal from an abnormal appendix.

953,22652846,"To evaluate the predictive value of the seventh edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for conjunctival melanoma. Retrospective, observational case series of 42 eyes of 42 patients with conjunctival melanoma studied by reviewing medical records, pathology reports, and color photographs. The main evaluated outcomes were demographic information, laterality, tumor size, thickness, pathologic diagnosis, seventh edition AJCC stage (clinical and pathologic), recurrence, metastasis, and duration of follow-up. There was no sex preference, and the median age was 61 years. Recurrent disease was noted in 33% of patients (n = 14 of 42), with 64% occurring at a median of 2.5 years (range, 1-5 years) after primary treatment. Metastasis was noted in 19% of patients. The significant predictive factors for high risk of tumor recurrence were tumors involving more than 1 quadrant (P = .02), tumors thicker than 0.5 mm (P = .04), and tumor multifocality (P = .04). The significant predictive factors for high risk of tumor metastasis were tumors thicker than 0.5 mm (P = .005), tumor invasiveness (P = .04), pathologic diagnosis of conjunctival melanoma rather than melanoma in situ (P = .04), and tumor recurrence (P < .001). Similarly, increasing AJCC T stages (clinical and pathologic) were associated with unfavorable outcomes. For example, clinical stage-related recurrence rates were 19% (Tis), 27% (T1), 33% (T2), and 75% (T3). Clinical stage-related lymphatic and distant metastasis rates were 0% (Tis), 20% (T1), 0% (T2), and 63% (T3). Advanced AJCC T-stage (clinical and pathologic) tumors were at higher risk for recurrence and metastasis. In this study, the seventh edition AJCC staging system was predictive of local control and systemic spread of conjunctival melanoma. "
954,2789910,Instantaneous cross sectional flow velocity profiles from early mitral flow in 10 healthy men were constructed by time interpolation of the velocity data from each point in sequentially delayed two dimensional digital Doppler ultrasound maps. This interpolation allows correction of the artificially produced skewness of velocities across the flow sector caused by the time taken to scan the flow sector for velocity recording of pulsatile blood flow. These results suggested that early mitral flow studied in an apical four chamber view is variably skewed both at the leaflet tips and at the annulus. The maximum flow velocity overestimated the cross sectional mean velocity at the same time by a factor of 1.2-2.2. Also the maximum time velocity integral overestimated the cross sectional mean time velocity integral to the same extent. This cross sectional skew must be taken into account when calculation of blood flow is based on recordings with pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound from a single sample volume. 
955,22068064,"The objective of the study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of pediatric emergency physicians in diagnosing clavicle fractures by bedside ultrasound (US). This was a prospective study of pediatric emergency department (ED) patients with suspected clavicle fractures conducted in a tertiary-care, freestanding pediatric hospital. A convenience sample of patients younger than 17 years underwent bedside US for detection of clavicle fracture by pediatric emergency physicians with limited US training. Ultrasound findings were compared with standard radiographs, which were considered the criterion standard. Pain scores using the validated color analog scale (0-10) were determined before and during US. Total length of stay in the ED, time to US, and time to radiograph were recorded. Fifty-eight patients were enrolled, of which 39 (67%) had fracture determined by radiograph. Ultrasound interpretation gave a sensitivity of 89.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 75.8%-97.1%) and specificity of 89.5% (95% CI, 66.9%-98.7%). Positive and negative predictive values were 94.6% (95% CI, 81.8%-99.3%) and 81.0% (95% CI, 58.1%-94.5%), respectively. Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 8.33 and 0.11, respectively. Pain scores averaged 4.7 before US and 5.2 during US (P = 0.204). There was a statistically significant difference between mean time to US (76 minutes) and mean time to radiograph (107 minutes) (P < 0.001). Pediatric emergency physicians with minimal formal training can accurately diagnose clavicle fractures by US. In addition, US itself is not associated with an increase in pain and may reduce length of stay in the ED. "

957,12365577,"Mulago Hospital, Kampala, Uganda. To evaluate the usefulness of urine dipsticks for monitoring adherence to anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy. In-house urine dipsticks for detection of isoniazid (INH) metabolites were compared to commercial test strips. The value of n-butanol to detect rifampicin was compared to coloration of the urine. Non-adherence was assessed through a questionnaire and reviews of the Mulago Hospital TB register. Urine was obtained from 236 patients (127 adults and 109 children) on daily chemotherapy. Using commercial test strips as standard, the sensitivity of in-house urine dipsticks was 99.5% and specificity was 96.4%. The sensitivity and the specificity of n-butanol and of coloration of urine to detect rifampicin were low (64.0% and 54.9%, and 85.5% and 64.8%, respectively). Fifty patients (21.2%) admitted non-adherence to treatment during the previous month. An additional 15 (6.8%) were detected through urine testing. Of 911 patients in the TB register of Mulago Hospital who had started treatment in the first 3 months of 2000, 39.7% did not complete their treatment. Two-thirds of these had discontinued treatment in the first 2 months. In-house INH test strips are as effective as commercially available strips for detecting isoniazid in the urine. They are a simple tool for monitoring adherence. Adherence to anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy as determined by the use of isoniazid test strips and review of the TB register showed poor compliance. Tests for rifampicin are less sensitive and specific. "
958,25372195,"To investigate comprehensive image findings in a patient with incomplete achromatopsia. Observational case report. A 12-year-old girl was referred to our clinic with nystagmus, photophobia, poor best-corrected visual acuity, and impaired color vision since she was 5 years old. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/200 for both eyes. The fundus photography showed macula mottling, and fundus autofluorescence imaging showed a bull's eye-like maculopathy. The spectral domain optical coherence tomography revealed decreased outer nuclear layer thickness and inner and outer segment loss beneath the subfoveal area. The electroretinogram showed extinguished cone responses with relatively well-preserved rod responses. Fundus autofluorescence and spectral domain optical coherence tomography may serve as screening tools for achromatopsia candidates, but the electroretinogram study remains the most reliable test for diagnosis.

959,25632029,"In pediatric echocardiography, pulse wave Doppler, and tissue Doppler imaging velocities are widely used to assess cardiac function. Current reference values and Z scores, allowing adjustment for growth are limited by inconsistent methodologies and small sample size. Using a standardized approach for parametric modeling and Z score quality assessment, we propose new pediatric reference values and Z score equations for most left ventricular pulse wave Doppler and tissue Doppler imaging measurements. Two hundred thirty-three healthy pediatric subjects 1 to 18 years of age were prospectively recruited. Thirteen pulse wave Doppler and 14 tissue Doppler imaging measurements were recorded. Normalization for growth was done via a complete and standardized approach for parametric nonlinear regression modeling. Several analyses were performed to ensure adequate Z score distribution and to detect potential residual associations with growth or residual heteroscedasticity. Most measurements adopted a nonlinear relationship with growth and displayed significant heteroscedasticity. Compared with age, height, and weight, normalization for body surface area was most efficient in removing the effect of growth. Generally, polynomial and allometric models yielded adequate goodness-of-fit. Residual values for several measurements had significant departure from the normal distribution, which could be corrected using logarithmic or reciprocal transformation. Overall, weighted parametric nonlinear models allowed us to compute Z score equations with adequate normal distribution and without residual association with growth. We present Z scores for normalized pulse wave Doppler and tissue Doppler imaging in pediatric echocardiography. Further studies are needed to define the threshold beyond which health becomes a disease by integrating other important factors such as ventricular morphology, loading conditions, and heart rate. "
960,21211844,"To characterize the retinal changes in patients with achromatopsia using an ultrahigh-resolution (UHR) spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) to examine how human achromatopsia corresponds to its animal model. Comparative case series. Ultrahigh-resolution OCT (Copernicus; OPTOPOL Technology S.A., Zawiercie, Poland; 3-μm axial resolution) was used to obtain scans from 13 patients (26 eyes) with achromatopsia and from 20 controls (40 eyes). A 3-dimensional scan program (743×75; A×B scan) sampling a 7×7-mm retinal area centered at the fovea was used to obtain tomograms of the fovea. Individual B-scans at the fovea were exported and analyzed using ImageJ (Wayne Rasband, National Institute of Health) for reflectance profiles and morphologic abnormalities. Gross morphologic changes in OCT were characterized. Specifically, inner segment and outer segment (IS/OS) junction and cone outer segment tip (COST) disruption was noted. Using the reflectance profiles, foveal depth, thickness of the outer nuclear layer (ONL), and retinal thickness (RT) were measured. A characteristic so-called punched out hyporeflective zone (HRZ) was noted in 7 of 13 patients; this was age-dependent (P = 0.001). The area of the HRZ was asymmetric with the nasal area being significantly greater than the temporal area (P = 0.002). In all patients, there was disruption of the IS/OS junction at the foveal or parafoveal regions, or both. Five of 13 patients also had a disrupted COST reflectivity. There was significant (P = 1.1×10(-6)) ONL thinning in the achromats compared with controls, which was age-dependent (P = 0.0002). Foveal maldevelopment was seen in 9 of 13 patients. The achromats also had a significantly reduced foveal depth (P = 7.7×10(-6)) and RT (P = 1.46×10(-9)) compared with controls. A range of signs in achromatopsia are described that can be detected using UHR OCT. The IS/OS junction and COST reflectivity disruption and presence of HRZ and ONL thinning are signs of cone photoreceptor degeneration. The latter 2 are age-dependent, which suggests that achromatopsia is a progressive disorder. In addition, foveal maldevelopment is described; this represents a fetal developmental defect linked to cone photoreceptor degeneration. "
961,35809824,"This cross-sectional study investigated the associations between Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and mental health outcomes of parents and children (n = 1307) from the Latinx, Native American, Somali/Ethiopian, White, Hmong, and African American communities. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the adjusted associations between five parent and child mental health measures and 25 measures of SDOH. False discovery rate q-values were computed to account for multiple comparisons. Families of color reported 5.3-7.8 SDOH barriers while White families reported 1.7 SDOH barriers on average. Adjusted analyses indicated that low family functioning and high perceived discrimination were associated with low resiliency among parents and increased behavioral difficulties among children. Other SDOH that were adversely associated with parent or child mental health included lack of social support, recent stressful life events, and adverse childhood experiences among parents. SDOH in the social and community context were most likely to be associated with mental health problems. Community-engaged evidence-based interventions are needed to improve population mental health.

962,36798720,"Following high-quality surgical repair, children born with a cleft lip anomaly may still display lasting visual differences. We exposed control adults and parents of affected children to images of children with cleft deformity and compared their visual tracking patterns. The protocol investigated whether parental exposure to secondary cleft deformity heightens or diminishes visual attraction to this type of structural facial variation. Twenty participants (10 control adults, 10 parents of affected children) assessed 40 colored images of children's faces while their eye movements were tracked. Twenty-four control images and 16 repaired cleft lip images were displayed to observers. Nine bilateral facial aesthetic zones were considered as regions of interest. Percentage of time visually fixating within each region, and statistical differences in fixation duration percentage between the two participant groups and across the bilateral regions of interest were analyzed. While both groups of observers directed more visual attention to the nasal and oral regions of the cleft images than control images, parents of children with cleft lip spent significantly more time fixating on these areas (25% and 24% of the time, respectively) than did unaffected adults (14.6% and 19.3%;  These results demonstrate that parents of cleft lip children exhibit heightened attention to this type of facial difference relative to the naive observer. These findings highlight that observer profile can meaningfully influence the perception of a facial deformity. Awareness of this information may enhance communication between surgeon and parents of an affected child by providing added insight into parental perspective. "
963,32544142,"The objective of this study was to assess the use of a color-only method syringe for accuracy and timeliness when administrating midazolam. This method was compared with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved validation method. A prospective, randomized, crossover trial was conducted to compare the dosing accuracy and timeliness of the color-only syringe method versus the validation method. Twenty-five participants prepared pediatric midazolam doses according to their preferred method, a FDA-approved validation method, and a color-only method. Primary endpoints included dosing accuracy and time to medication administration. The preferred 3-kg calculations had a median margin of error of 5.6% and a median time to completion of 55.6 seconds. The color-only method took less time to complete than the validation method (median time: 29.5 seconds vs 58.2 seconds). There was no statistically significant difference in errors between the color-only method and the validation method. None of the participants reported a mistake using the color-only method, whereas 25% (5/20) reported a mistake using the validation method. Only 20% (4/20) of participants believed that the validation method found or eliminated any mistakes. There were 8 medication errors identified when participants used the method of choice, 4 with the validation method, and 1 with the color-only method. There was no significant difference in dosing errors between the FDA-approved validation method and the color-only method. Use of a color-only method did reduced time to medication administration when compared with a preferred method and an FDA-approved validation method. "

We report a case of a pediatric patient presenting with small bowel obstruction following the ingestion of a water bead, which was diagnosed and treated swiftly without complication. With the increasing incidence of water bead ingestion, it is essential that the public be aware of the potential risks and the necessity of seeking medical attention if companies do not withdraw such dangerous products from the market.

965,9169680,"To determine whether vascular, ischemic, and inflammatory causes of bowel wall thickening in children can be differentiated at gray-scale and color Doppler ultrasonography (US). Thirty-seven children with acute bowel disease underwent graded compression US. Findings of bowel wall thickness, wall echotexture, location of bowel involvement, and presence of color Doppler flow were evaluated. Diagnoses were classified as inflammation (n = 25), vasculitis (n = 7), or ischemia (n = 5) and were confirmed with findings from colonoscopy and biopsy, stool culture analysis, surgery, and cutaneous biopsy, and with a combination of clinical and laboratory data. Patient age (P = .0022), bowel wall thickness (P = .0001), and color Doppler flow (P = .0013) were statistically significantly related to disease type. Wall thickening and absence of visible color Doppler flow suggested ischemia. Older patient age and visible color Doppler flow suggested inflammation, whereas younger patient age and visible color flow suggested vasculitis. Difference in location of bowel disease in patients with ischemic versus those with vascular wall thickening was statistically significant (P = .0185). No difference was found between disease type and wall stratification. Gray-scale and color Doppler flow US can aid in differentiating ischemic, vascular, and inflammatory bowel wall thickening. "

967,26354792,"Leprosy is a public health problem and a neglected condition of morbidity and mortality in several countries of the world. We analysed time trends and spatiotemporal patterns of leprosy-related mortality in Brazil. We performed a nationwide population-based study using secondary mortality data. We included all deaths that occurred in Brazil between 2000 and 2011, in which leprosy was mentioned in any field of death certificates. Leprosy was identified in 7732/12 491 280 deaths (0.1%). Average annual age-adjusted mortality rate was 0.43 deaths/100 000 inhabitants (95% CI 0.40-0.46). The burden of leprosy deaths was higher among males, elderly, black race/colour and in leprosy-endemic regions. Lepromatous leprosy was the most common clinical form mentioned. Mortality rates showed a significant nationwide decrease over the period (annual percent change [APC]: -2.8%; 95% CI -4.2 to -2.4). We observed decreasing mortality rates in the South, Southeast and Central-West regions, while the rates remained stable in North and Northeast regions. Spatial and spatiotemporal high-risk clusters for leprosy-related deaths were distributed mainly in highly endemic and socio-economically deprived regions. Leprosy is a neglected cause of death in Brazil since the disease is preventable, and a cost-effective treatment is available. Sustainable control measures should include appropriate management and systematic monitoring of leprosy-related complications, such as severe leprosy reactions and adverse effects to multidrug therapy.

972,36308243,"Evaluation of circumcision bleeding cannot depend on the visual change in the diaper. Diapers have different product features and absorbency capacities. The apparent changes in the diapers may vary according to their absorbent capacity and may not be in parallel with the amount of bleeding. Before significant visual difference occurs, the patient's hemodynamics may be impaired. Aim of the study is to evaluate better circumcision bleeding. Patients were divided into groups according to 12 different brand diapers of the same size, containing super-absorbent material. The study started by 15/01/2022, and finished by end of 01/03/2022. Diapers with concealed brands were soaked with blood with equal hematocrit value in 100 ml with increments of 5 ml. 252 images were obtained by taking 21 images of each diaper with the same method. The diapers were evaluated colorimetrically, and numerical values were obtained showing the color differences in red, green, and blue and saturation and lightness. Working groups were formed according to 12 different brands of diapers of the same size, containing super-absorbent material. Standard statistical tests were performed using obtained values. : Dry diapers had different weights, volumes, and specific gravities; the diapers with the lowest unit weight were ranked ninth in terms of volume; the diapers with the highest specific gravity were ranked third in terms of thinness. There were significant differences in the blood on the diaper, and significant differences between some groups (p < 0.005); on the other hand, there was not any difference between some other groups (p > 0.05). There was a significant relationship in terms of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). Visual graphic examination showed that linear but non-parallel color changes occurred. As the blood load increased, the visual and statistical differences between the diapers became more pronounced, and the curves diverged. Visual evaluation of the color change of the diapers may not give accurate results for bleeding follow-up. If necessary to use diapers after circumcision, it is more appropriate to prefer those with low absorbency capacity. Using fabric or cotton products in cases with bleeding risk may be recommended. If bleeding is suspected, hemogram control is the most appropriate option. Diaper manufacturers should warn consumers of the risk. In conclusion, we should be on the safe side for mortality and morbidity. "
973,30782698,"Needle-related procedures are considered as the most important source of pain and distress in children in hospital settings. Considering the physiological and psychological consequences that could result from these procedures, management of pain and distress through pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods is essential. Therefore, it is important to have interventions that are rapid, easy-to-use and likely to be translated into clinical practice for routine use. The aim of this study will be to determine whether a device combining cold and vibration (Buzzy) is non-inferior to a topical anaesthetic (liposomal lidocaine 4% cream) for pain management of children undergoing needle-related procedures in the emergency department. This study will be a randomised controlled non-inferiority trial comparing the Buzzy device to liposomal lidocaine 4% cream for needle-related pain management. A total of 346 participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two study groups. The primary outcome will be the mean difference in pain intensity between groups during needle-related procedures. A non-inferiority margin of 0.70 on the Color Analogue Scale will be considered. A Non-inferiority margin of 0.70 on the Color Analogue Scale will be considered. The secondary outcomes will be the level of distress during the procedure, the success of the procedure at first attempt, the occurrence of adverse events, the satisfaction of both interventions and the memory of pain 24 hours after the procedure. The primary outcome will be assessed for non-inferiority and the secondary outcomes for superiority.

974,11227129,"We investigated a role of long-wavelength red light emission from TV in the induction of photosensitive seizures by an animated TV program called ""Pocket Monsters"". The luminance energy of recorded color bar was measured by a spectroradiometer in cathode-ray tubes (CRTs) of photosensitive patients with and without seizures on the program (induced patients and photosensitive controls). The mean ratio of long-wavelength red light to total visible range was significantly higher in the CRTs of induced patients than in the CRTs of photosensitive controls. The ratio of luminance energy between at turn-on and at 60 min after turn-on of the CRTs indicated that luminance energy in long-wavelength red range from the CRTs of induced patients increased significantly after turn-on of CRTs. High amounts of long-wavelength red light emitted from CRTs might play an important role in induction of photosensitive seizures in ""Pokemon"" incident. "

However, over the past year, she has started to have more worries and unusual behavior.Chloe and her mother report that when she walks through doorways, she will almost always go back and walks through again. At home, she will walk through doorways multiple times and at school, she will pretend she forgot something so her friends do not notice. She often will not walk downstairs and occasionally her mother has to carry her. Clothes are problematic for Chloe. If her father touches something of a specific color and then touches Chloe, she will have to change her clothes or take a shower. Sometimes, she will never be able to wear those clothes again. She had a recent episode where she could not stop tapping a red paper, because if she stopped, she said it would burst into flame.

976,8286872,"A cylindrical valve was designed to prevent regurgitation of the semilunar valve. The valve is made of a sheet of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or porcine pericardium, and has three cusps and three commissures. The diameter of the valve is equal to the height of the cusps. We have used these valves in pulmonary stenosis after Jatene's operation and total correction of tetralogy of Fallot, and for truncal valve regurgitation. Regurgitation was trivial on color Doppler echocardiography in all cases. Advantages in comparison with the implantation of commercially available artificial valves include the ability to insert a larger size and no compression of the valve ring when closing the sternum. Outflow tract obstruction does not occur even when the valve is implanted in a small infant. In the present report, we describe this simple technique. "
977,38170535,"Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is an emerging diagnostic and monitoring tool for anterior uveitis. We investigated AS-OCT findings in the eyes of a large, diverse population of children free of uveitis to establish its potential to ""rule out"" accurately those without disease. In this cross-sectional observational study, image acquisition was performed with swept source AS-OCT (Heidelberg Anterion), using a protocol of 13 B-scans per volume, from 217 children (434 eyes) aged 5 to 15 years, with analysis of acquired images (identification of apparent inflammatory cells, or ""cell events"") by multiple graders. Outcomes of interest were median and maximum cell event count (MEDCC, MAXCC) per B-scan from each eye and the total cell event count (TCC) per volume scan. At least one cell event was detected in volume scans of 76% of eyes (329/434) and 87% of children (189/217). The maximum number (MAXCC) per scan ranged from 0 to 6 (median, 2). There was a strong positive association between increasing age (years) and the number of cell events detected within a volume scan following adjustment for gender and iris color (adjusted regression coefficient for TCC 0.5; P < 0.0001; 95% confidence interval, 0.4-0.7). Our findings demonstrate that apparent inflammatory cells are detectable on AS-OCT in the apparently healthy eyes of children and furthermore suggest early life developmental changes in blood-iris barrier stability that merit further exploration. We provide the foundation for the normative data set necessary for establishing the clinical utility of AS-OCT for surveillance of children with inflammatory eye diseases. "
978,25896175,"We previously reported that the transmural myocardial strain profile (TMSP) was an effective predictor for subclinical left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with preserved LV ejection fraction (LVEF), but its predictive power when used alone proved to be limited. A total of 95 DMD patients with LVEF of 59±5% (all ≥55%) and age 11.3±3.0 years were analyzed retrospectively. Echocardiography was performed at baseline and 1-year follow-up, and all baseline measurements were repeated during a passive leg-lifting maneuver with legs elevated to approximately 45° from the horizontal position. TMSP of the posterior wall was evaluated from the mid-LV short-axis view. On the basis of our previous findings, TMSP with a notch was adopted as a predictor for evaluation of subclinical LV dysfunction in DMD patients whose LVEF remains preserved. At baseline, normal TMSP comprised 35 patients (37%), and the remaining 60 (63%) were classified as TMSP with a notch. Twenty-nine patients (48%) had developed LV wall motion abnormality at the 1-year follow-up, but this was observed only in the group of patients with TMSP with a notch at rest and also during passive leg-lifting. Furthermore, this group showed significantly more frequent development of LV wall motion abnormality at 1-year follow-up, with better sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for prediction of this abnormality than for other sub-groups. Most DMD patients suffer from progressive skeletal muscle weakness, so that combining TMSP with passive leg-lifting may make TMSP even more effective as a simple and non-invasive predictor of LV subclinical dysfunction.

979,23656907,"Lichen aureus (LA) presents an inflammatory infiltrate with a lichenoid pattern, which mainly localizes to the superficial dermis, and it is admixed with extravasated erythrocytes. We present the case of a 12-year-old male who had a 1.3-cm golden-brown-color patch on the right upper back for 2 weeks. Histopathologic examination revealed a lichenoid, superficial, and deep perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with perineural and periappendageal involvement, extravasated erythrocytes, papillary dermal edema, and hemosiderophages. The perineural and periappendageal infiltrate is unusual for LA and suggestive of lichen striatus (LS). In addition, the presence of perineural inflammation is not a common feature for either LA or LS. However, given the clinical findings, taken together, these features were interpreted as being most consistent with LA. To the best of our knowledge, no previous case of LA has been reported with histological features of perineural inflammation and LS. "
980,3197272,"A new technique for imaging the intimal surface of arteries through optic fibers has been devised. With the aid of an optical multichannel analyzer, we recorded in real time fluorescence spectra during excitation of the arterial surface with an argon ion laser. Spectral parameters were used to detect atherosclerotic plaques and to discriminate normal tissue from lipid rich and calcified atheromas. By digitizing relative intensity values and the ratios of the peak at 550 nm to that at 520 nm into a gray scale, we generated pseudocolor maps of the arterial wall of 10 human aortas. Specific color distributions were congruent with the distribution of calcified tissue visualized by soft x-ray radiography and the distribution of lipid delineated by staining with Sudan IV. Thus, bidimensional maps obtained by laser spectroscopy can be used to identify the presence and composition of atherosclerotic lesions. Fluorescence imaging may prove to be an important application of laser techniques for the diagnosis and treatment of atherosclerosis. "

Coagulation, liver tests and abdomen ultrasound (US) were normal, showing a hepatopetal portal flow to the colour-Doppler. There was no sign of haemolysis on haematology investigations. The C reactive protein, immune globulins levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal, excluding both an infective and an immune regulation disorder. We excluded the haematological malignancy and lymphoproliferative disorders through a peripheral blood smear and a bone marrow biopsy.His history was remarkable for neonatal sepsis, which required umbilical venous catheter during hospitalisation in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The patient follow-up was interrupted for a while, probably due to his good health condition.At age 17 years, the child accessed our emergency department. for a minor trauma to the limbs, and his physical examination was unremarkable, except for the splenomegaly. We repeated the abdomen US, with colour flow Doppler (figure 1). "
982,38570933,"Children with dental caries are treated with stainless steel metal crowns (SSC), but the aesthetics and precision still need to be improved. Currently, both 3D-printed resin crowns (PRC) and computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacture (CAD/CAM) resin crowns (CRC) meet the clinical requirements for crown applications in terms of strength, production time, cost, and aesthetics. This study replaced SSC with customized resin crowns by 3D printing and CAD/CAM. In this study, PRC, CRC, and SSC were used for incisor and molar restorations, and 60 crowns were made with 10 for each group. The fabrication efficiency, surface characteristics, marginal fit, and stability of the two different crowns were evaluated. PRC and CRC show superior color and surface characteristics, though production times are longer (5.3-12.4 times and 3.3-9.1 times, respectively) than for SSC (p < .05). They, however, can be completed within 80 min. Edge gaps for PRC and CRC are significantly lower (13.0-19.2 times and 13.0-13.7 times) than for SSC (p < .05). All materials exhibit good stability. The 3D-PRCs and CAD/CAM resin crowns may replace SSCs as a potential choice for clinical child caries. "
983,2788922,"Blue cone monochromacy is a rare X-linked disorder of color vision characterized by the absence of both red and green cone sensitivities. In 12 of 12 families carrying this trait, alterations are observed in the red and green visual pigment gene cluster. The alterations fall into two classes. One class arose from the wild type by a two-step pathway consisting of unequal homologous recombination and point mutation. The second class arose by nonhomologous deletion of genomic DNA adjacent to the red and green pigment gene cluster. These deletions define a 579-base pair region that is located 4 kilobases upstream of the red pigment gene and 43 kilobases upstream of the nearest green pigment gene; this 579-base pair region is essential for the activity of both pigment genes.

985,17440768,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the capability of contrast-enhanced three-dimensional (3D) MR portography in detecting abnormal findings associated with the portal venous system compared with the results of color Doppler ultrasonography (CDUS). MR portography findings were retrospectively compared with the results of CDUS examinations in 161 patients, who were suspected of having portal venous system abnormalities. Portal venous vessels were divided into main 5 groups including the main portal vein, its left and right intrahepatic branches, splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein. Imaging findings were classified as normal, occluded, or partially thrombosed. Results of clinical and imaging follow-up examinations including CDUS, MR portography or angiography, if available, were used as a proof of final diagnosis. The potential sites of varicose veins and collateral vessels were also examined by both imaging methods. Vascular abnormalities were identified in 79 of 161 patients. There was a statistically significant agreement between the results of MR portography and CDUS in evaluating portal venous system (kappa = 0.871, P < 0.05). The sensitivity of MR portography was slightly superior to CDUS in detecting partially thrombosis and occlusion in the main portal venous vessels. In addition, MR portograms were superior to CDUS in the management of patients with portal hypertension by identifying portosystemic collaterals more adequately, and clearly demonstrated portal venous vessels that cannot be visualized at CDUS. Results of present study indicates that contrast-enhanced 3D MR portography is well suited and superior to CDUS in the management of patients with portal hypertension. "
986,27858923,"We sought to evaluate the value of echocardiography in the diagnosis of different types of anomalous pulmonary venous connections (APVCs) and summarize the diagnostic experience. A total of 84 patients with APVC were confirmed by surgery (n = 82) or computerized tomography angiography (CTA) (n = 2) in the last 6 years (2008-2014) at the Wuhan Union Hospital. The total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) cases account for 60.7%, and partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection (PAPVC) cases account for 39.3% among the 84 cases that were identified. The 51 TAPVCs were classified by the Darling method-type I (41.1%), type II (52.9%), type III (1.9%), and type IV (3.9%). The most common drainage path of type I was common pulmonary drainage to the left innominate vein via vertical vein, and the coronary sinus drainage was the most common path in type II. Compared with surgical or CTA results, the sensitivity and specificity of echocardiography in the diagnosis of APVCs were 97.6% and 99.9%, respectively. The echocardiography misdiagnoses were mainly seen in PAPVCs. Of the TAPVCs and PAPVCs correctly diagnosed by echocardiography, the diagnostic accuracy of classification were 94% and 100%, respectively. Echocardiography has specific value in diagnosing and classification of APVC, especially the supracardiac and cardiac TAPVCs. Multiplane scan views and color Doppler improve the display of drainage pathway. "
987,17350464,"Pediatric undifferentiated soft tissue sarcomas (USTS) are a rare group of neoplasms that are unclassifiable despite the application of immunohistochemical, cytogenetic, and molecular techniques. To date, there is a dearth of studies looking at the cytogenetic and molecular genetic alterations in such tumors. Trisomy 8, a frequent molecular alteration in neoplasia, is seen in several soft tissue sarcomas, including Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (ES/PNET), synovial sarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma. Because USTS share several clinicobiological features with the aforementioned tumors, the occurrence of alterations in chromosome 8 was studied in 11 pediatric USTS using a combination of interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), spectral karyotyping (SKY), and genomic profiling with oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). The copy number status of MYC was also assessed on the same tumors using dual-color FISH, with the aim of delineating the degree and intratumoral distribution of MYC amplification in this tumor. A near-uniform presence of an increase in MYC copy number was observed, along with an increase in chromosome 8 copy number in all the tumors. SKY and aCGH analysis of tumors exhibiting trisomy 8 confirmed the numerical imbalances. The occurrence of trisomy 8 in a subset of pediatric USTS confirms a shared genomic alteration with several other soft tissue sarcomas. Further studies are required to determine the clinical implications of such a finding. "
988,25974875,"Peripheral facial paralysis is accompanied by facial motor disorders and also, by oral dysfunctions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the lip forces and chewing efficiency in a group of children with peripheral facial paralysis. The degree of peripheral facial paralysis in the study group (n 11) was assessed using the House-Brackmann scale. The control group consisted of 21 children without facial nerve impairment. To assess lip forces, acrylic vestibular plates of three sizes were used: large (LVP), medium (MVP) and small (SVP). The lip force was recorded with a force transducer coupled with the data acquisition system. Masticatory efficiency was evaluated by the ability to mix two differently colored chewing gums. The images were processed with Adobe Photoshop CS3 (Delaware Corporation, San Jose, California, United States) and the number of pixels was quantified with the Image J software (DHHS/NIH/NIMH/RSB, Maryland, United States). For statistical analysis, the following statistical analysis were used: Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficient, multiple linear regression analysis, multiple logistic regression analysis, and optimal cutoff values for muscular dysfunction. There were statistically significant differences between lip forces in the following three groups: p=0.01 (LVP), p=0.01 (MVP), and p=0.008 (SVP). The cutoff values of lip forces in the study group were as follows: 7.08 N (LVP), 4.89 N (MVP), and 4.24 N (SVP). There were no statistically significant differences between the masticatory efficiency in the two groups (p=0.25). Lip forces were dependent on the degree of peripheral facial paralysis and age, but not on gender. In peripheral facial paralysis in children, a significant decrease of lip forces, but not masticatory efficiency, occurs. "
989,37203035,"To evaluate presence of perilimbal pigmentation (PLP) in Indian patients with vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC). Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted from 2019 to 2020 at a tertiary eye care center in Western Maharashtra, India. In this study, 152 cases of VKC were identified. The presence, type, color, and extent of PLP were recorded. The incidence of presence of PLP was calculated. Its correlations with severity and duration of VKC were analyzed using Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test and Chi square test. Of 152 cases, 79.61% were males. Mean age at presentation was 11.4 ± 5.6 years. The characteristic PLP was present in 81 cases (53.29%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 45.03%-61.42%; P < 0.001), of which 15 cases (18.5%) had this pigmentation in all the four quadrants. There was a significant difference between the groups with respect to quadrants involvement in terms of the extent of PLP in clock hours (χ Perilimbal pigmentation seems to be a consistent clinical finding seen in a significant number of VKC cases. It may benefit ophthalmologists in treating VKC cases when the palpebral/limbal signs are elusive. "
990,19841399,"To better categorize the epidemiologic profile, clinical features, and disease associations of loose anagen hair syndrome (LAHS) compared with other forms of childhood alopecia. Retrospective survey. Academic pediatric dermatology practice. Patients Three hundred seventy-four patients with alopecia referred from July 1, 1997, to June 31, 2007. Epidemiologic data for all forms of alopecia were ascertained, such as sex, age at onset, age at the time of evaluation, and clinical diagnosis. Patients with LAHS were further studied by the recording of family history, disease associations, hair-pull test or biopsy results, hair color, laboratory test result abnormalities, initial treatment, and involvement of eyelashes, eyebrows, and nails. Approximately 10% of all children with alopecia had LAHS. The mean age (95% confidence interval) at onset differed between patients with LAHS (2.8 [1.2-4.3] years) vs patients without LAHS (7.1 [6.6-7.7] years) (P < .001), with 3 years being the most common age at onset for patients with LAHS. All but 1 of 37 patients with LAHS were female. The most common symptom reported was thin, sparse hair. Family histories were significant for LAHS (n = 1) and for alopecia areata (n = 3). In 32 of 33 patients, trichograms showed typical loose anagen hairs. Two children had underlying genetic syndromes. No associated laboratory test result abnormalities were noted among patients who underwent testing. Loose anagen hair syndrome is a common nonscarring alopecia in young girls with a history of sparse or fine hair. Before ordering extensive blood testing in young girls with diffusely thin hair, it is important to perform a hair-pull test, as a trichogram can be instrumental in the confirmation of a diagnosis of LAHS.

991,31401625,"Little is known about the association between adrenarche and cognition in general populations of children. We therefore studied the associations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), androstenedione (A4), testosterone, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and adrenarche with cognition among prepubertal children. These cross-sectional analyses are based on baseline data of the Physical Activity and Nutrition in Children Study. A total of 387 children (183 girls, 204 boys) were included in the analyses. Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (CPM) score was used to assess nonverbal reasoning. Serum adrenal androgens and IGF-1 concentrations were measured and clinical signs of androgen action were evaluated. Higher IGF-1 among boys (β = 0.149, p =0.033) was related to a better Raven's CPM score after adjustment for age and parental education. Adrenal androgens in girls or boys or IGF-1 in girls were not associated with the score. There were no differences in Raven's CPM score between children with biochemical adrenarche (DHEAS ≥1.08 µmol/L; ≥40 µg/dL) or with clinical signs of androgen action and children without them. The results suggest that higher serum IGF-1 among boys is related to better cognition in prepubertal children. We could not provide evidence for the associations of adrenal maturation with cognition in prepubertal children. "
992,26986160,"Pseudoaneurysm of the mitral-aortic intervalvular fibrosa (P-MAIVF) is a rare but potentially fatal entity. Early diagnosis and surgical treatment are particularly important to decrease risk of mortality. The purpose of this study was to explore the echocardiographic characteristics and outcome of P-MAIVF and to evaluate the potential application of three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography in the evaluation of P-MAIVF. Clinical and echocardiographic characteristics were retrospectively evaluated in 9 patients with P-MAIVF, 5 of them assessed by 3D echocardiography. P-MAIVF was identified on echocardiography and located in the posterior aspect of the aortic root, expanding in systole and collapsing in diastole. Of the 9 cases examined, 8 were associated with endocarditis and 1 was caused by radio frequency catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation. Five cases were associated with bicuspid aortic valve, and rupture of P-MAIVF was identified in 3 patients. The morphology of P-MAIVF was clearly demonstrated on 3D echocardiography in 5 cases. In conclusion, echocardiography provides a useful tool in the diagnosis of P-MAIVF. Color Doppler flow imaging can ease identification of the ostium in cases of ruptured pseudoaneurysms. Three-dimensional echocardiography shows the relationship between P-MAIVF and the adjacent anatomic structures. "
993,34303398,"A 3-year old White boy was referred to our dermatology department with a papular disseminated eruption, evolving for 7 months. Several topical antibiotics and corticosteroids were used without improvement. The dermatosis was locally asymptomatic, and systemic symptoms were absent. Examination revealed multiple, skin-colored to pinkish monomorphic papules with a generalized distribution involving the face, trunk, and limbs (Figure 1). The lesions spared the scalp, palms, and soles. Cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphatic nodes were not palpable. Cutaneous biopsy of one of the abdominal lesions revealed an unremarkable epidermis but a reticular dermis with clusters of histiocytic, lymphocytic, and rare eosinophil cells. In the immunohistochemical study, expression of CD1a was observed in the histiocytic cells and S100 in the antigen-presenting cells of the dermal infiltrate (Figures 2 and 3). Taking into account the clinical presentation and the histopathologic result, a diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) was established. "
994,20193776,"Idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (VT) in children with a structurally normal heart can cause significant morbidity, and although rare, mortality. Conventional activation and pace mapping may be limited by nonsustained tachycardia or unstable hemodynamics. The aim of this study was to assess feasibility of catheter ablation of idiopathic VT in the pediatric population guided by noncontact mapping. Twenty consecutive pediatric patients with idiopathic VT underwent electrophysiologic study with the intention to use the noncontact mapping system EnSite 3000 (EnSite Array, St. Jude Medical Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota). The multielectrode balloon array was introduced into the left or right ventricle, respectively, and tachycardia was analyzed using color-coded isopotential maps as well as reconstructed unipolar electrograms on the virtual geometry. The region of origin was identified in all of them, and the site of earliest activation with a QS pattern of the unipolar electrograms was guided for sites of ablation. Idiopathic VT originated from the right ventricular outflow tract in 6 patients, from the left ventricle in 8, and from the aortic sinus cusp in 6 in this cohort with a median age of 14.4 (range: 4.8 to 20.9) years. Ablation was attempted in 18 of 20 children, and was acutely successful in 17 of these 18 (94%). During a mean follow-up of 2.3 +/- 1.7 years, VT recurred in 3, 2 of them have been treated with a second procedure, resulting in an overall intermediate-term success in 16 of 18 (89%) children with idiopathic VT. Noncontact mapping can safely and effectively be used to map and guide catheter ablation of the tachycardia substrate of idiopathic VT in pediatric patients. "
995,30052093,"The 595-nm pulsed dye laser (PDL) has been used to treat vascular anomalies for about 30 years; however, there are insufficient data in Chinese patients concerning therapeutic efficacy, optimized parameters, and procedure techniques. To study the efficacy and relevant factors in PDL therapy for vascular anomalies in Chinese patients. We enrolled 431 patients with 8 different vascular anomalies and no previous treatment in this retrospective study. A detailed classification of vascular anomalies and various parameters and techniques of PDL were studied. The clinical outcomes were analysed using the Investigator Global Assessment. Improvements were significantly correlated with infantile haemangioma (IH) subtypes (p < 0.05). A significant correlation between efficacy and lesion colour, anatomical sites, and hypertrophic-type port-wine stain (PWS) was found (p < 0.05). There was no significant correlation between efficacy and age or sex (p > 0.05). PDL is an effective and safe therapeutic modality for managing vascular anomalies in Chinese patients. We determined that differentiating and identifying IH subtypes prior to treatment could be a useful parameter for predicting therapeutic results.  Lesion colour, sites, and hypertrophic changes in PWS are relevant therapeutic factors. PDL parameters and techniques differ according to the various vascular anomalies to achieve optimal results. "
996,24924479,"It has been hypothesised that light skin pigmentation has arisen to ensure adequate levels of vitamin D as human populations moved out of Africa and into higher latitudes. Vitamin D, which is primarily obtained through exposure to sunlight (specifically ultraviolet radiation B (UVR-B)), has been inversely associated with several complex diseases. Greater sun exposure, on the other hand, is a well-known cause of skin cancer. The potential of UVR to be beneficial for some health outcomes but detrimental for others has prompted a public health debate on how to balance the positive and negative consequences of sun exposure. In this study we aimed to determine the validity of the evolutionary hypothesis linking lighter skin with higher vitamin D concentrations in a European population. Additionally, we aimed to examine the influence of pigmentation on personal behaviour towards sunlight exposure and the effects of this behaviour on vitamin D. We combined genetic variants strongly associated with skin colour, tanning or freckling to create genetic scores for each of these phenotypes. We examined the association of the scores with pigmentary traits, sun exposure and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels among children of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N = 661 to 5649). We found that fairer-skinned children, i.e. those with higher pigmentation score values, had higher levels of 25(OH)D (0.6 nmol/l; 95% CI 0.2, 1.0; per unit increase in skin colour score; N = 5649). These children also used more protection against the damaging effects of UVR. In this population taking protective measures against sunburn and skin cancer does not seem to remove the positive effect that having a less pigmented skin has on vitamin D production. Our findings require further replication as skin pigmentation showed only a small effect on circulating 25(OH)D. "
997,12395256,"Retroperitoneal cyst (RC) is a relatively rare disease, and its sonographic (US) findings have not been analyzed sufficiently. We studied US findings of five patients with RC, with special attention to location, size, shape, internal echoes, the presence or absence of lateral shadowing, and the mode of back echoes. In all cases, the cyst was situated behind (four cases) or lateral to (one case) the pancreas: behind or lateral to the pancreatic head in two cases, behind the pancreatic body in one case, and behind the pancreatic tail in two cases. Four cases showed a round mass (three cases) or multiple round mass (one case). Internal echoes were present in those cases and showed a ""pseudo-solid"" pattern. In those cases, M-mode US confirmed the movement of those internal echoes. In the remaining case, the lesion was imaged as an irregularly shaped multilocular mass. No case showed posterior echo enhancement, and no case showed lateral shadowing. No blood flow signals from the lesion were seen. Unlike ordinary cysts, RC usually is imaged as a round mass behind the pancreas, with dense internal echoes without lateral shadowing or posterior echo enhancement, which presents a ""pseudo-solid"" pattern. A diagnosis of RC should be considered when encountering a mass with such US findings. "
998,9840600,"The prevalence rate of ascariasis in primary school children in northern Jakarta, Indonesia varies from 60% to 90%. An association between helminthic infection and educational achievement has long been recognized. This study was carried out in the northern part of Jakarta among primary school children 6-8 years of age. Treatment of ascariasis and health education were used as the interventions. Before the interventions, basic data on socioeconomic status, epidemiology, infection with Ascaris lumbricoides, nutritional status, and cognitive function were collected. After the interventions, only data on infection with A. lumbricoides, nutritional status, and cognitive function were collected. The children were divided into five groups. Group I was given an anthelminthic (mebendazole), group II was provided with health education, group III was given an antihelminthic and provided with health education, group IV was given a placebo (controls), and group V consisted of egg-negative children, who also served as controls. Data from 336 students were analyzed by analysis of covariance. Parasitologic examinations showed a mean prevalence rate of 58.4% for A. lumbricoides infection in the pre-intervention children and a mean prevalence rate of 40.6% in the post-intervention children. Concerning nutritional status, approximately 80% of the children showed good scores in the pre- and post-treatment data, and only a small percentage (0.9-16.2%) showed mild or moderate malnutrition. No significant difference was found between the pre- and post-treatment nutritional status. The results of the cognitive test showed that the group treated with mebendazole showed significant improvement in the Colored Progressive Matrices and Coding test. Children also showed an improvement in their learning ability, concentration, and eye-hand coordination after five months of receiving this intervention. "
