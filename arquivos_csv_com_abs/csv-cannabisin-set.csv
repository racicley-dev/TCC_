0,36102608,"This review aims to summarize recent updates in the area of cannabis use for insomnia. Cannabis products have continued to become more potent, particularly in regard to delta-9- tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentration. Additionally, the use of cannabis has continued to become more accepted with less legal restrictions. The reported use of cannabis for relief of symptoms in sleep disorders appears to be increasing, however the specific effects of cannabinoids on sleep varies with cannabinoid type and concentration. Some evidence supports claims of efficacy of cannabinoids in sleep disorders such as insomnia, while other evidence is either lacking or in some cases contradictory. Regular cannabis use has been associated with withdrawal which can profoundly alter sleep. Also, clinicians should be aware of the potential effects of cannabis on the metabolism of other medications as well as the fact that cannabis use has been reported in a significant number of women in the periods before, during, and after pregnancy. Cannabis use has been becoming more and more prevalent in the setting of relaxed restrictions and easier consumer level access to cannabis and cannabis products. A relative paucity of high quality evidence regarding the effects of cannabis on sleep and the treatment of insomnia symptoms remains. The optimal type, concentration, ratio, and dosage form of cannabinoids in the treatment of insomnia symptoms needs further clarification. As the trend of acceptance and use of cannabis continues, more high quality evidence to help guide clinicians in their recommendations will hopefully become available. "
1,36539991,"Insomnia or difficulty falling and or staying asleep is experienced by up to 30% of the general population. This randomised crossover double-blind placebo-controlled 6-week trial aimed to assess the tolerability and effectiveness of the Entoura-10:15 medicinal cannabis oil on sleep in adults with insomnia. A total of 29 participants with self-reported clinical insomnia completed the crossover trial. Participants were randomly allocated to receive placebo or active oil containing 10 mg/ml tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 15 mg/ml cannabidiol (CBD) over 2-weeks titrated 0.2-1.5 ml/day, followed by a 1-week wash-out period before crossover. Tolerability was assessed by daily diary. Effectiveness was measured by saliva midnight melatonin levels, validated questionnaires, i.e., the Insomnia Severity Index, and the Fitbit activity/sleep wrist tracker. Entoura-10:15 medicinal cannabis oil was generally well tolerated, and was effective in improving sleep, whereby 60% of participants no longer classified as clinical insomniacs at the end of the 2-week intervention period. Midnight melatonin levels significantly improved in the active group by 30% compared to a 20% decline in the placebo group (p = 0.035). Medicinal cannabis oil improved both time and quality of sleep, in particular light sleep increased by 21 min/night compared to placebo (p = 0.041). The quality of sleep improved overall by up to 80% in the active group (p "
2,34115851,"This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 weeks of nightly sublingual cannabinoid extract (ZTL-101) in treating chronic insomnia (symptoms ≥3 months). Co-primary study endpoints were safety of the medication based on adverse event reporting and global insomnia symptoms (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI]). Secondary endpoints included: self-reported (sleep diary), actigraphy-derived, and polysomnography measurements of sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE); and self-reported assessments of sleep quality (sSQ) and feeling rested upon waking. Adjusted mean differences between placebo and ZTL-101 were calculated. Twenty-three of 24 randomized participants (n = 20 female, mean age 53 ± 9 years) completed the protocol. No serious adverse events were reported. Forty mild, nonserious, adverse events were reported (36 during ZTL-101) with all but one resolving overnight or soon after waking. Compared to placebo, ZTL-101 decreased ISI (-5.07 units [95% CI: -7.28 to -2.86]; p = 0.0001) and self-reported SOL (-8.45 min [95% CI: -16.33 to -0.57]; p = 0.04) and increased self-reported TST (64.6 min [95% CI: 41.70 to 87.46]; p < 0.0001), sSQ (0.74 units [95% CI: 0.51 to 0.97]; p < 0.0001), and feeling of being rested on waking (0.51 units [95% CI: 0.24 to 0.78]; p = 0.0007). ZTL-101 also decreased actigraphy-derived WASO (-10.2 min [95% CI: -16.2 to -4.2]; p = 0.002), and increased actigraphy-derived TST (33.4 min [95% CI: 23.07 to 43.76]; p < 0.001) and SE (2.9% [95% CI: 2.0 to 3.8]; p = 0.005). Two weeks of nightly sublingual administration of a cannabinoid extract (ZTL-101) is well tolerated and improves insomnia symptoms and sleep quality in individuals with chronic insomnia symptoms.

3,28349316,"The current review aims to summarize the state of research on cannabis and sleep up to 2014 and to review in detail the literature on cannabis and specific sleep disorders from 2014 to the time of publication. Preliminary research into cannabis and insomnia suggests that cannabidiol (CBD) may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of insomnia. Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) may decrease sleep latency but could impair sleep quality long-term. Novel studies investigating cannabinoids and obstructive sleep apnea suggest that synthetic cannabinoids such as nabilone and dronabinol may have short-term benefit for sleep apnea due to their modulatory effects on serotonin-mediated apneas. CBD may hold promise for REM sleep behavior disorder and excessive daytime sleepiness, while nabilone may reduce nightmares associated with PTSD and may improve sleep among patients with chronic pain. Research on cannabis and sleep is in its infancy and has yielded mixed results. Additional controlled and longitudinal research is critical to advance our understanding of research and clinical implications. "
4,35537535,"Sleep disturbances are often cited as a primary reason for medicinal cannabis use, and there is increasing clinical interest in the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in treating sleep disorders. Burgeoning evidence suggests a role of the endocannabinoid system in regulating the circadian sleep-wake cycle, highlighting a potential avenue for developing novel therapeutics. Despite widespread use of cannabis products as sleep aids globally, robustly designed studies verifying efficacy in sleep-disordered populations are limited. Although some study outcomes have suggested cannabinoid utility in insomnia disorder and sleep apnea, most studies to date are limited by small sample sizes, lack of rigorously controlled study designs, and high risk of bias. This critical review summarizes the current evidence for the use of cannabinoids as a treatment for sleep disorders and provides an overview of endocannabinoid modulation of sleep-wake cycles, as well as the sleep-modulating effects of plant-derived cannabinoids such as delta-9-tetrahydrocannbinol, cannabidiol, and cannabinol. The review also discusses practical considerations for clinicians regarding cannabinoid formulations, routes of administration, respiratory concerns, dosing, potential side effects, drug interactions, and effects relevant to driving, tolerance, and withdrawal. Although current interest in, and uptake of, medicinal cannabis use for sleep disorders may have surpassed the evidence base, there is a strong rationale for continued investigation into the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids.

5,32785848,"Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, and postural instability. Non-motor symptoms, including pain, fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, and depression to name a few, are increasingly recognized and often just as disabling at motor symptoms. The mainstay of treatment is dopamine replacement; however, the beneficial effects tend to wane over time with disease progression, and patients often experience motor fluctuations and medication side effects. The lack of a disease-modifying intervention and the shortcomings of traditional symptomatic medications have led many patients to pursue complementary therapies to alleviate motor and non-motor symptoms associated with PD. The term complementary implies that the therapy is used along with conventional medicine and may include supplements, manipulative treatments (chiropractic, massage), exercise-based programs, and mind-body practices. As these practices become more widespread in Western medicine, there is a growing interest in evaluating their effects on a number of medical conditions, PD included. In this review, we provide an update on clinical trials that have evaluated the effectiveness of complementary treatments for patients with PD, specifically focusing on acupuncture, Tai Chi, Qi Gong, yoga, and cannabis.

7,35617670,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction and by restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior. Some studies have shown that substances derived from Cannabis sativa improve the quality of life of children with ASD without causing serious adverse effects, thus providing an alternative therapeutic option. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a cannabis extract rich in cannabidiol (CBD) in children with ASD. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 60 children, aged from 5 to 11 years, were selected and divided into two groups: the treatment group, which received the CBD-rich cannabis extract, and the control group, which received the placebo. They both used their respective products for a period of 12 weeks. Statistical analysis was done by two-factor mixed analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA). Significant results were found for social interaction (F1,116 = 14.13, p = 0.0002), anxiety (F1,116 = 5.99, p = 0.016), psychomotor agitation (F1,116 = 9.22, p = 0.003), number of meals a day (F1,116 = 4.11, p = 0.04), and concentration (F1,48 = 6.75, p = 0.01), the last of which was only significant in mild ASD cases. Regarding safety, it was found that only three children in the treatment group (9.7%) had adverse effects, namely dizziness, insomnia, colic, and weight gain. CBD-rich cannabis extract was found to improve one of the diagnostic criteria for ASD (social interaction), as well as features that often co-exist with ASD, and to have few serious adverse effects.

8,34870584,"Cannabis use is common among young adults and has been proposed as a potential treatment for insomnia. However, controlled studies examining the impact of cannabis use on insomnia symptoms are rare. This secondary analysis of published trial data tested cannabis use during cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBT-I) as a moderator of treatment efficacy. Young adults (ages 18-30 years) who reported past-month binge drinking (4/5+ drinks for women/men) and met diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder were randomized to CBT-I (n = 28) or sleep hygiene (n = 28) groups. Interaction effects were tested using multilevel models. Outcomes included insomnia severity, actigraphy-assessed sleep efficiency, diary-assessed sleep quality, drinking quantity, and alcohol-related consequences. Twenty-six participants (46%; 12 in the sleep hygiene group and 14 in the CBT-I group) reported using cannabis during the treatment phase of the study, on an average of 23% of treatment days (range, 3%-100%). Relative to those who did not use cannabis, participants who used cannabis during treatment reported heavier drinking and more frequent cigarette use. Approximately 1 in 4 cannabis users (27%) reported using cannabis to help with sleep; however, cannabis users and nonusers did not differ in the use of alcohol as a sleep aid. Controlling for sex, race, drinking quantity, cigarette use, symptoms of depression, and symptoms of anxiety, use of cannabis during treatment did not moderate CBT-I effects on insomnia severity ( CBT-I is effective in reducing insomnia symptoms among young adult drinkers with insomnia, regardless of cannabis use.

9,35484520,"Little is known about cannabis use for insomnia in individuals with depression, anxiety, and comorbid depression and anxiety. To develop a better understanding of distinct profiles of cannabis use for insomnia management, a retrospective cohort study was conducted on a large naturalistic sample. Data were collected using the medicinal cannabis tracking app, Strainprint®, which allows users to monitor and track cannabis use for therapeutic purposes. The current study examined users managing insomnia symptoms in depression (n = 100), anxiety (n = 463), and comorbid depression and anxiety (n = 114), for a total of 8476 recorded sessions. Inferential analyses used linear mixed effects modeling to examine self-perceived improvement across demographic variables and cannabis product variables. Overall, cannabis was perceived to be efficacious across all groups, regardless of age and gender. Dried flower and oral oil were reported as the most used and most efficacious product forms. In the depression group, all strains were perceived to be efficacious and comparisons between strains revealed indica-dominant (M In terms of perceptions, individuals with depression, anxiety, and both conditions who use cannabis for insomnia report significant improvements in symptom severity after cannabis use. The current study highlights the need for placebo-controlled trials investigating symptom improvement and the safety of cannabinoids for sleep in individuals with mood and anxiety disorders. "
10,35459406,"The use of cannabis products to help with sleep and various other medical conditions by the public has increased significantly in recent years. Withdrawal from cannabinoids can lead to sleep disturbance. Here, we describe a patient who developed significant insomnia leading to worsening anxiety, mood, and suicidal ideation in the setting of medical cannabis withdrawal, prompting presentation to the Emergency Department and inpatient admission. There is a limited evidence base for the use of cannabis products for sleep. We provide a comprehensive review evaluating the literature on the use of cannabis products on sleep, including an overview of cannabis and related psychoactive compounds, the current state of the law as it pertains to the prescribing and use of these substances, and potential side effects and drug interactions. We specifically discuss the impact of cannabis products on normal sleep and circadian sleep-wake rhythms, insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep apnea, parasomnias, and restless legs syndrome. We also describe the effects of cannabis withdrawal on sleep and how this increases relapse to cannabis use. Most of the studies are observational but the few published randomized controlled trials are reviewed. Our comprehensive review of the effects of cannabis products on normal sleep and sleep disorders, relevant to primary care providers and other clinicians evaluating and treating patients who use these types of products, shows that cannabis products have minimal to no effects on sleep disorders and may have deleterious effects in some individuals. Further research examining the differential impact of the various types of cannabinoids that are currently available on each of these sleep disorders is required. "
11,36107800,"As cannabis is increasingly used to treat sleep disorders, we performed a systematic review to examine the effects of cannabis on sleep and to guide cannabis prescribers in their recommendations to patients, specifically focusing on dosing. We searched EMBASE, Medline, and Web of Science and identified 4550 studies for screening. Five hundred sixty-eight studies were selected for full-text review and 31 were included for analysis. Study results were considered positive based on improvements in sleep architecture or subjective sleep quality. Bias in randomized controlled trials was assessed using Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2.0. Sleep improvements were seen in 7 out of 19 randomized studies and in 7 out of 12 uncontrolled trials. There were no significant differences between the effects of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol. Cannabis showed most promise at improving sleep in patients with pain-related disorders, as compared to those with neurologic, psychiatric, or sleep disorders, and showed no significant effects on healthy participants' sleep. While subjective improvements in sleep quality were often observed, diagnostic testing showed no improvements in sleep architecture. Adverse events included headaches, sedation, and dizziness, and occurred more frequently at higher doses, though no serious adverse events were observed. High-quality evidence to support cannabis use for sleep remains limited. Heterogeneity in cannabis types, doses, timing of administration, and sleep outcome measures limit the ability to make specific dosing recommendations. "
12,35519083,"Medical cannabis has been increasingly used in Canada after being sanctioned by Health Canada in 2001. Insomnia and sleep disorders are among the most common conditions for which patients report using cannabis. Current research shows cannabis may have a beneficial effect in sleep disorders and may improve patient-reported sleep scores. A retrospective chart review was conducted at Hybrid Pharm community pharmacy in Ottawa, Ontario, and included patients who were interested in, or already using, medical cannabis for sleep disorders. A qualitative, exploratory approach was taken to evaluate the descriptive efficacy and safety of medical cannabis when prescribed for insomnia or comorbid conditions. The comprehensive data collection also involved investigating the impact of cannabis on other medication used for insomnia. A total of 38 patients were identified as having adequate follow-up documentation to assess the impact of medical cannabis. At time of data collection, 15 patients (39%) were able to reduce or completely discontinue a prescription medication indicated for sleep. On follow-up, 27 patients (71%) reported a subjective improvement in their sleep or related condition. Only 8 patients (21%) reported any adverse effects from medical cannabis use, and these were manageable and did not require discontinuation of cannabis. This study highlights the importance of a pharmacist's role in the management of cannabis-based therapy, including ongoing supportive care, follow-up and medication management.  "

14,30907602,"Previous research has reported that sleep problems longitudinally predict both onset of cannabis use and cannabis-related problems. However, the mediators of this relationship remain unclear. The present study examined (a) the concurrent relationship between insomnia symptoms and hazardous cannabis use and (b) examined whether use of protective behavioral strategies (PBS) for cannabis mediated this relationship among college student cannabis users. Participants were 984 (69.9% female) college students who reported consuming cannabis at least once in the past month and completed measures of insomnia, cannabis PBS, and cannabis misuse. Data were analyzed by structural equation modeling for binary and count outcomes. The significance of the mediator was evaluated using bias-corrected bootstrap confidence intervals. Insomnia symptoms were associated with an increase in the odds of hazardous cannabis use and possible cannabis use disorder. Cannabis PBS significantly mediated the relationship between insomnia symptoms and hazardous cannabis use, cannabis use disorder symptoms, and cannabis-related problems. Specifically, higher reports of insomnia symptoms were associated with lower use of cannabis PBS; which in turn was associated with an increase in the odds of hazardous cannabis use and possible cannabis use disorder, as well as a higher report of cannabis-related problems. Implications of these findings on the prevention of cannabis use problems among college students in the United States were discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved). "
15,36940598,"Individuals with regular cannabis use demonstrate adverse health outcomes, yet infrequently seek treatment. Insomnia, a common co-occurring complaint, could be targeted to reduce cannabis use and improve functioning in these individuals. In an intervention development study, we refined and tested the preliminary efficacy of a telemedicine-delivered CBT for insomnia tailored to individuals with regular cannabis use for sleep (CBTi-CB-TM). In this single-blind randomized trial, fifty-seven adults (43 women, mean age 37.6 ± 12.8 years) with chronic insomnia and cannabis use for sleep ≥3 times/week received CBTi-CB-TM (n = 30) or sleep hygiene education (SHE-TM, n = 27). Participants completed self-reported assessments of insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI]) and cannabis use (Timeline Followback [TLFB] and daily diary data) at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 8-week follow-up. ISI scores improved significantly more in the CBTi-CB-TM compared to SHE-TM condition (β = -2.83, se=0.84, P = 0.004, d=0.81). At 8-week follow-up, 18/30 (60.0 %) CBTi-CB-TM compared to 4/27 (14.8 %) SHE-TM participants were in remission from insomnia (X CBTi-CB-TM is feasible, acceptable, and demonstrated preliminary efficacy for improving sleep and cannabis-related outcomes among non-treatment-seeking individuals with regular cannabis use for sleep.

16,36809575,"During the treatment of cancer, 18% of patients use cannabis for symptom management. Anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances are common symptoms in cancer. A systematic review of the evidence for cannabis use for psychological symptoms in cancer patients was undertaken to develop a guideline. A literature search of randomized trials and systematic reviews was undertaken up to November 12, 2021. Studies were independently assessed for evidence by two authors and then evaluated by all authors for approval. The literature search involved MEDLINE, CCTR, EMBASE, and PsychINFO databases. Inclusion criteria included randomized control trials and systematic reviews on cannabis versus placebo or active comparator in patients with cancer and psychological symptom management (anxiety, depression, and insomnia). The search yielded 829 articles; 145 from Medline, 419 from Embase, 62 from PsychINFO, and 203 from CCTR. Two systematic reviews and 15 randomized trials (4 on sleep, 5 on mood, 6 on both) met eligibility criteria. However, no studies specifically assessed the efficacy of cannabis on psychological symptoms as primary outcomes in cancer patients. The studies varied widely in terms of interventions, control, duration, and outcome measures. Six of 15 RCTs suggested benefits (five for sleep, one for mood). There is no high-quality evidence to recommend the use of cannabis as an intervention for psychological symptoms in patients with cancer until more high-quality research demonstrates benefit. "
17,37243415,"Insomnia is highly prevalent among military veterans, with rates nearly double that of civilian populations. Insomnia typically co-occurs with other psychological problems, including substance use (e.g. cannabis) and perceived stress. Much of the research focused on insomnia, stress and cannabis use explores cannabis as a sleep aid and a mechanism for stress relief. However, recent theoretical and empirical evidence suggests a dynamic interplay between insomnia, cannabis use and perceived stress, yet few longitudinal studies exist. Using a sample of 1105 post-9/11 veterans assessed over four time points across 12 months, we used latent difference score modelling to examine proportional change between insomnia, perceived stress and cannabis use. Results revealed a complex interplay between all three constructs. In particular, we show that higher prior levels of insomnia are associated with greater increases in perceived stress, and greater prior levels of stress are associated with greater increases in cannabis use. Perhaps more importantly, our results also point to cannabis use as a catalyst for greater increases in both stress and insomnia severity. Our results suggest there may be both benefits and costs of cannabis use among veterans. Specifically, for veterans who experience chronic sleep problems, perceived stress may become overwhelming, and the benefit of stress reduction from increased cannabis use may come at the cost of increasing insomnia symptomology.

In a population-based twin cohort of 1882 twins (56% female, mean age = 22.99, SD = 2.97) we explored the genetic/environmental etiology of the relationship between onset of regular cannabis use and insomnia-related outcomes via multivariate twin models. Controlling for sex, current depression symptoms, and prior diagnosis of an anxiety or depression disorder, adult twins who reported early onset for regular cannabis use (age 17 or younger) were more likely to have insomnia (β = 0.07, p = 0.024) and insomnia with short sleep on weekdays (β = 0.08, p = 0.003) as young adults. We found significant genetic contributions for the onset of regular cannabis use (a2 = 76%, p < 0.001), insomnia (a2 = 44%, p < 0.001), and insomnia with short sleep on weekdays (a2 = 37%, p < 0.001). We found significant genetic correlations between onset of regular use and both insomnia (rA = 0.20, p = 0.047) and insomnia with short sleep on weekdays (rA = 0.25, p = 0.008) but no significant environmental associations between these traits. We found common genetic liabilities for early onset of regular cannabis use and insomnia, implying pleiotropic influences of genes on both traits. "

Two common reasons cited for the use and prescription of cannabis-based products are pain and insomnia. Unlike drug resistant epilepsy, the level of evidence of efficacy in pain is poorly developed. The lowest quality trials with the greatest methodological shortcomings suggest some benefit, a level of evidence that is inconsistent with widespread prescribing. The evidence in insomnia is scant.

23,33580483,"The recent trend for legalization of medicinal cannabis and cannabinoid-containing products, together with their soporific effects, has led to a surge of interest of their potential therapeutic role in the management of some common sleep disorders, such as insomnia, sleep disordered breathing, and restless legs syndrome, and less common disorders such as narcolepsy and parasomnias. Although much of the pre-clinical and clinical data were derived from studies with relatively small sample sizes and limited by biases in assessment, and in clinical trials lack of allocation concealment, as a whole, the results indicate a potential therapeutic role for cannabinoids in the management of some sleep disorders. Clinical trials are underway for insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea management, but there remains a substantial need for rigorous large multi-center studies to assess the dose, efficacy, and safety of the various types of cannabinoids on sleep disorders.

26,35302633,"Despite the legalization and widespread use of cannabis products for a variety of medical concerns in the US, there is not yet a strong clinical literature to support such use. The risks and benefits of obtaining a medical marijuana card for common clinical outcomes are largely unknown. To evaluate the effect of obtaining a medical marijuana card on target clinical and cannabis use disorder (CUD) symptoms in adults with a chief concern of chronic pain, insomnia, or anxiety or depressive symptoms. This pragmatic, single-site, single-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted in the Greater Boston area from July 1, 2017, to July 31, 2020. Participants were adults aged 18 to 65 years with a chief concern of pain, insomnia, or anxiety or depressive symptoms. Participants were randomized 2:1 to either the immediate card acquisition group (n = 105) or the delayed card acquisition group (n = 81). Randomization was stratified by chief concern, age, and sex. The statistical analysis followed an evaluable population approach. The immediate card acquisition group was allowed to obtain a medical marijuana card immediately after randomization. The delayed card acquisition group was asked to wait 12 weeks before obtaining a medical marijuana card. All participants could choose cannabis products from a dispensary, the dose, and the frequency of use. Participants could continue their usual medical or psychiatric care. Primary outcomes were changes in CUD symptoms, anxiety and depressive symptoms, pain severity, and insomnia symptoms during the trial. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for CUD diagnosis, and linear models were used for continuous outcomes to estimate the mean difference (MD) in symptom scores. A total of 186 participants (mean [SD] age 37.2 [14.4] years; 122 women [65.6%]) were randomized and included in the analyses. Compared with the delayed card acquisition group, the immediate card acquisition group had more CUD symptoms (MD, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.15-0.40; P < .001); fewer self-rated insomnia symptoms (MD, -2.90; 95% CI, -4.31 to -1.51; P < .001); and reported no significant changes in pain severity or anxiety or depressive symptoms. Participants in the immediate card acquisition group also had a higher incidence of CUD during the intervention (17.1% [n = 18] in the immediate card acquisition group vs 8.6% [n = 7] in the delayed card acquisition group; adjusted odds ratio, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.17-7.07; P = .02), particularly those with a chief concern of anxiety or depressive symptoms. This randomized clinical trial found that immediate acquisition of a medical marijuana card led to a higher incidence and severity of CUD; resulted in no significant improvement in pain, anxiety, or depressive symptoms; and improved self-rating of insomnia symptoms. Further investigation of the benefits of medical marijuana card ownership for insomnia and the risk of CUD are needed, particularly for individuals with anxiety or depressive symptoms.

27,33526132,"The therapeutic application of cannabidiol (CBD) is gaining interest due to expanding evidence for its use. To summarize the clinical outcomes, study designs and limitations for the use of CBD and nabiximols (whole plant extract from Cannabis sativa L. that has been purified into 1:1 ratio of CBD and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. A systematic review was conducted including case reports, case series, open-label trials, non-randomized and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The search resulted in 23 relevant studies on CBD and nabiximols in the treatment of a wide range of psychiatric disorders. The quality of evidence was judged by using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine 2011 Levels of Evidence that ranges from Level 1 to Level 5 based on the quality and study design. These levels of evidence help in grading the recommendations, including Grade A (strong), Grade B (moderate), Grade C (weak), and Grade D (weakest). CBD and CBD-containing compounds such as nabiximols were helpful in alleviating psychotic symptoms and cognitive impairment in patients with a variety of conditions, and several studies provided evidence of effectiveness in the treatment of cannabis withdrawal and moderate to severe cannabis use disorder with Grade B recommendation. There is Grade B recommendation supporting the use of CBD for the treatment of schizophrenia, social anxiety disorder and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Grade C recommendation exists for insomnia, anxiety, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and Tourette syndrome. These recommendations should be considered in the context of limited number of available studies. CBD and CBD-containing compounds such as nabiximols were helpful in alleviating symptoms of cannabis-related disorders, schizophrenia, social anxiety disorder, and comorbidities of ASD, and ADHD with moderate recommendation. However, there is weaker evidence for insomnia, anxiety, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and Tourette syndrome. The evidence for the use of CBD and CBD-containing compounds for psychiatric disorders needs to be explored in future studies, especially large-scale and well-designed RCTs. "
28,38574213,"Chronic low back pain, defined as lumbar pain persisting for 12 weeks or more, occurs in about 13% of U.S. adults. Patients with chronic low back pain should have a history and physical examination to identify red flags that may indicate serious conditions that warrant immediate intervention or yellow flags (i.e., psychological, environmental, and social factors) that indicate risk of disability. The examination should include an evaluation for radicular symptoms. Routine imaging is not recommended but is indicated when red flags are present, there is a neuromuscular deficit, or if pain does not resolve with conservative therapy. Patients should avoid bed rest. Nonpharmacologic treatment is first-line management and may include therapies with varying evidence of support, such as counseling, exercise therapy, spinal manipulation, massage, heat, dry needling, acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and physical therapy. Pharmacologic interventions are second-line treatment. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the initial medication of choice; duloxetine may also be beneficial. Evidence is inconclusive to recommend the use of benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, corticosteroids, insomnia agents, anticonvulsants, cannabis, acetaminophen, or long-term opioids. Epidural corticosteroid injections are not recommended except for short-term symptom relief in patients with radicular pain. Most patients with chronic low back pain will not require surgery; evaluation for surgery may be considered in those with persistent functional disabilities and pain from progressive spinal stenosis, worsening spondylolisthesis, or herniated disk. Physicians should consider prevention of chronic low back pain when patients present with acute back pain. Screening tools are available to predict the progression from acute to chronic low back pain, and targeted treatment strategies are beneficial for preventing progression. "
29,16335690,"This article estimates the prevalence of insomnia among Canadians aged 15 or older, and factors related to it. Associations between insomnia and coping ability, work status, two-week disability days and life dissatisfaction are analyzed. The data are from the 2002 Canadian Community Health Survey: Mental Health and Well-being. Cross-tabulations were used to estimate the prevalence of insomnia by selected characteristics. Associations between these characteristics and insomnia, and between insomnia and selected negative situations, were examined in multivariate logistic regression models. In 2002, an estimated 3.3 million Canadians (13.4% of the household population aged 15 or older) had insomnia. Factors independently associated with insomnia included painful chronic conditions, activity limitations, mood and anxiety disorders, life stress, frequent use of alcohol or cannabis, obesity, and low education. Compared with those who did not have insomnia, people with insomnia were more likely to report negataive situations such as difficulty coping and not having a job. "
30,36244318,"This pilot study aims to assess the effect of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for insomnia (CBTi) in individuals with cannabis use disorder and insomnia. It also aims to investigate the effect of CBTi on levels of serum inflammatory markers in relation to insomnia symptoms. Individuals with cannabis use disorder and insomnia symptoms were recruited over 18 months. Data collected included demographics, self-reported sleep parameters, and cannabis use. Blood samples were drawn to measure IL-2, IL-6, CRP, and cortisol. Participants completed the Insomnia Severity Index questionnaire (ISI) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), and they were provided with an actigraphy (wrist) device for 1 week before CBTi and a subsequent week after completing the 4 CBTi sessions. Nineteen participants were enrolled in the study. The mean ISI score decreased from moderately severe insomnia at baseline to no clinically significant insomnia after CBTi with a sustained decrease at 3- and 6-months follow-up. Actigraphy showed a significant decrease in sleep onset latency (SOL) after CBTi. Three months after CBTi, 80% of participants reported a decrease in their cannabis use. There was also a significant and sustained decrease in mean PHQ-4 scores after CBTi. Although only trending towards significance, the levels of three out of four biomarkers (IL-2, IL-6, CRP) were decreased 6 months after CBTi. CBTi is effective as a short- and long-term treatment of insomnia and comorbid anxiety/depression in individuals who regularly use cannabis. A potential added benefit is a reduction in cannabis consumption and inflammatory serum biomarkers. "
31,33537943,"Despite the fact that medical properties of Cannabis have been recognized for more than 5000 years, the use of Cannabis for medical purposes have recently reemerged and became more accessible. Cannabis is usually employed as a self-medication for the treatment of insomnia disorder. However, the effects of Cannabis on sleep depend on multiple factors such as metabolomic composition of the plant, dosage and route of administration. In the present chapter, we reviewed the main effect Cannabis on sleep. We focused on the effect of ""crude or whole plant"" Cannabis consumption (i.e., smoked, oral or vaporized) both in humans and experimental animal models.The data reviewed establish that Cannabis modifies sleep. Furthermore, a recent experimental study in animals suggests that vaporization (which is a recommended route for medical purposes) of Cannabis with high THC and negligible CBD, promotes NREM sleep. However, it is imperative to perform new clinical studies in order to confirm if the administration of Cannabis could be a beneficial therapy for the treatment of sleep disorders. "
32,31319769,"Up to 35% of adults in the United States suffer from sleep disturbances, which covary with a host of negative mental and physical health outcomes. Previous research suggests that cannabis' sedative effects may be associated with improved sleep. The present study examined the self-reported effect of cannabis use on individual's sleep-related problems. Participants included 311 individuals recruited online, who reported both sleep-related problems and cannabis use. Analyses revealed that participants expected cannabis to decrease the incidence of sleep-related problems, including allowing participants to have an earlier bedtime, to fall asleep more quickly, and to have a longer night's sleep. Moreover, expectancies about the influence of cannabis on sleep negatively covaried with cannabis-related problems. These findings suggest that individuals believe using cannabis might positively influence their sleep quality and believing so may be protective against cannabis problems. Randomized control trials of cannabis for insomnia appear justified. "
33,34952255,"Cannabidiol (CBD) has become a fast-growing avenue for research in psychiatry, and clinicians are challenged with understanding the implications of CBD for treating mental health disorders. The goal of this review is to serve as a guide for mental health professionals by providing an overview of CBD and a synthesis the current evidence within major psychiatric disorders. PubMed and PsycINFO were searched for articles containing the terms ""cannabidiol"" in addition to major psychiatric disorders and symptoms, yielding 2952 articles. Only randomized controlled trials or within-subject studies investigating CBD as a treatment option for psychiatric disorders (N = 16) were included in the review. Studies were reviewed for psychotic disorders (n = 6), anxiety disorders (n = 3), substance use disorders (tobacco n = 3, cannabis n = 2, opioid n = 1), and insomnia (n = 1). There were no published studies that met inclusion criteria for alcohol or stimulant use disorder, PTSD, ADHD, autism spectrum disorder, or mood disorders. Synthesis of the CBD literature indicates it is generally safe and well tolerated. The most promising preliminary findings are related to the use of CBD in psychotic symptoms and anxiety. There is currently not enough high-quality evidence to suggest the clinical use of CBD for any psychiatric disorder. "
34,31161270,"Cannabis is a useful botanical with a wide range of therapeutic potential. Global prohibition over the past century has impeded the ability to study the plant as medicine. However, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has been developed as a stand-alone pharmaceutical initially approved for the treatment of chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting in 1986. The indication was expanded in 1992 to include treatment of anorexia in patients with the AIDS wasting syndrome. Hence, if the dominant cannabinoid is available as a schedule III prescription medication, it would seem logical that the parent botanical would likely have similar therapeutic benefits. The system of cannabinoid receptors and endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) has likely developed to help us modulate our response to noxious stimuli. Phytocannabinoids also complex with these receptors, and the analgesic effects of cannabis are perhaps the best supported by clinical evidence. Cannabis and its constituents have also been reported to be useful in assisting with sleep, mood, and anxiety. Despite significant in vitro and animal model evidence supporting the anti-cancer activity of individual cannabinoids-particularly THC and cannabidiol (CBD)-clinical evidence is absent. A single intervention that can assist with nausea, appetite, pain, mood, and sleep is certainly a valuable addition to the palliative care armamentarium. Although many healthcare providers advise against the inhalation of a botanical as a twenty-first century drug-delivery system, evidence for serious harmful effects of cannabis inhalation is scant and a variety of other methods of ingestion are currently available from dispensaries in locales where patients have access to medicinal cannabis. Oncologists and palliative care providers should recommend this botanical remedy to their patients to gain first-hand evidence of its therapeutic potential despite the paucity of results from randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials to appreciate that it is both safe and effective and really does not require a package insert. "
35,31959585,"Medical cannabis (MC) is increasingly being used for treatment of chronic pain symptoms. Among patients there is also a growing preference for the use of MC to manage sleep problems. The aim of the current study was to examine the associations between use of whole plant cannabis and sleep problems among chronic pain patients. A total of 128 individuals with chronic pain over the age of 50 years were recruited from the Rambam Institute for Pain Medicine in Haifa, Israel. Of them, 66 were MC users and 62 were non-users. Regression models tested the differences in sleep problems between the two groups. Furthermore, Pearson correlations between MC use measures (dose, length and frequency of use, number of strains used, tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol levels) and sleep problems were assessed among MC users. After adjustment for age, sex, pain level and use of sleep and anti-depressant medications, MC use was associated with less problems with waking up at night compared with non-MC use. No group differences were found for problems with falling asleep or waking up early without managing to fall back asleep. Frequent MC use was associated with more problems waking up at night and falling asleep. MC use may have an overall positive effect on maintaining sleep throughout the night in chronic pain patients. At the same time, tolerance towards potential sleep-inducing properties of MC may occur with frequent use. More research based on randomised control trials and other longitudinal designs is warranted. "
36,31779999,"This study seeks to understand whether people substitute between recreational cannabis and conventional over-the-counter (OTC) sleep medications. UPC-level grocery store scanner data in a multivariable panel regression design were used to compare the change in the monthly market share of sleep aids with varying dispensary-based recreational cannabis access (existence, sales, and count) in Colorado counties between 12/2013 and 12/2014. We measured annually-differenced market shares for sleep aids as a portion of the overall OTC medication market, thus accounting for store-level demand shifts in OTC medication markets and seasonality, and used the monthly changes in stores' sleep aid market share to control for short-term trends. Relative to the overall OTC medication market, sleep aid market shares were growing prior to recreational cannabis availability. The trend reverses (a 236% decrease) with dispensary entry (-0.33 percentage points, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.24, p < 0.01) from a mean market share growth of 0.14 ± 0.97. The magnitude of the market share decline increases as more dispensaries enter a county and with higher county-level cannabis sales. The negative associations are driven by diphenhydramine- and doxylamine-based sleep aids rather than herbal sleep aids and melatonin. These findings support survey evidence that many individuals use cannabis to treat insomnia, although sleep disturbances are not a specific qualifying condition under any U.S. state-level medical cannabis law. Investigations designed to measure the relative effectiveness and side effect profiles of conventional OTC sleep aids and cannabis-based products are urgently needed to improve treatment of sleep disturbances while minimizing potentially serious negative side effects.

38,30624194,"Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of many cannabinoid compounds found in cannabis. It does not appear to alter consciousness or trigger a ""high."" A recent surge in scientific publications has found preclinical and clinical evidence documenting value for CBD in some neuropsychiatric disorders, including epilepsy, anxiety, and schizophrenia. Evidence points toward a calming effect for CBD in the central nervous system. Interest in CBD as a treatment of a wide range of disorders has exploded, yet few clinical studies of CBD exist in the psychiatric literature. To determine whether CBD helps improve sleep and/or anxiety in a clinical population. A large retrospective case series at a psychiatric clinic involving clinical application of CBD for anxiety and sleep complaints as an adjunct to usual treatment. The retrospective chart review included monthly documentation of anxiety and sleep quality in 103 adult patients. Sleep and anxiety scores, using validated instruments, at baseline and after CBD treatment. The final sample consisted of 72 adults presenting with primary concerns of anxiety (n = 47) or poor sleep (n = 25). Anxiety scores decreased within the first month in 57 patients (79.2%) and remained decreased during the study duration. Sleep scores improved within the first month in 48 patients (66.7%) but fluctuated over time. In this chart review, CBD was well tolerated in all but 3 patients. Cannabidiol may hold benefit for anxiety-related disorders. Controlled clinical studies are needed. "
39,34148759,"Insomnia symptoms may be an important etiological factor for substance use disorders; however, whether improving sleep leads to reductions in problematic substance use among at-risk populations remains unclear. As such, the current pilot study used a randomized controlled design to test the effects of Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia (BBTI) against a waitlist control among a sample of trauma-exposed young adults with elevated insomnia symptoms who regularly use cannabis (N = 56). Intent-to-treat multilevel modeling analyses indicated that BBTI may be more efficacious than waitlist control in reducing self-reported insomnia symptoms, with large effects three months post-treatment (d = 1.34). Further, our initial evidence suggested that BBTI resulted in reductions in cannabis-related problems with medium to large effects at three months post-treatment (d = 0.75). The current pilot analyses indicated BBTI also reduced cravings to use cannabis to reduce negative emotions in response to trauma cues with a large effect size. This pilot study suggests BBTI may be efficacious not only in improving insomnia symptoms among cannabis users but also in reducing cannabis-related problems and cravings over three months. Future research should replicate these results in a larger, fully powered sample with improved follow-up rates designed to test temporal mediation using multimethod assessments of insomnia symptoms and problematic cannabis use. Overall, BBTI may be a promising intervention for trauma-exposed cannabis users to improve sleep and reduce cannabis-related problems. "
40,33215831,"Cannabis has been used as a medicine for millennia. Prohibition in the mid-20th century precluded early scientific investigation. 'Cannabis' describes three separate forms - herbal cannabis, 'hemp' products, pharmaceutical-grade regulated cannabinoid-based medical products (CBMP). In Australia, CBMP became available for prescription in November 2016. Herbal cannabis with Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is illegal, and cannabidiol (CBD) in herbal extracts, are both unregulated and unreliable sources of cannabinoids. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), delineated in the late 1990s, has increased the understanding and interest in research for appropriate clinical indications. The ubiquitous ECS has homeostatic and anti-inflammatory effects and comprises cannabinoid receptors, endocannabinoids and degrading enzymes. Phytocannabinoids are partial agonists of the ECS. In pre-clinical studies, THC and CBD produce beneficial effects in chronic pain, anxiety, sleep and inflammation. Systematic reviews often conflate herbal cannabis and CBMP, confusing the evidence. Currently large randomised controlled trials are unlikely to be achieved. Other methodologies with quality end-points are required. Rich, valuable high-quality real-world evidence for the safe and effective use of CBMP provides an opportunity to examine benefits and potential harms. Evidence demonstrates benefit of CBMP in multiple sclerosis, chronic neuropathic pain, chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting, resistant paediatric epilepsy, anxiety and insomnia. CBMP are well tolerated with few serious adverse events. Additional clinical benefits are promising in many other resistant chronic conditions. Pharmaceutical grade prescribed CBMP has proven clinical benefits and provides another clinical option in the physician's pharmacopeia. "
41,34850899,"Session 2 of the National Cancer Institute's Cannabis, Cannabinoids, and Cancer Research Workshop opened with testimony from a lymphoma survivor who detailed medicinal cannabis-related improvements in nausea, low appetite, insomnia, and mental health and the limited clinical counsel she received regarding cannabis use. Discussion next turned to the evolution of the legal landscape of cannabis in the United States, one in which state and federal laws frequently conflict and the Controlled Substance Act renders cannabis Schedule I. This legal climate creates conundrums for US medicinal cannabis researchers who contend with limited funding opportunities, avenues to source trial drug, and procedural red tape and for oncology clinicians who recommend medicinal cannabis to patients with some frequency while perceiving themselves as ill equipped to make such clinical recommendations. Ultimately, it creates challenges for cancer patients who find themselves turning to nonmedical and anecdotal information sources. The risks of cannabis use by the cancer patient were discussed next. These include infection, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic drug-botanical interactions, cyclic nausea and vomiting, e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated illness, legal issues, and high cost. The session concluded with a broad survey of the research supporting oncologic cannabinoid use, conclusive evidence for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and suggestive evidence for cancer-related pain.

44,36259271,"Global interest in the non-intoxicating cannabis constituent, cannabidiol (CBD), is increasing with claims of therapeutic effects across a diversity of health conditions. At present, there is sufficient clinical trial evidence to support the use of high oral doses of CBD (e.g., 10-50 mg/kg) in treating intractable childhood epilepsies. However, a question remains as to whether ""low-dose"" CBD products confer any therapeutic benefits. This is an important question to answer, as low-dose CBD products are widely available in many countries, often as nutraceutical formulations. The present review therefore evaluated the efficacy and safety of low oral doses of CBD. The review includes interventional studies that measured the clinical efficacy in any health condition and/or safety and tolerability of oral CBD dosed at less than or equal to 400 mg per day in adult populations (i.e., ≥18 years of age).

45,33759668,"This study aimed to evaluate the published data on the effect of cannabis use in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women to alleviate menopausal symptoms, insomnia and anxiety. Databases searched included Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane, LILACS and AMED. Selected studies assessed perimenopausal or postmenopausal women, cannabis use impact and menopausal symptoms. A total of 564 studies were retrieved. Three studies met the inclusion criteria. One study controlled for participant cannabis use and reported on the effects of cannabis and placebo cigarette smoking on mood in 10 postmenopausal women. Another study assessed associations between drug use with hot flashes and insomnia in 120 HIV-infected women and found that menopausal status and cannabis use was crudely associated with the presence of hot flashes. The last study evaluated expectancies of 115 menopausal patients who endorsed lifetime cannabis use and reported that women expected cannabis to improve depression, anxiety, hot flashes and problems with sleep. None of these studies assessed quality of life as an outcome. There is a paucity of literature on the impact of cannabis use in menopause. Research into cannabis consumption in menopause is essential, as it is frequently used to alleviate symptoms without evidence of its benefits. "
46,36162349,"Algorithms for posttraumatic stress disorder were published by this team in 1999 and 2011. Developments since then warrant revision. New studies and review articles from January 2011 to November 2021 were identified via PubMed and analyzed for evidence supporting changes. Following consideration of variations required by special patient populations, treatment of sleep impairments remains as the first recommended step. Nightmares and non-nightmare disturbed awakenings are best addressed with the anti-adrenergic agent prazosin, with doxazosin and clonidine as alternatives. First choices for difficulty initiating sleep include hydroxyzine and trazodone. If significant non-sleep PTSD symptoms remain, an SSRI should be tried, followed by a second SSRI or venlafaxine as a third step. Second generation antipsychotics can be considered, particularly for SSRI augmentation when PTSD-associated psychotic symptoms are present, with the caveat that positive evidence is limited and side effects are considerable. Anti-adrenergic agents can also be considered for general PTSD symptoms if not already tried, though evidence for daytime use lags that available for sleep. Regarding other pharmacological and procedural options, e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation, cannabinoids, ketamine, psychedelics, and stellate ganglion block, evidence does not yet support firm inclusion in the algorithm.

47,35147654,"Our main aim was to investigate the short-term thera-peutic effects, safety/tolerability of natural compound, composed of melatonin (1,5 mg) and cannabis extracts (2.5 mg CBD) in patients with sleep disorders. In this spontaneous, anecdotal, retrospective, ""compas-sionate-use,"" observational, open-label study, 20 patients (age 43-96 years) were appealed to our ""Second Opinion Medical Consulting Net-work"" (Modena, Italy), because of a variable pattern of sleep disorders and anxiety and were instructed to take sublingually the compound (20 drops) overnight for 3 months of treatment. Tolerability and adverse effects were assessed monthly during the treatment period through direct contact (email or telephone) or visit if required. PSQUI and HAM-A scores evidenced reduction in mood alterations, including anxiety, panic, paranoia, depression (P < 0.03), in pain (P < 0.02) and good general health perceptions. These data suggest that the formula CBD-melatonin could be competitive with the classic hypnotic synthetic drugs, the antioxidant activity of melatonin offers a further benefit to the brain network, restoring the biological clock functions, while CBD, redu-cing chronic pain perception, helps to complete the neuromuscular relaxation and to relieve anxiety fulfilling a very balanced sensation of wellbeing during the sleep.

48,35611178,"The legalization of cannabis for medicinal, and in some countries, recreational, purposes in addition to growth in the cannabis industry has meant that cannabis use and interest in the area has increased rapidly over the past 20 years. Treatment of poor sleep and sleep disorders are two of the most common reasons for the current use of medicinal cannabis. However, evidence for the role of medical cannabis in the treatment of sleep disorders has not been clearly established, thus making it challenging for clinicians to make evidence-based decisions regarding efficacy and safety. This narrative review summarizes the highest quality clinical evidence currently available in relation to the use of medicinal cannabis for the treatment of sleep disorders including insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, nightmare disorder and narcolepsy. A summary of the effect of cannabis on sleep quality and architecture is also presented. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of medicinal cannabis as an effective and safe treatment option for any sleep disorder. Nevertheless, emerging evidence is promising and warrants further investigation using standardized cannabinoid products and validated quantitative measurement techniques. "
49,35458223,"Due to its stimulatory effects, caffeine is one of the most frequently consumed mood and behavior altering drugs. University students report using caffeine-containing products to enhance mood and performance or for a desire of alertness. The current study investigated caffeine consumption in university undergraduate students, and associations with smoking status, alcohol and cannabis consumption, fruit and vegetable consumption, and sleep quality. Motivations for caffeine intake were also ascertained. A total of 886 undergraduates aged 18−25 years from the University of the Balearic Islands participated in a cross-sectional survey. Caffeine was consumed by 91.1% of participants. Caffeine consumers were more likely to be female, smokers, and alcohol and cannabis consumers. Coffee was found to be the main source of caffeine intake in both men and women (48.9% of total caffeine intake). Higher percentages of women consumed coffee (56.4 vs. 42.1%, p = 0.01) and tea (40.3 vs. 19.8%, p < 0.001), whereas a higher percentage of men consumed energy drinks (18.0 vs. 7.4%, p < 0.001). Main motivations for caffeine intake were those related to cognitive enhancement. Caffeine intake was associated with poorer subjective sleep quality (p < 0.001). In conclusion, undergraduate students that were female and smokers reported higher caffeine intakes. Coffee was found as the main caffeine contributor, with higher contributions of tea in women and energy drinks in men. Universities should consider the implementation of health campaigns and educational programs to educate students of the risks of high caffeine consumption together with associated behaviors such as smoking, alcohol consumption and poor sleep quality to physical health and academic performance.

50,38569809,"To assess the use of cannabis as a symptom management strategy for patients with fibromyalgia. An electronic, cross-sectional survey was conducted among patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia and treated in Integrative Medicine & Health at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. The survey was constructed with the Symptom Management Theory tool and was sent anonymously via web-based software to patients with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Of 5234 patients with fibromyalgia sent the online survey, 1336 (25.5%) responded and met the inclusion criteria. Survey respondents had a median age of 48 (Q1-Q3: 37.5-58.0) years, and most identified as female. Nearly half of respondents (49.5%, n=661) reported cannabis use since their fibromyalgia diagnosis. The most common symptoms for which respondents reported using cannabis were pain (98.9%, n=654); fatigue (96.2%; n=636); stress, anxiety, or depression (93.9%; n=621); and insomnia (93.6%; n=619). Improvement in pain symptoms with cannabis use was reported by 82.0% (n=536). Most cannabis-using respondents reported that cannabis also improved symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression and of insomnia. Considering that cannabis is a popular choice among patients for managing fibromyalgia symptoms, clinicians should have adequate knowledge of cannabis when discussing therapeutic options for fibromyalgia with their patients.

51,33537944,"Shared neurophysiology of addiction and sleep disorders results in a bidirectional interplay. Diagnosing and treating primary sleep disorders, particularly in adolescents, can prevent the development of addiction in susceptible individuals. Addressing sleep issues in early recovery, and throughout maintenance, can prevent relapse. Cannabis use for insomnia shows mixed results; assisting with onset sleep latency in early use, this subsides with chronic use and holds addiction risk. Insomnia is a primary complaint of cannabis withdrawal syndrome and a primary cause of relapse in cannabis use disorder. An ideal sleep aid would prevent relapse and have low abuse potential. Pharmaceutical and behavioral options include suvorexant, mirtazapine, trazodone, and aerobic exercise, but clinical trials are lacking to demonstrate efficacy. "
52,32314110,"Insomnia is a common issue among patients with breast cancer with a potentially devastating impact on quality of life. It can be caused or exacerbated by multiple disease and treatment-related factors. Despite the prevalence and impact of insomnia, it is rarely addressed systematically in the oncology clinic. We conducted a comprehensive review of insomnia to guide clinical care of patient's with breast cancer and insomnia. This manuscript reviews the prevalence, etiology, emerging science and both non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic options for treatment of insomnia among patients with breast cancer. Multiple factors contribute to insomnia among patients with breast cancer including endocrine therapy and hotflashes, pain and discomfort from local therapy, and fear of recurrence. If we do identify insomnia, there are treatment options and strategies available to help patients. In particular, there is now a considerable body of evidence supporting the use of psychosocial interventions and behavioral treatments, such as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), yoga, and mind-body programs. It is also important for oncology providers to be educated regarding available pharmacologic therapies and emerging data for cannabis-based therapy. This manuscript provides an up-to-date and comprehensive review of the prevalence, etiology, and treatment approaches available for insomnia for clinicians treating patients with breast cancer. We also address strategies and goals for cancer care delivery and future research. "
53,36467783,"Cannabis and its natural derivatives have emerged as promising therapeutics for multiple pathological and nonpathological medical conditions. For example, cannabinoids, the most popular and biologically active chemicals in cannabis, aid in many clinical ailments, including pain, inflammation, epilepsy, sleep disturbances or insomnia, multiple sclerosis, anorexia, schizophrenia, neurodegenerative diseases, anti-nausea, and most importantly, cancer. Despite the comprehensive benefits, certain aspects of cannabis present unique challenges in the medical cannabis landscape. Recent studies have highlighted the inherent challenges associated with cannabinoids' formulation like low solubility, rapid metabolism, poor bioavailability, and erratic pharmacokinetics - all of which contribute to the limited efficacy of cannabinoids. Several efforts are underway to address the bottlenecks and modify the formulations along with the delivery systems to achieve greater solubility/bioavailability, potency, and efficacy in treatment settings while minding the necessary standards for purity associated with the pharmaceutical industry. The current article presents a perspective on (1) a working knowledge of cannabinoids and their mechanisms of action, (2) the landscape of using medicinal cannabis for cancer-related medical conditions along with adversities, (3) current approaches, formulations, and challenges in medicinal cannabis delivery systems (oral, transdermal, pulmonary, and transmucosal), and lastly, (4) emerging approaches to improve delivery systems.

Human studies that involved the administration of cannabinoids and at least 1 quantitative sleep-related measure were included. Review articles, opinion pieces, letters or editorials, case studies (final N < 8), published abstracts, posters, and non-English articles were excluded. Thirty-six publications were included in the review. Sleep was frequently interrupted during cannabis withdrawal, although the specific mechanisms of disruption remain unclear. Methodological issues in the majority of studies to date preclude any definitive conclusion on the specific aspects of sleep that are affected. "
55,37068366,"As greater numbers of states in the United States and countries in the world continue to legalize cannabis for medical use, it has become increasingly important to assess patterns of cannabis use in individuals using cannabis for medical symptoms over time. A public health concern is that, like recreational cannabis, some individuals using cannabis for medical reasons may develop detrimental patterns of use, leading to the development of a cannabis use disorder (CUD). In a 9-month longitudinal cohort study following a 12-week randomized, waitlist-controlled trial in 149 adults who used cannabis to alleviate insomnia, pain, depressed mood, or anxiety (RCT: NCT03224468), we assessed whether patterns of cannabis use for the 9 months following the RCT were associated with the development of CUD. We identified five unique trajectories of use; 31 participants (21%) had low stable or no use, 50 (34%) had medium stable use, 19 (13%) had high stable use, 26 (17%) showed de-escalating and 23 (15%) showed escalating use over 9 months following the RCT. Of 149 participants enrolled, 19 (13%) met diagnostic criteria for CUD at 12 months. Only the escalating cannabis use pattern predicted significantly higher rates of CUD compared to the low or no use category (OR = 4.29, 95% CI = 1.21 to 10.87, p = 0.02). These data indicate that most individuals using cannabis for medical symptoms have a stable pattern of use over the first year. Escalation of use may be a detrimental pattern that warrants further concern. "
56,38337193,"The primary aim of this study was to assess changes in sleep-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for those prescribed cannabis-based medicinal products (CBMPs) for insomnia. A case series of UK patients with insomnia was analyzed. Primary outcomes were changes in the Single-Item Sleep-Quality Scale (SQS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and EQ-5D-5L at up to 6 months from baseline. Statistical significance was identified as a p value < .050. 61 patients were included in the analysis. There was an improvement in the SQS from baseline at 1, 3, and 6 months (p < .001). There were also improvements in the EQ-5D-5L Index value and GAD-7 at 1, 3, and 6 months (p < .050). There were 28 (45.9%) adverse events recorded by 8 patients (13.1%). There were no life-threatening/disabling adverse events. Patients with insomnia experienced an improvement in sleep quality following the initiation of CBMPs in this medium-term analysis. Fewer than 15% of participants reported one or more adverse events. However, due to the limitations of the study design, further investigation is required before definitive conclusions can be drawn on the efficacy of CBMPs in treating insomnia. "
57,30139415,"Cannabis has been used as a medicinal plant for thousands of years. As a result of centuries of breeding and selection, there are now over 700 varieties of cannabis that contain hundreds of compounds, including cannabinoids and terpenes. Cannabinoids are fatty compounds that are the main biological active constituents of cannabis. Terpenes are volatile compounds that occur in many plants and have distinct odors. Cannabinoids exert their effect on the body by binding to receptors, specifically cannabinoid receptors types 1 and 2. These receptors, together with endogenous cannabinoids and the systems for synthesis, transport, and degradation, are called the Endocannabinoid System. The two most prevalent and commonly known cannabinoids in the cannabis plant are delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol. The speed, strength, and type of effects of cannabis vary based on the route of administration. THC is rapidly distributed through the body to fatty tissues like the brain and is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system to 11-hydroxy-THC, which is also psychoactive. Cannabis and cannabinoids have been indicated for several medical conditions. There is evidence of efficacy in the symptomatic treatment of nausea and vomiting, pain, insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, loss of appetite, Tourette's syndrome, and epilepsy. Cannabis has also been associated with treatment for glaucoma, Huntington's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and dystonia, but there is not good evidence to support its efficacy. Side effects of cannabis include psychosis and anxiety, which can be severe. Here, we provided a summary of the history of cannabis, its pharmacology, and its medical uses. "

59,33263719,"Cannabis is increasingly being used for medicinal purposes but remains outside Western medical practice. Data on perioperative use and outcomes are scarce. Few surgeons receive training regarding legal endorsement, reported medicinal benefits, and potential risks, making it difficult to advise patients. Guidelines and additional research are needed. It is legal to recommend cannabis, which can be obtained in states with medical cannabis programs. There are many methods of consumption, oral being the safest. Activity is primarily through Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) via cannabinoid receptors, which may be potentiated when taken together in the plant or plant extract. The known effects of cannabis on inflammation and malignancy are largely limited to laboratory experiments. However, there are higher-quality data to support adjunctive use of cannabis for relief of pain, nausea, and insomnia, which may be useful postoperatively and could potentially decrease reliance on opiates and benzodiazepines. There are prospective trials in surgical patients, but no reported data regarding surgical complications or other surgical outcomes. Currently, cannabis is regulated differently than other controlled substances, and there are issues with purity/homogeneity, making it difficult for surgeons to accept or significantly explore its medical benefits. Recommendations are made for surgeons advising patients who use cannabis based on the limited existing data. While cannabis likely has some therapeutic benefits, it must be treated as other medical controlled substances to truly elucidate its role in surgical patient care. "
60,33526110,"Growing interest in the medicinal properties of cannabis has led to an increase in its use to treat medical conditions, and the establishment of state-specific medical cannabis programs. Despite medical cannabis being legal in 33 states and the District of Colombia, there remains a paucity of data characterizing the patients accessing medical cannabis programs. We retrospectively reviewed a registry with data from 33 medical cannabis evaluation clinics in the United States, owned and operated by CB2 Insights. Data were collected primarily by face-to-face interviews for patients seeking medical cannabis certification between November 18, 2018 and March 18, 2020. Patients were removed from the analysis if they did not have a valid date of birth, were less than 18, or did not have a primary medical condition reported; a total of 61,379 patients were included in the analysis. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics expressed as a mean (standard deviation (SD)) or median (interquartile range (IQR)) as appropriate for continuous variables, and number (percent) for categorical variables. Statistical tests performed across groups included t-tests, chi-squared tests and regression. The average age of patients was 45.5, 54.8% were male and the majority were Caucasian (87.5%). Female patients were significantly older than males (47.0 compared to 44.6). Most patients reported cannabis experience prior to seeking medical certification (66.9%). The top three mutually exclusive primary medical conditions reported were unspecified chronic pain (38.8%), anxiety (13.5%) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (8.4%). The average number of comorbid conditions reported was 2.7, of which anxiety was the most common (28.3%). Females reported significantly more comorbid conditions than males (3.1 compared to 2.3). This retrospective study highlighted the range and number of conditions for which patients in the US seek medical cannabis. Rigorous clinical trials investigating the use of medical cannabis to treat pain conditions, anxiety, insomnia, depression and PTSD would benefit a large number of patients, many of whom use medical cannabis to treat multiple conditions. "
61,34704957,"Insomnia is a prevalent condition that presents itself at both the symptom and diagnostic levels. Although insomnia is one of the main reasons individuals seek medicinal cannabis, little is known about the profile of cannabinoid use or the perceived benefit of the use of cannabinoids in daily life. We conducted a retrospective study of medicinal cannabis users to investigate the use profile and perceived efficacy of cannabinoids for the management of insomnia. Data were collected using the Strainprint app, which allows medicinal cannabis users to log conditions and symptoms, track cannabis use, and monitor symptom severity pre- and postcannabis use. Our analyses examined 991 medicinal cannabis users with insomnia across 24,189 tracked cannabis use sessions. Sessions were analyzed, and both descriptive statistics and linear mixed-effects modeling were completed to examine use patterns and perceived efficacy. Overall, cannabinoids were perceived to be efficacious across all genders and ages, and no significant differences were found among product forms, ingestion methods, or gender groups. Although all strain categories were perceived as efficacious, predominant indica strains were found to reduce insomnia symptomology more than cannabidiol (CBD) strains (estimated mean difference 0.59, SE 0.11; 95% CI 0.36-0.81; adjusted P<.001) and predominant sativa strains (estimated mean difference 0.74, SE 0.16; 95% CI 0.43-1.06; adjusted P<.001). Indica hybrid strains also presented a greater reduction in insomnia symptomology than CBD strains (mean difference 0.52, SE 0.12; 95% CI 0.29-0.74; adjusted P<.001) and predominant sativa strains (mean difference 0.67, SE 0.16; 95% CI 0.34-1.00; adjusted P=.002). Medicinal cannabis users perceive a significant improvement in insomnia with cannabinoid use, and this study suggests a possible advantage with the use of predominant indica strains compared with predominant sativa strains and exclusively CBD in this population. This study emphasizes the need for randomized placebo-controlled trials assessing the efficacy and safety profile of cannabinoids for the treatment of insomnia. "
62,31895189,"Marijuana generally refers to the dried mixture of leaves and flowers of the cannabis plant, and the term cannabis is a commonly used to refer to products derived from the Cannabis sativa L. plant. There has been an increasing interest in the potential medicinal use of cannabis to treat a variety of diseases and conditions. This review will provide the latest evidence regarding the medical risks and potential therapeutic benefits of cannabis in managing patients with sleep disorders or those with other medical conditions who commonly suffer with sleep disturbance as an associated comorbidity. Published data regarding the effects of cannabis compounds on sleep in the general population, as well as in patients with insomnia, chronic pain, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other neurological conditions, will be presented. Current trends for marijuana use and its effects on the economy and the implications that those trends and effects have on future research into medical cannabis are also presented. "
63,28457056,"A flowering plant of variegated ingredients and psychoactive qualities, cannabis has long been used for medicinal and recreational purposes. Currently, cannabis is approved in several countries for indications of symptomatic alleviation. However, limited knowledge on the benefits and risks precludes inclusion of cannabis in standard treatment guidelines. This review provides a summary of the available literature on the use of cannabis and cannabinoid-based medicines in palliative oncology. Favorable outcomes are demonstrated for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and cancer-related pain, with evidence of advantageous neurological interactions. Benefit in the treatment of anorexia, insomnia and anxiety is also suggested. Short- and long-term side effects appear to be manageable and to subside after discontinuation of the drug. Finally, cannabinoids have shown anti-neoplastic effects in preclinical studies in a wide range of cancer cells and some animal models. Further research is needed before cannabis can become a part of evidence-based oncology practice. "
64,37273764,"The primary objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of cannabis use in patients with gynecologic malignancies and to describe patterns of cannabis use. Secondary objectives included identifying sources of cannabis information used by patients. This is a single institution cross sectional survey conducted in Calgary, Alberta. Patients with a current or prior gynecologic cancer diagnosis were considered for inclusion. Planned analysis included descriptive statistics of patient demographics, and the patterns of cannabis use were described using frequencies and proportions. Forty-six patients participated in the survey. The most common disease sites were ovarian cancer and uterine cancer, with the majority of patients receiving chemotherapy as part of their treatment (n = 35). Seventeen participants were current cannabis users (37%). The most common symptoms participants used cannabis for were pain (9/17), anxiety (9/17), and insomnia (9/17).Most patients using cannabis did not have a prescription and obtained their cannabis from a recreational dispensary (11/17). Many participants using cannabis had not talked to their doctor about cannabis (9/17). Instead, the most common sources of information about cannabis were cannabis retailers (20/46), and friends/family (20/46). Over 50% of patients would be interested in discussing cannabis if their physician broached the subject (26/46). The results from this survey indicate that patients would like to talk to their oncologist about cannabis. Further research is needed to inform physician training and direct patient education to ensure that patients have access to unbiased, evidence-based information to make decisions about cannabis use.

65,35047242,"Many countries now allow the consumption of cannabis or cannabinoids for medical purposes with varying approaches concerning products allowed and the regulatory frameworks prevailing their endowment. On 18 February 2019 Thailand passed legislation allowing the use of cannabis for medical purposes. This study aimed to examine patterns and purposes for consumption of medical cannabis, and consumers' perceptions and opinions towards benefits and harms of cannabis and related policies in 2019-2020. A cross-sectional study using a respondent-driven sampling (RDS) method was conducted in four sites across Thailand. Participants were 485 adults aged 18 years and over, living in the study region, who had used cannabis for medical purposes within the past 12 months. Face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire were used to collect data on (1) demographic characteristics, (2) pattern of consumption, (3) source of information and perception of benefits and harms of medical cannabis, and (4) opinion towards cannabis policies. Data were analyzed using RDS Analyst and presented as percentage and mean with 95% confidence interval (CI). Most participants (84.7%, 95% CI [78.9-90.5]) used an oral form of crude oil extract while 9.2% (95% CI [4.1-14.2]) used the raw form. The most common uses were for treatment of cancers (23.3%, 95% CI [16.1-30.4]), neuropsychiatric symptoms (22.8%, 95% CI [17.5-28.0]), and musculoskeletal pains (21.6%, 95% CI [16.7-26.6]). Illegal sources such as underground traders (54.5%, 95% CI [40.8-68.3]), friends and relatives (12.2%, 95% CI [6.2-18.3]), not-for-profit provider groups (5.2%, 95% CI [0.5-10.9]), and clandestine growers or producers (2.9%, 95% CI [0.6-5.3]) were the main suppliers. Most (>80%) perceived cannabis could treat cancers, chronic pains, insomnia, Parkinson's disease and generalized anxiety disorder. Less than half perceived that cannabis could cause adverse conditions  Our study reports the experiences of consumers of medical cannabis in the first year after its legalization in Thailand. Consumers reported various patterns and indications of consumption that were not supported by scientific evidence, but had positive perception of the results of consumption. These findings highlight ongoing policy challenges for Thailand and can be a lesson to be learned for other countries in the region. "
66,32634714,"Poor sleep quality and insomnia have been associated with the use of tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis, but it is unclear if there is a causal link. In this Mendelian Randomization (MR) study we examine if insomnia causes substance use and/or if substance use causes insomnia. MR uses summary effect estimates from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to create a genetic instrumental variable for a proposed 'exposure' variable and then identifies that same genetic instrument in an 'outcome' GWAS. Using GWASs of insomnia, smoking (initiation, heaviness, cessation), alcohol use (drinks per week, dependence), and cannabis initiation, bi-directional causal effects were tested. Multiple sensitivity analyses were applied to assess the robustness of the findings. There was strong evidence for positive causal effects of liability to insomnia on all substance use phenotypes (smoking traits, alcohol dependence, cannabis initiation), except alcohol per week. In the other direction, there was strong evidence that smoking initiation increased insomnia risk (smoking heaviness and cessation could not be tested as exposures). We found no evidence that alcohol use per week, alcohol dependence, or cannabis initiation causally affect insomnia risk. There were unidirectional effects of liability to insomnia on alcohol dependence and cannabis initiation, and bidirectional effects between liability to insomnia and smoking measures. Bidirectional effects between smoking and insomnia might give rise to a vicious circle. Future research should investigate if interventions aimed at insomnia are beneficial for substance use treatment. "
67,30113101,"Sleep disturbance is one of the hallmarks of cannabis withdrawal. Studies have indicated that treatment of this key symptom may facilitate abstinence. In the present paper we aim to provide a systematic review of the extant literature on pharmacological management of sleep disturbance associated with cannabis withdrawal. We conducted a systematic literature search across five electronic databases including PubMed, Psycinfo, MEDLINE, Cochrane review and Embase. Human studies using a pharmacological treatment for sleep disturbances associated with cannabis withdrawal were included. Review articles, case-series, open trials, posters, and editorials were excluded. Seventeen publications, involving 562 participants, were included in this review. Major limitations involved small sample size, high dropout rate, methodological limitations, and heterogeneity of participants. Most of the studies were at high risk of bias, further downgrading the level of evidence. A meta-analysis was not performed due to lack of quantitative data, marked heterogeneity and low quality of the included studies. There is not sufficient evidence for any of the reviewed treatment options. Methodological limitations in a majority of the studies rendered their findings preliminary. Of the twelve investigated pharmacological agents, Gabapentin, Lofexidine, Mirtazapine, Quetiapine, and Zolpidem showed some primary benefits for treatment of sleep difficulties associated with cannabis withdrawal; however, future prospective studies are required to confirm such results. This review examines the current evidence for potential pharmacological options for treatment of cannabis withdrawal and associated sleep disturbance. It furthers our knowledge and provides groundwork for future research. (Am J Addict 2018;27:453-464). "
68,35354186,"Indian hemp (lat. Cannabis sativa subs. Indica) has been used as a source of industrial fiber, seed oil, food, medicine for some somatic diseases, and it is also used as a psychoactive substance. Cannabis can be used by smoking, evaporation, as a food ingredient, or as an extract. Acute and chronic cannabis use has been shown to be detrimental to several aspects of psychological and physical health and many experimental studies done on healthy people indicate the potential of Δ9- tetra hydro cannabinoid (THC) in inducing transient, dose-dependent psychotic symptoms, but also affective, behavioral, cognitive, neurovegetative, and psychophysical symptoms. Cannabis is the most commonly used illegal drug globally. In many communities, cannabis is perceived as a low-risk drug, leading to political lobbying to decriminalize its use. The wave of laws and initiatives to liberalize cannabis use continues to spread across the United States and the rest of the world, and there seems to be a political debate in the background about the potential risks and benefits of cannabis use. Aim is to present the possible consequences that the legalization of cannabis would have from the aspect of mental health and mental disorders. Authors reviewed the literature using PubMed resources on the effects of cannabis using the keywords: cannabis use, cannabis use and psychoticism, cannabis use and depression, cannabis use and anxiety, cannabis use and cognition, cannabis use and insomnia, legalization of cannabis. Authors examined the effects of cannabis use on psychiatric disorders and the review of the legal status of cannabis use in the world was also made. The possible consequences of cannabis legalization on the public health system were also considered, based on experiences from countries where legalization has already been done. The evidence cited in this article suggests that strong claims about the need to legalize cannabis are still questionable, and may, even in the long run, remain mixed, inconclusive, or even contradictory. Political interference in this issue can trigger a wide range of unintended but profound and lasting consequences for the health system and the health of the individual. We recommend further research on this topic and data collection with an emphasis on the effects and consequences of cannabis use on mental health, and in particular the benefits and harmful effects of medical cannabis use. "
69,33439370,"The use of the cannabis plant by cancer patients has been rising significantly in the past few years worldwide, primarily driven by public demand. There is an obvious need for more reliable scientific data, pharmacology information, a better understanding of its mode of action, and available clinical evidence supporting its robust use. Physicians must complete a thorough medical assessment, screening for potential drugs, or treatment contraindications before allowing its consumption. In light of the growing popularity of cannabis usage, it is highly essential that, in the near future, the medical community will be able to provide practical recommendations and explicit guidelines, including doses, and that cannabinoid concentrations in the used products are defined regarding its prescription before any medical procedure involving its usage is authorized. Here, we review and describe the favorable outcomes demonstrating the benefits of cannabis as an adjunctive treatment to conventional medicines for chemotherapy-induced nausea, vomiting, and cancer-related pain (primarily refractory chronic or neuropathic pain). Although not yet substantial enough, the treatment of anorexia, insomnia, depression, and anxiety is also seemingly favorable. To date, reports regarding its anti-neoplastic effects or its potent immunosuppressive properties influencing response to immunotherapy are still very conflicting and controversial. Thus, with the current state of evidence, cannabis use is not advisable as initial treatment, as an adjunct or an advanced line of care. In the coming years, we expect that preclinical data and animal models will shift to the clinical arena, and more patients will be recruited for clinical trials, and their reports will advance the field. Thus, physicians should prescribe cannabis only if careful clarification and consideration is provided together with a follow-up response evaluation. "
70,27022315,"Cannabis species have been used as medicine for thousands of years; only since the 1940s has the plant not been widely available for medical use. However, an increasing number of jurisdictions are making it possible for patients to obtain the botanical for medicinal use. For the cancer patient, cannabis has a number of potential benefits, especially in the management of symptoms. Cannabis is useful in combatting anorexia, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, pain, insomnia, and depression. Cannabis might be less potent than other available antiemetics, but for some patients, it is the only agent that works, and it is the only antiemetic that also increases appetite. Inhaled cannabis is more effective than placebo in ameliorating peripheral neuropathy in a number of conditions, and it could prove useful in chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. A pharmacokinetic interaction study of vaporized cannabis in patients with chronic pain on stable doses of sustained-release opioids demonstrated no clinically significant change in plasma opiates, while suggesting the possibility of synergistic analgesia. Aside from symptom management, an increasing body of in vitro and animal-model studies supports a possible direct anticancer effect of cannabinoids by way of a number of different mechanisms involving apoptosis, angiogenesis, and inhibition of metastasis. Despite an absence of clinical trials, abundant anecdotal reports that describe patients having remarkable responses to cannabis as an anticancer agent, especially when taken as a high-potency orally ingested concentrate, are circulating. Human studies should be conducted to address critical questions related to the foregoing effects. "
71,29419734,"This review summarizes the available literature on the intersection of adolescent cannabis use and sleep disturbances, along with interventions for adolescent cannabis users who suffer sleep impairments. Adolescents are susceptible to various sleep disorders, which are often exacerbated by the use of substances such as cannabis. The relationship between cannabis and sleep is bidirectional. Interventions to improve sleep impairments among adolescent cannabis users to date have demonstrated limited efficacy, although few studies indicating the benefits of behavioral interventions-such as Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Insomnia or Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction-appear promising in the treatment of sleep disorders, which are present for users of cannabis. Further research is necessary to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which cannabis use coexists with sleep impairments, along with effective interventions for those users who suffer sleep difficulties.

73,38612615,"The post-COVID condition (PCC) is a pathology stemming from COVID-19, and studying its pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment is crucial. Neuroinflammation causes the most common manifestations of this disease including headaches, fatigue, insomnia, depression, anxiety, among others. Currently, there are no specific management proposals; however, given that the inflammatory component involves cytokines and free radicals, these conditions must be treated to reduce the current symptoms and provide neuroprotection to reduce the risk of a long-term neurodegenerative disease. It has been shown that cannabis has compounds with immunomodulatory and antioxidant functions in other pathologies. Therefore, exploring this approach could provide a viable therapeutic option for PCC, which is the purpose of this review. This review involved an exhaustive search in specialized databases including PubMed, PubChem, ProQuest, EBSCO, Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Clinical Trials. Phytocannabinoids, including cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG), and Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), exhibit significant antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties and have been shown to be an effective treatment for neuroinflammatory conditions. These compounds could be promising adjuvants for PCC alone or in combination with other antioxidants or therapies. PCC presents significant challenges to neurological health, and neuroinflammation and oxidative stress play central roles in its pathogenesis. Antioxidant therapy and cannabinoid-based approaches represent promising areas of research and treatment for mitigating adverse effects, but further studies are needed. "
74,36460181,"Cannabis use rates are increasing in the United States. Patients with cancer use cannabis for many reasons, even without high-quality supporting data. This study sought to characterize cannabis use among patients seen in radiation oncology in a state that has legalized adult nonmedical use cannabis and to identify key cannabis-related educational topics. Cannabis history was documented by providers using a structured template at patient visits in an academic radiation oncology practice October 2020 to November 2021. Cannabis use data, including recency/frequency of use, reason, and mode of administration, were summarized, and logistic regression was used to explore associations between patient and disease characteristics and recent cannabis use. A multivariable model employed stepwise variable selection using the Akaike Information Criterion. Of 3143 patients total, 91 (2.9%) declined to answer cannabis use questions, and 343 (10.9%) endorsed recent use (≤1 month ago), 235 (7.5%) noted nonrecent use (>1 month ago), and 2474 (78.7%) denied history of cannabis use. In multivariable analyses, those ≥50 years old (odds ratio [OR], 0.409; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.294-0.568; P < .001) or with history of prior courses of radiation (OR, 0.748; 95% CI, 0.572-0.979; P = .034) were less likely, and those with a mental health diagnosis not related to substance use (OR, 1.533; 95% CI, 1.171-2.005; P = .002) or who smoked tobacco (OR, 3.003; 95% CI, 2.098-4.299; P < .001) were more likely to endorse recent cannabis use. Patients reported pain, insomnia, and anxiety as the most common reasons for use. Smoking was the most common mode of administration. Patients are willing to discuss cannabis use with providers and reported recent cannabis use for a variety of reasons. Younger patients new to oncologic care and those with a history of mental illness or tobacco smoking may benefit most from discussions about cannabis given higher rates of cannabis use in these groups.

75,30828459,"Physical and psychological symptom burden in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) is significantly debilitating; yet, it is often inadequately treated. Legalization of cannabis in Canada may attract increasing interest from patients for its medical use in refractory symptom management, but its indications and long-term adverse health impacts are poorly established, creating a challenge for clinicians to support its use. In this review, we summarize key clinical studies and the level of evidence for nonsynthetic cannabinoids in the treatment of common symptoms encountered in advanced stages of CKD, including chronic pain, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, pruritus, and insomnia. Medline and Embase. A search was conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE (inception to March 1, 2018) on cannabis and CKD symptoms of interest, complemented with a manual review of bibliographies. Studies that examined synthetic cannabinoids that are manufactured to mimic the effects of ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol such as dronabinol, levonantradol, nabilone, and ajulemic acid were excluded. We focused on studies with higher level of evidence where available, and quality of studies was graded based on the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence (1a to 5). Based on studies conducted in patients without renal impairment, those treated with nonsynthetic cannabinoids were 43% to 300% more likely to report a ≥30% reduction in chronic neuropathic pain compared with placebo. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend nonsynthetic cannabinoids for other medical indications, although preliminary investigation into topical endocannabinoids for uremia-induced pruritus in end-stage renal disease is promising. Finally, any benefits of cannabis may be offset by potential harms in the form of cognitive impairment, increased risk of mortality post-myocardial infarction, orthostatic hypotension, respiratory irritation, and malignancies (with smoked cannabis). Nonsynthetic cannabinoid preparations were highly variable between studies, sample sizes were small, and study durations were short. Due to an absence of studies conducted in CKD, recommendations were primarily extrapolated from the general population. Until further studies are conducted, the role of nonsynthetic cannabinoids for symptom management in patients with CKD should be limited to the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain. Clinicians need to be cognizant that nonsynthetic cannabinoid preparations, particularly smoked cannabis, can pose significant health risks and these must be cautiously weighed against the limited substantiated therapeutic benefits of cannabis in patients with CKD. Les symptômes physiques et psychologiques ressentis par les patients souffrant d’insuffisance rénale chronique (IRC) sont particulièrement débilitants, et souvent traités inadéquatement. La légalisation du cannabis au Canada pourrait susciter un intérêt croissant chez ces patients avec l’emploi médical de cette substance pour le traitement de ces symptômes. Cependant, les indications thérapeutiques du cannabis et ses effets nocifs sur la santé à long terme sont mal connus, rendant difficile son soutien par les cliniciens. L’article présente l’état des preuves et une synthèse des principales études cliniques portant sur l’usage des cannabinoïdes non synthétiques dans le traitement des symptômes fréquemment observés aux stades avancés de l’IRC, soit la douleur chronique, les nausées, les vomissements, l’anorexie, le prurit et l’insomnie. Medline et Embase. On a procédé à une recherche dans MEDLINE et EMBASE (de leur création jusqu’au 1 Des études menées chez des patients non atteints d’insuffisance rénale montraient que les sujets recevant des cannabinoïdes non synthétiques étaient 43 à 300 % plus susceptibles de rapporter une réduction d’au moins 30 % de la douleur neuropathique chronique comparativement aux sujets recevant un placebo. Mais pour l’heure, les preuves permettant de recommander les cannabinoïdes non synthétiques à d’autres fins médicales sont insuffisantes; quoique des résultats préliminaires soient prometteurs avec les endocannabinoïdes topiques dans le traitement du prurit provoqué par l’urémie en contexte d’IRC. Cependant, tout bienfait du cannabis pourrait se voir neutralisé par de potentiels effets nocifs tels que troubles cognitifs, risque accru de mortalité après un infarctus du myocarde, hypotension orthostatique, irritation des voies respiratoires ou tumeurs malignes (dues à l’inhalation). Les préparations de cannabinoïdes non synthétiques employées dans les études retenues étaient très variables, les échantillons étaient faibles et les études de courte durée. En absence d’études menées en contexte d’IRC, les résultats présentés sont principalement extrapolés d’une population générale. Jusqu’à ce que d’autres études soient menées, l’utilisation des cannabinoïdes non synthétiques chez les patients atteints d’IRC devrait se limiter au soulagement des douleurs neuropathiques chroniques. Les cliniciens doivent comprendre que les cannabinoïdes non synthétiques, particulièrement lorsqu’ils sont inhalés, comportent des risques significatifs pour la santé et que ceux-ci doivent être examinés avec prudence en regard des bienfaits thérapeutiques limités du cannabis chez les patients atteints d’IRC.

76,34225825,"The use of cannabinoids in mental health has gained strength in recent years due to emerging scientific evidence and the lifting of prohibitionist laws that prevailed for years in many countries, including Colombia. This study describes the results of a survey of Colombian psychiatrists on some aspects of medicinal cannabis, such as attitudes towards its potential use, perceived knowledge, and beliefs surrounding its regulation and safety. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 145 psychiatrists in 14 territories of Colombia between November 2019 and July 2020. The survey consisted of 28 items on topics related to medicinal cannabis, including attitudes and clinical experience (4 items), perceived knowledge (4 items), indications for use in psychiatric pathologies (6 items), indications for use in nonpsychiatric pathologies (8 items), and concerns and awareness about safety and efficacy (6 items). The results were summarized using descriptive statistics. In addition, possible associations among variables were examined using Fisher's exact test. Eighty-two percent of the psychiatrists agreed that medical cannabis should be available for different medical conditions, and 73.1% stated that they wanted to be able to prescribe it. However, 66.2% said they did not know how to help their patients legally access it, and only 25% understood the legal status of medicinal cannabis in the country. The mental health indications that received the highest approval levels for cannabis use were insomnia (35.2%), anxiety disorders (29%), and agitation in dementia (18.6%). The greatest disapproval of cannabis use was indicated for schizophrenia, with 66.9%. The most approved nonpsychiatric medical conditions were cancer-related chronic pain (87.6%), chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting (78.6%), and chronic pain not associated with cancer (72.4%). Multinomial stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that female psychiatrists who did not agree with MC to treat psychiatric symptoms were more likely to agree with non-psychiatric use. Our results showed that this sample of Colombian psychiatrists have a favorable attitude towards the prescription of medicinal cannabis; however, there is a serious lack of knowledge of the legal status of medicinal cannabis in the country and the methods through which patients can gain access to government-regulated products. Most of them approve the use of MC for nonpsychiatric conditions and, in general, disapprove of its use in mental illnesses. They generally consider medicinal cannabis as a safe treatment compared to other psychotropic drugs and medications with potential risk of dependence, such as opioids and/or benzodiazepines. "
77,35162872,"Using cannabis to reduce psychological and physical distress, referred to as self-medication, is a significant risk factor for cannabis use disorder. To better understand this high-risk behavior, a sample of 290 young adults (ages 18-25; 45.6% female) were recruited from two U.S. universities in January and February of 2020 to complete a survey about their cannabis use and self-medication. Results: seventy-six percent endorsed using cannabis to reduce problems such as anxiety, sleep, depression, pain, loneliness, social discomfort, and concentration. When predicting reasons for self-medication with cannabis, logistic regression models showed that lower CUDIT-R scores, experiencing withdrawal, living in a state where cannabis was illegal, and being female were all associated with higher rates of self-medication. Withdrawal symptoms were tested to predict self-medication with cannabis, and only insomnia and loss of appetite were significant predictors. To further explore why young adults self-medicate, each of the original predictors were regressed on seven specified reasons for self-medication. Young adults experiencing withdrawal were more likely to self-medicate for pain. Participants living where cannabis is legal were less likely to self-medicate for anxiety and depression. Living where cannabis is illegal also significantly predicted self-medicating for social discomfort-though the overall model predicting social discomfort was statistically non-significant. Finally, female participants were more likely to self-medicate for anxiety. These results suggest widespread self-medication among young adults with likely CUD and underscore the complexity of their cannabis use. The findings have implications for understanding why young adults use cannabis in relation to psychological and physical distress and for accurately treating young adults with cannabis use disorder. "
78,23040955,"The main characteristics of cannabis dependence are craving, persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control cannabis use and important social, occupational, or recreational activities given up or reduced because of cannabis use. Withdrawal symptoms include insomnia, irritability, anger, restlessness, depression, mood swings and cravings. Regular cannabis use induces cognitive impairment, especially of attention, episodic memory and working memory. Alcohol and other substances abuse or dependence are frequently found in patients with cannabis dependence. Psychiatric comorbidities are frequent in patients with cannabis dependence, in particular anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and personality disorders. The treatment of cannabis dependence includes behavioral psychotherapy, especially motivational interviewing and cognitive-behavioral therapy, alongside treatment of co-occurring mental health and substance use conditions. There are currently no available pharmacological treatment interventions for cannabis dependence. The treatment of cannabis dependence and withdrawal remains nonspecific. "
79,39480147,"Cannabis is a psychoactive substance the availability and use of which, in various forms, has been liberalized in many countries across the world. Cannabis use, including by women of reproductive age, has become increasingly common, with (in some studies) >5% of women using the substance even during pregnancy to self treat nausea, vomiting, stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, chronic pain, and other conditions. Women who use cannabis during pregnancy are more likely to have a medical or mental health condition; they are commonly unaware that cannabis is associated with pregnancy related risks. These risks arise from effects of cannabis on cannabinoid receptors in the placenta as well as from cannabis constituents that cross the placenta and act on receptors in the developing fetal brain; other mechanisms may also operate. This article examines recent cohort studies and meta-analyses on specific maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes associated with gestational exposure to cannabis. Maternal cannabis use during pregnancy is associated with small to moderately increased risks of gestational hypertension, gestational weight gain less than as well as greater than guidelines, and placental abruption. Maternal cannabis use during pregnancy is also associated with small to moderately increased risks of preterm birth (<36 weeks, <34 weeks, and <32 weeks), small for gestational age, low birth weight, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and fetal death. The risk of some of these adverse outcomes is greater with greater frequency of cannabis use. These adverse outcomes have been identified even in women who do not use other substances during pregnancy. Other adverse outcomes, such as major congenital malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders, are also reported (but are not discussed in this article). For these and other reasons, many professional bodies across the world are already discouraging women from using cannabis during pregnancy. It is important for pregnant women to be educated about cannabis and pregnancy related risks in a shared decision-making process. "
80,38611090,"In this review, we discuss the potential role of cannabis and cannabinoids in the management of cancer-related symptoms. There is limited evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of cannabis-based products in treating cancer-related pain and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Regarding the role of cannabis-based products in the treatment of insomnia and mood disorders, most studies looked at these symptoms as secondary outcomes with mixed results. Cannabis-based products have adverse effects, ranging from neuropsychiatric to systemic effects to potential drug interactions. "
81,36131299,"Use of medical cannabis is increasing among older adults. However, few investigations have examined cannabis use in this population. We assessed the authorization patterns, safety, and effects of medical cannabis in a sub-analysis of 201 older adults (aged ≥ 65 years) who completed a 3-month follow-up during this observational study of patients who were legally authorized a medical cannabis product (N = 67). Cannabis authorization patterns, adverse events (AEs), Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale-revised (ESAS-r), and Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) data were collected. The most common symptoms for which medical cannabis was authorized were pain (159, 85.0%) and insomnia (9, 4.8%). At baseline and at the 3-month follow-up, cannabidiol (CBD)-dominant products were authorized most frequently (99, 54%), followed by balanced products (76, 42%), and then delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-dominant products (8, 4.4%). The most frequent AEs were dizziness (18.2%), nausea (9.1%), dry mouth (9.1%), and tinnitus (9.1%). Significant reductions in ESAS-r scores were observed over time in the domains of drowsiness (p = .013) and tiredness (p = .031), but not pain (p = .106) or well-being (p = .274). Significant reductions in BPI-SF scores over time were observed for worst pain (p = .010), average pain (p = .012), and overall pain severity (p = 0.009), but not pain right now (p = .052) or least pain (p = .141). Overall, results suggest medical cannabis was safe, well-tolerated, and associated with clinically meaningful reductions in pain in this sample of older adults. However, the potential bias introduced by the high subject attrition rate means that all findings should be interpreted cautiously and confirmed by more rigorous studies. "
82,27172585,"The purpose of this study was to examine whether individuals who used medical cannabis for chronic pain were at increased risk for cannabis use problems compared with individuals who used medical cannabis for other reasons (e.g., anxiety, insomnia, and muscle spasms). An additional aim was to determine whether individuals who used cannabis for chronic pain, as well as those who reported greater within-group pain levels, demonstrated a species preference (i.e., sativa, indica, hybrids) and the extent to which species preference was associated with cannabis use problems. Participants were 163 medical cannabis users (77% male), recruited from a medical marijuana dispensary in California, who completed assessments of medical cannabis use motives, history, preferences (species type), and problems, as well as current pain level. Individuals who used cannabis to manage chronic pain experienced fewer cannabis use problems than those who did not use it for pain; among those who used it for pain, the average pain level in the past week was not associated with cannabis use problems. Furthermore, individuals who used cannabis for chronic pain were more likely to use indica over sativa. Preference for indica was associated with fewer cannabis use problems than preference for hybrid species. Individuals who use cannabis to manage chronic pain may be at a lower risk for cannabis use problems, relative to individuals who use it for other indications, potentially as a function of their species preference. "
83,37159196,"The use of cannabis as a medicine is becoming increasingly prevalent. Given the diverse range of conditions being treated with medical cannabis, as well as the vast array of products and dose forms available, clinical evidence incorporating patient-reported outcomes may help determine safety and efficacy. To assess whether patients using medical cannabis report improvements in health-related quality of life over time. This retrospective case series study was conducted at a network of specialist medical clinics (Emerald Clinics) located across Australia. Participants were patients who received treatment for any indication at any point between December 2018 and May 2022. Patients were followed up every mean (SD) 44.6 (30.1) days. Data for up to 15 follow-ups were reported. Statistical analysis was conducted from August to September 2022. Medical cannabis. Product types and cannabinoid content varied over time in accordance with the treating physician's clinical judgement. The main outcome measure was health-related quality of life as assessed using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire. In this case series of 3148 patients, 1688 (53.6%) were female; 820 (30.2%) were employed; and the mean (SD) age was 55.9 (18.7) years at baseline before treatment. Chronic noncancer pain was the most common indication for treatment (68.6% [2160 of 3148]), followed by cancer pain (6.0% [190 of 3148]), insomnia (4.8% [152 of 3148]), and anxiety (4.2% [132 of 3148]). After commencing treatment with medical cannabis, patients reported significant improvements relative to baseline on all 8 domains of the SF-36, and these improvements were mostly sustained over time. After controlling for potential confounders in a regression model, treatment with medical cannabis was associated with an improvement of 6.60 (95% CI, 4.57-8.63) points to 18.31 (95% CI, 15.86-20.77) points in SF-36 scores, depending on the domain (all P < .001). Effect sizes (Cohen d) ranged from 0.21 to 0.72. A total of 2919 adverse events were reported, including 2 that were considered serious. In this case series study, patients using medical cannabis reported improvements in health-related quality of life, which were mostly sustained over time. Adverse events were rarely serious but common, highlighting the need for caution with prescribing medical cannabis. "
84,30572744,"A flowering plant of variegated ingredients and psychoactive qualities, Cannabis has long been used for medicinal and recreational purposes. Regulatory approvals have been gained across a broad range of palliative and therapeutic indications, and in some cases, included in standard treatment guidelines. The use of Cannabis and cannabinoid-based-medicines in oncology is summarized in this article. Cannabinoids are classified according to natural and synthetic subtypes and their mechanisms of action expounded. The variability of available products is discussed in the clinical context and data regarding chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, cancer-related pain, anorexia, insomnia, and anxiety are presented. Moreover, immunological and antineoplastic effects in preclinical and clinical trials are addressed. Concepts such as synergism or opposition with conventional treatment modalities, the sequence of administration and dosage, molecular cross-talk and malignancy-cannabinoid congruence, are explored. Finally, side-effects, limitations in trial design and legislation barriers are related. Sufficient evidence supports the use of Cannabis for palliative indications in oncology; however, patients should be carefully selected, guided and followed. Promising research suggests the potent antineoplastic activity, but more data must be accrued before conclusions can be drawn. "
85,36960460,"Evidence for long-term effectiveness of commercial cannabis products used to treat medical symptoms is inconsistent, despite increasingly widespread use. To prospectively evaluate the effects of using cannabis on self-reported symptoms of pain, insomnia, anxiety, depression, and cannabis use disorder (CUD) after 12 months of use. This observational cohort study describes outcomes over 9 months following a 12-week randomized, waitlist-controlled trial (RCT: NCT After 12 months of using cannabis for medical symptoms, 11.7% of all participants ( Frequency of cannabis use was not associated with improved pain, anxiety, or depression symptoms but was associated with new-onset cannabis use disorder in a significant minority of participants. Daily or near-daily cannabis use appears to have little benefit for these symptoms after 12 months of use. "
86,37802317,"Sleep disturbance is commonly reported among individuals meeting criteria for cannabis use disorder (CUD), and people who use cannabis frequently report sleep disturbance as a contributor to failed quit attempts. The purpose of this study was to measure sleep in individuals enrolled in treatment for CUD, and to determine whether use of hypnotic medication during treatment increased abstinence rates. The study enrolled 127 adults seeking treatment for CUD in a 12-week clinical trial and randomized to receive extended-release zolpidem (zolpidem-XR) or placebo. All participants received computerized behavioral therapy and abstinence-based contingency management. The study conducted in-home ambulatory polysomnography (PSG) assessments at baseline and during treatment to objectively measure sleep. Self-report measures of recent sleep, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and drug use (Timeline Follow-Back) were collected at each study visit, and the study confirmed self-reported abstinence via quantitative urine drug testing. Participants randomized to placebo, but not zolpidem-XR exhibited significant sleep disturbance during week 1 of treatment. Sleep disturbance emerged in the zolpidem-XR group after study medication was stopped at the end of treatment. Though participants assigned to the zolpidem-XR condition had qualitatively greater rates of abstinence compared with placebo (27 % versus 15 % negative at end of treatment), the difference was not statistically significant. Treatment retention was poor (about 50 % drop out in both groups) and medication adherence was a challenge without the use of contingent incentives. Results from this randomized controlled trial suggest that zolpidem-XR can attenuate abstinence-induced sleep disturbance early in treatment for CUD, but that sleep problems are likely to emerge after the medication is stopped. Further research should identify alternative pharmacotherapies and behavioral treatments for CUD and elucidate the role of sleep disturbance in the development and maintenance of CUD. "
87,31897700,"Cannabis was used for cancer patients as early as about 2500 years ago. Experimental studies demonstrated tumor-inhibiting activities of various cannabinoids more than 40 years ago. In view of the status of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) as a regulated substance, non-psychotomimetic cannabidiol (CBD) is of particular importance. Efficacy of pure CBD in various animal models as well as initial results (case reports) from patients. Review of the literature on animal experiments and observations in humans. Preclinical studies, particularly recent ones, including numerous animal models of tumors, unanimously suggest the therapeutic efficacy of CBD. In isolated combination studies, synergistic effects were generally observed. In addition, CBD may potentially play a role in the palliative care of patients, especially concerning symptoms such as pain, insomnia, anxiety, and depression. Further human studies are warranted. HINTERGRUND: Cannabis wurde bereits vor ca. 2500 Jahren bei Krebspatienten verwendet.

89,35872526,"Adolescents are at risk for both sleep problems and cannabis use. Despite emerging evidence for college students' self-medication with cannabis to help sleep, generalizability to earlier developmental stages remains unknown. This study remedied this literature gap by characterizing high school students' cannabis sleep aid use in terms of psychosocial correlates and prospective associations with substance use and sleep. Data were drawn froma longitudinal urban adolescent health behavior study, Project Teen, including 4079th-11thgraders(Year 1 M Students reporting lifetime cannabis sleep aid use (8%) endorsed greater depression and anxiety symptoms at Y1, as well as greater cannabis, alcohol, and cigarette use (but not insomnia symptoms or sleep durations) at Y1 and Y2, compared to non-using peers. Over one year, cannabis sleep aid use was associated with increased cannabis dependence symptoms among students using cannabis, past-2-week binge drinking among students using alcohol, and lifetime cigarette use. However, cannabis sleep aid use was not prospectively associated with changes in insomnia symptoms or sleep durations. Although replication is needed, cannabis sleep aid use among high school students may be associated with exacerbated cannabis dependence symptoms and increased binge drinking and cigarette use over time, without the intended sleep benefit.

91,37384372,"Since the legalization of medical cannabis in Canada in 2013, prescription of cannabis for medical purposes has become commonplace and a multibillion dollar industry has formed. Much of the media coverage surrounding medical cannabis has been positive in nature, leading to Canadians potentially underestimating the adverse effects of medical cannabis use. In recent years, there has been a large increase in clinic websites advertising the use of medical cannabis for health indications. However, little is known about the quality of the evidence used by these clinic websites to describe the effectiveness of cannabis used for medical purposes. We aimed to identify the indications for medical cannabis reported by cannabis clinics in Ontario, Canada, and the evidence these clinics cited to support cannabis prescription. We conducted a cross-sectional web search to identify all cannabis clinic websites within Ontario, Canada, that had physician involvement and identified their primary purpose as cannabis prescription. Two reviewers independently searched these websites to identify all medical indications for which cannabis was promoted and reviewed and critically appraised all studies cited using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence rubric. A total of 29 clinics were identified, promoting cannabis for 20 different medical indications including migraines, insomnia, and fibromyalgia. There were 235 unique studies cited on these websites to support the effectiveness of cannabis for these indications. A high proportion (36/235, 15.3%) of the studies were identified to be at the lowest level of evidence (level 5). Only 4 clinic websites included any mention of harms associated with cannabis. Cannabis clinic websites generally promote cannabis use as medically effective but cite low-quality evidence to support these claims and rarely discuss harms. The recommendation of cannabis as a general therapeutic for many indications unsupported by high-quality evidence is potentially misleading for medical practitioners and patients. This disparity should be carefully evaluated in context of the specific medical indication and an individualized patient risk assessment. Our work illustrates the need to increase the quality of research performed on the medical effects of cannabis. "
92,26151582,"Individuals report using cannabis for the promotion of sleep, and the effects of cannabis on sleep may vary by cannabis species. Little research has documented preferences for particular cannabis types or cannabinoid concentrations as a function of use for sleep disturbances. 163 adults purchasing medical cannabis for a physical or mental health condition at a cannabis dispensary were recruited. They provided self-report of (a) whether cannabis use was intended to help with sleep problems (e.g. insomnia, nightmares), (b) sleep quality (PSQI), (c) cannabis use (including preferred type), and (d) symptoms of DSM-5 cannabis dependence. 81 participants reported using cannabis for the management of insomnia and 14 participants reported using cannabis to reduce nightmares. Individuals using cannabis to manage nightmares preferred sativa to indica strains (Fisher's exact test (2) = 6.83, p < 0.05), and sativa users were less likely to endorse DSM-5 cannabis dependence compared with those who preferred indica strains (χ(2)(2) = 4.09, p < 0.05). Individuals with current insomnia (t(9) = 3.30, p < 0.01) and greater sleep latency (F(3,6) = 46.7, p < 0.001) were more likely to report using strains of cannabis with significantly higher concentrations of CBD. Individuals who reported at least weekly use of hypnotic medications used cannabis with lower THC concentrations compared to those who used sleep medications less frequently than weekly (t(17) = 2.40, p < 0.05). Associations between sleep characteristics and the type of cannabis used were observed in this convenience sample of individuals using cannabis for the management of sleep disturbances. Controlled prospective studies are needed to better characterize the impact that specific components of cannabis have on sleep. "
93,36842936,"Sleep complaints and cannabis use are common among University students and are related to detrimental effects on health. The aim of this study was to explore their association. This cross-sectional study based on the i-Share e-cohort included French students between 18 and 30 years old (n = 14,787). Frequency of cannabis use was categorized into daily, weekly, monthly, and never/rarely use. Sleep complaints were defined using four items (i.e., insomnia, sleepiness, poor sleep quality, and sleep deprivation). In the whole sample (mean age: 20.4 years, 75.5% of females), 22.7% had insomnia, 18.3% had sleepiness, 22.4% had poor sleep quality, 52.5% had sleep deprivation, and 5.8% used cannabis weekly or daily. After adjustment, the likelihood of insomnia was significantly higher by 45% in cannabis users compared to non-users. The estimates steadily increased with frequency of use, reaching a 2.0-fold higher likelihood of insomnia in daily users compared to never/rarely users. Results were similar for the other sleep complaints. These findings provide support for an association between cannabis use and sleep complaints, particularly insomnia, among University students. Though direction and causality cannot be established in this setting, these results suggest warning students and health professionals about the association between cannabis use and sleep complaints.

94,3520605,"Marijuana seems firmly established as another social drug in Western countries, regardless of its current legal status. Patterns of use vary widely. As with other social drugs, the pattern of use is critical in determining adverse effects on health. Perhaps the major area of concern about marijuana use is among the very young. Using any drug on a regular basis that alters reality may be detrimental to the psychosocial maturation of young persons. Chronic use of marijuana may stunt the emotional growth of youngsters. Evidence for an amotivational syndrome is largely based on clinical reports; whether marijuana use is a cause or effect is uncertain. A marijuana psychosis, long rumored, has been difficult to prove. No one doubts that marijuana use may aggravate existing psychoses or other severe emotional disorders. Brain damage has not been proved. Physical dependence is rarely encountered in the usual patterns of social use, despite some degree of tolerance that may develop. The endocrine effects of the drug might be expected to delay puberty in prepubertal boys, but actual instances have been rare. As with any material that is smoked, chronic smoking of marijuana will produce bronchitis; emphysema or lung cancer have not yet been documented. Cardiovascular effects of the drug are harmful to those with preexisting heart disease; fortunately the number of users with such conditions is minimal. Fears that the drug might accumulate in the body to the point of toxicity have been groundless. The potential deleterious effects of marijuana use on driving ability seem to be self-evident; proof of such impairment has been more difficult. The drug is probably harmful when taken during pregnancy, but the risk is uncertain. One would be prudent to avoid marijuana during pregnancy, just as one would do with most other drugs not essential to life or well-being. No clinical consequences have been noted from the effects of the drug on immune response, chromosomes, or cell metabolites. Contamination of marijuana by spraying with defoliants has created the clearest danger to health; such attempts to control production should be abandoned. Therapeutic uses for marijuana, THC, or cannabinoid homologs are being actively explored. Only the synthetic homolog, nabilone, has been approved for use to control nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) "
95,32935850,"Estimate the genetic relationship of cannabis use with sleep deficits and an eveningness chronotype. We used linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) to analyze genetic correlations between sleep deficits and cannabis use behaviors. Secondly, we generated sleep deficit polygenic risk score (PRS) and estimated their ability to predict cannabis use behaviors using linear and logistic regression. Summary statistics came from existing genome-wide association studies of European ancestry that were focused on sleep duration, insomnia, chronotype, lifetime cannabis use, and cannabis use disorder (CUD). A target sample for PRS prediction consisted of high-risk participants and participants from twin/family community-based studies (European ancestry; n = 760, male = 64%; mean age = 26.78 years). Target data consisted of self-reported sleep (sleep duration, feeling tired, and taking naps) and cannabis use behaviors (lifetime ever use, number of lifetime uses, past 180-day use, age of first use, and lifetime CUD symptoms). Significant genetic correlation between lifetime cannabis use and an eveningness chronotype (rG = 0.24, p < 0.001), as well as between CUD and both short sleep duration (<7 h; rG = 0.23, p = 0.017) and insomnia (rG = 0.20, p = 0.020). Insomnia PRS predicted earlier age of first cannabis use (OR = 0.92, p = 0.036) and increased lifetime CUD symptom count (OR = 1.09, p = 0.012). Cannabis use is genetically associated with both sleep deficits and an eveningness chronotype, suggesting that there are genes that predispose individuals to both cannabis use and sleep deficits. "
96,35067772,"To examine the efficacy and safety of medical cannabis in benign essential blepharospasm (BEB). This is a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. All consecutive adult BEB patients who had been treated with BTX-A injections without success between 3/2019 and 2/2020 were recruited. The study patients were randomly allocated into a treatment and a control (placebo) group in a 1:1 ratio. The treatment group used cannabis drops and the control group used cannabis oil drops during the first 6 weeks of the study, and both groups were treated with the medical cannabis drops during the second 6 weeks. The cannabis dose was gradually increased for each patient depending upon effect and tolerability. Three patients were included in each group (treatment and control groups). The mean duration of spasm attack during the first 6 weeks was 4.29 min in the treatment group and 73.9 min in the placebo group (P < 0.01). During the last 6 weeks, the treatment group used an average of 6.27 drops and the placebo group used an average of 5.36 drops (P = 0.478). There were 61 spasm events in the treatment group and 94 spasm events in the placebo group (P = 0.05). The mean duration of spasm attack was 1.77 and 8.96 min, respectively (P < 0.01). The side effects were mild, and they included general fatigue, dry mouth, and insomnia. Medical cannabis can be an effective and safe treatment for BEB as a second line after BTX-A injections when used for 3 months. No significant ocular or systemic side effects was associated with the treatment. "
97,35484401,"Glutamate plays an important role in continued use of and relapse to abused substances. However, its involvement in cannabis withdrawal is still unclear. We hypothesize that regional glutamate is associated with the cannabis withdrawal syndrome and recently examined possible association of glutamate with cannabis withdrawal, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), in non-treatment-seeking cannabis users. We recruited 26 frequent cannabis users and 11 age-matched non-using controls. Of the 37, 20 users (8f/12m) and 10 controls (5f/5m) completed a verified 21-day abstinence protocol. Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) glutamate and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) were measured with proton MRS at baseline and on abstinent days 7 and 21 in conjunction with measures of cannabis withdrawal and craving (MCQ), sleep difficulties (PSQI) and mood state. We used ANOVA to examine group differences in glutamate and GABA from baseline through day 21 and used linear regression to evaluate correlations between intra-individual glutamate and withdrawal symptoms. We found that self-reported anxiety severity (HAMA) was correlated with urinary THC/Cr ratios at baseline (r = 0.768, p = 0.000076) and abstinent day 7 (r = 0.5636, p = 0.0097), dACC glutamate was significantly lower in the users compared with the controls from baseline through day 21 (F = 5.90, p = 0.022), changes in glutamate between baseline and abstinent day 21 had a significantly negative correlation with corresponding changes in craving (r = -0.72, p = 0.005) after adjusting for age, consumption of alcohol/cigarettes, sleep difficulties, and urinary THC levels. These findings provide preliminary evidence that dACC glutamate is associated with the cannabis withdrawal syndrome. "
98,37289502,"The use of cannabis for medical symptoms is increasing despite limited evidence for its efficacy. Expectancies-prior beliefs about a substance or medicine-can modulate use patterns and effects of medicines on target symptoms. To our knowledge, cannabis expectancies have not been studied for their predictive value for symptom relief. The 21-item Cannabis Effects Expectancy Questionnaire-Medical (CEEQ-M) is the first longitudinally validated measure of expectancies for cannabis used for medical symptoms.

99,26187404,"Cannabis is the most frequently used illicit substance in the United States resulting in high rates of cannabis use disorders. Current treatments for cannabis use are often met with high rates of lapse/relapse, tied to (1) behavioral health factors that impact cannabis use such as poor sleep, and (2) access, stigma, supply, and cost of receiving a substance use intervention. This pilot study examined the feasibility, usability, and changes in cannabis use and sleep difficulties following mobile phone-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) in the context of a cannabis cessation attempt. Four male veterans with DSM-5 cannabis use disorder and sleep problems were randomized to receive a 2-week intervention: CBT-I Coach mobile app (n=2) or a placebo control (mood-tracking app) (n=2). Cannabis and sleep measures were assessed pre- and post-treatment. Participants also reported use and helpfulness of each app. Changes in sleep and cannabis use were evaluated for each participant individually. Both participants receiving CBT-I used the app daily over 2 weeks and found the app user-friendly, helpful, and would use it in the future. In addition, they reported decreased cannabis use and improved sleep efficiency; one also reported increased sleep quality. In contrast, one participant in the control group dropped out of the study, and the other used the app minimally and reported increased sleep quality but also increased cannabis use. The mood app was rated as not helpful, and there was low likelihood of future participation. This pilot study examined the feasibility and initial patient acceptance of mobile phone delivery of CBT-I for cannabis dependence. Positive ratings of the app and preliminary reports of reductions in cannabis use and improvements in sleep are both encouraging and support additional evaluation of this intervention. "
100,32433200,"Despite substantial controversies concerning patients' reports of benefits from cannabis for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and inconsistent research findings regarding its efficacy and adverse risks, some states have already recognized PTSD as a qualifying condition for medical cannabis. Consequently, medical cannabis can also be provided for patients with complex PTSD who experience additional posttraumatic symptoms of affective dysregulation, negative perception of the self, and difficulties in relationships due to a history of repetitive trauma. In this article, we explore cannabis use in relation to benefits versus harms that might occur relative to specific complex PTSD symptoms and comorbidities. Whereas some symptoms related to PTSD per se (e.g., anxiety, insomnia, nightmares) may be benefited, others that are more characteristic of complex PTSD (e.g., dissociation, reckless behavior, and substance abuse associated with dysregulated affect) may be aggravated. Therefore, clinicians treating patients with complex PTSD who use or seek cannabis should carefully assess patients' motivations and the impacts of particular use patterns on specific symptoms. Clinicians and patients should be aware of and fully discuss the significant number of potential adverse effects of cannabis use, several of which might impede patients' participation in beneficial psychotherapeutic, social, and medical interventions. "
101,37920683,"Medical cannabis (MC) is used by Canadian Veterans to manage a wide range of health issues. However, there is little information comparing the reasons for MC use and its perceived effectiveness between Veterans and non-Veterans. We compared MC use among a convenience sample of Canadian Veterans and with non-Veteran controls, including demographics, reasons and patterns of use, and perceived effectiveness. Between November and December 2021, Canadian Veterans using cannabis were invited to participate in a survey using a national press release, social media, and announcements on online platform dedicated to promoting health among Canadian Veterans and non-Veterans during the pandemic (www.MissionVav.com). The survey was also mentioned in a monthly newsletter from Veteran Affairs Canada. Self-reported effectiveness was evaluated using a 0 to 10 visual analogue scale (0 being not all effective, 10 being the most effective). The survey was completed by 157 people, including 108 (69%) males and 49 (31%) females. The mean age was 57 years (range 19 to 84). Among responders, 90 (63%) identified as Veterans. The most common reasons for MC use among Veterans included: insomnia (80%), anxiety (73%), and depression (52%). Veterans reported medical conditions such as chronic pain (88%) and arthritis (51%). Compared with non-Veterans, Veterans were significantly more likely to be male (83% vs. 49%), have a higher BMI (35.2 vs. 30.9), to report problems with sleep, anxiety, depression, and PTSD, and to use cannabis in edible form (51% vs. 22%). Self-reported mean effectiveness scores for MC were highest for PTSD (8.4), insomnia (8.2), anxiety (8.1), depression (8.0), and chronic pain (7.6). We found important differences in user characteristics and cannabis use patterns between Canadian Veterans and non-Veterans. Further controlled studies are required to validate these findings, but these data suggest that orally administered cannabis products may be worth further study. "
102,38981156,"Fatigue, insomnia and sleep disturbances are common after cancer diagnosis, and have a negative impact on quality of life and function. This narrative review synthesised evidence on lifestyle and integrative oncology interventions for cancer-related fatigue, insomnia and sleep disturbances in cancer survivors. There is strong evidence in support of aerobic and strength exercise for the relief of cancer-related fatigue. Yoga, massage therapy, acupuncture, Tai Chi and qigong can also be recommended for cancer-related fatigue. The evidence on yoga, acupuncture and massage therapy for sleep disturbances in cancer is mixed, while exercise appears to have a modest favourable effect. There is insufficient evidence on nutrient supplements or dietary interventions for cancer-related fatigue or insomnia and other sleep disturbances after cancer. Beyond alleviating cancer-related fatigue and insomnia-related symptoms, integrative oncology and lifestyle interventions have potential to effect multiple other benefits, such as improvement in symptoms such as pain and menopausal symptoms. There is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials of interventions, particularly in the areas of diet and nutrient supplements, and for implementation studies of interventions already supported by evidence. "
103,24765558,"Clinical research regarding the therapeutic benefits of cannabis (""marijuana"") has been almost non-existent in the United States since cannabis was given Schedule I status in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. In order to discover the benefits and adverse effects perceived by medical cannabis patients, especially with regards to chronic pain, we hand-delivered surveys to one hundred consecutive patients who were returning for yearly re-certification for medical cannabis use in Hawai'i. The response rate was 94%. Mean and median ages were 49.3 and 51 years respectively. Ninety-seven per cent of respondents used cannabis primarily for chronic pain. Average pain improvement on a 0-10 pain scale was 5.0 (from 7.8 to 2.8), which translates to a 64% relative decrease in average pain. Half of all respondents also noted relief from stress/anxiety, and nearly half (45%) reported relief from insomnia. Most patients (71%) reported no adverse effects, while 6% reported a cough or throat irritation and 5% feared arrest even though medical cannabis is legal in Hawai'i. No serious adverse effects were reported. These results suggest that Cannabis is an extremely safe and effective medication for many chronic pain patients. Cannabis appears to alleviate pain, insomnia, and may be helpful in relieving anxiety. Cannabis has shown extreme promise in the treatment of numerous medical problems and deserves to be released from the current Schedule I federal prohibition against research and prescription. "
104,34636036,"The goal of this study was to characterize cannabis use among patients with breast cancer, including their reasons for and timing of use, their sources of cannabis information and products, their satisfaction with the information found, their perceptions of its safety, and their dialogue about cannabis with their physicians. United States-based members of the Breastcancer.org and Healthline.com communities with a self-reported diagnosis of breast cancer within 5 years (age ≥ 18 years) were invited to participate in an anonymous online survey. After informed consent was obtained, nonidentifiable data were collected and analyzed. Of all participants (n = 612), 42% (n = 257) reported using cannabis for relief of symptoms, which included pain (78%), insomnia (70%), anxiety (57%), stress (51%), and nausea/vomiting (46%). Furthermore, 49% of cannabis users believed that medical cannabis could be used to treat cancer itself. Of those taking cannabis, 79% had used it during treatment, which included systemic therapies, radiation, and surgery. At the same time, few (39%) had discussed it with any of their physicians. A significant percentage of survey participants (42%) used cannabis to address symptoms; approximately half of these participants believed that cannabis could treat cancer itself. Most participants used cannabis during active cancer treatment despite the potential for an adverse event during this vulnerable time. Furthermore, most participants believed that cannabis was safe and were unaware that product quality varied widely and depended on the source. This study reviews the research on medicinal cannabis in the setting of these findings to help physicians to recognize its risks and benefits for patients with cancer. Almost half of patients with breast cancer use cannabis, most commonly during active treatment to manage common symptoms and side effects: pain, anxiety, insomnia, and nausea. However, most patients do not discuss cannabis use with their physicians. Instead, the internet and family/friends are the most common sources of cannabis information. Furthermore, most participants believe that cannabis products are safe and are unaware that the safety of many products is untested. "
105,37917012,"As the U.S. cannabis market expands, surveillance of retailer practices, especially product health claims and risks, is crucial to protect consumers. In this study, mystery shoppers (i.e., staff not explicitly identified as researchers) examined retail personnel communication regarding product recommendations, health benefits, safety, and/or risks among U.S. cannabis retailers. In Summer 2022, mystery shoppers audited 140 licensed cannabis retailers in 5 cities in states with established nonmedical (i.e., recreational) cannabis sales and diverse regulations (Denver, Colorado; Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon; Las Vegas, Nevada; Los Angeles, California). Descriptive and bivariate analyses characterized retail personnel communication overall and across cities. Common product recommendations for new users included edibles, pre-rolled joints, and bud/flower, and 8.6% offered free/inexpensive ways to sample products. Although Colorado, Washington, and Oregon explicitly prohibited health claims in advertising or labels, more than 90% of retailers there endorsed use for anxiety, insomnia, and/or pain. Whereas 54.3% endorsed use for pregnancy-related nausea (least common in Denver, 23.3%; most common in Seattle, 76.7%), 26.4% warned against use during pregnancy (most frequently in Denver, 46.7%; least frequently in Seattle and Portland, 13.3%). Overall, 52.1% warned against driving after use (most frequently in Denver, 80.0%; least frequently in Las Vegas, 20.0%). Almost all (≥90%) sold cannabidiol (CBD) products and endorsed their health benefits and safety, but few (<10%) sold or endorsed delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), etc. (all of which were in Los Angeles). Ongoing cannabis retail surveillance, particularly using protocols assessing factors outside those visibly observable, is needed to inform regulatory and enforcement efforts, especially related to health claims.

106,37090897,"Sleep disorders are the third most common indication for the prescription of medical cannabis products in Australia, after pain and anxiety. While the use of cannabis for medical purposes is growing in Australia, underlying consumer behaviours and patterns of use, particularly around sleep disorders, are poorly understood. We conducted a subanalysis of the cross-sectional ""Cannabis as Medicine Survey"" 2020-2021 (CAMS-20) (N = 1600), to explore the characteristics of a sample of Australians who were using prescribed and/or illicit medical cannabis to treat a self-reported sleep disorder. When asked to specify up to seven different conditions they were treating with medical cannabis, a total of 1030 (64%) respondents [mean (SD) 44.9 (13.6) years] selected a sleep disorder, with ""insomnia disorder"" (85.5%), 'sleep-related movement disorders' (26%) and 'sleep-related breathing disorders' (11.1%) the most common subtypes. Only 165 (16.8%) respondents selected a self-reported sleep disorder as the main health condition being treated. Relative to other health conditions, use of medical cannabis for a self-reported sleep disorder was associated with younger age, increased likelihood of using both prescribed and illicit forms of medical cannabis, inhaled routes of administration, and THC-dominant products. Most respondents reported a reduction in the use of benzodiazepines and alcohol since starting medical cannabis. Binary logistic regression showed that respondents who predominantly used inhaled routes of administration, and concomitant use of medical cannabis for pain, mental health and/or substance use disorder, or a gastrointestinal disorder, were significantly more likely to also use medical cannabis to treat a self-reported sleep disorder. Overall, these results suggest that self-reported sleep disorders are often being treated with medical cannabis alongside other health conditions (often pain or a mental health disorder) and that use of inhaled methods, THC-dominant products, and illicit sources of medical cannabis are common among people with self-reported sleep disorders in Australia.

107,27117064,"Sleep abnormalities are associated with acute and chronic use of addictive substances. Although sleep complaints associated with use and abstinence from addictive substances are widely recognized, familiarity with the underlying sleep abnormalities is often lacking, despite evidence that these sleep abnormalities may be recalcitrant and impede good outcomes. Substantial research has now characterized the abnormalities associated with acute and chronic use of alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, and opiates. This review summarizes this research and discusses the clinical implications of sleep abnormalities in the treatment of substance use disorders. "
108,38296858,"Cannabis sativa has been used for improving sleep for long history. Cannabidiol (CBD) has drown much attention as a non-addictive psychoactive component in Cannabis sativa extract. However, the effects of CBD on sleep architecture and it's acting mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the sedative-hypnotic effect of cannabidiol (CBD), assessed the effects of CBD on sleep using a wireless physiological telemetry system. We further explored the therapeutic effects of CBD using 4-chloro-dl-phenylalanine (PCPA) induced insomnia model and changes in sleep latency, sleep duration and intestinal flora were evaluated. CBD shortened sleep latency and increases sleep duration in both normal and insomnia mice, and those effects were blocked by 5-HT "
109,33244728,"Insomnia is associated with significant comorbidity, disability and impact on quality of life and, despite advances in pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, remains a significant burden to society. Cannabinoids are gaining acceptance for use as medicines in the treatment of insomnia disorder. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of cannabinoids in the treatment of insomnia disorder. We performed a systematic review of the PubMed, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Complete databases from inception to 5 December 2019, and again prior to data abstraction, for studies of cannabis-based products for the treatment of insomnia disorder in adults. Inclusion criteria were (1) clinical studies, (2) participants aged ≥ 18 years, (3) insomnia disorder either formally diagnosed against contemporaneous diagnostic criteria or quantified with validated instruments and (4) compared cannabis-based products with the standard of care, placebo or a sedative. No language restrictions were imposed. Non-primary research, animal studies and studies of cannabis-induced insomnia were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed using the RoB 2 tool for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool for non-randomized trials. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I A total of five studies (two RCTs and three non-randomised studies) with 219 study participants were included, of which three could be combined. The three non-randomised studies contributed data on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Questionnaire score, showing a favourable effect of cannabinoids at ≤ 4 weeks of follow-up (mean difference - 1.89 [95% confidence interval {CI} - 2.68 to - 1.10]; n = 176) and at 8 weeks of follow-up (mean difference - 2.41 [95% CI - 3.36 to - 1.46]; n = 166). One double-blind crossover RCT (n = 32) reported that, compared with amitriptyline, nabilone-a synthetic analogue to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-improved Insomnia Severity Index scores after 2 weeks of treatment (adjusted difference - 3.25 [95% CI - 5.26 to - 1.24]) and resulted in a more restful sleep as a sub-measure of the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ) (difference 0.48 [95% CI 0.01-0.95]) but with no effect on overall sleep quality as measured by the LSEQ. In a single ascending-dose RCT (n = 9), THC reduced sleep-onset latency compared with placebo at 10 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg doses (mean difference - 43.00 min [95% CI - 82.76 to - 3.24], - 62.00 [95% CI - 103.60 to - 20.40] and - 54.00 [95% CI - 103.93 to - 4.07], respectively). All the included studies were assessed as poor quality, mainly due to small sample sizes, short treatment periods, uncertain clinical significance and high risk of bias. Few studies have examined the efficacy of cannabinoids in the treatment of insomnia disorder. Despite some possible signals for efficacy, the heterogeneity of participants, interventions, efficacy outcomes and results, and the high risk of bias across included trials, do not reliably inform evidence-based practice. This review highlights shortcomings in the existing literature, including lack of diagnostic clarity, poorly defined participant groups, non-standardised interventions and studies of inappropriate design, duration and power to detect clinically meaningful outcomes. Further research in the form of high-quality RCTs are required before drawing any conclusions about the efficacy of cannabinoids in the treatment of insomnia disorder.

110,36787672,"Despite limited clinical evidence of its efficacy, cannabis use has been commonly reported for the management of various mental health concerns in naturalistic field studies. The aim of the current study was to use machine learning methods to investigate predictors of perceived symptom change across various mental health symptoms with acute cannabis use in a large naturalistic sample. Data from 68,819 unique observations of cannabis use from 1307 individuals using cannabis to manage mental health symptoms were analyzed. Data were extracted from Strainprint®, a mobile app that allows users to monitor their cannabis use for therapeutic purposes. Machine learning models were employed to predict self-perceived symptom change after cannabis use, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value plots were used to assess feature importance of individual predictors in the model. Interaction effects of symptom severity pre-scores of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and gender were also examined. The factors that were most strongly associated with perceived symptom change following acute cannabis use were pre-symptom severity, age, gender, and the ratio of CBD to THC. Further examination on the impact of baseline severity for the most commonly reported symptoms revealed distinct responses, with cannabis being reported to more likely benefit individuals with lower pre-symptom severity for depression, and higher pre-symptom severity for insomnia. Responses to cannabis use also differed between genders. Findings from this study highlight the importance of several factors in predicting perceived symptom change with acute cannabis use for mental health symptom management. Mental health profiles and baseline symptom severity may play a large role in perceived responses to cannabis. Distinct response patterns were also noted across commonly reported mental health symptoms, emphasizing the need for placebo-controlled cannabis trials for specific user profiles. "
111,30502644,"Studies suggest cannabis may improve symptoms like pain and muscle spasticity in patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Despite cannabis' new-found legality and availability, few studies have explored the profile of PwMS cannabis users and characteristics of their use, particularly in a state where cannabis is legal both for recreational and medicinal use. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate cannabis use among PwMS at a large academic multiple sclerosis (MS) clinic, specifically: (1) prevalence, (2) products used (e.g., cannabidiol vs Δ PwMS completed questions assessing personal opinions about cannabis use, characteristics of cannabis use, MS history, and sociodemographic details, as well as the self-reported disability-Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS), overall quality of life-the Patient Reported Outcome Measure Information System (PROMIS-10), and cognition-the Neuro-QoL ACGC v1.0 measures. Thirty-eight percent (n = 96) of PwMS were current Cannabis users (CUs). Although there were no sociodemographic or clinical differences (p ≤ 0.05) between CUs and Non-Cannabis users (NUs), CUs had significantly higher median disability compared to NUs (PDDS = 2 vs. 1; p = 0.02). Among CUs, 57% categorized their use as strictly medicinal. CUs reported using cannabis most often for pain and insomnia/poor sleep and experienced greater than 60% benefit/relief from cannabis use. Over 90% of respondents desire more research on cannabis for MS, and 74% indicated they would consider using cannabis for their MS. As cannabis legalization has impacted the variety of cannabis products available, there appears to be growing numbers of PwMS using cannabis, with this study's CUs reporting use of highly efficacious products with minimal side-effects. "
112,38612415,"The endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS) plays a critical role in the regulation of various physiological functions, including sleep, mood, and neuroinflammation. Phytocannabinoids such as Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinomimimetics, and some N-acylethanolamides, particularly palmitoyethanolamide, have emerged as potential therapeutic agents for the management of sleep disorders. THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis, may initially promote sleep, but, in the long term, alters sleep architecture, while CBD shows promise in improving sleep quality without psychoactive effects. Clinical studies suggest that CBD modulates endocannabinoid signaling through several receptor sites, offering a multifaceted approach to sleep regulation. Similarly, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), in addition to interacting with the endocannabinoid system, acts as an agonist on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). The favorable safety profile of CBD and PEA and the potential for long-term use make them an attractive alternative to conventional pharmacotherapy. The integration of the latter two compounds into comprehensive treatment strategies, together with cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), represents a holistic approach to address the multifactorial nature of sleep disorders. Further research is needed to establish the optimal dosage, safety, and efficacy in different patient populations, but the therapeutic potential of CBD and PEA offers hope for improved sleep quality and general well-being.

113,36638745,"Real world patterns of cannabis use for health concerns are highly variable and rarely overseen by a physician. Pragmatic effectiveness studies with electronic daily diaries that capture person-specific patterns of cannabis use and health symptoms may help clarify risks and benefits. As part of a larger, randomized trial (NCT03224468), adults (N = 181) seeking cannabis for insomnia, pain, or anxiety or depressive symptoms were randomized to obtain a medical cannabis card immediately (MCC) or a waitlist control (WLC) and completed 12-weeks of daily web-based surveys on cannabis use and sleep, pain, and depressive symptoms. Completion rates of daily surveys were moderate to high (median completed: 72 out of 90 days). Daily reports of cannabis use were consistent with monthly interview assessments and urinalysis. The MCC group increased cannabis use frequency in the 12 weeks following randomization, while WLC did not. Among the MCC group, self-reported sleep quality was significantly higher on cannabis use days, compared to nonuse days. The MCC group displayed long-term sleep improvements, consistent with increasing cannabis frequency. No improvements were found for pain or depressive symptoms. Cannabis use is associated with same day improvements in self-reported sleep quality, but not pain or depressive symptoms, although sleep improvements occurred in the context of increased frequency of cannabis use, raising the risk for cannabis use disorder. Daily web-based assessments of cannabis appear valid and feasible in adults seeking cannabis for health concerns, providing a flexible, complementary method for future real-world effectiveness studies with expanded and objective measures.

114,33636612,"To survey the pattern and benefits of medical cannabis use (MCU) in a cross section of persons with multiple sclerosis (PWMS). One hundred and fifteen subjects completed a 36-question survey online or on paper which queried aspects of their use of cannabis, including frequency of use, effect on symptoms, and changes in their use of prescription medications, as well asa number of key demographic variables such as age, gender, disease duration and clinical course, etc. All subjects were treated at a multiple sclerosis (MS) clinic in Connecticut and enrolled in the Connecticut Medical Marijuana Program (CTMMP). Self-reported benefit from cannabis use for two or more symptoms of MS was associated with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) vs progressive (PMS) (OR 3.043, 95% CI 1.026-9.028, p=0.038) and less benefit for two or more symptoms for those who required a wheelchair vs. those who ambulated without assistance (OR .246, 95% CI .195-.797, p=0.016). General benefit from cannabis use was reported for mood disorders (p<0.001), insomnia (p<0.001), sensory symptoms, including pain (p<0.001), and muscle cramps and spasms (p<0.001). Furthermore, benefit was also significantly associated with symptom severity in the case of insomnia (OR 9.735, 95% CI 2.751-34.445, p<0.001), and cramps and spasms (OR 5.234, 95% CI 1.261-21.729, p=0.014). A significant proportion of respondents had stopped or reduced prescription medications (86% vs. 55%, p<0.001) as a function of finding cannabis more effective than prescription medications. These included opioids, benzodiazepines, muscle relaxers and other pain medications. MCU among PWMS can lead to the reduction or discontinuation of several categories of prescription medications for symptoms of MS. Persons reporting the most benefit from MCU tended to have a milder form of MS with less disability, in contrast to previous studies. This study confirms the benefit of cannabis in several common MS symptoms, extending these findings to show that benefit can be related to baseline severity of some symptoms. "
115,35930902,"Legalization of recreational, or non-medical, cannabis in Canada in 2018 was followed by significant increase in use among older adults. Non-medical cannabis is often used medicinally in this population for issues such as pain, insomnia, and appetite stimulation. The purpose of this study was to explore new cannabis use among older adults within an evolving socio-legal context. Normalization theory provided the theoretical foundation and qualitative description was the guiding methodology. A convenience sample of twelve participants (ten women, two men) aged 71 to 85 years old was recruited. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and analyzed thematically. Findings illustrate factors that influenced participants' beliefs and contributed to their decisions to begin using cannabis in later life. The most important factor was legalization, which sparked a shift in beliefs around using cannabis and shaped the beginning of de-stigmatization around using this substance. Increasing acceptance in their social networks and visibility of cannabis in the media also informed decision-making. However, using cannabis for non-medicinal or social reasons remained stigmatized. This research indicates that older adults' beliefs about cannabis use are shifting and this is likely related to legalization and broader social acceptance of cannabis. As a consequence, increased public health education is needed to improve health literacy about cannabis use during this stage of the life-course. "
116,39199679,"As the legalization of medical cannabis expands across several countries, interest in its potential advantages among cancer patients and caregivers is burgeoning. However, patients seeking to integrate cannabis into their treatment often encounter frustration when their oncologists lack adequate information to offer guidance. This knowledge gap is exacerbated by the scarcity of published literature on the benefits of medical cannabis, leaving oncologists reliant on evidence-based data disheartened. This comprehensive narrative article, tailored for both clinicians and patients, endeavors to bridge these informational voids. It synthesizes cannabis history, pharmacology, and physiology and focuses on addressing various symptoms prevalent in cancer care, including insomnia, nausea and vomiting, appetite issues, pain management, and potential anti-cancer effects. Furthermore, by delving into the potential mechanisms of action and exploring their relevance in cancer treatment, this article aims to shed light on the potential benefits and effects of cannabis in oncology.

117,35749740,"Our study sought to further characterize patterns of medical cannabis use in elderly cancer patients. Furthermore, we sought to assess efficacy of medical cannabis for the treatment of pain, nausea, anorexia, insomnia and anxiety in elderly cancer patients. Medical cannabis use is growing for symptom management in cancer patients, but limited data exists on the safety or efficacy of use in elderly patients. A retrospective chart review assessing changes in numerical symptom scores reported at clinic visits before and after medical cannabis initiation. There was no statistically significant difference in pain, nausea, appetite, insomnia or anxiety scores reported before and after initiation of medical cannabis. Oil was the most common form used, followed by vape, and the most common ratios used were high tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to cannabidiol (CBD) and equal parts THC/CBD products. This study did not find a statistically significant change in symptom scores with medical cannabis use, although further study is warranted given the limitations of the present study. Elderly patients most commonly are using equal parts THC/CBD or high THC ratio products initially. "
118,39292455,"Cannabis is increasingly being used to treat medical symptoms, but the effects on brain function in those using cannabis for these symptoms are not known. To test whether 1 year of cannabis use for medical symptoms after obtaining a medical cannabis card was associated with increased brain activation during working memory, reward, and inhibitory control tasks, areas of cognition affected by cannabis. This cohort study was conducted from July 2017 to July 2020 among participants from the greater Boston area who were recruited as part of a clinical trial of individuals seeking medical cannabis cards for anxiety, depression, pain, or insomnia symptoms. Participants were aged between 18 and 65 years. Exclusion criteria were daily cannabis use and cannabis use disorder at baseline. Data analysis was conducted from August 2021 to April 2024. Outcomes were whole brain functional activation during tasks involving working memory, reward, and inhibitory control at baseline and after 1 year of medical cannabis card ownership. Imaging was collected from participants before and 1 year after obtaining medical cannabis cards, with 57 participants at baseline (38 female [66.7%]; 6 [10.5%] Black and 45 [78.9%] White participants; 1 [1.8%] Hispanic participant; median [IQR] age, 34.0 [24.0-51.0] years) and 54 participants at 1 year (37 female [68.5%]; 4 [7.4%] Black and 48 [88.9%] White participants; 1 [1.9%] Hispanic participant, median [IQR] age, 36.5 [25.0-51.0] years). Imaging was also collected in 32 healthy control participants at baseline (22 female [68.8%]; 2 [6.2%] Black and 27 [84.4%] White participants; 3 [9.4%] Hispanic participants; median [IQR] age, 33.0 [24.8-38.2] years). In all groups and at both time points, functional imaging revealed canonical activations of the probed cognitive processes. No statistically significant difference in brain activation between the 2 time points (baseline and 1 year) in those with medical cannabis cards and no associations between changes in cannabis use frequency and brain activation after 1 year were found. In this cohort study of adults obtaining medical cannabis cards for medical symptoms, no significant association between brain activation in the areas of cognition of working memory, reward, and inhibitory control and 1 year of cannabis use was observed. The results warrant further studies that probe the association of cannabis at higher doses, with greater frequency, in younger age groups, and with larger, more diverse cohorts. "

121,35619155,"Cannabis is increasingly used for medical purposes, particularly in countries like Canada where cannabis was recently legalized for recreational use. We aimed to assess self-medication with cannabis post-cannabis legalization among adults in the Canadian province of Quebec. This is a cross-sectional online survey of a self-selected convenience sample conducted in Quebec, Canada, from November 2020 to January 2021. Individuals aged ≥ 21 years who endorsed using cannabis bought in legal recreational cannabis stores to self-medicate a health condition were included. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and stratified according to sex, age, and the type of cannabis use (exclusively medical versus medical and recreational use). Four hundred eighty-nine participants were included. The median age was 34 years, and 48% were women. About 25% reported exclusive medical use of cannabis. Treated conditions included anxiety (70%), insomnia (56%), pain (53%), depression (37%), and many others. Reasons for not consulting in cannabis clinics included lack of information (52%), the complexity of the process (39%), accessibility of cannabis clinics (23%), and others. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) dosage > 20% was reported by 32%. Smoking was the main route of use (81%). Possession of prescribed drugs was reported by 56%. Professionals consulted for information on cannabis included recreational cannabis store agents (36%), physicians (29%), and others. Overall, significant differences were observed for many of the comparisons according to sex, age, and the type of cannabis use. Many conditions are self-medicated with cannabis. The use of high doses of cannabis, smoking as a preferred method of use, and concurrent use of other medications may pose some risks to individuals. Addressing the reported barriers to medical access to cannabis is urgently needed. "
122,30003119,"Although increasing rates of cannabis use and cannabis use disorder (CUD) are well-documented among veterans, little is known about their use of cannabis specifically for medicinal purposes. The present study characterizes such use and compares veterans reporting cannabis use for medicinal ( Participants were veterans deployed post 9/11/2001 recruited from a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facility ( The most frequently endorsed conditions for medicinal cannabis (MC) use were anxiety/stress, PTSD, pain, depression, and insomnia. In logistic regression analyses adjusted for frequency of cannabis use, MC users were significantly more likely ( Veterans who use cannabis for medicinal purposes differ significantly in sleep, physical and mental health functioning than veterans who use cannabis for recreational purposes. PTSD and sleep problems may be especially relevant issues to address in screening and providing clinical care to returning veterans who are using cannabis for medicinal purposes. "

124,34515130,"Cannabis is increasingly used in the management of pain, though minimal research exists to support its use since approval. Reduction in stigma has led to a growing interest in pharmaceutical cannabinoids as a possible treatment for lower back pain (LBP). The objective of this review was to assess the role and efficacy of cannabis and its derivatives in the management of LBP and compile global data related to the role of cannabis in the management of LBP in an aging population. A systematic review was conducted using predetermined keywords by 3 independent researchers. Predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, and 23 articles were selected for further analysis. Studies identified both significant and insignificant impacts of cannabis on LBP. Contradicting evidence was noted on the role of cannabis in the management of anxiety and insomnia, 2 common comorbidities with LBP. The existing literature suggests that cannabis may be used in the management of LBP and comorbid symptoms. Further research is needed to consider cannabis as an independent management option. There is a lack of evidence pertaining to the benefits of cannabis in an aged population, and thus, additional research is warranted to support its use in the aged population. "
125,39369578,"To estimate the prevalence of insomnia and the use of sleep aids among Canadian adults. Data were derived from a phone interview conducted (April to October 2023) with a stratified, population-based sample of 4037 adults (57.6 % females; mean age 50.6 ± 18.4; range 18-102 years old) living in Canada. Post-stratified survey weights were included in the analysis to ensure the representativity of the adult Canadian population. The prevalence estimate of insomnia disorder was 16.3 % (95 % CI 15.1-17.6), with higher rates in females (risk ratio [RR] 1.24, 95 % CI 1.06-1.45), Indigenous peoples (RR 1.77, 95 % CI 1.27-2.47), and individuals with poorer mental or physical health. Overall, 14.7 % of respondents reported having used prescribed sleep medications in the previous 12 months, 28.7 % used natural products or over-the-counter (OTC) sleep aids, 15.6 % used cannabis-derived products and 9.7 % used alcohol for sleep in the last 12 months. Higher proportions of females used prescribed medication (RR 1.79, 95 % CI 1.31-2.43) and natural products or OTC medication (RR 1.41, 95 % CI 1.16-1.71), while more males used cannabis (RR 1.33, 95 % CI 1.03-1.72) and alcohol (RR 1.67, 95 % CI 1.16-2.33) for sleep. Higher proportions of older adults (≥65 years) were taking prescribed medications, while more young adults (18-35 years) used natural products or OTC medications, cannabis, and alcohol as sleep aids. Insomnia is a highly prevalent condition in Canada and there is widespread and increasing use of various medications and substances to cope with this health issue. These findings highlight the need for public health interventions to promote healthy sleep and for wider dissemination of evidence-based treatments for insomnia, such as cognitive behavioral therapy which is the first-line treatment for insomnia in practice guidelines, to reduce sleep health disparities. "
126,30176972,"We aimed to explore symptoms of insomnia in a group of youths characterized as engaging in risky drinking, their use of drugs as sleep/ wake aids, and the relationships between alcohol and other drug use and insomnia. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 596 Australian 14 to 19-year-olds identified as engaging in regular risky drinking. They completed the Insomnia Severity Index and were assessed for recent alcohol and other drug use, including drugs used specifically as sleep aids or to stay awake. Alcohol-related problems, emotional distress, self-control, and working outside of traditional hours were also assessed using validated scales. More than one-third of the study participants (36%) reported moderate to very severe sleep-onset insomnia, and 39% screened positive for clinical insomnia using adolescent criteria. Three-fourths used drugs in the past 2 weeks to regulate their sleep cycle (65% used stimulants to stay awake, mainly caffeine, and 32% used a depressant to get to sleep, mainly cannabis). Regression analyses showed that after controlling for variables such as sex, emotional distress, self-control, alcohol use problems, and past 6-month illicit or non-prescribed drug use, those who used drugs specifically to get to sleep or to stay awake were 2.0 ( Insomnia was commonly reported in this community sample of adolescents characterized as engaging in risky drinking. Those with symptoms of insomnia appeared to be managing their sleep-related symptoms through alcohol and other drug use, which may have further exacerbated their sleep issues. "
127,39315343,"Patients with chronic kidney disease experience high burden of symptoms, negatively affecting their quality of life. Medication therapy is often initiated to address these symptoms but is limited by variable efficacy and high pill burden. There is interest among clinicians and patients to explore cannabis and cannabinoids as an alternative treatment to manage symptoms related to kidney disease. The objectives were to characterize cannabis use among patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis (HD), to describe patient perspectives on cannabis, and to explore patient experiences with their kidney health care team related to cannabis. This was a descriptive, cross-sectional paper-based patient survey. Patients receiving maintenance HD at Toronto General Hospital in the ambulatory setting between July and August 2020 were included. A 33-item questionnaire was developed to address the study questions based on existing cannabis questionnaires and input from kidney specialist physicians, pharmacists, kidney nurse practitioners, and patients. The questionnaire was distributed to patients during their in-center HD session. Patients who chose to participate in the study completed the questionnaire and returned it to the study team. In total, there were 52 respondents, of which 11 (21%) reported cannabis use in the preceding 3 months, and 23 (44%) reported historical cannabis use. Baseline characteristics were similar between those who used cannabis and those who did not, with a possible trend of cannabis users being younger. The most commonly reported reasons for using cannabis were recreation and symptom management. Those who reported using cannabis for symptom management were doing so without medical authorization or documentation. Common symptoms that cannabis was used to self-treat were insomnia, anxiety, and/or non-neuropathic pain. Dried flower was the most common type of product used, and smoking was the most common route. Care gaps and opportunities to improve patient care related to cannabis use were identified, related to monitoring and management of adverse effects, management of drug interactions, harm reduction strategies, informed decision-making, and prescriber education. The overall participation rate was low, at approximately 17%, possibly related to the COVID-19 pandemic, lack of interest, or fear of revealing cannabis use. Non-response bias is a possible limitation as this was a voluntary survey. The questionnaire was limited to multiple-choice and Likert scale questions, therefore limiting the depth of patient responses. Our study showed that cannabis use among patients receiving HD is common and comparable with the general population. Patients may be using cannabis to self-manage symptoms related to kidney disease, without the involvement of the health care team. Multiple opportunities to improve patient care related to cannabis use were identified. Les symptômes liés à l’insuffisance rénale représentent un lourd fardeau pour les patients qui en sont atteints, ce qui affecte négativement leur qualité de vie. Un traitement médicamenteux est souvent prescrit pour soulager les symptômes, mais il est limité par son efficacité variable et le nombre élevé de médicaments. Les patients et les cliniciens sont ouverts à explorer d’autres avenues pour gérer les symptômes de l’insuffisance rénale, notamment la consommation de cannabis et de cannabinoïdes. Caractériser la consommation de cannabis chez les patients recevant des traitements d’hémodialyse (HD) chronique; décrire les perspectives des patients sur le cannabis et examiner les expériences des patients avec leurs équipes de soins en lien avec la consommation de cannabis. Enquête transversale descriptive sous forme d’un questionnaire papier remis aux patients. Les patients qui suivaient des traitements d’HD chronique en ambulatoire à l’Hôpital général de Toronto en juillet et août 2020. Pour répondre aux objectifs de l’étude, un questionnaire en 33 points a été élaboré à partir de questionnaires existants sur la consommation de cannabis et des commentaires de néphrologues, pharmaciens, infirmières praticiennes en néphrologie et patients. Le questionnaire a été distribué aux patients pendant une séance d’HD en centre. Les personnes qui ont choisi de participer à l’étude l’ont rempli et l’ont renvoyé à l’équipe de recherche. En tout, 52 personnes ont répondu au questionnaire, desquelles 11 (21%) ont déclaré avoir consommé du cannabis dans les trois mois précédents et 23 (44%) en avoir consommé dans le passé. Les caractéristiques initiales des consommateurs de cannabis étaient semblables à celles des personnes qui n’en consommaient pas; les consommateurs de cannabis ayant tendance à être plus jeunes. On consommait principalement du cannabis pour le côté récréatif et pour gérer les symptômes. Les personnes qui consommaient du cannabis pour gérer leurs symptômes le faisaient sans documentation ou indication médicale. Le cannabis était consommé pour l’auto-traitement de symptômes courants comme l’insomnie, l’anxiété et/ou la douleur non neurogène. Le plus souvent, le cannabis était fumé, et la fleur séchée était le produit le plus utilisé. Des lacunes dans les soins et des occasions d’améliorer les soins aux patients ont été identifiées en lien avec la consommation de cannabis, celles-ci concernaient la surveillance et la gestion des effets indésirables, la gestion des interactions médicamenteuses, les stratégies de réduction des risques, la prise de décisions éclairées et l’éducation des prescripteurs. Le taux de participation global a été faible (environ 17%), possiblement en raison de la pandémie de COVID-19, d’un manque d’intérêt ou de la réticence à révéler la consommation de cannabis. La participation était volontaire, un biais de non-réponse est donc possible. Le questionnaire n’était constitué que de questions à choix multiples et à échelle de Likert, ce qui limite la profondeur des réponses. Notre étude montre que la consommation de cannabis chez les patients sous HD est courante et comparable à celle de la population générale. Les patients peuvent consommer du cannabis pour soulager les symptômes liés à l’insuffisance rénale sans intervention de l’équipe de soins. Le sondage a permis d’identifier plusieurs occasions d’améliorer les soins aux patients en lien avec la consommation de cannabis. "

130,38693590,"Distressing symptoms are common in advanced cancer. Medicinal cannabinoids are commonly prescribed for a variety of symptoms. There is little evidence to support their use for most indications in palliative care. This study aims to assess a 1:20 delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol (THC/CBD) cannabinoid preparation in the management of symptom distress in patients with advanced cancer undergoing palliative care. One hundred and fifty participants will be recruited across multiple sites in Queensland, Australia. A teletrial model will facilitate the recruitment of patients outside of major metropolitan areas. The study is a pragmatic, multicenter, randomised, placebo-controlled, two-arm trial of escalating doses of an oral 1:20 THC/CBD medicinal cannabinoid preparation (10 mg THC:200 mg CBD/mL). It will compare the efficacy and safety outcomes of a titrated dose range of 2.5 mg THC/50mgCBD to 30 mg THC/600 mg CBD per day against a placebo. There is a 2-week patient-determined titration phase, to reach a dose that achieves symptom relief or intolerable side effects, with a further 2 weeks of assessment on the final dose. The primary objective is to assess the effect of escalating doses of a 1:20 THC/CBD medicinal cannabinoid preparation against placebo on change in total symptom distress score, with secondary objectives including establishing a patient-determined effective dose, the effect on sleep quality and overall quality of life. Some patients will be enrolled in a sub-study which will more rigorously evaluate the effect on sleep. MedCan-3 is a high-quality, adequately powered, placebo-controlled trial which will help demonstrate the utility of a THC:CBD 1:20 oral medicinal cannabis product in reducing total symptom distress in this population. Secondary outcomes may lead to new hypotheses regarding medicinal cannabis' role in particular symptoms or in particular cancers. The sleep sub-study will test the feasibility of using actigraphy and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) in this cohort. This will be the first large-scale palliative care randomised clinical trial to utilise the teletrial model in Australia. If successful, this will have significant implications for trial access for rural and remote patients in Australia and internationally. ANZCTR ACTRN12622000083796 . Protocol number 001/20.

131,36587508,"Using data from two methodologically independent youth research studies in Canada, the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study and the Cannabis, Obesity, Mental health, Physical activity, Alcohol, Smoking, and Sedentary behaviour (COMPASS) study, the objective of this study was to compare associations between youth's mental health and cannabis use across samples. Using similar indicators in both studies, our goal was to affirm the potential for nationally representative cross-sectional analyses (HBSC) to replicate findings found in a longitudinal non-representative data source (COMPASS), enhancing opportunity for causal inferences. Data were collected from grade 9 and 10 Canadian students participating in the 2017/18 HBSC (n=8462) and 2017/18 to 2018/19 waves of COMPASS (n=32,023). Using multivariable Poisson regression models, the strength and statistical significance of the effects of mental health indicators on cannabis use outcomes were estimated within both studies and compared for consistency. Using a 2-year linked sample of students participating in COMPASS, models examining the impact of mental health indicators on cannabis use initiation and maintenance over time were similarly fit using Poisson regression to estimate relative risk. Similar associations between mental health problems and cannabis use were observed in both data sources. The direction, magnitude, and precision of the estimates for restless sleep, loneliness, poor wellbeing, and cannabis use were highly comparable across both studies. Worse mental health was consistently associated with current and lifetime cannabis use among youth. Cross-sectional and longitudinal findings from two large methodologically diverse studies in Canada demonstrate a replicable association between indicators of mental health and youth cannabis use. Similarities were identified and two generalizations may be concluded: 1) potentially causal etiological relationships inferred from HBSC data were supported in longitudinal findings based on COMPASS, and 2) longitudinal COMPASS data aligns with nationally representative data from HBSC.

133,34052339,"Medical cannabis access has been legalized in more than 30 countries worldwide and popularity among patients is increasing rapidly. Cannabinoid-based treatments have been shown to be beneficial for several symptoms such as chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, spasticity, chronic pain, intractable seizures and insomnia, yet high-quality clinical trials are still limited. As millions of patients now have legal access to medical cannabis, little information is available about the development of best clinical practices and an effective medical cannabis clinic model. A medical cannabis clinic is an innovative and emergent practice model that may be necessary to bridge the gap between patient and healthcare provider interest and existing barriers to the prescription of medical cannabis treatments, such as limited medical education, lack of high-quality clinical research and challenging or evolving regulatory frameworks. In this paper, we describe the model of care and organization of a dedicated medical cannabis clinic operating in Quebec, Canada since 2014. We share the principles of medical cannabis practice, including the structure of its medical and support team, clinic organisation and procedure guidelines. Key clinic statistics and patient demographics are shared with year by year comparison. Operating since 2014, the clinic has endured a rapidly changing regulatory landscape in Canada, overcoming numerous challenges including medical and social stigma, limited funding, resources and institutional support combined with a high demand for services. To support medical cannabis leaders globally, an important knowledge-sharing is required. The clinic has expanded to a network of four clinic sites across Quebec and offers continuing education and preceptorships to health care providers and trainees as well as research services to both academic and industry partners. The description of the clinic offers guidance on medical cannabis treatment and care and discusses possible solutions to associated challenges. The clinic model of care can be adapted to different healthcare settings and regulatory frameworks; it may assist physicians and health care providers in the development of medical cannabis clinics or the implementation of best practices as medical cannabis access continues to evolve.

135,33204797,"Research within a gynecologic oncology population has lagged behind the uptake in use of medical cannabis for symptom control. This study seeks to evaluate patient experience with prescribed medical cannabis obtained through licensed dispensaries in women with gynecologic malignancies. A 43-item survey exploring patient experience with medical cannabis was administered to women with gynecologic malignancies who used medical cannabis prescribed by a gynecologic oncologist. Thirty-six eligible patients were approached for consent, and 31 patients returned completed surveys (86%). Ninety-three percent had advanced or recurrent disease; 74% were receiving chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Eighty-three percent reported medical cannabis provided relief from cancer or treatment-related symptoms including decreased appetite (41%), insomnia (41%), neuropathy (41%), anxiety (35%), nausea (29%), joint pain (29%), bone pain (29%), abdominal pain (25%), and depression (19%). Eighty percent of patients reported medical cannabis worked the same or better than other traditional medications for management of their cancer or treatment-related symptoms, and 83% reported medical cannabis had an equivalent or better side effect profile. Of the subset of patients using medical cannabis for pain, 63% reported a reduction in opioid use. Patients perceive that medical cannabis was useful for relief of cancer and treatment-related symptoms, suggesting medical cannabis may be a reasonable alternative or adjunct therapy. Medical cannabis was well tolerated and may have the potential to improve neuropathic pain and decrease opioid use. "
136,25135784,"Substance use disorders (SUD) are common and individuals who suffer from them are prone to relapse. One of the most common consequences of the use of and withdrawal from substances of abuse is sleep disturbance. Substances of abuse affect sleep physiology, including the neurotransmitter systems that regulate the sleep-wake system. Emerging research now highlights an interactive effect between sleep disorders and substance use. New findings in alcohol and sleep research have utilized sophisticated research designs and expanded the scope of EEG and circadian rhythm analyses. Research on marijuana and sleep has progressed with findings on the effects of marijuana withdrawal on objective and subjective measures of sleep. Treatment studies have focused primarily on sleep in alcohol use disorders. Therapies for insomnia in cannabis disorders are needed. Future research is poised to further address mechanisms of sleep disturbance in alcoholics and the effect of medical marijuana on sleep and daytime functioning. "

139,28340421,"Medical cannabis is increasingly being used for a variety of health conditions as more states implement legislation permitting medical use of cannabis. Little is known about medical cannabis use patterns and motives among adults across the lifespan. The present study examined data collected at a medical cannabis dispensary in San Francisco, California. Participants included 217 medical cannabis patients who were grouped into age-defined cohorts (younger: 18-30, middle-aged: 31-50, and older: 51-72). The age groups were compared on several measures of cannabis use, motives and medical conditions using one-way ANOVAs, chi-square tests and linear regression analyses. All three age groups had similar frequency of cannabis use over the past month; however, the quantity of cannabis used and rates of problematic cannabis use were higher among younger users relative to middle-aged and older adults. The association between age and problematic cannabis use was moderated by age of regular use initiation such that earlier age of regular cannabis use onset was associated with more problematic use in the younger users, but not among older users. Middle-aged adults were more likely to report using medical cannabis for insomnia, while older adults were more likely to use medical cannabis for chronic medical problems such as cancer, glaucoma and HIV/AIDS. Younger participants reported cannabis use when bored at a greater rate than middle-aged and older adults. Findings suggest that there is an age-related risk for problematic cannabis use among medical cannabis users, such that younger users should be monitored for cannabis use patterns that may lead to deleterious consequences.

140,37269785,"Young adults (18-30 years) are vulnerable to sleep-wake disturbances and substance use, which are bi-directionally associated. The present work aims to organise the literature that deals with the association between sleep and substance use in young adults, also considering self-medication behaviours. We adopted a framework that accounts for the multidimensionality of sleep and the effect of different substances. We considered sleep disturbances (insomnia symptoms, sleep quality), sleep health dimensions (duration, satisfaction, efficiency, timing, daytime alertness), circadian characteristics (chronotype). Substances were alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, cannabis, others. We included 46 studies. The use of caffeine and nicotine was associated with higher odds of sleep disturbances. No significant effect was detected for sleep duration. In narrative findings, daytime dysfunction was associated with alcohol and caffeine use, and poor sleep satisfaction with nicotine use. Few evidence were available for the other sleep health dimensions. Evening chronotype was associated with alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine use. Few studies focused on cannabis or self-medication. Longitudinal results were inconclusive. We found a distinct pattern of associations between different substances and different sleep outcomes. Further investigation considering the multidimensionality of sleep would create a better understanding of the complex relationship between substance use and sleep health in young adults. "
141,30822492,"The use of Cannabis for medical purposes is rapidly expanding and is usually employed as a self-medication for the treatment of insomnia disorder. However, the effect on sleep seems to depend on multiple factors such as composition of the Cannabis, dosage and route of administration. Vaporization is the recommended route for the administration of Cannabis for medical purposes; however, there is no published research about the effects of vaporized Cannabis on sleep, neither in laboratory animals, nor in humans. Because previous reports suggested that low doses of THC have sedating effects, the aim of the present study was to characterize in rats, the acute effects on sleep induced by the administration of low doses of THC by means of vaporization of a specific type of Cannabis (THC 11.5% and negligible amounts of other cannabinoids). For this purpose, polysomnographic recordings in chronically prepared rats were performed during 6 h in the light and dark phases. Animals were treated with 0 (control), 40, 80 and 200 mg of Cannabis immediately before the beginning of recordings; the THC plasma concentrations with these doses were low (up to 6.7 ng/mL with 200 mg). A quantitative EEG analyses by means of the spectral power and coherence estimations was also performed for the highest Cannabis dose. Compared to control, 200 mg of Cannabis increased NREM sleep time during the light phase, but only during the first hour of recording. Interestingly, no changes on sleep were observed during the dark (active) phase or with lower doses of Cannabis. Cannabis 200 mg also produced EEG power reductions in different cortices, mainly for high frequency bands during W and REM sleep, but only during the light phase. On the contrary, a reduction in the sleep spindles intra-hemispheric coherence was observed during NREM sleep, but only during the dark phase. In conclusion, administration of low doses of THC by vaporization of a specific type of Cannabis produced a small increment of NREM sleep, but only during the light (resting) phase. This was accompanied by subtle modifications of high frequency bands power (during the light phase) and spindle coherence (during the dark phase), which are associated with cognitive processing. Our results reassure the importance of exploring the sleep-promoting properties of Cannabis. "

143,37884682,"The side effects of cancer therapy continue to cause significant health and cost burden to the patient, their friends and family, and governments. A major barrier in the way in which these side effects are managed is the highly siloed mentality that results in a fragmented approach to symptom control. Increasingly, it is appreciated that many symptoms are manifestations of common underlying pathobiology, with changes in the gastrointestinal environment a key driver for many symptom sequelae. Breakdown of the mucosal barrier (mucositis) is a common and early side effect of many anti-cancer agents, known to contribute (in part) to a range of highly burdensome symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, infection, malnutrition, fatigue, depression, and insomnia. Here, we outline a rationale for how, based on its already documented effects on the gastrointestinal microenvironment, medicinal cannabis could be used to control mucositis and prevent the constellation of symptoms with which it is associated. We will provide a brief update on the current state of evidence on medicinal cannabis in cancer care and outline the potential benefits (and challenges) of using medicinal cannabis during active cancer therapy.

This study examined whether correlates of self-reported MCU among youth varied as a function of the primary health condition for which cannabis is used. Data were drawn from the 2017 Canadian Tobacco, Alcohol, and Drugs Survey. Youth (ages 15-24) who reported past-year cannabis use were included in these analyses. Regression analyses (controlling for age and sex) compared youth reporting only nonmedicinal cannabis use (NMCU only,  Relative to youth reporting NMCU only, youth reporting MCU for physical or mental health conditions had greater odds of reporting daily cannabis use, cannabis problems, vaporization and oral ingestion of cannabis, and tobacco use. Youth reporting MCU for physical health reasons also had greater odds of both illicit drug use and prescription pain medication use, whereas youth reporting MCU for mental health reasons had greater odds of prescription sedative use. Youth in both the physical health and mental health MCU groups reported poorer health and mental health compared with the NMCU-only group. Youth reporting MCU for insomnia had greater odds of cannabis problems relative to youth in the NMCU-only group, but there were no other differences between these groups. Findings provide new insight into the correlates of MCU among youth in the Canadian population, suggesting that these correlates vary as a function of the primary reason for MCU. "

Cross-sectional study using a novel 35-question survey distributed to women diagnosed with gynecologic cancer within two academic centers in California and Colorado. The survey queries demographic and disease traits, and both objective and subjective issues surrounding use of cannabis products for symptom management. Surveys were distributed to patients actively receiving treatment or under surveillance. Enrollment began July 16, 2018 and was completed December 1, 2018. Survey return rate was 52.7%. A total of 225 participants met inclusion criteria.Sixty-two percent reported that they have used or would be interested in using cannabis products for symptom management; 60 (26.7%) are using non-prescription cannabis for treatment of cancer related symptoms, and 80 (35.6%) are interested in using cannabis derivatives under direction of their oncologist. Reasons cited for use of cannabis included: pain control (n = 41, 68.3), insomnia (n = 33, 55.0%), anxiety (n = 29, 48.3%), nausea (n = 26, 43.3%), and appetite stimulation (n = 21, 35.0%). Of the women using cannabis products, almost half report decreased prescription narcotic use after initiation of cannabis products (n = 27, 45.0%). Women with gynecologic cancer report a strong interest in the use of non-prescription cannabis products for management of cancer-related symptoms. Practitioners in the field of gynecologic oncology should be aware of the frequency of use of non-prescription cannabis amongst their patients as well as the growing desire for guidance about the use of cannabis derivatives. A substantial number of patients report decreased reliance on opioids when using cannabis derivatives for pain control. "
146,36182689,"Despite increasing use of Medical Cannabis (MC) among posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients, research is lacking on how MC treatment relates to PTSD symptomatology, in particular sleep disturbances. This study examines the time gap between MC use and sleep onset and its association with (1) number of awakenings throughout the night, (2) early awakenings, (3) nightmares. Each morning over a two week period, 77 licensed MC patients suffering from PTSD reported on the timing of previous night MC use and sleep disturbances. Within-person analyses found that shorter time gaps between previous night MC use and sleep start time was associated with lower likelihood of experiencing nightmares throughout the night, but it was not associated with nightly awakenings or waking up too early. Between-person analyses showed that individuals who used MC products with higher CBD concentrations reported fewer early awakenings. These preliminary results indicate that future research should test causal relations between MC use and sleep problems in PTSD patients. Future research is warranted in order to explore causal relationships between MC use, nightmares and insomnia in PTSD patients. "
147,38703603,"There is a profound connection between abnormal sleep patterns and brain disorders, suggesting a shared influential association. However, the shared genetic basis and potential causal relationships between sleep-related traits and brain disorders are yet to be fully elucidated. Utilizing linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and bidirectional two-sample univariable Mendelian Randomization (UVMR) analyses with large-scale GWAS datasets, we investigated the genetic correlations and causal associations across six sleep traits and 24 prevalent brain disorders. Additionally, a multivariable Mendelian Randomization (MVMR) analysis evaluated the cumulative effects of various sleep traits on each brain disorder, complemented by genetic loci characterization to pinpoint pertinent genes and pathways. LDSC analysis identified significant genetic correlations in 66 out of 144 (45.8 %) pairs between sleep-related traits and brain disorders, with the most pronounced correlations observed in psychiatric disorders (66 %, 48/72). UVMR analysis identified 29 causal relationships (FDR<0.05) between sleep traits and brain disorders, with 19 associations newly discovered according to our knowledge. Notably, major depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, cannabis use disorder, and anorexia nervosa showed bidirectional causal relations with sleep traits, especially insomnia's marked influence on major depression (IVW beta 0.468, FDR = 5.24E-09). MVMR analysis revealed a nuanced interplay among various sleep traits and their impact on brain disorders. Genetic loci characterization underscored potential genes, such as HOXB2, while further enrichment analyses illuminated the importance of synaptic processes in these relationships. This study provides compelling evidence for the causal relationships and shared genetic backgrounds between common sleep-related traits and brain disorders. "
148,37574376,"Research investigating cannabis use and sleep health is limited, and results are mixed. Few studies were nationally representative with racially-ethnically diverse samples or assessed potential modifiers. Our objective was to investigate cross-sectional associations between reported cannabis use and sleep disturbances by potential modifiers among non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic/Latino men and women in the United States. We used nationally representative National Comorbidity Survey-Replication data collected from 2001 to 2003 among 3929 adults. Poisson regression with robust variance estimated prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals of patterns of sleep disturbances identified through latent class analysis. Models adjusted for sociodemographic, health behavior, and clinical characteristics were stratified by race-ethnicity and by race-ethnicity along with sex/gender, and age, separately. Over half of adults reported cannabis use (52%-ever/lifetime vs 48%-never). We identified two latent classes: multiple sleep disturbances with daytime sleepiness and no sleep disturbances with some daytime sleepiness. Prevalence of multiple sleep disturbances with daytime sleepiness was higher among participants reporting lifetime cannabis use (23% vs 20%). Associations did not vary by race-ethnicity or sex/gender. Lifetime vs never cannabis use was marginally associated with a higher prevalence of multiple sleep disturbances with daytime sleepiness only among adults aged 25-29years (PR=1.09 [95% confidence interval: 1.00-1.18]; eg, PR Associations between cannabis use and sleep may vary by age. Replication with more recent data and prospective studies that investigate intersectional identities among diverse populations with objective assessments are warranted. "
149,33509412,"Veterans have high rates of cannabis use, and rates of cannabis use disorder (CUD) are rising among this population. These rising rates are particularly true for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is common among veterans of recent conflicts, Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND). Although prior work has documented links between PTSD and cannabis use, a better understanding of the intersection among CUD, PTSD, and other disorders in real-world clinical practice can inform prevention and treatment efforts. This study examined the prevalence and comorbidities of CUD and PTSD in OFE/OIF/OND veterans. The study analyzed data from the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse (2010-2016) for returning war veterans who were diagnosed with CUD (N = 46,268). The study determined prevalence of PTSD, and examined additional differences in comorbidities. The prevalence of a comorbid PTSD diagnosis among OEF/OIF/OND veterans with a CUD diagnosis was 72.3%. Further analysis revealed additional co-occurring disorders. Veterans with a diagnosis of CUD and PTSD were more likely to have a comorbid diagnosis of depression (odds ratio, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.62-1.71), panic disorder (odds ratio; 1.58; 95% CI, 1.43-1.75), alcohol use disorder (odds ratio; 1.30; 95% CI, 1.24-1.35), opioid use disorder (odds ratio; 1.52; 95% CI, 1.43-1.62), and insomnia (odds ratio; 1.74; 95% CI, 1.65-1.84) than veterans without a PTSD diagnosis. Findings highlight that the majority of returning war veterans with CUD are highly complex. Our findings substantiate the need for urgent, comprehensive care for veterans with co-occurring CUD and PTSD, including integrated and transdiagnostic treatment approaches. "
150,37837502,"Poor sleep is one of the most common side effects of cancer. It can persist for years beyond treatment and negatively impact quality of life and health. Cannabis is increasingly used to manage cancer treatment-related symptoms, including sleep. This study investigated the use and perceived effects of cannabis as a sleep aid in Canadian cancer survivors. Adult Canadian cancer survivors (N = 1464) were recruited via the Angus Reid Institute and completed an online, cross-sectional survey including the Insomnia Severity Index and questions about cannabis use for sleep. Standard descriptive statistics, such as means, standard deviations, and ranges were produced for measured variables to assess the ways cancer survivors use cannabis for sleep. Frequencies were tabulated for categorical and ordinal variables. On average, participants (M Given the prevalence and potential impact, research is needed to examine the actual efficacy of cannabis as a sleep aid. It is important that cancer survivors have information on methods to help their sleep to avoid impairments to quality of life and health. "
151,30361897,"About 30% of regular cannabis users report withdrawal symptoms on cessation of prolonged use, such as irritability, insomnia, decreased appetite, depressed mood, anxiety, and restlessness. However, among highly dependent and/or in-treatment users, the incidence of withdrawal can be even higher, reaching up to 50-95% of individuals. This syndrome was only recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) as a diagnosis with specific criteria in 2013. The treatment options are poor, with high rates of relapse and non-responders. In this scenario, agonist replacement therapy with cannabinoids has demonstrated potential as a promising therapeutic intervention, with a series of studies having been carried out in recent years. This review sought to summarize trials with cannabinoid agonist replacement therapy for cannabis withdrawal symptoms with the aim of evaluating the efficacy of this pharmacological intervention. We entered the following search terms on the PubMed, Web of Science and PsycINFO databases: (marijuana OR marihuana OR cannabis OR THC OR tetrahydrocannabinol OR hashish OR pot) AND (treatment OR medication) AND (withdrawal OR abstinence) AND (dronabinol OR nabilone OR nabiximols OR sativex OR cesamet OR synthetic cannabinoid). The date of the most recent search was September 2017. Original trials, published in English, performed on humans and dealing with cannabis users who were treated for cannabis withdrawal symptoms using synthetic cannabinoids were all included in the present systematic review. Quality and risk of bias across studies were assessed using a Cochrane tool. The first, second, and last authors read the abstracts of all studies found in the search (n = 243). The inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, and 233 articles were excluded. The first and second authors independently developed a data extraction sheet based on the included articles. The present review included ten original articles. Despite the limited number of studies and methodological differences, our findings demonstrate that the use of dronabinol, nabilone, or nabiximols, either alone or in combination with other drugs, shows promise in reducing cannabis withdrawal symptoms, probably with a dose-dependent effect. This has also been considered a safe group of medications with good tolerability and few adverse effects. No method of handling data and combining results of studies was carried out, representing a limitation of the review. Cannabinoids appear to be a promising group of drugs for the treatment of cannabis withdrawal symptoms. These medications may help decrease the rate of relapse in the treatment of cannabis dependence due to withdrawal symptoms occurring within the first few weeks of treatment. The protocol for this review has been registered in the PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO 2014:CRD42014014118). "
152,36571628,"The female menstrual or estrous cycle and its associated fluctuations in circulating estradiol (E2), progesterone, and other gonadal hormones alter orexin or hypocretin peptide production and receptor activity. Depending on the estrous cycle phase, the transcription of prepro-orexin mRNA, post-translational modification of orexin peptide, and abundance of orexin receptors change in a brain region-specific manner. The most dramatic changes occur in the hypothalamus, which is considered the starting point of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis as well as the hub of orexin-producing neurons. Thus, hypothalamus-regulated behaviors, including arousal, feeding, reward processing, and the stress response depend on coordinated efforts between E2, progesterone, and the orexin system. Given the rise of orexin therapeutics for various neuropsychiatric conditions including insomnia and affective disorders, it is important to delineate the behavioral outcomes of this drug class in both sexes, as well as within different time points of the female reproductive cycle. Summarize how the menstrual or estrous cycle affects orexin system functionality in animal models in order to predict how orexin pharmacotherapies exert varying degrees of behavioral effects across the dynamic hormonal milieu.

153,34325235,"College students have experienced significant disruptions related to COVID-19, and limited international data suggest they may be at elevated risk for mental health symptom increases related to COVID. Given their potentially elevated risk, our aim was to evaluate differences from pre-college closures to post-closure in mental health symptoms, alcohol, and cannabis use. Participants (N = 4749) were from seven U.S. public universities/colleges. They were 70.1 % female and 48.5 % white, non-Hispanic/Latino, with 48.1 % in their first college/university year. 30-day retrospective assessments of alcohol and cannabis use, and past 2-week retrospective assessments of anxiety, depression, anger, and insomnia were captured at the time of the survey. We examined differences between those providing data pre- and post-university closure via linear and negative binomial regressions. Alcohol and cannabis use days were 13 % and 24 % higher, respectively, from pre-to post-university closure; also, prevalence of any 30-day alcohol use and alcohol use consequences were both higher in the post-closure sample (odds ratios = 1.34 and 1.31, respectively). In contrast, days of binge alcohol use were 4 % lower in the post-closing sample. Depressive symptoms and anger were both modestly higher in post-closing participants (d < 0.1), with no differences in anxiety symptoms or insomnia. The modest differences in substance use and mental health from pre-closure through two months post-college closure suggest unexpected resilience in a large and diverse sample of students. College health providers will need to identify those students experiencing the greatest increases in mental health symptoms and substance use, using innovative outreach and treatment. "

This study identified pain profiles among young adult cannabis users and examined related antecedents and distal outcomes. Past 30-day cannabis users aged 18-26, both medical cannabis patients and non-patients, were enrolled in Los Angeles in 2014-2015. A latent class analysis was used to identify pain classes based on history of chronic pain conditions and recent non-minor pain. The study assessed the predictors of membership in pain classes and examined the association of classes with recent mental health characteristics, cannabis use motives and practices. Three classes were identified:  Findings suggest that young adult cannabis users can be separated into distinct groups with different pain profiles. The  "
156,38586531,"With the rapidly changing landscape of state level legalization of cannabis, older adults have become one of the fastest growing populations seeking medical cannabis (MC). However, research evidence on the risks and benefits of MC use in this population remains limited. This review aims to synthesize recent literature on the impacts of MC use in older adults and identify critical knowledge gaps to be addressed in future research. Recent literature showed that older adults often face financial and/or educational barriers and stigma associated with MC access. Emerging data showed that MC may have therapeutic effects on symptoms of conditions such as chronic pain, insomnia, anxiety/depression, dementia, nausea, and vomiting. However, available evidence is inconsistent and tends to rely on self-report and uncontrolled studies. While some adverse events associated with MC use were reported, it is generally well tolerated in older adults. Neurocognitive and psychological consequences and cardiovascular risks have been reported but again only in limited studies with inconsistent findings. There is a need for more systematic and rigorous research on MC in older adults to determine its safety and efficacy. Research on dosing procedures and product characteristics, as well as how these may impact health outcomes, is crucial. More consistent evidence is needed to inform policy changes and patient/physician education to minimize potential risks and optimize benefits among older adults seeking MC as an alternative treatment.

157,19012815,"Although cannabis is the most widely abused illicit drug, little is known about the prevalence of cannabis withdrawal and its factor structure, clinical validity, and psychiatric correlates in the general population. National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions participants were assessed, in 2001-2002, with structured in-person interviews covering substance history, DSM-IV Axis I and II disorders, and withdrawal symptoms after cessation of use. Of these, 2613 had been frequent cannabis users (> or = 3 times/week), and a ""cannabis-only"" subset (N = 1119) never binge-drank or used other drugs > or = 3 times/week.

The symptoms formed 2 factors, one characterized by weakness, hypersomnia, and psychomotor retardation and the second by anxiety, restlessness, depression, and insomnia. Both symptom types were associated with significant distress/impairment (p < .01), substance use to relieve/avoid cannabis withdrawal symptoms (p <.01), and quantity of cannabis use (among the cannabis-only users p < .05). Panic (p < .01) and personality (p > .01) disorders were associated with anxiety symptoms in both samples, family history of drug problems was associated with weakness symptoms in the subset (p = .01), and depression was associated with both sets of symptoms in the subset (p < or = .05). Cannabis withdrawal was prevalent and clinically significant among a representative sample of frequent cannabis users. Similar results in the subset without polysubstance abuse confirmed the specificity of symptoms to cannabis. Cannabis withdrawal should be added to DSM-V, and the etiology and treatment implications of cannabis withdrawal symptoms should be investigated. "
158,18853932,"To evaluate the association between adolescent insomnia and mental health during adolescence and young adulthood. Cross-sectional and prospective study. School and in home. Nationally based population sample of 4494 adolescents, 12 to 18 years old at baseline (mean = 15.83 years), with 3582 young adults, 18 to 25 years old (mean = 21.25 years) at 6- to 7-year follow-up. Self-report measures of mental health. Insomnia symptoms were reported by 9.4% of the adolescents. Cross-sectionally, adolescent insomnia symptoms were associated with use of alcohol, cannabis, and drugs other than cannabis; depression; suicide ideation; and suicide attempts (all P values < 0.01) after controlling for sex. Prospectively, insomnia symptoms during adolescence were a significant risk factor for depression diagnosis (odds ratio = 2.3) in young adulthood after controlling for sex and baseline depression. This study is the first to longitudinally evaluate insomnia symptoms during adolescence as a risk factor for mental health problems in young adulthood. The findings indicate that insomnia is a prevalent problem for adolescents and argue for future treatment-outcome studies to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of various insomnia interventions in this age group.

159,35387682,"Cannabis use among pregnant women has increased. We surveyed pregnant women in rural Pennsylvania to examine cannabis use and opinions regarding its safety during pregnancy. We examined associations between challenges of pregnancy (e.g., exhaustion, pain, nausea) and cannabis use. A cross-sectional survey was administered to a convenience sample of English-speaking pregnant women receiving prenatal care at Geisinger, May-June 2019. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to construct three scores (overwhelmed/exhausted, happy/optimistic, and health worries) based on 10 questions regarding common experiences during pregnancy (e.g., nausea/vomiting, pain, exhaustion, mood). A score based on four questions regarding cannabis safety during pregnancy was also constructed. From a maximum of 300 surveys distributed, 284 were completed (95%). Most participants were white (87%), married (49%) or living with a partner (38%), and had private health insurance (62%). Most women indicated it was unsafe to use alcohol and tobacco products during pregnancy (> 90%), but that proportion dropped to 82% and 63% regarding recreational cannabis and medical cannabis, respectively. Only women with prior cannabis use (23% of sample) continued to do so during pregnancy: 57% of women reporting daily cannabis use prior to pregnancy continued to use cannabis during pregnancy with 33% reporting daily use. Two thirds of users during pregnancy indicated they were self-medicating for: nausea (90%), anxiety (70%), insomnia (30%), and pain management (30%). Many (56%) of the women who used cannabis during pregnancy believed it is safe. Younger women and women who were overwhelmed/exhausted or less happy/optimistic were more likely to believe cannabis use is safe. Women valued healthcare provider advice more than advice from family and friends. Study strengths include a high response rate. Weaknesses include self-report and that is was a convenience sample; however, the demographics of the sample were similar to past studies. Women with a history of cannabis use, especially daily use, are at risk of continuing during pregnancy and should receive counseling. Younger women and women with greater stressors during pregnancy also are at greater risk. Screening for prior use and for stressors may identify patients that would benefit from enhanced counseling.

160,31548810,"Cancer patients experience multiple symptoms throughout their illness, and some report benefit from the use of cannabis. There are concerns that many patients are accessing products inappropriate for their situation and potentially putting themselves at risk. In the present study, we aimed to capture the prevalence of cannabis use among cancer patients at BC Cancer before recreational legalization in Canada and to identify the reasons that patients take cannabis, the various routes of administration they use, and the reasons that prior users stopped. Patients were eligible if, on the selected study day (15 August 2018), they were scheduled for an appointment at any of the 6 BC Cancer sites. Eligible patients were mailed a survey. Of surveys sent to 2998 patients, 821 (27.4%) were returned and included in analysis. Of those respondents, 23% were currently using cannabis-based products, almost exclusively for medical purposes, and an additional 28% had been users in the past (most often recreationally). Of the patients currently using cannabis, 31% had medical authorization. The most common symptoms that the current users were targeting were pain, insomnia, nausea, and anxiety; many were also hoping for anticancer effects. More than half the respondents had tried cannabis at some time, and almost one quarter of respondents were currently taking cannabis to help manage their symptoms or treat their cancer, or both. Many more patients would consider use with appropriate guidance from a health care professional. More research is needed to inform physicians and patients about safe uses and doses and about the potential adverse effects of cannabis use. "
161,28214781,"Cannabis use has been reported to affect the course of various psychiatric disorders, however its effect on the course of major depressive disorder (MDD) is not yet clear. We used data from Wave 1 and Wave 2 of the National Epidemiologic survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). Individuals with baseline MDD (N=2,348) were included in the study. Cannabis users without a Cannabis Use Disorder (CUDs) and individuals with a CUD were compared to nonusers using linear and logistic regression analyses controlling for sociodemographics, psychiatric disorders and substance use disorders at baseline. No differences were found in rates of remission between the groups. Level of cannabis use was associated with significantly more depressive symptoms at follow-up, particularly anhedonia, changes in body weight, insomnia or hypersomnia and psychomotor problems. After adjusting for baseline confounding factors, no associations were found between cannabis use and suicidality, functionality and quality of life. We conclude that many of the associations between cannabis use and a more severe course of MDD do not seem to be attributed to cannabis use itself but to associated sociodemographic and clinical factors. Further longitudinal studies using depression severity indices are required. "
162,34676335,"We present the case of a 12-year-old boy diagnosed with Tourette syndrome, who was successfully treated with a combination of vaporized medicinal cannabis and oral pure tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Due to severe motor tics resulting in insomnia, the parents - both of whom were medical doctors - decided to initiate treatment with 0.02 g vaporized cannabis (Bedrocan with a THC content of 22% and a cannabidiol content of 1%; corresponding to a dose equivalent to 4.4 mg THC) without prior consultation of a Tourette expert. This treatment resulted - according to the parents' report - in an immediate and nearly complete remission of the tics. Due to a further increase in tics, the parents therefore decided to implement a regular treatment with a combination of vaporized medicinal cannabis (up to 0.1 g cannabis per day, varieties Bedrocan and Amnesia Haze, corresponding to 22 mg THC/day) plus orally administered oil-based THC drops (maximum daily dose = 12.5 mg THC) resulting in a marked tic reduction. During a visit in our clinic, we were able to observe the reported beneficial effects 30 min after vaporization of 0.15 g cannabis (Amnesia Haze, equivalent to 33 mg THC; in addition, 7 mg oral THC were taken at home 6 h before the visit): tics, premonitory urges, and overall impairment significantly improved according to self-ratings, parent and clinician questionnaires. Importantly, no adverse events were reported. From this single case study, it is suggested that cannabis-based medicines and their combination (such as oral THC plus vaporized medicinal cannabis) are effective and safe in the treatment of severe tics in minors with TS. However, long-term follow-up is needed to confirm the beneficial treatment effects. We want to emphasize that in this boy treatment with cannabis was initiated by the parents before a consultation in our clinic has taken place. In our opinion, treatment with cannabis-based medicine in children should be regarded as a last-line treatment, when well-established treatments have failed to improve tics. "

164,30817935,"Supraphysiologic-dose anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) use is associated with physiologic, cognitive, and brain abnormalities similar to those found in people at risk for developing Alzheimer's Disease and its related dementias (AD/ADRD), which are associated with high brain β-amyloid (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau (tau-P) protein levels. Supraphysiologic-dose AAS induces androgen abnormalities and excess oxidative stress, which have been linked to increased and decreased expression or activity of proteins that synthesize and eliminate, respectively, Aβ and tau-P. Aβ and tau-P accumulation may begin soon after initiating supraphysiologic-dose AAS use, which typically occurs in the early 20s, and their accumulation may be accelerated by other psychoactive substance use, which is common among non-medical AAS users. Accordingly, the widespread use of supraphysiologic-dose AAS may increase the numbers of people who develop dementia. Early diagnosis and correction of sex-steroid level abnormalities and excess oxidative stress could attenuate risk for developing AD/ADRD in supraphysiologic-dose AAS users, in people with other substance use disorders, and in people with low sex-steroid levels or excess oxidative stress associated with aging.

166,31954953,"A substantial proportion of people using cannabis report using it to improve sleep. Yet, little research exists on the associations between the timing of cannabis use and sleep. This study examines the time elapsed between cannabis use and sleep start time and its association with two of the main indicators of sleep continuity: (1) sleep onset latency (SOL) and (2) number of awakenings (NOA) throughout the night. Each morning, for 7 consecutive days, daily cannabis users (n = 54) reported on the timing of previous night's cannabis use and sleep indicators on their smartphones. Mixed effects models examined the relations of within- and between-subjects' time elapsed between previous night cannabis use and sleep start time, with (1) SOL and (2) NOA. Within subjects, shorter time elapsed between cannabis use and sleep start time was associated with shorter SOL (β = 0.519, p = 0.010), but not NOA (β = -0.030, p = 0.535). Furthermore, between individuals, the time gap between the previous night cannabis use and sleep start time was not associated with SOL or NOA (p > 0.05). It is possible that cannabis use proximal to bedtime is associated with shorted sleep onset latency but not nighttime awakenings. Cannabis users should be informed about both the potential sleep aid effects of cannabis and its limitations. Pending further evidence of the effects of cannabis on sleep, cannabis users experiencing sleep problems should be provided with evidence-based alternatives to improve sleep, e.g., pharmacological and behavioral treatments.

167,29119763,"medical cannabis refers to the use of cannabis or cannabinoids as medical therapy to treat disease or alleviate symptoms. In the United States, 23 states and Washington DC (May 2015) have introduced laws to permit the medical use of cannabis. Within the European Union, medicinal cannabis laws and praxis vary wildly between Countries. to provide evidence for benefits and harms of cannabis (including extracts and tinctures) treatment for adults in the following indications: control of spasticity and pain in patients with multiple sclerosis; control of pain in patients with chronic neuropathic pain; control of nausea and vomiting in adults with cancer receiving chemotherapy. we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, and EMBASE from inception to September 2016. We also searched for on-going studies via ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal. All searches included also non-English language literature. All relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the safety and efficacy of cannabis (including extracts and tinctures) compared with placebo or other pharmacological agents were included. Three authors independently evaluated the titles and abstracts of studies identified in the literature searches for their eligibility. For studies considered eligible, we retrieved full texts. Three investigators independently extracted data. For the assessment of the quality of evidence, we used the standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane and GRADE working Group. 41 trials (4,550 participants) were included; 15 studies considered efficacy and safety of cannabis for patients with multiple sclerosis, 12 for patients with chronic pain, and 14 for patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy. The included studies were published between 1975 and 2015, and the majority of them were conducted in Europe. We judged almost 50% of these studies to be at low risk of bias. The large majority (80%) of the comparisons were with placebo; only 8 studies included patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy comparing cannabis with other antiemetic drugs. Concerning the efficacy of cannabis (compared with placebo) in patients with multiple sclerosis, confidence in the estimate was high in favour of cannabis for spasticity (numerical rating scale and visual analogue scale, but not the Ashworth scale) and pain. For chronic and neuropathic pain (compared with placebo), there was evidence of a small effect; however, confidence in the estimate is low and these results could not be considered conclusive. There is uncertainty whether cannabis, including extracts and tinctures, compared with placebo or other antiemetic drugs reduces nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer requiring chemotherapy, although the confidence in the estimate of the effect was low or very low. In the included studies, many adverse events were reported and none of the studies assessed the development of abuse or dependence. there is incomplete evidence of the efficacy and safety of medical use of cannabis in the clinical contexts considered in this review. Furthermore, for many of the outcomes considered, the confidence in the estimate of the effect was again low or very low. To give conclusive answers to the efficacy and safety of cannabis used for medical purposes in the clinical contexts considered, further studies are needed, with higher quality, larger sample sizes, and possibly using the same diagnostic tools for evaluating outcomes of interest.

168,37944198,"Interventions for youth cannabis use have limited efficacy. Sleep is likely to affect treatment response, as sleep difficulties are cross-sectionally associated with use and common during treatment. This analysis examined how sleep duration and subjective trouble sleeping related to next-day cannabis use among youth during cannabis treatment. Participants (N=64) received a psychosocial intervention plus topiramate versus placebo while completing a 6-week ecological momentary assessment study. Time-varying effect modeling (TVEM) examined within- and between-person associations between sleep and cannabis use and how the strength of within-person associations varied over the course of treatment. TVEM resvealed that, between-participants, youth with longer average sleep duration used cannabis less often controlling for baseline cannabis use, topiramate, and weekend status. Daily within-person fluctuations in sleep duration and trouble were not associated with use. Findings suggest regularly shorter sleep may impede treatment outcomes. Adolescents who regularly have insufficient sleep durations likely need additional intervention to improve sleep difficulties in tandem with cannabis use reduction. "
169,35316689,"Mood, sleep and pain problems are common comorbidities among treatment-seeking cannabis-dependent patients. There is limited evidence suggesting treatment for cannabis dependence is associated with their improvement. This study explored the impact of cannabis dependence treatment on these comorbidities. This is a secondary analysis from a 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled trial testing the efficacy of a cannabis agonist (nabiximols) against placebo in reducing illicit cannabis use in 128 cannabis-dependent participants. Outcome measurements including DASS-21 (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress subscales); Insomnia Severity Index (ISI); and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), were performed at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12 and 24. Each was analysed as continuous outcomes and as binary cases based on validated clinical cut-offs. Among those whose DASS and ISI scores were in the moderate to severe range at baseline, after controlling for cannabis use, there was a gradual decrease in severity of symptoms over the course of the trial. BPI decreased significantly until week 12 and then rose again in the post-treatment period during weeks 12-24. Neither pharmacotherapy type (nabiximols vs placebo) nor number of counselling sessions contributed significant explanatory power to any of the models and were excluded from the final analyses for both continuous and categorical outcomes. Participants in this trial who qualified as cases at baseline had elevated comorbidity symptoms. There was no evidence that nabiximols treatment is a barrier to achieving reductions in the comorbid symptoms examined. Cannabis dependence treatment reduced illicit cannabis use and improved comorbidity symptoms, even when complete abstinence was not achieved. "

171,35609230,"The Cannabis Consultation Service (CCS) is an innovative pharmacist-led resource at the Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Centre. Its mandate is to provide education and guide patients through access and appropriate use of high-quality plant-derived cannabinoids (PDCs). Our objective was to describe the CCS, explain its processes, and characterize patient disposition with respect to use of PDCs. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients referred to the CCS from July 13, 2020, to March 05, 2021. We used descriptive statistics to report on the patient population and service metrics. During the 34-week period, 96 patients accessed the CCS (median age, 61 years). The top reasons for CCS consultation were management of cancer pain, insomnia, and general interest. Medical cannabis was supported as an option in 44/96 patients. Reasons for not supporting PDC use included lack of indication, potential drug interaction/contraindication, or requiring treatment with first-line therapy. Of the 40 patients requiring a medical document, 22 initiated therapy. The most common product used was a 2:50 THC:CBD (Tetrahydrocannabinol:Cannabidiol) cannabis oil. At the date of last contact, few patients remained on therapy because of lack of benefit, patient choice, and/or hesitancy. Despite patients with cancer having interest in seeking PDCs for symptom management, only a few initiated and continued therapy. Pharmacists have an opportunity to advise patients and the oncology team on the risks and benefits of PDCs. These results can be used to support the development of medical cannabis programs by oncology centers and focus future research priorities. "

We sought to explore how different intentions for cannabis use relate to social, structural, and behavioural factors among PWUD in Vancouver, Canada. We used data from cannabis-using participants in two community-recruited prospective cohort studies of PWUD. Using latent class analysis, we identified discrete cannabis-using groups based on self-reported intentions for use. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine correlates of class membership. Between June 2016 and December 2018, 2,686 observations from 897 participants cannabis-using PWUD were analyzed. Four latent classes of cannabis use emerged: Class 1 (31.6%), characterized by non-medical purposes; Class 2 (37.5%), characterized by non-pain therapeutic use (e.g., stress, nausea/loss of appetite, and insomnia); characterized by Class 3 (21.9%) predominantly pain relief; and Class 4 (9.0%), characterized by a wide range of therapeutic uses in addition to pain management, including insomnia, stress, nausea/loss of appetite, and harm reduction. Class-specific structural, substance-, and health-related differences were observed, including indicators of better physical and mental health among the ""recreational"" class, despite evidence of more structural vulnerabilities (e.g., homelessness, incarceration). Our findings demonstrate a wide spectrum of motivations for cannabis use among PWUD. We observed important health-related differences between latent classes, demonstrating possible unmet healthcare needs among PWUD reporting therapeutic cannabis use. These findings inform ongoing policy surrounding access to cannabis for harm reduction purposes and applications of medical cannabis for PWUD. "

175,27074158,"Cannabis has been shown to affect sleep in humans. Findings from animal studies indicate that higher endocannabinoid levels promote sleep, suggesting that chronic use of cannabis, which downregulates endocannabinoid activity, may disrupt sleep. This study sought to determine if past-year cannabis use and genes that regulate endocannabinoid signaling, FAAH rs324420 and CNR1 rs2180619, predicted sleep quality. As depression has been previously associated with both cannabis and sleep, the secondary aim was to determine if depressive symptoms moderated or mediated these relationships. Data were collected from 41 emerging adult (ages 18-25) cannabis users. Exclusion criteria included Axis I disorders (besides SUD) and medical and neurologic disorders. Relationships were tested using multiple regressions, controlling for demographic variables, past-year substance use, and length of cannabis abstinence. Greater past-year cannabis use and FAAH C/C genotype were associated with poorer sleep quality. CNR1 genotype did not significantly predict sleep quality. Depressive symptoms moderated the relationship between cannabis use and sleep at a nonsignificant trend level, such that participants with the higher cannabis use and depressive symptoms reported the more impaired sleep. Depressive symptoms mediated the relationship between FAAH genotype and sleep quality. This study demonstrates a dose-dependent relationship between chronic cannabis use and reported sleep quality, independent of abstinence length. Furthermore, it provides novel evidence that depressive symptoms mediate the relationship between FAAH genotype and sleep quality in humans. These findings suggest potential targets to impact sleep disruptions in cannabis users. "
176,24613633,"Cannabis causes lower mortality and morbidity than alcohol and tobacco so it is clinically important if quitting cannabis is associated with substitution with these substances. This study tests if cannabis is substituted with alcohol and/or tobacco during cannabis abstinence, and factors predicting such substitution. A secondary analysis of a prospective community based study quantified cannabis, alcohol and tobacco use with Timeline Follow-back during a two-week voluntary cannabis abstinence and at one-month follow-up in non-treatment seeking cannabis users (n=45). Cannabis use was verified by urine THC-COOH levels. Alcohol use increased by 8 standard units (SU; d=0.48)/week and cigarette use by 14 cigarettes/week (d=0.29) during cannabis abstinence. Those using less of each substance at baseline had greater increases during cannabis abstinence (alcohol P<0.0001, tobacco P=0.01). There was a decrease in alcohol (-4.8 SU, d=-0.29) and tobacco (-13 cigarettes/week, d=-0.26) use at follow-up, when most participants (87%, n=39) had resumed cannabis use. Increased cigarette use was predicted by cannabis withdrawal related sleep difficulty (insomnia) (P=0.05), restlessness (P=0.03) and physical symptoms (P=0.02). Neither alcohol nor cigarette use increased significantly in those (13.3%, n=6) who remained abstinent from cannabis through to follow-up. Abstaining from cannabis was associated with increases in alcohol and tobacco use that decreased with resumption of cannabis use; however there were no increases in individuals who remained abstinent from cannabis at one-month follow-up. Tobacco use did not increase in those experiencing milder cannabis withdrawal symptoms. Research on substitution in treatment seekers during outpatient cannabis abstinence is needed. "
177,26195653,"Published evidence regarding the use of cannabis and cannabis derivatives by military veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is reviewed. When inhaled or delivered orally or transdermally, cannabinoids (the psychoactive components of unrefined marijuana and various derivative products) activate endogenous cannabinoid receptors, modulating neurotransmitter release and producing a wide range of central nervous system effects, including increased pleasure and alteration of memory processes. Those effects provide a pharmacologic rationale for the use of cannabinoids to manage the three core PTSD symptom clusters: reexperiencing, avoidance and numbing, and hyperarousal. A literature search identified 11 articles pertaining to cannabis use by military veterans who met standard diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Cross-sectional studies have found a direct correlation between more severe PTSD symptomatology and increased motivation to use cannabis for coping purposes, especially among patients with difficulties in emotional regulation or stress tolerance. Data from 4 small studies suggested that cannabinoid use was associated with global improvements in PTSD symptoms or amelioration of specific PTSD symptoms such as insomnia and nightmares. Large well-designed controlled trials are needed in order to better delineate the potential role of cannabinoids as an adjunct or alternative to conventional approaches to PTSD management. While further research into cannabinoid treatment effects on PTSD symptoms is required, the evaluated evidence indicates that substantial numbers of military veterans with PTSD use cannabis or derivative products to control PTSD symptoms, with some patients reporting benefits in terms of reduced anxiety and insomnia and improved coping ability.

178,39551707,"An innovative New South Wales government funded statewide Cannabis Medicines Advisory Service (CMAS) operated between January 2018 and June 2022. The service provided comprehensive patient-specific and evidence-based information to support health professionals in prescribing and patient care decisions. This study aimed to describe real-world data collected by CMAS. A sub-set of de-identified, patient-specific enquiries collected between January 2021 and June 2022 (n = 123/567; 21.7%) were analyzed using R version 4.2.1. Diagnosis, indication, and comorbidities were coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. Most patient-specific enquiries from medical practitioners were from general practitioners (n = 103/123; 83.7%). Female (n = 53/123; 43.1%) and male (n = 59/123; 48.0%) patients were similarly represented. Sex was not specified for 8.9% (n = 11/123) of patients. The mean age of patients was 52.1 years (range <10-90). The most common three diagnoses were osteoarthritis, anxiety, and chronic pain. Indications that were most frequently reported included chronic pain, anxiety, back pain, non-neuropathic pain, and insomnia. Comedications were most commonly non-opioid and opioid analgesics and antidepressants. Most practitioners were considering prescribing a cannabidiol (CBD) product for their patient. Cannabinoid composition selection guidance provided by CMAS was predominantly (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) THC:CBD ~1:1, followed by CBD-only products. CMAS was contacted by health professionals regarding the management of potential adverse events for five patients. The findings of this study shed light on the information medical practitioners were seeking to inform their clinical decision-making about medical cannabis and can inform the development of clinical guidance resources.

179,31997499,"Insomnia symptoms have been linked to problematic marijuana use among young adults, but the mechanism underlying this association and whether sex differences exist, remains unclear. Using cross-sectional data, this study examined negative mood as a mediator of the association between insomnia and marijuana problems among male and female college students. Undergraduate students (n = 267; 61% female) reporting marijuana use in the past month completed an online survey assessing insomnia symptoms, negative mood and marijuana problems. Controlling for relevant covariates, negative mood was examined as a mediator of the association between insomnia and marijuana problems using bootstrapped significance tests for indirect effects (n-boot = 1,000). Results indicated that higher levels of insomnia were associated with greater levels of negative mood (regardless of sex), which in turn were associated with greater marijuana-related problems. In conclusion, insomnia symptoms are associated with more negative mood among college students who use marijuana, and this effect on negative mood accounts for a large part of the association of insomnia symptoms with marijuana-related problems. Research is needed to determine if these associations are maintained prospectively. "
180,36529730,"Medicinal cannabis (MC) products have been available on prescription in Australia for around six years. General practitioners (GPs) are at the forefront of MC prescribing and recent years have seen substantial increases in prescription numbers. This study examined the current knowledge, experiences, and attitudes of Australian GPs around MC. We also compared our findings to those of an earlier 2017 investigation. We conducted a cross-sectional study using a 42-item on-line questionnaire adapted from our earlier 2017 survey. The current survey was completed by GPs attending an on-line, multi-topic educational seminar. Australian GPs (n = 505) completed the survey between November 2021 and February 2022. Data were synthesised using descriptive statistics. MC 'prescribers' and 'non-prescribers' responses were compared using Pearson's χ2 tests. While most GPs (85.3%) had received patient enquiries about MC during the last three months, only half (52.3%) felt comfortable discussing MC with patients. Around one fifth (21.8%) had prescribed a MC product. GPs strongly supported MC prescribing for palliative care, cancer pain, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and epilepsy, more so than in our 2017 survey. Prescribing for mental health conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety) and insomnia received less support. Opioids, benzodiazepines, and chemotherapy drugs were rated as more hazardous than MC. GPs correctly endorsed concerns around Δ Acceptance of MC as a treatment option has increased among Australian GPs since 2017. However, there is a clear need for improved training and education of GPs around cannabis-based medicines to provide increased numbers of skilled prescribers in the community. "

182,35585574,"There is a lack of evidence on healthcare professionals' attitudes, knowledge, and beliefs about medical cannabis in Cyprus and across the world. Therefore, the present study aimed to explore the attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge about MC use among nurses and midwives in Cyprus. Special focus was given to differences across gender, age, religion, marital status, and years of work experience. A descriptive, cross-sectional correlational study with internal comparisons was conducted during the 26 The final sample population consisted of 232 nurses and midwives (response rate of 46.4%). In total, 67(28.9%) participants were male, and 165(71.1%) were female. Cypriot nurses and midwives reported lack of knowledge regarding the risks and benefits about MC use to patients. However, specific number of participants believed MC use was considered acceptable for the patients with persistent muscle spasms, insomnia/sleeping disorders, mental health conditions, and terminal illnesses. The vast majority of the participants believed that formal training on MC should be integrated into academic programs, and expressed the necessity of urgent training under the current curriculum, as well as, educational training programs about MC use should be integrated into the practice/clinical practice. Concerning the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants, gender had a statistically significant positive effect on participants' attitudes and beliefs about MC (p < 0.01, 26.8% vs. 13.4%). Male and unmarried participants reported higher frequency about cannabis use for recreational purposes, compared with female group (p < 0.01, 22.8%Vs 11.4%). Unmarried participants agreed that using cannabis might develop serious mental health risks compared with married participants group (p < 0.05, 77.9% vs. 66.8%). The conclusions seem to be rather recommending in favor of MC use. Participants proposed enriching nursing curricula with theoretical and clinical/laboratory courses about MC during studies and clinical practice. Additional tailoring interventions should be established to decrease recreational cannabis use among Cypriot nurses and midwives. "
183,31488752,"Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and its precursor gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) are popular drugs of abuse used for their euphoric, (potential) anabolic, sedative, and amnestic properties. Daily use of GHB/GBL can lead to addiction and the possibility of withdrawal syndrome on cessation which results in tremor, tachycardia, insomnia, anxiety, hypertension, delirium, coma. To describe the baseline characteristics, treatment and retention in patients admitted for GHB/GBL withdrawal management. A retrospective review of 4 consecutive cases of patients reporting GHB/GBL addiction who were admitted for inpatient management of withdrawal syndrome. All patients were using GHB/GBL daily, 1-1.5 ml per hour. One of them was using cannabis additionally, others were using alcohol, cocaine and amphetamine type stimulants. Psychiatric comorbidities as personality disorders, depression, anxiety and bigorexia were recognized. Patients were treated with benzodiazepines and/or clomethiazole, atypical and typical antipsychotics and beta-blockers. Delirium was developed in two patients. One patient completed detoxification and finished the treatment program. One patient completed detoxification but stopped his treatment earlier, two patients did not completed detoxification and left the program. GHB/GBL withdrawal can be severe and retention in program is poor. Polysubstance use, psychiatric co-morbidities and heavier GHB/GBL use as possible predictors of poor treatment outcome need consideration in treatment planning. "

185,17101054,"Cannabis, in herbal form, is widely used as self-medication by patients with diseases such as HIV/AIDS and multiple sclerosis suffering from symptoms including pain, muscle spasticity, stress and insomnia. Valid clinical studies of herbal cannabis require a product which is acceptable to patients in order to maximize adherence to study protocols. We conducted a randomized controlled crossover trial of 4 different herbal cannabis preparations among 8 experienced and authorized cannabis users with chronic pain. Preparations were varied with respect to grind size, THC content and humidity. Subjects received each preparation on a separate day and prepared the drug in their usual way in a dedicated and licensed clinical facility. They were asked to evaluate the products based on appearance (smell, colour, humidity, grind size, ease of preparation and overall appearance) and smoking characteristics (burn rate, hotness, harshness and taste). Five-point Likert scores were assigned to each characteristic. Scores were compared between preparations using ANOVA. Seven subjects completed the study, and the product with highest THC content (12%), highest humidity (14%) and largest grind size (10 mm) was rated highest overall. Significant differences were noted between preparations on overall appearance and colour (p = 0.003). While the small size of the study precludes broad conclusions, the study shows that medical cannabis users can appreciate differences in herbal product. A more acceptable cannabis product may increase recruitment and retention in clinical studies of medical cannabis. "

187,30383388,"There is a rapidly evolving legal and medical culture around cannabis, with corresponding changes in the demographics of users. For instance, the percentage of the aging population accessing cannabis is growing substantially, outpacing other age groups. The goals of this study were to describe the acute effects of cannabis, subjective experiences of withdrawal, and beliefs around the addictiveness of cannabis, as well as to determine whether these effects differ as a function of age or reason for use (medical vs. recreational use). It was hypothesized that medical users and younger users would report fewer adverse effects. Survey responses from 2905 cannabis users were analyzed. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses were used to compare group percentages after statistically controlling for confounding differences in their demographic and cannabis use characteristics. The most commonly endorsed acute effects were improved sleep, more calm/peaceful, desire to eat, more creative, and dry mouth; while the most commonly endorsed withdrawal symptoms were irritability, insomnia, and anxiety. Relative to recreational users, medical users were less likely to report undesirable acute effects but were more likely to report undesirable withdrawal symptoms. Older (50+) individuals reported fewer undesirable acute effects and withdrawal symptoms compared with younger users (18-29). Only 17% of the total sample reported believing that cannabis is addictive, and this did not vary as a function of reason for use. Older people and medical users appear to experience acute and withdrawal effects of cannabis differently than recreational and younger users, perhaps because these groups benefit more from the medicinal properties of cannabis. These data can provide descriptive information to help inform health care providers and potential consumers about effects of cannabis use. "
188,33970291,"The therapeutic potential of medical cannabis to treat a variety of conditions is becoming increasingly recognised. Globally, a large number of countries have now legalised cannabis for medical uses and a substantial number of patients are able to access their medications. Yet in the UK, where medical cannabis was legalised in November 2018, only a handful of NHS prescriptions have been written, meaning that most patients are unable to access the medicine. Reasons for this are manyfold and include the perceived lack of clinical evidence due to the challenges of studying medical cannabis through randomised controlled trials. In order to develop the current evidence base, the importance of incorporating real-world data (RWD) to assess the effectiveness and efficacy of medical cannabis has gradually become recognised. The current paper provides a detailed outline of Project Twenty21 (T21), the UK's first medical cannabis registry, launched in August 2020. We provide the rationale for T21 and describe the methodology before reporting the characteristics of the 'first patients' enrolled in the registry. We describe the health status of all patients enrolled into the project during its first 7 months of operation and the sociodemographic characteristics and primary presenting conditions for these patients, as well as details of the medical cannabis prescribed to these individuals. By 12th March 2021, 678 people had been enrolled into T21; the majority (64%) were male and their average age was 38.7 years (range = 18-80). The most commonly reported primary conditions were chronic pain (55.6%) and anxiety disorders (32.0%) and they reported high levels of multi-morbidity, including high rates of insomnia and depression. We also present preliminary evidence from 75 patients followed up after 3 months indicating that receipt of legal, prescribed cannabis was associated with a significant increase in self-reported health, assessed using the visual analogue scale of the EQ-5D-5L (Cohen's d = .77, 95% CI = .51-1.03). Our initial findings complement reports from other large-scale databases globally, indicating that the current RWD is building up a pattern of evidence. With many clinicians demanding better and faster evidence to inform their decisions around prescribing medical cannabis, the current and future results of T21 will expand the existing evidence base on the effectiveness of cannabis-based medical products (CBMPs).

189,39108243,"This study characterizes patient and health-care professional perspectives regarding medical cannabis use at a National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Center. Data evaluated included the prevalence and patterns of and reasons for cannabis use. Patients with cancer undergoing treatment were recruited into a cross-sectional survey as part of a national National Cancer Institute-funded effort. Participants completed a survey about cannabis use, reasons for use, and types of cannabis. A health-care professional survey was also conducted to explore perspectives regarding patients' use of cannabis. A total of 313 patients with cancer (mean [SD] age = 60.7 [12.8] years) completed the survey (43% response rate) between 2021 and 2022. Of the respondents, 58% were female; identified as White (61%) and Black (23%); and had diverse cancer diagnoses. Nearly half of respondents (43%) had previously used cannabis, one-quarter (26%) had used cannabis since their cancer diagnosis, and almost 1 in 6 (17%) were actively using cannabis at the time of survey completion. The most common modes of ingestion were gummies (33%) and smoking (30%). The most commonly reported reasons for use were insomnia (46%), pain (41%), and mood (39%). For the 164 health-care professionals who completed the survey (25% response rate), the majority agreed that cannabis use (72%) is safe and beneficial for patients (57%). Four in 10 (39%) health-care professionals felt comfortable providing guidance to patients about cannabis use; however, only 1 in 8 (13%) felt knowledgeable about the topic of cannabis. Approximately one-sixth of patients with cancer receiving treatment actively use cannabis for management of various cancer symptoms. Perceptions about cannabis use and education varied widely among health-care professionals. "

191,24724880,"Chronic, frequent cannabis smokers may experience residual and offset effects, withdrawal, and craving when abstaining from the drug. We characterized the prevalence, duration, and intensity of these effects in chronic frequent cannabis smokers during abstinence on a closed research unit. Non-treatment-seeking participants (N = 29 on admission, 66% and 34% remaining after 2 and 4 weeks) provided subjective effects data. A battery of five instruments was computer-administered daily to measure psychological, sensory, and physical symptoms associated with cannabinoid intoxication and withdrawal. Plasma and oral fluid specimens were concurrently collected and analyzed for cannabinoids. Outcome variables were evaluated as change from admission (Day 0) with regression models. Most abstinence effects, including irritability and anxiety were greatest on Days 0-3 and decreased thereafter. Cannabis craving significantly decreased over time, whereas decreased appetite began to normalize on Day 4. Strange dreams and difficulty getting to sleep increased over time, suggesting intrinsic sleep problems in chronic cannabis smokers. Symptoms likely induced by residual drug effects were at maximum intensity on admission and positively correlated with plasma and oral fluid cannabinoid concentrations on admission but not afterward; these symptoms showed overall prevalence higher than cannabis withdrawal symptoms. The combined influence of residual/offset drug effects, withdrawal, and craving was observed in chronic cannabis smokers during monitored abstinence. Abstinence symptoms were generally more intense in the initial phase, implying importance of early intervention in cannabis quit attempts. Sleep disturbance persisting for an extended period suggests that hypnotic medications could be beneficial in treating cannabis dependence. "

We aimed to assess overall health-related quality of life (HRQL), pain, fatigue, sleep, anxiety, and depression in a large real-world sample of patients accessing prescribed medicinal cannabis. We hypothesized that all patient-reported outcomes (PROs) would improve from baseline to 3-months. The QUEST Initiative is a large prospective multicenter study of patients with any chronic health condition newly prescribed medicinal cannabis between November 2020 and December 2021. Eligible patients were identified by 120 clinicians at medical centers across six Australian states. Consenting participants completed the EuroQol Group EQ-5D-5L health status questionnaire; European Organization for Research & Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaire (QLQ-C30); Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Short Forms in Fatigue and Sleep Disturbance, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) before starting therapy, at 2-weeks titration, then monthly for 3-months. Of the 2762 consenting participants, 2327 completed baseline and at least one follow-up questionnaire. Ages ranged between 18-97 years (mean 51y; SD = 15.4), 62.8% were female. The most commonly treated conditions were chronic pain (n = 1598/2327; 68.7%), insomnia (n = 534/2327; 22.9%), generalized anxiety (n = 508/2327; 21.5%), and mixed anxiety and depression (n = 259/2327; 11%).

196,20434169,"It is clinically and theoretically plausible that insomnia contributes to the development and maintenance of paranoid fears. The primary aim of the study was to establish in a large sample whether insomnia and paranoia are associated more strongly than by chance. Cross-sectional data on paranoia, insomnia, anxiety, worry, depression, irritability, and cannabis use were obtained from the second British National Survey of Psychiatric Morbidity, a general population survey of adults aged 16-74 years living in Great Britain (N = 8580). It was found that insomnia was associated with an approximately two to threefold increase in paranoid thinking. Paranoia and insomnia were both strongly associated with the presence of anxiety, worry, depression, irritability and cannabis use. In a path analysis the association of paranoia and insomnia was partially explained by the affective symptoms, and, to a much lesser degree, cannabis use. The results are consistent with recent developments in the cognitive understanding of persecutory delusions, in which insomnia, negative affect, and substance use are identified as key factors. Longitudinal studies of insomnia and paranoia, and tests of the effects of sleep interventions on levels of paranoia, are now required to examine causality. "

Species effects were compared regarding health symptoms, conditions, purpose, route, and trust in product label. Trust in the purity, the route of administration, or the purpose (recreational vs. medicinal) did not differ between the two species. A preference for C. indica was statistically significant for pain management (p=0.001), helping with sedation (p=0.015), and sleep (p<0.001). C. sativa was preferred for euphoria (p<0.001) and enhancing energy (p=0.022).

For C. sativa, no conditions reached significance. The MC websites' descriptions of effects that agreed with the survey results are listed. Some conditions had very few respondents. The internal consistency/reliability (Cronbach α) was adequate for the condition scale but not for the symptom survey. In this anonymous Web survey, which had limitations, the two species had different effect associations on symptoms and conditions, possibly because of ingredient differences. Future surveys and subsequent prospective definitive trials are needed to confirm the findings. "
198,6271820,"Psychoactive drugs are often widely used before tolerance and dependence is fully appreciated. Tolerance to cannabis-induced cardiovascular and autonomic changes, decreased intraocular pressure, sleep and sleep EEG, mood and behavioral changes is acquired and, to a great degree, lost rapidly with optimal conditions. Mechanisms appear more functional than metabolic. Acquisition rate depends on dose and dose schedule. Dependence, manifested by withdrawal symptoms after as little as 7 days of THC administration, is characterized by irritability, restlessness, insomnia, anorexia, nausea, sweating, salivation, increased body temperature, altered sleep and waking EEG, tremor, and weight loss. Mild and transient in the 120 subjects studied, the syndrome was similar to sedative drug withdrawal. Tolerance to drug side effects can be useful. Tolerance to therapeutic effects or target symptoms poses problems. Clinical significance of dependence is difficult to assess since drug-seeking behavior has many determinants. Cannabis-induced super sensitivity should be considered wherever chronic drug administration is anticipated in conditions like epilepsy, glaucoma or chronic pain. Cannabis pharmacology suggests ways of minimizing tolerance and dependence problems. "
