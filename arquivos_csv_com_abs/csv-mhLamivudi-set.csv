0,26962941,"Lentiviruses have a long-documented association with macrophages. Abundant evidence exists for in vitro and, in a tissue-specific manner, in vivo infection of macrophages by the primate lentiviruses HIV-1 and SIV. However, macrophage contribution to aspects of HIV-1 and SIV pathogenesis, and their role in viral persistence in individuals on suppressive antiretroviral therapy, remains unclear. Here we discuss recent evidence implicating macrophages in HIV-1-mediated disease and highlight directions for further investigation. "

2,22415473,"A substantial proportion of HIV-1 infected individuals in sub-Saharan Africa are in stable relationships with HIV-1 uninfected partners, and HIV-1 serodiscordant couples thus represent an important target population for HIV-1 prevention. Couple-based HIV-1 testing and counseling facilitates identification of HIV-1 serodiscordant couples, counseling about risk reduction, and referrals to HIV-1 treatment, reproductive health services, and support services. Maximizing HIV-1 prevention for HIV-1 serodiscordant couples requires a combination of strategies, including counseling about condoms, sexual risk, fertility, contraception, and the clinical and prevention benefits of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the HIV-1-infected partner; provision of clinical care and ART for the HIV-1-infected partner; antenatal care and services to prevent mother-to-child transmission for HIV-1-infected pregnant women; male circumcision for HIV-1-uninfected men; and, pending guidelines and demonstration projects, oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV-1-uninfected partners.

3,26613994,"Behavioral disorders are common in persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The differential includes preexisting psychiatric diseases, substance abuse, direct effects of HIV infection, opportunistic infection, and the adverse effects of medical therapies. Many patients have more than one contributing or comorbid problem to explain these behavioral changes. The differential should always include consideration of psychosocial, genetic, and medical causes of disease. Treatment strategies must take into account the coadministration of antiretroviral therapy and the specific neurologic problems common in patients infected with HIV. "
4,27447446,"HIV has a very limited species tropism that prevents the use of most conventional small animal models for AIDS research. The in vivo analysis of HIV/AIDS has benefited extensively from novel chimeric animal models that accurately recapitulate key aspects of the human condition. Specifically, immunodeficient mice that are systemically repopulated with human hematolymphoid cells offer a viable alternative for the study of a multitude of highly relevant aspects of HIV replication, pathogenesis, therapy, transmission, prevention, and eradication. This article summarizes some of the multiple contributions that humanized mouse models of HIV infection have made to the field of AIDS research. These models have proven to be highly informative and hold great potential for accelerating multiple aspects of HIV research in the future. "
5,25304006,"Optimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is central to achieving viral suppression and positive health outcomes in HIV-infected individuals. Virally suppressed individuals can also reduce the risk of HIV transmission to uninfected partners. Hence, adherence to ART has become both an HIV treatment and an HIV prevention strategy. However, achieving optimal ART adherence can be challenging, especially over the long term. It is increasingly important for clinicians and researchers to be abreast of the most recent developments in the field as new biomedical approaches to treatment emerge and as guidelines for the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are disseminated to providers serving HIV affected populations. Several reviews have described numerous ART adherence interventions that have been developed and/or tested with the most recent review including literature up to 2012. To augment the literature, we present a review of ART adherence interventions from 2013 to the present. We included peer-reviewed journals as well as abstracts from two key conferences. "
6,37952550,"Injectable cabotegravir was superior to daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine for HIV prevention in two clinical trials. Both trials had the primary aim of establishing the HIV prevention efficacy of long-acting injectable cabotegravir pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) compared with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine daily oral PrEP. Long-acting PrEP was associated with diagnostic delays and integrase strand-transfer inhibitor (INSTI) resistance. This report presents findings from the first unblinded year of the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 083 study. The HPTN 083 randomised controlled trial enrolled HIV-uninfected cisgender men and transgender women at elevated HIV risk who have sex with men, from 43 clinical research sites in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the USA. Inclusion criteria included: a negative HIV serological test at the screening and study entry, undetectable HIV RNA levels within 14 days of study entry, age 18 years or older, overall good health as determined by clinical and laboratory evaluations, and a creatinine clearance of 60 mL/min or higher. Participants were randomly allocated to receive long-acting injectable cabotegravir or daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine PrEP. After study unblinding, participants remained on their original regimen awaiting an extension study. HIV infections were characterised retrospectively at a central laboratory. Here we report the secondary analysis of efficacy and safety for the first unblinded year. The primary outcome was incident HIV infection. Efficacy analyses were done on the modified intention-to-treat population using a Cox regression model. Adverse events were compared across treatment groups and time periods (blinded vs unblinded). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02720094. Of the 4488 participants who contributed person-time to the blinded analysis, 3290 contributed person-time to the first unblinded year analysis between May 15, 2020, and May 14, 2021. Updated HIV incidence in the blinded phase was 0·41 per 100 person-years for long-acting injectable cabotegravir PrEP and 1·29 per 100 person-years for daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine PrEP (hazard ratio [HR] 0·31 [95% CI 0·17-0·58], p=0·0003). HIV incidence in the first unblinded year was 0·82 per 100 person-years for long-acting PrEP and 2·27 per 100 person-years for daily oral PrEP (HR 0·35 [0·18-0·69], p=0·002). Adherence to both study products decreased after study unblinding. Additional infections in the long-acting PrEP group included two with on-time injections; three with one or more delayed injections; two detected with long-acting PrEP reinitiation; and 11 more than 6 months after their last injection. Infection within 6 months of cabotegravir exposure was associated with diagnostic delays and INSTI resistance. Adverse events were generally consistent with previous reports; incident hypertension in the long-acting PrEP group requires further investigation. Long-acting injectable cabotegravir PrEP retained high efficacy for HIV prevention in men and transgender women who have sex with men during the first year of open-label follow-up, with a near-identical HR for HIV risk reduction between long-acting injectable cabotegravir and daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine PrEP during the first year after unblinding compared with the blinded period. Extended follow-up further defined the risk period for diagnostic delays and emergence of INSTI resistance.

7,32992787,"Most myeloid lineage cells express the receptor and coreceptors that make them susceptible to infection by primate lentiviruses (SIVs and HIVs). However, macrophages are the only myeloid lineage cell commonly infected by SIVs and/or HIVs. The frequency of infected macrophages varies greatly across specific host and virus combinations as well as disease states, with infection rates being greatest in pathogenic SIV infections of non-natural hosts (i.e., Asian nonhuman primates (Asian NHPs)) and late in untreated HIV-1 infection. In contrast, macrophages from natural SIV hosts (i.e., African NHPs) are largely resistant to infection due to entry and/or post-entry restriction mechanisms. These highly variable rates of macrophage infection may stem from differences in the host immune environment, entry and post-entry restriction mechanisms, the ability of a virus to adapt to efficiently infect macrophages, and the pleiotropic effects of macrophage-tropism including the ability to infect cells lacking CD4 and increased neutralization sensitivity. Questions remain about the relationship between rates of macrophage infection and viral pathogenesis, with some evidence suggesting that elevated levels of macrophage infection may contribute to greater pathogenesis in non-natural SIV hosts. Alternatively, extensive infection of macrophages may only emerge in the context of high viral loads and immunodeficiency, making it a symptom of highly pathogenic infections, not a primary driver of pathogenesis.

8,28615975,"There are ~900,000 new HIV infections among women every year, representing nearly half of all new HIV infections globally. In the US, nearly one-fifth of all new HIV infections occur among women, and women from racial and ethnic minority communities experience disproportionately high rates of new HIV infections. Thus, there is a need to develop and implement effective HIV prevention strategies for women in the US and internationally, with a specific need to advance strategies in minority communities. Previous studies have demonstrated that oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), the use of antiretroviral medications by HIV-uninfected persons to prevent HIV acquisition, can reduce HIV incidence among women who are adherent to PrEP. However, to date, awareness and uptake of PrEP among women have been very limited, suggesting a need for innovative strategies to increase the knowledge of and access to PrEP among women in diverse settings. This narrative review summarizes the efficacy and safety data of PrEP in women, discusses considerations related to medication adherence for women who use PrEP, and highlights behavioral, social, and structural barriers to maximize the effectiveness of PrEP in women. It also reviews novel modalities for PrEP in women which are being developed and tested, including topical formulations and long-acting injectable agents that may offer advantages as compared to oral PrEP and proposes a community-oriented, social networking framework to increase awareness of PrEP among women. If women are provided with access to PrEP and support to overcome social and structural barriers to adhere to PrEP, this prevention strategy holds great promise to impact the HIV epidemic among women in the US and globally.

10,28886986,"Neuron-Glia crosstalk is essential for efficient synaptic communication, cell growth and differentiation, neuronal activity, neurotransmitter recycling, and brain immune response. The master regulators of this neuron-glia communication are connexin containing Gap Junctions (GJs) and Hemichannels (HCs) as well as pannexin HCs. However, the role of these channels under pathological conditions, especially in infectious diseases is still in exploratory stages. Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV) is one such infectious agent that takes advantage of the host intercellular communication systems, GJs and HCs, to exacerbate viral pathogenesis in the brain in spite of the antiretroviral therapy effectively controlling viral replication in the periphery. Although most infectious agents lead to total ""shutdown"" of gap junctional communication in parenchymal cells, HIV infection maintains and ""hijacks"" GJs and HCs to enable few infected cells to spread toxic intracellular agents to neighboring uninfected cells aggravating viral neuropathology even in the absence of viral replication. In this mini-review, we present a comprehensive overview of the role of GJs and HCs in augmenting HIV neuropathogenesis. "
11,23073703,"The efficacy of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been demonstrated in four clinical trials to date; however, the success of PrEP is largely dependent on high levels of medication adherence. Due to their extensive experience and expertise in medication adherence counseling, as well as their ability to monitor and manage medication adverse effects and drug-drug interactions, clinical pharmacists are well-equipped to play a key role in effective PrEP utilization. Here we discuss reasons favoring the establishment of a protocol-based, pharmacist-run PrEP clinic. "

13,33128874,Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective in reducing HIV transmission but remains underutilised globally. Same-day PrEP prescribing and medication provision is an emerging implementation approach. The experiences of the three same-day PrEP programmes support the feasibility of the approach. Key elements of safe and effective same-day PrEP programmes include the ability to order laboratory tests at the time of the clinical visit and the ability to contact patients when laboratory results are available. Same-day PrEP has the potential to alleviate the attrition seen in usual care between initial evaluation and receipt of a PrEP prescription. A widespread application of same-day prescribing will be needed to assess its effect on PrEP usage.

15,35126374,"Globally, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is a major health burden for which successful therapeutic options are still being investigated. Challenges facing current drugs that are part of the established life-long antiretroviral therapy (ART) include toxicity, development of drug resistant HIV-1 strains, the cost of treatment, and the inability to eradicate the provirus from infected cells. For these reasons, novel anti-HIV-1 therapeutics that can prevent or eliminate disease progression including the onset of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are needed. While development of HIV-1 vaccination has also been challenging, recent advancements demonstrate that infection of HIV-1-susceptible cells can be prevented in individuals living with HIV-1, by targeting C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5). CCR5 serves many functions in the human immune response and is a co-receptor utilized by HIV-1 for entry into immune cells. Therapeutics targeting CCR5 generally involve gene editing techniques including CRISPR, CCR5 blockade using antibodies or antagonists, or combinations of both. Here we review the efficacy of these approaches and discuss the potential of their use in the clinic as novel ART-independent therapies for HIV-1 infection. "
16,26103095,"Clinical trial data have shown that oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is efficacious when taken as prescribed; however, PrEP adherence is complex and must be understood within the context of variable risk for HIV infection and use of other HIV prevention methods. Different levels of adherence may be needed in different populations to achieve HIV prevention, and the optimal methods for achieving the necessary adherence for both individual and public health benefits are unknown. Guidance for PrEP use must consider these questions to determine the success of PrEP-based HIV prevention programs. In this article, we propose a new paradigm for understanding and measuring PrEP adherence, termed prevention-effective adherence, which incorporates dynamic HIV acquisition risk behaviors and the use of HIV alternative prevention strategies. We discuss the need for daily PrEP use only during periods of risk for HIV exposure, describe key issues for measuring and understanding relevant behaviors, review lessons from another health prevention field (i.e., family planning), and provide guidance for prevention-effective PrEP use. Moreover, we challenge emerging calls for sustained, near perfect PrEP adherence regardless of risk exposure and offer a more practical and public health-focused vision for this prevention intervention.

17,34452331,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and HIV-2 originated from cross-species transmission of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs). Most of these transfers resulted in limited spread of these viruses to humans.

18,37698802,"Medical mistrust is fueled by conspiracy theories and histories of healthcare systems abuse and is a known determinant of health outcomes in minority populations. Plagued by multiple and pervasive conspiracy theories, HIV/AIDS has proven to be particularly hampered by medical mistrust. The current paper systematically reviews the literature on medical mistrust among people at risk for or living with HIV infection. The bulk of evidence from 17 studies supports medical mistrust as a barrier to HIV testing, engagement in prevention and care services, treatment uptake and adherence, and clinical outcomes. While findings mostly indicate that medical mistrust is a barrier to HIV prevention and care, some studies report null results and others suggest that medical mistrust may actually improve some HIV-related outcomes. Additionally, most of the reviewed literature was cross-sectional. Thus longitudinal, theory-driven research is needed to reconcile inconsistent findings and determine long term outcomes of medical mistrust. Interventions may then be developed to reduce the negative consequences associated with medical mistrust. "

20,26793265,"Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) has shown high efficacy in preventing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among men who have sex with men (MSM) in several large clinical trials, and more recently in ""real world"" reports of clinical implementation and a PrEP demonstration project. Those studies also demonstrated high bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence and raised the discussion of how PrEP may impact STI control efforts, especially in the setting of increasing Neisseria gonorrhoeae antimicrobial resistance and the increase in syphilis cases among MSM. Here, we discuss STIs as a driver of HIV transmission risk among MSM, and the potential opportunities and challenges for STI control afforded by expanded PrEP implementation among high-risk MSM. "

22,31965523,"Based on the results of the IPERGAY study, on-demand HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP; also known as ""non-daily PrEP,"" ""event-driven PrEP,"" or ""2-1-1 PrEP"") is being requested more frequently by patients who have intermittent sexual risk or are unable/unwilling to take daily PrEP; therefore, clinicians will be increasingly required to familiarize themselves with its appropriate use. In this perspective, we summarize data related to on-demand PrEP, describe advantages and disadvantages for this alternative dosing strategy, and provide clinical counseling points. "
23,22156901,"Topical tenofovir gel and oral tenofovir and emtricitabine-tenofovir [FTC/tenofovir disoproxyl fumarate (TDF)] have been demonstrated to have efficacy in preventing HIV-1 in some populations. Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) trials and future directions are summarized. Pericoital use of 1% tenofovir gel in the CAPRISA 004 study reduced HIV-1 acquisition by 39% and herpes simplex virus-2 acquisition by 51%. Daily oral FTC/TDF demonstrated 44% reduction in HIV-1 acquisition among MSM in the iPrEx study (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Initiative). Both studies showed higher efficacy among those with higher adherence. Efficacy of daily oral TDF and FTC/TDF was 66 and 73%, respectively, among HIV-1-uninfected partners in an HIV-1 serodiscordant partnership in the Partners PrEP Study. Efficacy of daily oral FTC/TDF was 66% in young heterosexuals in Botswana in the TDF2 trial. The FEM-PrEP and VOICE (Vaginal and Oral Interventions to Control the Epidemic) studies in African women found no efficacy with oral FTC/TDF and TDF, respectively. Safety and tolerability were excellent and limited resistance was observed in seroconverters. Topical tenofovir gel showed efficacy in African women and daily oral TDF and FTC/TDF were efficacious in MSM, and African HIV-1 serodiscordant couples and young heterosexuals. The reasons for lack of efficacy of oral FTC/TDF and TDF in two studies in African women are being investigated. Longer-acting formulations, invtravaginal rings, and new candidate antiretrovirals are being evaluated for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). "
24,32221469,"Little is known about the potential population-level impact of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use among cisgender male sex workers (MSWs), a high-risk subset of cisgender men who have sex with men (MSM). Using an agent-based model, we simulated HIV transmission among cisgender MSM in Rhode Island to determine the impacts of PrEP implementation where cisgender MSWs were equally (""standard expansion"") or five times as likely (""focused expansion"") to initiate PrEP compared to other cisgender MSM. Without PrEP, the model predicted 920 new HIV infections over a decade, or an average incidence of 0.39 per 100 person-years. In a focused expansion scenario where 15% of at-risk cisgender MSM used PrEP, the total number of new HIV infections was reduced by 58.1% at a cost of $57,180 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Focused expansion of PrEP use among cisgender MSWs may be an efficient and cost-effective strategy for reducing HIV incidence in the broader population of cisgender MSM. "
25,23221365,"Antiretroviral-based HIV-1 prevention strategies - including antiretroviral treatment (ART) to reduce the infectiousness of individuals with HIV-1 and oral and topical pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for uninfected individuals to prevent HIV-1 acquisition - are the most promising new approaches for decreasing HIV-1 spread. Observational studies among HIV-1 serodiscordant couples have associated ART initiation with a reduction in HIV-1 transmission risk of 80-92%, and a recent randomized trial demonstrated that earlier initiation of ART (that is, at CD4(+) T-cell counts between 350 and 550 cells/mm(3)), in the context of virological monitoring and adherence support, resulted in a 96% reduction in HIV-1 transmission. A number of ongoing and recently-completed clinical trials have assessed the efficacy of PrEP for HIV-1 prevention as pericoitally administered or daily-administered 1% tenofovir gel and daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and combination emtricitabine (FTC)/TDF. Completed studies have demonstrated HIV-1 protection efficacies ranging from 39% to 75%. However, two trials in African women have shown no HIV-1 protection with TDF and FTC/TDF PrEP; the reasons for lack of efficacy in those trials are being investigated. Adherence is likely the key to efficacy of antiretrovirals for HIV-1 prevention, both as ART and PrEP. Critical unanswered questions for successful delivery of antiretroviral-based HIV-1 prevention include how to target ART and PrEP to realize maximum population benefits, whether HIV-1-infected individuals at earlier stages of infection would accept ART to reduce their risk for transmitting HIV-1 and whether highest-risk HIV-1-negative persons would use PrEP, and whether high adherence could be sustained to achieve high effectiveness. "
26,36973419,"The development of persistent cellular reservoirs of latent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a critical obstacle to viral eradication since viral rebound takes place once anti-retroviral therapy (ART) is interrupted. Previous studies show that HIV persists in myeloid cells (monocytes and macrophages) in blood and tissues in virologically suppressed people with HIV (vsPWH). However, how myeloid cells contribute to the size of the HIV reservoir and what impact they have on rebound after treatment interruption remain unclear. Here we report the development of a human monocyte-derived macrophage quantitative viral outgrowth assay (MDM-QVOA) and highly sensitive T cell detection assays to confirm purity. We assess the frequency of latent HIV in monocytes using this assay in a longitudinal cohort of vsPWH (n = 10, 100% male, ART duration 5-14 yr) and find half of the participants showed latent HIV in monocytes. In some participants, these reservoirs could be detected over several years. Additionally, we assessed HIV genomes in monocytes from 30 vsPWH (27% male, ART duration 5-22 yr) utilizing a myeloid-adapted intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA) and demonstrate that intact genomes were present in 40% of the participants and higher total HIV DNA correlated with reactivatable latent reservoirs. The virus produced in the MDM-QVOA was capable of infecting bystander cells resulting in viral spread. These findings provide further evidence that myeloid cells meet the definition of a clinically relevant HIV reservoir and emphasize that myeloid reservoirs should be included in efforts towards an HIV cure.

28,25216985,"Combination HIV prevention interventions that integrate efficacious behavioral and biomedical strategies offer the potential to reduce new HIV infections. We overview the efficacy data for three biomedical HIV prevention approaches, namely microbicides, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and HIV vaccination; review factors associated with differential acceptability and uptake of these methods; and suggest strategies to optimize the effectiveness and dissemination of combination HIV prevention approaches. A narrative review was conducted highlighting key efficacy data for microbicides, PrEP, and an HIV vaccination and summarizing acceptability data for each of the three biomedical HIV prevention approaches. Recommendations for the integration and dissemination of combined behavioral and biomedical HIV prevention approaches are provided. To date, microbicides and an HIV vaccination have demonstrated limited efficacy for the prevention of HIV. However, PrEP has demonstrated efficacy in reducing HIV incident infections. A diverse array of factors influences both hypothetical willingness and actual usage of each biomedical prevention method. Strategies to effectively integrate and evaluate combination HIV prevention interventions are urgently needed. "
29,32347446,"We review applications of artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning (ML), in the field of HIV prevention. ML approaches have been used to identify potential candidates for preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in healthcare settings in the USA and Denmark and in a population-based research setting in Eastern Africa. Although still in the proof-of-concept stage, other applications include ML with smartphone-collected and social media data to promote real-time HIV risk reduction, virtual reality tools to facilitate HIV serodisclosure, and chatbots for HIV education. ML has also been used for causal inference in HIV prevention studies. ML has strong potential to improve delivery of PrEP, with this approach moving from development to implementation. Development and evaluation of AI and ML strategies for HIV prevention may benefit from an implementation science approach, including qualitative assessments with end users, and should be developed and evaluated with attention to equity.

30,20679759,"HIV-serodiscordant couples face complicated choices between fulfilling reproductive desire and risking HIV transmission to their partners and children. Sexual HIV transmission can be dramatically reduced through artificial insemination and sperm washing; however, most couples cannot access these resources. We propose that periconception pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) could offer an important, complementary therapy to harm reduction counseling programs that aim to decrease HIV transmission for couples who choose to conceive. In this paper, we describe the potential benefits of periconception PrEP and define critical points of clarification prior to implementation of PrEP as part of a reproductive health program. We consider sexual transmission risk, current risk reduction options, PrEP efficacy, cost, adherence, resistance, fetal toxicity, and impact of PrEP counseling on entry into health services. We address PrEP in the context of other periconception HIV-prevention strategies, including antiretroviral treatment of the HIV-infected partner. We conclude that, should PrEP prove safe and efficacious in ongoing trials, periconception PrEP may offer a useful approach to minimize risk of HIV transmission for individuals of reproductive age in HIV-endemic countries.

31,18447615,"Central nervous system (CNS) human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection begins during primary viremia and continues throughout the course of untreated systemic infection. Although frequently accompanied by local inflammatory reactions detectable in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), CNS HIV-1 infection usually is not clinically apparent. In a minority of patients, CNS HIV-1 infection evolves into encephalitis during the late stages of systemic infection, which compromises brain function and presents clinically as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome dementia complex (ADC). Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has had a major impact on all aspects of CNS HIV-1 infection and disease. In those with asymptomatic infection, ART usually effectively suppresses HIV-1 in CSF and markedly reduces the incidence of symptomatic ADC. In those presenting with ADC, ART characteristically prevents neurological progression and leads to variable, and at times substantial, recovery. Similarly, treatment has reduced CNS opportunistic infections. With better control of these severe disorders, attention has turned to the possible consequences of chronic silent infection and the issue of whether indolent, low-grade brain injury might require earlier treatment intervention.

32,32105164,"Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may be an effective approach to prevent HIV among people who are currently incarcerated or who have been recently released from incarceration. However, awareness and interest in PrEP are largely unknown in this population. This study assessed 417 incarcerated men's lifetime HIV risk engagement and gauged their interest and willingness to take PrEP. Twenty percent reported ever injecting drugs and 4% ever having sex with a man without a condom; 88% had never heard of PrEP. More White men had heard of PrEP, but higher percentages of men of color were interested in learning more about PrEP and willing to take PrEP to prevent HIV. Future interventions should focus on PrEP education and uptake among individuals who are incarcerated. "
33,18780234,"The success of antiretroviral therapy has reduced the incidence of severe neurological complication resulting from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, increased patient survival has been associated with an increased prevalence of protracted forms of HIV encephalitis leading to moderate cognitive impairment. NeuroAIDS remains a great challenge to patients, their families, and our society. Thus development of preclinical models that will be suitable for testing promising new compounds with neurotrophic and neuroprotective capabilities is of critical importance. The simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected macaque is the premiere model to study HIV neuropathogenesis. This model was central to the seminal work of Dr. Opendra ""Bill"" Narayan. Similar to patients with HIV encephalitis, in the SIV model there is injury to the synaptodendritic structure of excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory calbindin-immunoreactive interneurons. This article, which is part of a special issue of the Journal of NeuroVirology in honor of Dr. Bill Narayan, discusses the most important neurodegenerative features in preclinical models of neuroAIDS and their potential for treatment development.

To date, literature synthesizing what is known about the impact of unhealthy alcohol use on the PrEP care continuum with a focus on considerations for primary care is lacking. We searched OVID Medline and Web of Science from inception through March 19, 2020, to examine the extent, range, and nature of research on PrEP delivery among individuals with unhealthy alcohol use in primary care settings. We identified barriers and opportunities at each step along the PrEP care continuum, including for specific populations: adolescents, people who inject drugs, sex workers, and transgender persons. Future research should focus on identification of candidate patients, opportunities for patient engagement in novel settings, PrEP implementation strategies, and stigma reduction. Indivíduos con dificultades con el uso del alcohol tienen un alto riesgo de contraer VIH y podrían beneficiarse de recibir profilaxis preexposición (PrEP) de VIH en centros de cuidado primario.

This article provides an overview of an array of efficient and effective designs across the translational spectrum that are utilized within the ATN. These designs maximize methodological rigor and real-world applicability of findings while minimizing resource use. Implementation science and cost-effectiveness methods are included.

36,28060019,"Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective HIV prevention strategy. There is little scientific consensus about how to measure PrEP program implementation progress. We draw on several years of experience in implementing PrEP programs and propose a PrEP continuum of care that includes: (1) identifying individuals at highest risk for contracting HIV, (2) increasing HIV risk awareness among those individuals, (3) enhancing PrEP awareness, (4) facilitating PrEP access, (5) linking to PrEP care, (6) prescribing PrEP, (7) initiating PrEP, (8) adhering to PrEP, and (9) retaining individuals in PrEP care. We also propose four distinct categories of PrEP retention in care that include being: (1) indicated for PrEP and retained in PrEP care, (2) indicated for PrEP and not retained in PrEP care, (3) no longer indicated for PrEP, and (4) lost to follow-up for PrEP care. This continuum of PrEP care creates a framework that researchers and practitioners can use to measure PrEP awareness, uptake, adherence, and retention. Understanding each point along the proposed continuum of PrEP care is critical for developing effective PrEP interventions and for measuring public health progress in PrEP program implementation. "

Relevant literature is reviewed which examines the relationships between HIV-associated neuropsychological impairment and employment, driving, medication adherence, mood, fatigue, and interpersonal functioning. Specifically, the relative contributions of medical, cognitive, psychosocial, and psychiatric issues on whether someone with HIV/AIDS will be able to return to work, adhere to a complicated medication regimen, or safely drive a vehicle will be discussed. Methodological issues that arise in the context of measuring medication adherence or driving capacity are also explored. Finally, the impact of HIV/AIDS on mood state, fatigue, and interpersonal relationships are addressed, with particular emphasis on how these variables interact with cognition and independent functioning. The purpose of this review is to integrate neuropsychological findings with their real world correlates of functional behavior in the HIV/AIDS population. "
38,34114166,"COVID-19 is a public health crisis that has fundamentally altered health care provision. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) care. We reviewed all patient records for those who presented for PrEP care at a PrEP program in Providence, Rhode Island from September 1st, 2019 to May 29th, 2020. The number of PrEP encounters decreased but was not significantly different over time (ps > .05). Patients were still able to access PrEP clinical services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Implementing flexible and timely PrEP delivery approaches in this setting likely minimized the disruption of PrEP care during COVID-19. COVID-19 es una crisis de salud pública que ha alterado fundamentalmente la prestación de servicios de salud. El propósito de este estudio fue examinar el impacto de COVID-19 en los servicios de la profilaxis preexposición (PrEP). Revisamos todos los registros de pacientes que se presentaron para recibir atención de PrEP en un programa de PrEP en Providence, Rhode Island desde el 1 de septiembre de 2019 hasta el 29 de mayo de 2020. El número de encuentros de PrEP disminuyó pero no fue significativamente diferente con el paso del tiempo (ps > .05). Los pacientes aún pudieron acceder a los servicios clínicos de PrEP durante la pandemia de COVID-19. La implementación de enfoques de entrega de PrEP que eran flexibles y oportunos en este entorno probablemente minimizó la interrupción de la atención médica de la PrEP durante COVID-19. "
39,29084044,"The use of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2012, but delivery to at-risk persons has lagged. This critical review analyzes the current state of PrEP implementation in the United States, by reviewing barriers and innovative solutions to enhance PrEP access and uptake. Clinical care settings, public health programs, and community-based organizations (CBOs). Critical review of recent peer-reviewed literature. More than 100 papers were reviewed. PrEP is currently provided in diverse settings. Care models include sexually transmitted disease clinics, community health centers, CBOs, pharmacies, and private primary care providers (PCPs). Sexually transmitted disease clinics have staff trained in sexual health counseling and are linked to public health programs (eg, partner notification services), whereas PCPs and community health centers may be less comfortable counseling and feel time-constrained in managing PrEP. However, PCPs may be ideal PrEP providers, given their long-term relationships with patients, integrating PrEP into routine care. Collaborations with CBOs can expand PrEP care through adherence support and insurance navigation. Pharmacies can deliver PrEP, given their experience with medication dispensing and counseling, and may be more accessible for some patients, but to address other health concerns, liaisons with PCPs may be needed. PrEP implementation in the United States is moving forward with the development of diverse models of delivery. Optimal scale-up will require learning about the best features of each model and providing choices to consumers that enhance engagement and uptake. "
40,35142705,"People with severe mental illness are 10 times more likely to have HIV/ AIDS than the general population, yet little is known about the characteristics and frequency of recognition of pre-existing HIV/AIDS diagnoses among inpatients with severe mental illness. This study examines documentation rates of pre-existing HIV/ AIDS among inpatients within psychiatric hospitals in New York State. Retrospective cohort study to examine recognition of pre-existing HIV/AIDS among psychiatric inpatients. Patient-level Medicaid claims records were linked with hospital and regional data for people admitted to psychiatric inpatient units in New York State. Presence of HIV/AIDS diagnoses prior to psychiatric hospitalization was coded for each inpatient (n = 14 602). Adjusted odds ratios of undocumented HIV/AIDS diagnoses at the time of discharge were calculated using logistic regression analyses. About 5.1% (741/14 602) of unique psychiatric inpatients had pre-existing HIV/AIDS diagnoses. Of these inpatients, 58.3% (432/741) were not coded as having HIV/AIDS upon discharge. Higher rates of missed detection were associated with younger age, non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity, shorter length of stay, more distal coding of an HIV/AIDS diagnosis, and fewer HIV/AIDS-related Medicaid claims in the past year. Hospitals with higher readmission rates also had higher rates of undetected HIV/AIDS diagnoses. Over half of inpatients previously diagnosed with HIV/AIDS did not have their HIV-positive status noted upon discharge from psychiatric hospitalization. This finding underscores how frequently clinically significant medical comorbidities fail to be incorporated into psychiatric treatment and treatment planning. Inpatient clinicians are missing important opportunities to optimize HIV/AIDS treatment and reduce morbidity and mortality. "
41,33575901,"For transgender (trans) women, community belonging may play an important role in shaping perceptions of HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP). A cluster analysis was performed using data obtained from a survey administered to 128 trans women residing in Philadelphia, PA and the San Francisco Bay area, CA. Six items assessing feelings of community belongingness among trans women produced three distinct clusters. Associations were examined between cluster membership and perceptual items including beliefs about PrEP, experiences with healthcare, patient self-advocacy, and perceived trusted sources for PrEP information. Clusters were demographically comparable apart from age. There were significant differences noted between trust in various communication channels and perceptions of PrEP; the least community-connected cluster had less trust and more negative perceptions of PrEP. Analyses suggest that psychographic differences exist based on perceived community belongingness in this population, and this in turn may be consequential in determining how information about PrEP is communicated and diffused to trans women for whom PrEP may be indicated.

43,26270691,"Reductions in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) incidence with pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for men who have sex with men (MSM) will require significant coverage of those at risk. We propose a simplified framework, similar to the HIV care continuum, to achieve protection with PrEP as follows: 1. At-risk MSM; 2. Awareness of and willingness to take PrEP; 3. Access to healthcare; 4. Receiving a prescription; and 5. Adhering to effective PrEP. We evaluated the PrEP care continuum on an Atlanta cohort of MSM and projected how many MSM might achieve protection from HIV. Even with optimistic estimates, few Atlanta MSM (15%) are projected to achieve protection from HIV with PrEP given the significant barriers described. Each continuum step represents an important point for intervention that could substantially increase the overall effectiveness of PrEP. In addition, novel strategies for PrEP delivery are needed to achieve the necessary effectiveness for Atlanta MSM at risk of HIV. "
44,31688333,"Long-acting HIV treatment and prevention (LAHTP) can address some of the achievement gaps of daily oral therapy to bring us closer to achieving Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS Fast-track goals. Implementing these new technologies presents individual-level, population-level, and health systems-level opportunities and challenges. To optimize LAHTP implementation and impact, decision-makers should define and gather relevant data to inform their investment case within the existing health systems context. Programmatic observations from scale-up of antiretroviral therapy, oral preexposure prophylaxis, voluntary medical male circumcision, and family planning offer lessons as planning begins for implementation of LAHTP. Additional data intelligence should be derived from formative studies, pragmatic clinical trials, epidemiologic and economic modeling of LAHTP. Key implementation issues that need to be addressed include optimal communication strategies for demand creation; target setting; logistics and supply chain of commodities needed for LAHTP delivery; human resource planning; defining and operationalizing monitoring and evaluating metrics; integration into health systems. Successful LAHTP implementation can bolster treatment and prevention coverage levels if implementation issues outlined above are proactively addressed in parallel with research and development so that health systems can more rapidly integrate new technologies as they gain regulatory approval.

45,21286833,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) often leads to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) prior to the progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). At the cellular level, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) provide a family of signal transducers that regulate many processes in response to extracellular stimuli and environmental stress, such as viral infection. Recently, evidence has accumulated suggesting that p38 MAPK plays crucial roles in various pathological processes associated with HIV infection, ranging from macrophage activation to neurotoxicity and impairment of neurogenesis to lymphocyte apoptosis. Thus, p38 MAPK, which has generally been linked to stress-related signal transduction, may be an important mediator in the development of AIDS and HAND. "

47,37249729,"Despite evidence that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) reduces HIV risk, initiation and adherence remain low among vulnerable communities. Motivational interviewing (MI) can improve HIV prevention behaviors. However, limited research identifies how MI impacts PrEP uptake and adherence. This scoping review examines essential components of MI-based interventions that aimed to improve PrEP use, including the number and duration of sessions, counselor characteristics, and interview content. We searched four databases, PubMed, CINAHL Plus, Embase, and Web of Science, and reviewed 379 articles. Studies were considered if they (a) were published between 2012 and 2023, (b) used MI independently or part of a multi-component intervention strategy, and (c) focused on improving PrEP initiation or adherence. Seven articles met inclusion criteria. Regarding intervention components, the number of MI sessions varied and duration ranged between 15 and 60 min. MI counselors varied in credentialing and demographic characteristics. MI content included PrEP education, identifying initiation and adherence barriers, and strategizing ways to overcome barriers. MI is an important component of interventions that aim to improve PrEP initiation and adherence. However, the variability and limited details across studies hinder our ability to assess MI efficacy on PrEP initiation and adherence or replicate these approaches in future interventions. "
48,2181001,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus Type-1 (HIV-1), the causative agent of AIDS, can be associated with central nervous system as well as immune system disease. Advanced AIDS can be complicated by a dementia. Short of frank dementia, many AIDS patients manifest neuropsychological (NP) impairment including disturbance in speeded information processing, abstraction, learning, and recall. Data conflict on whether medically asymptomatic HIV-1 carriers have subtle NP deficits. Variations in tests chosen, criterion specification, and sample selection may all be contributing to disparate results. Longitudinal research is needed, and this should examine representative samples of HIV-1 seropositive individuals for whom approximate date of seroconversion is known and in whom sources of comorbidity (e.g., drug abuse, concurrent infections, CNS injuries) can be specified. "
49,30114997,Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has the ability to curb HIV incidence worldwide and bring us closer to ending the HIV epidemic. Scale up of PrEP service delivery has many similar challenges to those faced by voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) services roll-out. This article outlines ten important lessons learned during the scale up of VMMC services in sub-Saharan Africa and their application to current oral PrEP implementation efforts to promote faster expansion for public health impact. 
50,36044375,"The HIV-1 often evades a robust antiretroviral-mediated immune response, leading to persistent infection within anatomically privileged sites including the CNS. Continuous low-level infection occurs in the presence of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) in CD4+ T cells and mononuclear phagocytes (MP; monocytes, macrophages, microglia, and dendritic cells). Within the CNS, productive viral infection is found exclusively in microglia and meningeal, perivascular, and choroidal macrophages. MPs serve as the principal viral CNS reservoir. Animal models have been developed to recapitulate natural human HIV-1 infection. These include nonhuman primates, humanized mice, EcoHIV, and transgenic rodent models. These models have been used to study disease pathobiology, antiretroviral and immune modulatory agents, viral reservoirs, and eradication strategies. However, each of these models are limited to specific component(s) of human disease. Indeed, HIV-1 species specificity must drive therapeutic and cure studies. These have been studied in several model systems reflective of latent infections, specifically in MP (myeloid, monocyte, macrophages, microglia, and histiocyte cell) populations. Therefore, additional small animal models that allow productive viral replication to enable viral carriage into the brain and the virus-susceptible MPs are needed. To this end, this review serves to outline animal models currently available to study myeloid brain reservoirs and highlight areas that are lacking and require future research to more effectively study disease-specific events that could be useful for viral eradication studies both in and outside the CNS.

51,36029425,"To date, there are no established scales to assess PrEP stigma among youth. We validated the Youth PrEP Stigma Scale within the Adolescent Trials Network P3 study (2019-2021). Data from sexual and gender minority youth (16-24 years) who were prescribed PrEP across nine domestic sites were evaluated (N = 235). Descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, and correlation coefficients are reported. Results yielded a three-factor solution (PrEP Disapproval by Others, Enacted PrEP Stigma, and PrEP User Stereotypes) with strong factor loadings and Cronbach's alphas ranging from 0.83 to 0.90, suggesting excellent internal consistency. Correlations between this Scale, anticipated HIV stigma, perceived HIV risk, and disclosure of sexual identity were significant, indicating potential for robust application. Given the persistence of HIV infections among youth, stigma as a barrier to prevention, and expansion of PrEP modalities, the Youth PrEP Stigma Scale could enhance intervention and mechanistic research among youth at elevated risk for HIV acquisition. Hasta la fecha, no existen escalas establecidas para evaluar el estigma de la PrEP entre los jóvenes. Validamos la Escala de estigma de la PrEP para jóvenes dentro del estudio P3 de la Red de ensayos para adolescentes (2019–2021). Se evaluaron los datos de jóvenes de minorías sexuales y de género (16–24 años) a quienes se les recetó PrEP en nueve sitios domésticos (N = 235). Se informan estadísticas descriptivas, análisis factorial exploratorio y coeficientes de correlación. Los resultados arrojaron una solución de tres factores (desaprobación de PrEP por parte de otros, estigma de PrEP promulgado y estereotipos de usuarios de PrEP) con fuertes cargas factoriales y alfas de Cronbach que oscilan entre 0.83 y 0.90, lo que sugiere una excelente consistencia interna. Las correlaciones entre esta Escala, el estigma anticipado del VIH, el riesgo percibido del VIH y la divulgación de la identidad sexual fueron significativas, lo que indica un potencial para una aplicación sólida. Dada la persistencia de las infecciones por el VIH entre los jóvenes, el estigma como una barrera para la prevención y la expansión de las modalidades de PrEP, la Escala de estigma de la PrEP para jóvenes podría mejorar la intervención y la investigación mecánica entre los jóvenes con un riesgo elevado de contraer el VIH.

53,29977959,Insufficient pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) laboratory monitoring could increase HIV resistance and sexually transmitted infections. We examined test-ordering in a primary care network. Providers did not order HIV testing before almost one-quarter of PrEP initiations; panel management was associated with higher testing. Effective monitoring is needed to maximize PrEP's preventive impact. 
54,32048078,"PrEP persistence, or PrEP use over time, has been shown to be short, with most PrEP users stopping within 6-12 months. Furthermore, those most vulnerable to HIV often use PrEP for shorter periods. This qualitative study explores patient, provider, and contextual factors that influence PrEP persistence. In interviews with 25 PrEP users and 18 PrEP providers in San Francisco's safety net clinics, we analyze the perceived benefits and difficulties of taking PrEP, including structural barriers. We identify different steps in receipt of PrEP care (clinic visits and lab tests, pharmacy interactions, and medication adherence), and describe barriers and facilitators for providers and patients at each step. Our findings suggest that drop-in visits, streamlined testing, standing orders for labs, and 90-day PrEP prescriptions are highly desirable for many PrEP users. Also important are the proactive provision of adherence support and counseling, and referrals for housing, substance use, and mental health services. Se ha demostrado que la persistencia de PrEP, o el uso de PrEP a lo largo del tiempo, es corto, y la mayoría de los usuarios de PrEP lo deja de tomar dentro de 6-12 meses. Además, muchas veces las personas más vulnerables al VIH usan PrEP por períodos más cortos. Este estudio cualitativo explora pacientes, proveedores y factores contextuales que influyen en la persistencia de PrEP. En entrevistas con 25 usuarios de PrEP y 18 proveedores de PrEP en las clínicas de redes de seguridad de San Francisco, analizamos los beneficios y las dificultades percibidos de tomar PrEP, incluidas las barreras estructurales. Identificamos diferentes pasos en la recepción de la atención de PrEP (visitas a clínicas y pruebas de laboratorio, interacciones de farmacia y adherencia a medicamentos) y describimos las barreras y facilitadores para proveedores y pacientes en cada paso. Nuestros hallazgos sugieren que las visitas directas, las pruebas simplificadas, las órdenes permanentes para los laboratorios y las recetas de PrEP de 90 días son muy deseables para muchos usuarios de PrEP. También es importante la provisión proactiva de apoyo y asesoramiento de adherencia, y referencias para vivienda, uso de sustancias y servicios de salud mental. "
55,20690259,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and AIDS remain a major public health crisis in Nigeria which harbors more people living with HIV than any other country in the world, except South Africa and India. A significant challenge to the success of achieving universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support by 2010 is HIV-AIDS stigma and discrimination. Eight studies looking at some degree of measurement of stigma and discrimination in Nigeria were reviewed in an attempt to investigate the cultural context of stigma, health seeking behavior and the role both perceived and community stigma play in HIV prevention. Results suggest that reducing stigma does increase the individual as well as community acceptance of people living with HIV-AIDS (PLWHAs), but long term studies are needed. Some suggestions are recommended for future research on culture specific stigma studies in Nigeria. "

57,31644481,"This review highlights the development of long-acting injectable cabotegravir (CAB LA) for HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), with a focus on phase 2 studies and later development. Early studies of CAB LA for HIV prevention offered promising pharmacokinetic data and paved the way for phase 2 studies, which have now been completed. On the basis of phase 2 data, dosing of CAB LA at 8-week intervals consistently delivers target trough concentrations in both men and women. Recent studies have shown no required dose adjustments for hepatic or renal disease and minimal drug--drug interactions. Additionally, injectable PrEP is desired by potential PrEP candidates. Still, gaps in knowledge remain with respect to implementation and delivery, the clinical significance of the pharmacologic tail, and dosing in key populations. Phase 3 trials are underway that are anticipated to inform some of these questions and provide efficacy and safety data to support regulatory submissions for CAB LA as a potential PrEP agent. Recent studies have defined an appropriate CAB LA dosing interval and offered insight into its safety profile. Phase 3 studies will provide much-anticipated efficacy data. If efficacious, CAB LA may provide a desirable PrEP option for those who face challenges to daily pill adherence. A more complete understanding of how to best integrate LA PrEP into service delivery models will be critical for success. "
58,3331119,"Mental disturbances associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are related not only to profound psychosocial stress, systemic diseases, and neoplasms or opportunistic infections within the central nervous system (CNS); they are also related to the direct neurotoxicity of the etiologic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), producing an array of both insidious and acute affective, cognitive, and behavioral dysfunction that can mimic many neuropsychiatric disorders. The precise mechanism of this direct neurotoxicity is not known, nor have the frequency, clinical course, or methods of early diagnosis been clearly established; however, a critique of 56 clinical reviews or case reports regarding approximately 800 subjects suggest that at some point following infection an HIV-induced dementia is extremely common, as are marked histopathological changes throughout the CNS. Treatment strategies are discussed. "
59,30649635,"Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) are a group critically affected by HIV. Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is a biomedical prevention strategy that can help reduce new infections in this population. However, PrEP use may expose users to experiences of PrEP-related stigma. In-depth interviews conducted with Latino MSM PrEP users (N = 29) were analyzed using thematic analysis to explore experiences of PrEP stigma. Six themes emerged related to anticipated and enacted PrEP stigma: (1) Perception that PrEP users engage in risky sexual behaviors; (2) PrEP-induced conflict in relationships; (3) Perception that PrEP users are HIV-positive; (4) Generational differences in attitudes toward HIV prevention; (5) Experiences of discomfort, judgment, or homophobia from medical providers; and (6) Gay stigma related to PrEP disclosure to family. Manifestations of stigma included disapproving judgment, negative labeling, rejection, and devaluing individuals. The social consequences associated with using PrEP may deter uptake and persistence among Latino MSM. "
60,33617771,"Men who have sex with men (MSM) in the USA were the first population to be identified with AIDS and continue to be at very high risk of HIV acquisition. We did a systematic literature search to identify the factors that explain the reasons for the ongoing epidemic in this population, using a social-ecological perspective. Common features of the HIV epidemic in American MSM include role versatility and biological, individual, and social and structural factors. The high-prevalence networks of some racial and ethnic minority men are further concentrated because of assortative mixing, adverse life experiences (including high rates of incarceration), and avoidant behaviour because of negative interactions with the health-care system. Young MSM have additional risks for HIV because their impulse control is less developed and they are less familiar with serostatus and other risk mitigation discussions. They might benefit from prevention efforts that use digital technologies, which they often use to meet partners and obtain health-related information. Older MSM remain at risk of HIV and are the largest population of US residents with chronic HIV, requiring culturally responsive programmes that address longer-term comorbidities. Transgender MSM are an understudied population, but emerging data suggest that some are at great risk of HIV and require specifically tailored information on HIV prevention. In the current era of pre-exposure prophylaxis and the undetectable equals untransmittable campaign, training of health-care providers to create culturally competent programmes for all MSM is crucial, since the use of antiretrovirals is foundational to optimising HIV care and prevention. Effective control of the HIV epidemic among all American MSM will require scaling up programmes that address their common vulnerabilities, but are sufficiently nuanced to address the specific sociocultural, structural, and behavioural issues of diverse subgroups. "
61,30993479,"We aimed to discover barriers and facilitators of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) adherence in young men and transgender women of color who have sex with men (YMSM/TW). Short-term and sustained adherence were measured by urine tenofovir concentration and pharmacy refills, respectively. Optimal adherence was defined as having both urine tenofovir concentration consistent with dose ingestion within 48 h and pharmacy refills consistent with ≥ 4 doses per week use. Participants completed semi-structured interviews exploring adherence barriers and facilitators. Participants (n = 31) were primarily African-American (68%), mean age 22 years (SD: 1.8), and 48% had optimal adherence. Adherence barriers included stigma, health systems inaccessibility, side effects, competing stressors, and low HIV risk perception. Facilitators included social support, health system accessibility, reminders/routines, high HIV risk perception, and personal agency. Our findings identify targets for intervention to improve PrEP adherence in these populations, including augmenting health activation and improving accuracy of HIV risk perception. Nuestro objetivo fue descubrir los obstáculos y facilitadores de la adherencia al profilaxis de pre-exposición al VIH (PrEP) en hombres jóvenes y mujeres transgénero que tienen sexo con hombres (YMSM/TW) y quienes son minorías étnicas. La adherencia, a corto plazo y sostenida, se midió mediante la concentración de tenofovir en la orina y las prescripciones completadas en la farmacia. La adherencia óptima se definió basado en una concentración de tenofovir en la orina consistente con el uso de PrEP en las ultimas 48 horas y prescripciones completadas en la farmacia consistentes con ≥4 dosis por semana. Los participantes completaron entrevistas semiestructuradas que exploraron los obstáculos y facilitadores de la adherencia. Los participantes (n = 31) fueron principalmente afroamericanos (68%), con una edad media de 22 años (SD: 1.8) y 48% obtuvieron adherencia óptima. Participantes discutieron varios obstáculos, incluyendo el estigma, acceso limitado a los sistemas de salud, los efectos secundarios asociados a PrEP, competencia con otras prioridades, y la baja percepción del riesgo de VIH. Los facilitadores incluyeron apoyo social, acceso al sistema de salud, recordatorios/rutinas, alta percepción de riesgo de VIH y agencia personal. Nuestros hallazgos identifican oportunidades para mejorar la adherencia a la PrEP en estas poblaciones a través de intervenciones, incluyendo la activación de salud y cambios en la percepción del riesgo al VIH en estas comunidades.

62,33216244,"Interventions are needed to expand HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) prescribing practices among healthcare providers, but research classifying providers to determine tailored intervention needs is lacking. Providers reported demographics, factors related to HIV treatment and prevention experience, and PrEP-related factors such as knowledge and community protection beliefs via online survey. Latent class analysis grouped providers with similar patterns of HIV prevention- and treatment-related care and tested for associations with demographics and PrEP-related factors. Three distinct classes of providers emerged: (1) PrEP naïve, (2) PrEP aware, and (3) PrEP prescribers. Providers with lower community protection beliefs and staff capacity were more likely to be classified as PrEP naïve compared to aware (ps < 0.05). Providers with concerns about PrEP-related tasks and staff capacity were more likely to be classified as PrEP aware compared to prescribers (ps < 0.05). PrEP-naïve providers could benefit from continuing education, whereas PrEP-aware providers might benefit from capacity building and prescribing optimization interventions. Se necesitan intervenciones para expandir los hábitos de prescripción de la profilaxis de pre-exposición al VIH (PrEP) entre los proveedores de atención médica, pero faltan investigaciones que categoricen a los proveedores para identificar necesidades que requieran intervención personalizada. A través de una encuesta en línea, proveedores de salud reportaron sus datos demográficos, los factores relacionados con la experiencia en el tratamiento y la prevención del VIH y los factores relacionados con la PrEP, como el conocimiento y las creencias de protección de la comunidad. Se aplicó un análisis de clases latentes para agrupar a los proveedores con patrones similares de atención de la prevención y el tratamiento del VIH y se evaluó la asociación de estos con factores demográficos y factores relacionados con la PrEP. Surgieron tres clases de proveedores: (1) ingenuos de la PrEP, (2) conscientes de la PrEP y (3) prescriptores de la PrEP. Los proveedores con creencias de protección de la comunidad y capacidad del personal más bajos tuvieron más probabilidad de ser clasificados como ingenuos de la PrEP en comparación con los proveedores conscientes de la PrEP (ps <0.05). Los proveedores con preocupaciones sobre las tareas relacionadas con la PrEP y la capacidad del personal tuvieron mas probabilidad de ser clasificados como conscientes de la PrEP en comparación con los prescriptores de la PrEP (ps <0.05). Los proveedores ingenuos de la PrEP podrían beneficiarse de la educación continua, mientras que los proveedores conscientes de la PrEP podrían beneficiarse de intervenciones para el desarrollo de capacidades y optimización de los hábitos de prescripción.

63,26491256,"The human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) enters target cells by binding its envelope glycoprotein gp120 to the CD4 receptor and/or coreceptors such as C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5; R5) and C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4; X4), and R5-tropic viruses predominate during the early stages of infection. CCR5 antagonists bind to CCR5 to prevent viral entry. Maraviroc (MVC) is the only CCR5 antagonist currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, the European Commission, Health Canada, and several other countries for the treatment of patients infected with R5-tropic HIV-1. MVC has been shown to be effective at inhibiting HIV-1 entry into cells and is well tolerated. With expanding MVC use by HIV-1-infected humans, different clinical outcomes post-approval have been observed with MVC monotherapy or combination therapy with other antiretroviral drugs, with MVC use in humans infected with dual-R5- and X4-tropic HIV-1, infected with different HIV-1 genotype or infected with HIV-2. This review discuss the role of CCR5 in HIV-1 infection, the development of the CCR5 antagonist MVC, its pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, drug-drug interactions, and the implications of these interactions on treatment outcomes, including viral mutations and drug resistance, and the mechanisms associated with the development of resistance to MVC. This review also discusses available studies investigating the use of MVC in the treatment of other diseases such as cancer, graft-versus-host disease, and inflammatory diseases. "
64,9336715,"This review surveys evidence relevant to the proposition that psychobiologic factors may influence the progress of infection with human immunodeficiency virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Little research has directly examined the influence of psychobiologic factors on the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying HIV progression. However, basic research in neuroimmune interactions indicates that activation of the sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis can influence several immunologic processes relevant to HIV pathogenesis and the body's ability to resist the progress of infection. A small number of observational natural history studies indicate that certain psychosocial characteristics may be associated with differential disease progression (e.g., subjective responses to highly threatening events, and inhibited psychosocial characteristics). We address some of the methodologic and conceptual issues critical to the interpretation of current results as evidence that psychobiologic processes influence HIV progression, and we conclude by highlighting promising areas for future inquiry. "
65,24679634,"Studies examining the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV transmission among people who inject drugs (PWIDs) have not been adequately summarized. Recently, the Bangkok Tenofovir Study has shown that PrEP may be effective at reducing new HIV infections among this high-risk group. This randomized controlled trial was the first study to specifically examine the efficacy of PrEP among PWIDs. In this review, we present the current state of evidence regarding the use of PrEP to prevent HIV infection in PWID populations, and set an agenda for future research to inform the most effective implementation of PrEP in the context of existing evidence-based HIV prevention strategies. Despite positive trial results confirming that PrEP may prevent HIV transmission among PWIDs, there remain many questions regarding the interpretation of these results, as well as obstacles to the implementation of PrEP regimens within highly diverse drug-using communities. Aside from the Bangkok Tenofovir Study, we identified only one other published study that has collected empirical data to inform the use of PrEP among PWIDs. The large gap in research regarding the use and implementation of PrEP for PWIDs signals the need for further research and attention. We recommend that future research efforts focus on elucidating the generalizability of the Bangkok Tenofovir Study results in other injection drug-using populations, examining the willingness of PWIDs to use PrEP in diverse contexts, identifying barriers to adherence to PrEP regimens and determining the most effective ways to implement PrEP programmes within the context of existing evidence-based prevention strategies, including opioid substitution therapy and needle and syringe distribution programmes.

66,30332309,"HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective method of reducing HIV incidence. Questions remain regarding PrEP's efficacy and outcomes in real-world clinical settings. We conducted a retrospective review to assess PrEP outcomes in an academic clinic setting and focused on retention in care, reasons for discontinuation, and receipt of appropriate preventive care (immunizations, HIV testing, and STI testing). One hundred thirty-four patients were seen between 2010 and 2016 over 309 visits. One hundred sixteen patients (87%) started daily PrEP and of those, 88 (76%) attended at least one 6-month follow-up visit. Over 60% of PrEP patients completed all recommended STI screening after starting PrEP. Only 40% of patients had all appropriate immunizations at baseline; 78% had all appropriate immunizations at study completion. This study demonstrated high rates of both retention and of attaining recommended preventive care in a clinical setting outside of the rigors of clinical trials. "

Allen McCutchan has comprehensively reviewed the various clinical presentations of CMV neurological disease as well as the methods of diagnosis, the neuropharmacology of available antiviral agents, the results of therapy, and the potential for prevention of these sequela of advanced immunosuppression. As the ability to prevent diseases such as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, bacteremia secondary to Mycobacterium avium, tuberculosis, serious fungal infections, and toxoplasma cerebritis is increasing, physicians must now treat more HIV-1-infected persons with CMV disease. This AIDS Commentary provides a timely update of the current state of our knowledge regarding this serious problem. "
68,30874995,"Racial and ethnic disparities exist in HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) awareness and care. We evaluated how racial and ethnic disparities in PrEP awareness among MSM presenting to a sexually transmitted disease clinic changed from 2013 to 2016. Among 1243 MSM (68% non-Hispanic White, 22% Hispanic, and 10% non-Hispanic Black), PrEP awareness increased overall, but awareness was lower among Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black MSM relative to non-Hispanic White MSM. Awareness converged among non-Hispanic Black and White MSM by 2016, but remained consistently lower among Hispanic MSM. Improved efforts are needed to address disparities in PrEP awareness. "
69,31401755,"Although combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has improved the health of millions of those living with HIV-1 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Type 1), the penetration into the central nervous system (CNS) of many such therapies is limited, thereby resulting in residual neurocognitive impairment commonly referred to as NeuroHIV. Additionally, while cART has successfully suppressed peripheral viremia, cytotoxicity associated with the presence of viral Transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein in tissues such as the brain, remains a significant concern. Our previous study has demonstrated that both HIV-1 Tat as well as opiates such as morphine, can directly induce synaptic alterations via independent pathways. Herein, we demonstrate that exposure of astrocytes to HIV-1 protein Tat mediates the induction and release of extracellular vesicle (EV) microRNA-7 (miR-7) that is taken up by neurons, leading in turn, to downregulation of neuronal neuroligin 2 (NLGN2) and ultimately to synaptic alterations. More importantly, we report that these impairments could be reversed by pretreatment of neurons with a neurotrophic factor platelet-derived growth factor-CC (PDGF-CC). Graphical Abstract. "
70,30689766,"Clinical guidelines for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been instrumental in the implementation of PrEP in medical practices throughout the country. However, the eligibility criteria contained within may inadvertently limit PrEP access for some patients. We describe the following key considerations and caveats related to these criteria: promotion of a selective vs universal approach to sexual health education involving PrEP; misalignment between criteria stated in the table and text boxes; problematic categorization and confounding of sexual orientation, gender identity, and risk behavior; underemphasis of network/community-level drivers of HIV transmission; oversimplification of serodiscordant risk; and lack of clarity surrounding the relevance of condoms to PrEP eligibility. We offer concrete recommendations to address the identified issues and strengthen future iterations of the guidelines, applying these recommendations in an alternative table of ""criteria."" "
71,26895248,"We evaluated cellular metabolism profiles of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infected primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). First, HIV-2 GL-AN displays faster production kinetics and greater amounts of virus as compared to HIV-1s: YU-2, 89.6 and JR-CSF. Second, quantitative LC-MS/MS metabolomics analysis demonstrates very similar metabolic profiles in glycolysis and TCA cycle metabolic intermediates between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infected macrophages, with a few notable exceptions. The most striking metabolic change in MDMs infected with HIV-2 relative to HIV-1-infected MDMs was the increased levels of quinolinate, a metabolite in the tryptophan catabolism pathway that has been linked to HIV/AIDS pathogenesis. Third, both HIV-1 and HIV-2 infected MDMs showed elevated levels of ribose-5-phosphate, a key metabolic component in nucleotide biosynthesis. Finally, HIV-2 infected MDMs display increased dNTP concentrations as predicted by Vpx-mediated SAMHD1 degradation. Collectively, these data show differential metabolic changes during HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection of macrophages. "

Researchers reviewed the English-language literature with a focus on child and adolescent risk factors associated with HIV/AIDS, prevention, and treatment. Substantial scientific advances have occurred over the past two decades leading to decreased morbidity and mortality in the United States from AIDS-related opportunistic infections. At the same time, rates of HIV infection are increasing in teenagers, young women, and minorities, and growing numbers of youths are living with an infected family member. Understanding HIV risk behavior requires a broad theoretical framework. Comprehensive HIV prevention programs have led to reduced risk behavior among HIV-affected youths and teens at risk of infection. Biological and behavioral treatments of HIV infection continue to evolve and have led to longer life span, improved quality of life, and fewer psychiatric problems. HIV/AIDS has significant mental health implications, and psychiatry can play a critical role in curbing the epidemic. With minimal effort, mental health professionals can adapt and apply the strategies that they use to treat psychiatric symptoms to prevent HIV transmission behaviors. "

75,30796608,"Clinical trials have found that PrEP is highly effective in reducing risk of HIV acquisition across types of exposure, gender, PrEP regimens, and dosing schemes. Evidence is urgently needed to inform scale-up of PrEP to meet the ambitious WHO/UNAIDS prevention target of 3,000,000 individuals on PrEP by 2020. Successful models of delivering HIV services at scale evolved from years of formal research and programmatic evidence. These efforts produced lessons-learned relevant for scaling-up PrEP delivery, including the importance of streamlining laboratory tests, expanding prescription and management authority, differentiating medication access points, and reducing stigma and barriers of parental consent for PrEP uptake. Further research is especially needed in areas differentiating PrEP from ART delivery, including repeat HIV testing to ensure HIV negative status and defining and measuring prevention-effective adherence. Evidence from 15 years of ART scale-up could immediately inform a public health approach to PrEP delivery. "
76,33311790,"Despite the proven efficacy and safety of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), it remains underutilized. PrEP use among Missouri providers has increased as the rate of new HIV infections grows statewide, but remains lower than the Midwest and United States (U.S.) averages. Because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identify Missouri as at-risk for an HIV outbreak, we seek to characterize HIV testing practices and PrEP knowledge and use among Missouri healthcare providers. "
77,28132744,"Our primary aim was to explore themes regarding attitudes toward HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among young transgender women (YTW), in order to develop a theoretical model of PrEP uptake in this population disproportionally affected by HIV. Qualitative study nested within a mixed-method study characterizing barriers and facilitators to health services for YTW. Participants completed an in-depth interview exploring awareness of and attitudes toward PrEP. Key themes were identified using a grounded theory approach. Participants (n = 25) had a mean age of 21.2 years (standard deviation 2.2, range 17-24) and were predominately multiracial (36%) and of HIV-negative or unknown status (68%). Most participants (64%) reported prior knowledge of PrEP, and 28% reported current use or intent to use PrEP. Three major content themes that emerged were variability of PrEP awareness, barriers and facilitators to PrEP uptake, and emotional benefits of PrEP. Among participants without prior PrEP knowledge, participants reported frustration that PrEP information has not been widely disseminated to YTW, particularly by health care providers. Attitudes toward PrEP were overwhelmingly positive; however, concerns were raised regarding barriers including cost, stigma, and adherence challenges. Both HIV-positive and negative participants discussed emotional and relationship benefits of PrEP, which were felt to extend beyond HIV prevention alone. A high proportion of YTW in this study had prior knowledge of PrEP, and attitudes toward PrEP were positive among participants. Our findings suggest several domains to be further explored in PrEP implementation research, including methods of facilitating PrEP dissemination and emotional motivation for PrEP uptake. "
78,19768553,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of the central nervous system (CNS) can result in neurological dysfunction with devastating consequences in a significant proportion of individuals with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. HIV-1 does not infect neurons directly but induces damage indirectly through the accumulation of activated macrophage/microglia (M/M) cells, some of which are infected, that release neurotoxic mediators including both cellular activation products and viral proteins. One mechanism for the accumulation of activated M/M involves the development in infected individuals of an activated peripheral blood monocyte population that traffics through the blood-brain barrier, a process that also serves to carry virus into CNS and establish local infection. A second mechanism involves the release by infected and activated M/M in the CNS of chemotactic mediators that recruit additional monocytes from the periphery. These activated M/M, some of which are infected, release a number of cytokines and small molecule mediators as well as viral proteins that act on bystander cells and in turn activate them, thus amplifying the cascade. These viral proteins and cellular products have neurotoxic properties as well, both directly and through induction of astrocyte dysfunction, which ultimately lead to neuronal injury and death. In patients effectively treated with antiretroviral therapy, frank dementia is now uncommon and has been replaced by milder forms of neurocognitive impairment, with less frequent and more focal neuropathology. This review summarizes key findings that support the critical role and mechanisms of monocyte/macrophage activation and inflammation as a major component for HIV-1 encephalitis or HIV-1 associated dementia.

80,38411842,"HIV reservoirs are the main barrier to cure. CD4+ T cells have been extensively studied as the primary HIV-1 reservoir. However, there is substantial evidence that HIV-1-infected myeloid cells (monocytes/macrophages) also contribute to viral persistence and pathogenesis. Recent studies in animal models and people with HIV-1 demonstrate that myeloid cells are cellular reservoirs of HIV-1. HIV-1 genomes and viral RNA have been reported in circulating monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages from the brain, urethra, gut, liver, and spleen. Importantly, viral outgrowth assays have quantified persistent infectious virus from monocyte-derived macrophages and tissue-resident macrophages. The myeloid cell compartment represents an important target of HIV-1 infection. While myeloid reservoirs may be more difficult to measure than CD4+ T cell reservoirs, they are long-lived, contribute to viral persistence, and, unless specifically targeted, will prevent an HIV-1 cure.

81,31194291,"There is emerging data on HIV-1 incidence among MSM in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), but no known estimate of HIV-1 incidence among transgender women (TGW) in the region has yet been reported. We assessed HIV-1 incidence and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) interest in men who have sex with men exclusively (MSME), men who have sex with men and women (MSMW) and TGW in coastal Kenya. HIV-1-seronegative individuals who had participated in an HIV testing study in 2016 were traced and retested in 2017 according to Kenyan guidelines. All participants were assigned male sex at birth and had male sex partners; additional data on gender identity and sexual orientation were obtained. We assessed the factors associated with HIV-1 acquisition using Poisson regression and calculated HIV-1 incidence in MSME, MSMW and TGW. PrEP interest was assessed through focus group discussions to characterize subcategories' perceived PrEP needs. Of the 168 cohort participants, 42 were classified as MSME, 112 as MSMW and 14 as TGW. Overall, HIV-1 incidence was 5.1 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.6 to 9.8) per 100 person-years (PY): 4.5 (95% CI: 1.1 to 17.8] per 100 PY among MSME, 3.4 (95% CI: 1.3 to 9.1) per 100 PY among MSMW and 20.6 (95% CI: 6.6 to 63.8] per 100 PY among TGW. HIV-1 acquisition was associated with exclusive receptive anal intercourse (aIRR 13.0, 95% CI 1.9 to 88.6), history of an STI in preceding six months (aIRR 10.3, 95% CI 2.2 to 49.4) and separated/divorced marital status (aIRR 8.2 (95%: 1.1 to 62.2). Almost all (98.8%) participants were interested in initiating PrEP. MSME and TGW felt that PrEP would lead to increases in condomless anal or group sex. TGW had a very high HIV-1 incidence compared with MSME and MSMW. Subcategories of MSM anticipated different PrEP needs and post-PrEP risk behaviour. Further studies should assess if TGW may have been wrongly categorized as MSM in other HIV-1 incidence studies in the region. "
82,20419478,"HIV/AIDS is concentrated among the inner-city poor and poverty may directly interfere with HIV treatment. This study examined food insufficiency in relation to HIV-related health and treatment. A sample of 344 men and women living with HIV/AIDS in Atlanta, Georgia completed measures of food security, health, and HIV disease progression and treatment. HIV treatment adherence was monitored using unannounced pill counts. Results showed that half of people living with HIV/AIDS in this study lacked sufficient food, and food insufficiency was associated with multiple indicators of poor health, including higher HIV viral loads, lower CD4 cell counts, and poorer treatment adherence. Adjusted analyses showed that food insufficiency predicted HIV treatment non-adherence over and above years of education, employment status, income, housing, depression, social support, and non-alcohol substance use. Hunger and food insecurity are prevalent among people living with HIV/AIDS, and food insufficiency is closely related to multiple HIV-related health indicators, particularly medication adherence. Interventions that provide consistent and sustained meals to people living with HIV/AIDS are urgently needed. "
83,31792704,"To review the literature on progress towards UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets for HIV prevention and treatment among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China. China has made progress towards UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets among MSM. However, socio-structural barriers, including HIV-related stigma and homophobia, persist at each stage of the HIV care continuum, leading to substantial levels of attrition and high risk of forward HIV transmission. Moreover, access to key prevention tools, such as pre-exposure prophylaxis, is still limited. Multilevel interventions, many using digital intervention, have been shown effective in pragmatic randomized controlled trials in China. Multilevel interventions incorporating digital health have led to significant improvement in engagement of Chinese MSM in the HIV care continuum. However, interventions that address socio-structural determinants, including HIV-related stigma and discrimination, towards Chinese MSM are needed. "

85,14595004,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-associated dementia is a neuroinflammatory brain disorder that is fueled by viral infection and immune activation of brain mononuclear phagocytes (MP; macrophages and microglia). MP serve as a reservoir for persistent viral infection, a vehicle for viral dissemination throughout the brain, and a major source of neurotoxic products that when produced in abundance, affect neuronal function. Such neurotoxic substances secreted by MP lead to clinical neurological impairment (cognitive, behavior, and motor abnormalities), which occurs usually years after the initial viral infection. How HIV-1 evades the immune function characteristic for MP as a first line of defense, including phagocytosis and intracellular killing, is not well understood despite more than two decades of study. In this report, we review the complex role(s) played by MP in the neuropathogenesis of HIV-1 infection. The clinical manifestations, pathology and pathogenesis, and treatment options are discussed in relationship to innate and adaptive immunity. Particular emphasis is given to the diversity of MP functions and how it may affect the disease process and manifestations. New insights into disease mechanisms are provided by advances in enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and proteomics to identify cell movement and genetic profiles of disease. New therapeutic strategies are discussed based on current knowledge of HIV-1-associated dementia pathogenesis. "
86,19932385,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of AIDS, has infected an estimated 33 million individuals worldwide. HIV is associated with immunodeficiency, neoplasia, and neurologic disease. The continuing evolution of the HIV epidemic has spurred an intense interest in a hitherto neglected area of medicine, neuroinfectious diseases and their consequences. This work has broad applications for the study of central nervous system (CNS) tumors, dementias, neuropathies, and CNS disease in other immunosuppressed individuals. HIV is neuroinvasive (can enter the CNS), neurotrophic (can live in neural tissues), and neurovirulent (causes disease of the nervous system). This article reviews the HIV-associated neurologic syndromes, which can be classified as primary HIV neurologic disease (in which HIV is both necessary and sufficient to cause the illness), secondary or opportunistic neurologic disease (in which HIV interacts with other pathogens, resulting in opportunistic infections and tumors), and treatment-related neurologic disease (such as immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome).

87,25045996,"Oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a promising new biomedical prevention approach in which HIV-negative individuals are provided with daily oral antiretroviral medication for the primary prevention of HIV-1. Several clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy of oral PrEP for HIV prevention among groups at high risk for HIV, with adherence closely associated with level of risk reduction. In the United States (US), three groups have been prioritized for initial implementation of PrEP-injection drug users, men who have sex with men at substantial risk for HIV, and HIV-negative partners within serodiscordant heterosexual couples. Numerous demonstration projects involving PrEP implementation among MSM are underway, but relatively little research has been devoted to study PrEP implementation in HIV-serodiscordant heterosexual couples in the US. Such couples face a unique set of challenges to PrEP implementation at the individual, couple, and provider level with regard to PrEP uptake and maintenance, adherence, safety and toxicity, clinical monitoring, and sexual risk behavior. Oral PrEP also provides new opportunities for serodiscordant couples and healthcare providers for primary prevention and reproductive health. This article provides a review of the critical issues, challenges, and opportunities involved in the implementation of oral PrEP among HIV-serodiscordant heterosexual couples in the US. "
88,27896552,"Pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV (PrEP) is recommended for people who inject drugs (PWID). Despite their central role in disease prevention, willingness to prescribe PrEP to PWID among primary care physicians (PCPs) is largely understudied. We conducted an online survey (April-May 2015) of members of a society for academic general internists regarding PrEP. Among 250 respondents, 74% (n = 185) of PCPs reported high willingness to prescribe PrEP to PWID. PCPs were more likely to report high willingness to prescribe PrEP to all other HIV risk groups (p's < 0.03 for all pair comparisons). Compared with PCPs delivering care to more HIV-infected clinic patients, PCPs delivering care to fewer HIV-infected patients were more likely to report low willingness to prescribe PrEP to PWID (Odds Ratio [95% CI] = 6.38 [1.48-27.47]). PCP and practice characteristics were not otherwise associated with low willingness to prescribe PrEP to PWID. Interventions to improve PCPs' willingness to prescribe PrEP to PWID are needed. "
89,27885552,"HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) was FDA approved in 2012, but uptake remains low. To characterize what would facilitate health care providers' increased PrEP prescribing, we conducted a 10-city, online survey of 525 primary care providers (PCPs) and HIV providers (HIVPs) to assess awareness, knowledge, and experience with prescribing PrEP; and, comfort with and barriers to PrEP-related activities. Fewer PCPs than HIVPs had heard of PrEP (76 vs 98%), felt familiar with prescribing PrEP (28 vs. 76%), or had prescribed it (17 vs. 64%). PCPs were less comfortable than HIVPs with PrEP-related activities such as discussing sexual activities (75 vs. 94%), testing for acute HIV (83 vs. 98%), or delivering a new HIV diagnosis (80 vs. 95%). PCPs most frequently identified limited knowledge about PrEP and concerns about insurance coverage as prescribing barriers. PCPs and HIVPs differ in needs that will facilitate their PrEP prescribing. Efforts to increase PrEP uptake will require interventions to increase the knowledge, comfort, and skills of providers to prescribe PrEP. "
90,34370571,"Increasing access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in primary care settings for patients who may be at risk for HIV could help to increase PrEP uptake, which has remained low among certain key risk populations. The current study conducted interviews with primary care providers identified from national claims data as having either high or low likelihood of serving PrEP-eligible patients based on their prescribing practices for other sexually transmitted infections. The study yielded important information about primary care providers' knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about PrEP, as well as the barriers and facilitators to prescribing PrEP. Key recommendations for a provider-focused intervention to increase PrEP prescribing among primary care providers, including increasing patient education to increase demand from providers, enhancing provider education, leveraging technology, and instituting standardized sexual health checks, are provided with the goal of informing network-based interventions.

91,15075496,"To review the clinical features, treatment issues, and research needs surrounding HIV infection in older adults with psychotic disorders and new-onset psychosis in HIV-infected individuals, while focusing on the implications of the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era and the use of atypical antipsychotic agents. We searched the Medline/HealthStar database for articles that had examined new-onset psychosis in HIV disease and existing HIV infection in adults with psychotic disorders. Individuals with psychotic disorders have an elevated risk of HIV infection. The risk factors for, prognosis for, and treatment of HIV disease may all be affected by older age. New-onset psychosis in HIV-infected individuals presents with a range of clinical features and is likely to remain a problem encountered in the near future, despite the treatment advances associated with HAART. Antipsychotic agents are the treatment of choice for psychosis in HIV-infected individuals. Research has demonstrated the sensitivity of HIV-infected individuals to the extrapyramidal side-effects of conventional antipsychotic agents, adverse effects that are reduced with the use of atypical antipsychotic agents. HIV, psychosis, and aging represent a trio with important clinical implications. HIV-infected older adults, a growing portion of the HIV population, face challenges in terms of concomitant illness, treatment sensitivity, and the potential for increased morbidity and premature mortality. Atypical antipsychotic agents in low doses represent an advance over conventional antipsychotic agents, although they do have their own side-effects. "

In the Deep South, a region with high rates of new HIV diagnosis, patterns of PrEP discontinuation remain unexplored. We evaluated data from a clinic-based PrEP program in Jackson, Mississippi and included patients initiating PrEP between August 2018 and April 2021. We considered patients to have a gap in PrEP coverage if they had at least 30 days without an active PrEP prescription; those who restarted PrEP after 30 days were classified as 'stopped and restarted' and those who never obtained a new PrEP prescription were classified as 'stopped and did not restart'. Patients without a gap in coverage were considered 'continuously on PrEP'. We estimated median time to first PrEP discontinuation and examined factors associated with time to first PrEP discontinuation. Of 171 patients who received an initial 90-day PrEP prescription; 75% were assigned male at birth and 74% identified as Black. The median time to first discontinuation was 90 days (95% CI 90-114). Twenty-two percent were continuously on PrEP, 28% stopped and restarted (median time off PrEP = 102 days), and 50% stopped and did not restart. Associations with early PrEP stoppage were notable for patients assigned sex female vs male (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.6, 95% CI 1.0-2.5) and those living over 25 miles from clinic vs. 0-10 miles (aHR 1.89, 95% CI 1.2-3.0).

We conducted in-depth interviews with 19 men who have sex with transgender women in Baltimore, Maryland and Atlanta, Georgia to explore perspectives on HIV prevention. Participants used several strategies to reduce HIV risk: condoms, frequent HIV testing, communication about HIV status with partners, and limiting the types of sex acts performed. While condom use was inconsistent, it was preferred over pre-exposure prophylaxis, in part due to medical distrust. HIV self-testing was generally viewed unfavorably. Although most participants were referred to the study by their transgender women partners, they recommended reaching other men who have sex with transgender women in bars, nightclubs, online, and through social media. HIV prevention interventions should be inclusive of the needs and experiences of men who have sex with transgender women. "
96,22076814,"Chemokines are critical components of the immune system that participate in immune homeostasis and alterations in chemokine balance can result in severe inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The role of chemokines and their receptors in viral infections including HIV-1 was predicted from the early studies of HIV-1 co-receptor CCR5 and its ligands and a divergent role of C-C chemokines in HIV-1 pathogenesis has been established. For example, CCL3 (MIP-1α), CCL4 (MIP-1β) and CCL5 (RANTES) have been shown to possess antiviral effects by binding to the HIV-1 co-receptor CCR5, whereas CCL2, a pro-inflammatory chemokine, supports HIV-1 replication despite being a member of same chemokine family. Furthermore, the well-established role of CCL2 in driving the Th2 immune response supports its potential role in HIV-1/AIDS. Recent reports suggest multiple pathways of CCL2 affect HIV-1 infection. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the role and potential mechanisms of the HIV-1-CCL2 interplay in driving virus-induced immuno-pathology, suggesting that CCL2 could be an anti-inflammatory target in the treatment of HIV-1 infection.

97,26143247,"Qualitative interviews about pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) stereotypes were conducted with a subsample of 160 MSM who participated in a PrEP messaging study. Negative stereotypes about PrEP users were identified by 80 % of participants. Two types of stereotypes were most common: PrEP users are HIV-infected (and lying about it), and PrEP users are promiscuous and resistant to condom use. Participants' identification of these stereotype categories differed significantly by demographic factors (i.e., race/ethnicity, education). Expanding access to PrEP requires recognizing potential differences in the experience or anticipation of PrEP-related stereotypes that might impact willingness to discuss PrEP with providers, friends, or partners.

HIV providers and non-HIV providers (n = 480) practicing within above-average HIV prevalence ZIP codes of the 10 U.S. cities with greatest overall HIV prevalence participated in a cross-sectional survey between July 2014 and May 2015. Providers were asked about their awareness of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and nPEP prescribing experience for patients with potential sexual exposures to HIV, which we coded into a PEP prescribing cascade with three categories: (1) PEP unaware, (2) PEP aware, no nPEP prescribing experience, and (3) nPEP prescribing experience. Overall, 12.5% were unaware of PEP, 43.5% were aware but hadn't prescribed nPEP, and 44.0% had prescribed nPEP for potential sexual exposures to HIV.

100,26091454,"The Chinese national observational cohort study suggests that the treatment-as-prevention (TasP) approach can be an effective public health HIV-1 prevention strategy. However, results from that study may have been biased because the follow-up time of index patients prior to their initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) was excluded. In this study, we correct for such bias by using an extended time-dependent Cox regression model to conduct a cohort study analysis of serodiscordant couples in Guangxi of China, inclusive of all follow-up time. During the follow-up of this observational cohort study of HIV-1 sero-discordant couples, the positive index partners may have never be treated with ART, or enter untreated but subsequently began treatment, or may have been treated immediately upon entry into the public health system. The treatment effectiveness of ART in HIV-1 acquisition among HIV-negative partners is assessed by the extended Cox regression model with treatment status as a time-varying covariate. A total of 6548 sero-discordant couples were included in the cohort study analysis. Among them, 348 negative partners sero-converted. HIV seroincidence was significantly higher among the nontreated (4.3 per 100 person-years, 3.7-4.9) compared with those receiving ART (1.8 per 100 person-years, 1.5-2.0). An overall 35% reduction in risk of HIV transmission was associated with receiving ART (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51-0.83), and the yearly risk reduction was also significant in the first 3 consecutive years of follow-up. Moreover, ART was found to be significantly inversely associated with multiple baseline characteristics of index partners. TasP may be feasible on a national or regional scale. In addition to other proven preventive strategies such as the use of condoms, ART adherence to maintain viral suppression would then be the key challenge for successful TasP implementation. "

103,32109141,"Increasing prescription of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is imperative to ending the HIV epidemic in the United States. The objective of this review was to identify health care provider barriers to PrEP implementation. A systematic review was conducted in February 2019 using PubMed to identify barriers to PrEP prescribing practices in the United States. Targeted search terms surrounding PrEP and providers resulted in 222 original studies, 28 of which were ultimately included in our review, with data collected between 2011 and 2018. Six themes were identified across reviewed studies: (i) a lack of PrEP knowledge, (ii) the presence of the Purview Paradox, which refers to discordance in beliefs between HIV specialists and primary care providers on who should prescribe PrEP, (iii) concerns about PrEP costs, (iv) concerns about behavioral and health consequences, (v) interpersonal stigma, and (vi) concerns about patient adherence. A majority of providers were lacking knowledge regarding PrEP, resulting in discomfort in prescribing PrEP, or limited awareness and understanding of PrEP clinical guidelines. Discrepant opinions were identified regarding whether PrEP was best managed within primary care or specialty clinics. Other barriers included concerns about cost, patient adherence, and follow-up maintenance care. Finally, concerns about risk compensation and discomfort discussing sexual activities with patients who would benefit most from PrEP were apparent. Additional work is needed to prepare providers to prescribe and manage patients on PrEP, optimize PrEP delivery, and reduce provider bias. Future research is needed to identify providers' attitudes and beliefs regarding innovations in PrEP dosing, task shifting, and novel strategies for PrEP care. "
104,31609925,"Optimal adherence to oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention involves aligning consistent PrEP use with periods of risk to achieve prevention-effective adherence. Prevention-effective adherence is predicated on individuals discontinuing PrEP during periods without expected risk. For stable, serodiscordant couples, antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence by the HIV-positive partner markedly decreases HIV transmission risk, potentially obviating the need for continued PrEP use; yet little is known about actual lived experiences of discontinuing PrEP. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with HIV-uninfected PrEP users in serodiscordant couples taking part in the Partners Demonstration Project at IDI-Kasangati, Kampala, Uganda. Open-ended interviews elicited information on the partnered relationship; understandings of PrEP; prevention strategies; and experiences of PrEP discontinuation. An inductive, thematic, content-analytic approach was used to analyze study data. Uninfected partners experienced PrEP as a valued resource for preventing HIV acquisition. Despite ongoing ART use by HIV-positive partners for a period of time consistent with viral suppression, discontinuation of PrEP was experienced as a loss of protection and a corresponding increase in risk of HIV acquisition. Uninfected partners responded with strategies aimed at offsetting this subjective sense of increased risk, specifically: (1) changing sexual practices; (2) prioritizing fidelity in the relationship; (3) increasing reliance on condoms; and (4) seeking evidence of partners' ART adherence. These experiences highlight the challenges PrEP users in serodiscordant couples face in discontinuing PrEP for prevention-effective adherence. Flexible interventions that support individuals during this transition may increase comfort with discontinuing PrEP when alternative prevention strategies provide protection, such as a partner's consistent adherence to ART. "
105,34669062,"HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) remains underutilized in the U.S. Since greater than 85% of PrEP prescriptions are filled at commercial pharmacies, pharmacists are uniquely positioned to increase PrEP use. This scoping review explores pharmacy-based initiatives to increase PrEP use. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Scopus for peer-reviewed studies on pharmacist-led interventions to increase PrEP use or pharmacy-based PrEP initiatives. Forty-nine articles were included in this review. Overall, studies demonstrated that patients expressed strong support for pharmacist prescription of PrEP. Three intervention designs compared changes in PrEP initiation or knowledge pre- and post-intervention. Commentary/review studies recommended PrEP training for pharmacists, policy changes to support pharmacist screening for HIV and PrEP prescription, and telemedicine to increase prescriptions. Pharmacists could play key roles in improving PrEP use in the U.S. Studies that assess improvements in PrEP use after interventions such as PrEP prescription, PrEP-specific training, and adherence monitoring by pharmacists are needed. "
106,26633638,"The review describes the current understanding of adherence to oral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), methods for adherence measurement, approaches to supporting PrEP adherence, and guidance for defining PrEP adherence goals within the larger context of HIV prevention. PrEP adherence has generally been higher in recent trials, open-label extensions, and demonstration projects compared with the initial clinical trials; potential explanations include known PrEP efficacy and different motivations to take PrEP. Recent studies have explored adherence monitoring through electronic pill containers, short message service (SMS), and drug concentrations in hair and dried blood spots. The few PrEP adherence interventions developed to date include combinations of enhanced counseling, feedback of objective adherence measurement, and SMS. Conceptualization of PrEP adherence is evolving. The goal is not 100% adherence indefinitely, as it was in clinical trials. PrEP adherence should be defined with respect to HIV exposure, which varies over time by sexual behavior and use of other prevention strategies. PrEP adherence beyond clinical trials has generally been high enough to achieve reliable HIV prevention. Future efforts to measure and support PrEP adherence should focus on the context of risk for HIV acquisition, accounting for dynamic behaviors and choices among HIV prevention options. "
107,1506505,"In the decade since acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) was first diagnosed, behavioral research has focused intensively on risk reduction change processes and, to a lesser extent, on mental health needs of persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) conditions. Although research to date has yielded important findings for primary prevention efforts and has identified some psychological dimensions relevant to mental health interventions, there is a pressing need for much more systematic intervention outcome research in both the prevention/behavior change and emotional coping areas. Progress in these areas will be facilitated by better linkage of intervention approaches to behavioral theory; identification of intervention elements that produce HIV risk behavior change; evaluated field-testing of promising intervention models; continued focus on populations that remain at risk (such as gay men and injection drug users); and expansion of prevention efforts to urban, poor, and minority populations increasingly threatened as AIDS/HIV enters a ""second wave."" Although AIDS is still a relatively new problem, existing behavioral medicine conceptual models and intervention strategies can be adapted to meet the enormous challenges created by AIDS and HIV infection. "
108,24719201,"This study focuses on psychological differences in risk-taking patterns and their association with risk compensation motivations in the context of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Participants were 257 HIV-negative MSM and transgender women recruited in New York City. The majority of participants (89.5 %, n = 230), could be classified as either: Intimates (40 %), who report unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) only with a main partner believed to be HIV-negative; Trusters (34 %), who engaged in UAI only with casual partners believed to be HIV-negative; and Gamblers (26 %) who report UAI with partners of unknown serostatus. Partner-based classifications were better predictors of HIV risk perception and other traditional correlates of risk-taking (e.g. impulsivity, sexual compulsivity) than rates of UAI. The three groups differed significantly in PrEP-related risk compensation motivations: sexual pleasure (Gamblers), intimacy (Trusters) and partner pressure (Intimates). These data underscore the importance of focusing the psychological dynamics of risk perception and sexual decision-making. "
109,26198345,"After the initial approval of the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2012 for anti-HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), uptake was initially limited, but more recent community surveys and expert opinion suggest wider acceptance in some key populations. Demonstration projects are underway to determine the best practices in the United States to identify at-risk individuals in primary care and sexually transmitted disease clinics who could benefit from PrEP. Studies of PrEP in combination with behavioural interventions are being evaluated. Studies to evaluate the use of PrEP by HIV-uninfected women in HIV-discordant couples interested in safe conception are also getting underway. The optimal deployment of PrEP as part of a comprehensive national HIV/AIDS strategy in the United States has been limited by lack of knowledge among some at-risk people and by some medical providers indicating that they do not feel sufficiently knowledgeable and comfortable in prescribing PrEP. Studies are underway to determine how to assist busy clinicians to determine which of their patients could benefit from PrEP. Although most federal health insurance programmes will cover most of the costs associated with PrEP, underinsured patients in states that have not enacted health reform face additional challenges in paying for PrEP medication and appropriate clinical monitoring. PrEP implementation in the United States is a work in progress, with increasing awareness and uptake among some individuals in key populations. "
110,33678712,"The goal of this study was to assess awareness of, interest in, and sources of knowledge about pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among 1,464 HIV-uninfected patients from public STD clinics in Baltimore. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine factors associated with PrEP awareness and interest. Results suggest PrEP awareness and interest in knowing more about PrEP was highest among men who reported sex with men or with both men and women. White patients were more likely to be aware of PrEP than African American patients, and those reporting consistent condom use were more likely to have heard about PrEP than those who never used condoms. The major source of knowledge about PrEP was health care providers. Findings can inform future prioritization of locally targeted PrEP programs to enhance access to and uptake of PrEP among those most at risk for HIV transmission. "
111,29168695,"Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), using tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), can effectively prevent HIV acquisition. However, TDF can cause changes in bone mineral density (BMD). There is little information on the use of PrEP among patients with bone disease. We present a case report of a female with pre-existing osteoporosis who was prescribed PrEP. Over the course of 9 months of consistent PrEP use, verified by dried blood spot testing, we report a lack of BMD changes on serial dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry scans in this patient. This case can inform PrEP care for patients with pre-existing bone disease. "
112,31675786,"Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective tool for preventing HIV infection among men who have sex with men (MSM), but its cost-effectiveness has varied across settings. Using an agent-based model, we projected the cost-effectiveness of a statewide PrEP program for MSM in Rhode Island over the next decade. In the absence of PrEP, the model predicted an average of 830 new HIV infections over ten years. Scaling up the existing PrEP program to cover 15% of MSM with ten or more partners each year could reduce the number of new HIV infections by 33.1% at a cost of $184,234 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Expanded PrEP use among MSM at high risk for HIV infection has the potential to prevent a large number of new HIV infections but the high drug-related costs may limit the cost-effectiveness of this intervention.

113,33899944,"In healthy conditions, pannexin-1 (Panx-1) channels are in a close state, but in several pathological conditions, including human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) and NeuroHIV, the channel becomes open. However, the mechanism or contribution of Panx-1 channels to the HIV pathogenesis and NeuroHIV is unknown. To determine the contribution of Panx-1 channels to the pathogenesis of NeuroHIV, we used a well-established model of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in macaques (Macaca mulatta) in the presence of and absence of a Panx-1 blocker to later examine the synaptic/axonal compromise induced for the virus. Using Golgi's staining, we demonstrated that SIV infection compromised synaptic and axonal structures, especially in the white matter. Blocking Panx-1 channels after SIV infection prevented the synaptic and axonal compromise induced by the virus, especially by maintaining the more complex synapses. Our data demonstrated that targeting Panx-1 channels can prevent and maybe revert brain synaptic compromise induced by SIV infection. "

115,33633031,"Long-acting pre-exposure prophylaxis (LA-PrEP) formulated as implants and injections are promising prevention method strategies offering simplicity, discretion, and long dose duration. Men are important end users of LA-PrEP, and early assessment of their preferences could enhance downstream male engagement in HIV prevention. A discrete-choice experiment survey was conducted with 406 men, aged 18-24, in Cape Town, South Africa, to assess preferences for 5 LA-PrEP attributes with 2-4 pictorially-depicted levels: delivery form, duration, insertion location, soreness, and delivery facility. Latent class analysis was used to explore heterogeneity of preferences and estimate preference shares. The median age was 21 (interquartile range 19-22), and 47% were men who have sex with men. Duration was the most important product attribute. Latent class analysis identified 3 classes: ""duration-dominant decision makers"" (46%) were the largest class, defined by significant preference for a longer duration product. ""Comprehensive decision makers"" (36%) had preferences shaped equally by multiple attributes and preferred implants. ""Injection-dominant decision makers"" (18%) had strong preference for injections (vs. implant) and were significantly more likely to be men who have sex with men. When estimating shares for a 2-month injection in the buttocks with mild soreness (HPTN regimen) vs. a 6-month implant (to arm) with moderate soreness (current target), 95% of ""injection-dominant decision makers"" would choose injections, whereas 79% and 63% of ""duration-dominant decision makers"" and ""comprehensive decision makers"" would choose implant. Young South African men indicated acceptability for LA-PrEP. Preferences were shaped mainly by duration, suggesting a sizeable market for implants, and underscoring the importance of product choice. Further research into men's acceptability of LA PrEP strategies to achieve engagement in these HIV prevention tools constitutes a priority. "
116,20418131,"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, is a neurotropic lentivirus, and both natural and experimental infections are associated with neuropathology. FIV enters the brain early following experimental infection, most likely via the blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers. The exact mechanism of entry, and the factors that influence this entry, are not fully understood. As FIV is a recognised model of HIV-1 infection, understanding such mechanisms is important, particularly as HIV enters the brain early in infection. Furthermore, the development of strategies to combat this central nervous system (CNS) infection requires an understanding of the interactions between the virus and the CNS. In this review the results of both in vitro and in vivo FIV studies are assessed in an attempt to elucidate the mechanisms of viral entry into the brain. "
117,29257911,"Although pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has dramatically impacted HIV prevention, deep engagement with PrEP-takers' own accounts of their sexual behavior is still rare. We report findings from semi-structured interviews with male participants of the US PrEP Demonstration Project. In their narratives, interviewees variously foregrounded their individual selves, interactions with sexual partners, and the biopolitical and historical context of their lives. PrEP served to discursively integrate the multiple selves populating these stories. We argue that medical anthropological notions can help make sense of men's accounts, and PrEP's role in them, advancing a holistic conception of personhood that includes but transcends concern with HIV. "
118,35904695,"HIV self-testing (HIVST) has the potential to expand access to and uptake of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) delivery. We conducted a systematic literature review to understand the evidence on HIVST use for PrEP delivery. After screening 1055 records, we included eight: three randomized trials and five values and preferences studies. None measured PrEP initiation. Most studies occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa (7/8) and included different populations. One trial found that HIVST use between quarterly clinic visits as part of an adherence package with biofeedback slightly increased adherence; the other two trials found that HIVST use between or in lieu of quarterly clinic visits had no significant or non-inferior effects on adherence. HIVST to support PrEP delivery was acceptable, feasible, and preferred. HIVST use for PrEP continuation largely resulted in similar outcomes to standard-of-care delivery and was perceived acceptable and feasible. Further research is needed to optimize HIVST use within PrEP programming. "
119,31272495,"The introduction of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) prevention in Africa presents new challenges for health systems that are already overburdened because PrEP delivery requires frequent clinic visits (generally every 3 months) for HIV-1 testing and PrEP refills. HIV-1 self-testing (HIVST) has the potential to improve the efficiency of PrEP delivery by decreasing the number of clinic visits. Here, we describe the rationale and design of a randomized, noninferiority trial designed to test the effectiveness and safety of using HIVST to support PrEP delivery in Kenya. The JiPime-JiPrEP (Kiswahili for 'Test Yourself, PrEP Yourself') study is a three-arm randomized trial taking place in Thika, Kenya. Participants (n = 495) are eligible for enrollment if they are at least 18 years old, HIV-1 seronegative, and have been taking PrEP for 1 month. Three distinct participant types will be enrolled: men (n = 165) and women (n = 165) who are in mutually disclosed HIV-1 serodiscordant relationships, and women (n = 165) who are at HIV-1 risk and not in a known serodiscordant relationship. Participants in each of these subpopulations will be 1:1:1 randomized to: 1) the standard of care, with quarterly clinic visits; 2) oral HIVST, with biannual clinic visits plus oral HIVSTs to use at the quarters between those visits; or 3) blood-based HIVST, with biannual clinic visits plus blood-based HIVSTs. All participants will complete quantitative surveys and provide blood samples for the objective measurement of PrEP adherence at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. The primary outcomes are PrEP adherence, PrEP continuation, and HIV-1 testing, measured at 6 months and secondarily at 12 months. The findings from this trial can help to understand how HIVST-a new HIV-1 testing technology-can support health systems in sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, the findings can inform policy aimed at improving the efficiency of PrEP implementation and scale-up in Kenya. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03593629 .

121,1997729,"In conclusion, there is overwhelming evidence that within the CNS the primary sites of active HIV-1 infection are microglia. CNS infection may be related to the normal repopulation of the CNS by monocytes (microglial turnover) that carry latent infection into the CNS. Activation of viral infection may depend upon microglial differentiation, soluble factors (cytokines), and/or coexistent infections. Infection of microglia may disturb the normal hemostatic balance that exists between microglia and other glia, and between microglia and neurons, processes that are only recently being explored at the molecular level. The impact that HIV infection of microglia may have on synaptic integrity is unknown. Cytokines appear to be prime candidates as mediators of some of the adverse effects of microglial infection on other CNS cells, myelin and endothelial cells. "

123,37079900,"HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) delivery at private pharmacies is a promising new differentiated service delivery model that may address barriers to PrEP delivery at public health care facilities. We measured the fidelity of this model (ie, delivery as intended) in a pilot study in Kenya. Five private, retail pharmacies in Kisumu and Thika Counties. Trained pharmacy providers delivered PrEP services, including identifying eligible clients, counseling on HIV risk, assessing PrEP safety, testing for HIV, and dispensing PrEP. Pharmacy clients completed surveys that assessed the fidelity of the services received after each visit. Standardized client actors (ie, mystery shoppers) were trained on 4 different case scripts, then made unannounced pharmacy visits, and then completed a 40-item checklist that assessed the fidelity and quality of service delivery components. From November 2020 to December 2021, 287 clients initiated and 159 (55%) refilled PrEP. At initiation, most clients were counseled on PrEP adherence (99%, 284 of 287) and potential side effects (97%, 279 of 287) and all received provider-assisted HIV self-testing before PrEP dispensing (findings consistent across refill visits). Nine standardized client actors completed 15 pharmacy visits. At each visit, most actors were asked about their behaviors associated with HIV risk (80%, 12/15) and all were counseled on PrEP safety and side effects. All actors reported that pharmacy providers treated them with respect. In this first pilot study of pharmacy-delivered PrEP services in Africa, the fidelity of service delivery was high, suggesting that trained providers at private pharmacies can deliver quality PrEP services.

124,25139057,"Disproportionate HIV/AIDS rates among African American women have been examined extensively, primarily from an individual-centered focus. Beyond individual behaviors, factors such as the hyperincarceration of African American men and geographically concentrated disadvantage may better explain inequitable disease burden. In this article I propose a conceptual model of individual, social, and structural factors that influence HIV transmission among African American women. The model can be used to develop comprehensive assessments and guide prevention programs in African American communities. "
125,22972843,"Drug concentrations associated with protection from HIV-1 acquisition have not been determined. We evaluated drug concentrations among men who have sex with men in a substudy of the iPrEx trial (1). In this randomized placebo-controlled trial, daily oral doses of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were used as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in men who have sex with men. Drug was detected less frequently in blood plasma and in viable cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in HIV-infected cases at the visit when HIV was first discovered compared with controls at the matched time point of the study (8% versus 44%; P < 0.001) and in the 90 days before that visit (11% versus 51%; P < 0.001). An intracellular concentration of the active form of tenofovir, tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP), of 16 fmol per million PBMCs was associated with a 90% reduction in HIV acquisition relative to the placebo arm. Directly observed dosing in a separate study, the STRAND trial, yielded TFV-DP concentrations that, when analyzed according to the iPrEx model, corresponded to an HIV-1 risk reduction of 76% for two doses per week, 96% for four doses per week, and 99% for seven doses per week. Prophylactic benefits were observed over a range of doses and drug concentrations, suggesting ways to optimize PrEP regimens for this population. "
126,32638629,"We examined how traditional masculinity and stigma surrounding HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) affect PrEP interest among Black men who have sex with men (BMSM). One hundred twenty-three men attending a Black Gay Pride event completed measures assessing traditional masculinity, PrEP stigma, and PrEP interest along with two behavioral measures of interest in PrEP. Results demonstrated that avoidance of femininity directly related to interest in PrEP and indirectly through conformity to heterosexual self-presentation. Further, PrEP stigma differentially moderated both of these relationships. Interventions designed to improve engagement of PrEP for BMSM should be attentive to traditional masculinity as a barrier. "
127,8423065,"Microglia are associated with central nervous system (CNS) pathology of both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In AD, microglia, especially those associated with amyloid deposits, have a phenotype that is consistent with a state of activation, including immunoreactivity with antibodies to class II major histocompatibility antigens and to inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1-beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha). Evidence from other studies in rodents indicate that microglia can be activated by neuronal degeneration. These results suggest that microglial activation in AD may be secondary to neurodegeneration and that, once activated, microglia may participate in a local inflammatory cascade that promotes tissue damage and contributes to amyloid formation. In AIDS, microglia are the primary target of retroviral infection. Both ramified and ameboid microglia, in addition to multinucleated giant cells, are infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). The mechanism of microglial infection is not known since microglia lack CD4, the HIV-1 receptor. Microglia display high affinity receptors for immunoglobulins, which makes antibody-mediated viral uptake a possible mechanism of infection. In AIDS, the extent of active viral infection and cytokine production may be critically dependent upon other factors, such as the presence of coinfecting agents. In the latter circumstance, very severe CNS pathology may emerge, including necrotizing lesions. In other circumstances, HIV infection of microglia probably leads to CNS pathology by indirect mechanisms, including release of viral proteins (gp120) and toxic cytokines. Such a mechanism is the best hypothesis for the pathogenesis of vacuolar myelopathy in adults and the diffuse gliosis that characterizes pediatric AIDS, in which very little viral antigen can be detected.

128,19415552,"Disparities related to barriers to caring for HIV-positive and at-risk minorities continue to be a major public health problem. Adaptation of efficacious HIV-prevention interventions for use as health communication innovations is a promising approach for increasing minorities' utilization of HIV health and ancillary services. Role-model stories, a widely-used HIV-prevention strategy, employ culturally tailored narratives to depict experiences of an individual modeling health-risk reduction behaviors. This article describes the careful development of a contextually appropriate role model story focused on increasing minorities' engagement in HIV/AIDS health and related services. Findings from interviews with community members and focus groups with HIV-positive minorities indicated several barriers and facilitators related to engagement in HIV health care and disease management (e.g., patient-provider relationships) and guided the development of role-model story narratives.

129,16670228,"We examine epidemiological and demographic data documenting the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Deep South region of the United States. These data document substantial increases in AIDS cases in the Deep South from 2000 to 2003. In contrast, other US regions are experiencing stable rates or small increases in new AIDS cases. Furthermore, the AIDS epidemic in the Deep South is more concentrated than in other regions among African Americans, women, and rural residents. The Deep South also has some of the highest levels of poverty and uninsured individuals, factors that complicate the prevention and treatment of HIV infection. Further research is needed to determine the cause of the disproportionate rise in AIDS incidence and to develop effective means of preventing HIV infection and providing care of those infected in this region.

130,28819214,"Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of co-morbidity in HIV-1 positive patients, even those in whom plasma virus levels are well-controlled. The pathogenic mechanism of HIV-1-associated cardiomyopathy is unknown, but has been presumed to be mediated indirectly, owing to the absence of productive HIV-1 replication in cardiomyocytes. We sought to investigate the effect of the HIV-1 auxiliary protein, Nef, which is suspected of extracellular release by infected CD4+ T cells on protein quality control and autophagy in cardiomyocytes. After detection of Nef in the serum of HIV-1 positive patients and the accumulation of this protein in human and primate heart tissue from HIV-1/SIV-infected cells we employed cell and molecular biology approaches to investigate the effect of Nef on cardiomyocyte-homeostasis by concentrating on protein quality control (PQC) pathway and autophagy. We found that HIV-1 Nef-mediated inhibition of autophagy flux leads to cytotoxicity and death of cardiomyocytes. Nef compromises autophagy at the maturation stage of autophagosomes by interacting with Beclin 1/Rab7 and dysregulating TFEB localization and cellular lysosome content. These effects were reversed by rapamycin treatment. Our results indicate that HIV-1 Nef-mediated inhibition of cellular PQC is one possible mechanism involved in the development of HIV-associated cardiomyopathy. "
131,29847480,"Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake has lagged among US women. PrEP stigma is a recognized barrier to uptake among men who have sex with men but remains largely unexplored among women. This study examined the pervasiveness of PrEP stigma among US women and its implications for uptake. In a 2017 online survey of Planned Parenthood patients drawn from the 3 cities with the highest numbers of new HIV infections in Connecticut, 597 heterosexually active, HIV-negative, PrEP-inexperienced women reported background characteristics, 2 dimensions of anticipated PrEP stigma (PrEP-user stereotypes and PrEP disapproval by others), and 3 indicators of potential PrEP uptake (interest in learning more about PrEP, intention to use PrEP, and comfort discussing PrEP with a provider). Participants commonly perceived PrEP-user stereotypes, with many believing that others would regard them as promiscuous (37%), HIV-positive (32%), bad (14%), or gay (11%) if they used PrEP. Thirty percent would feel ashamed to disclose PrEP use. Many participants expected disapproval by family (36%), sex partners (34%), and friends (25%). In adjusted analyses, perception of PrEP-user stereotypes was uniquely associated with less comfort discussing PrEP with a provider. Expected PrEP disapproval by others was uniquely associated with less PrEP interest, less intention to use PrEP, and less comfort discussing PrEP with a provider. Exploratory moderation analyses suggested that intention to use PrEP was greatest when participants anticipated low levels of both PrEP-user stereotypes and PrEP disapproval by others. Findings highlight the need for positive messaging targeting potential PrEP users and their social networks to increase PrEP acceptance and uptake. "
132,32109293,"In a pre-exposure prophylaxis program for Kenyan women, we detected tenofovir-diphosphate in 61% (125/201) of randomly selected dried blood spots collected at the first follow-up visit. Tenofovir-diphosphate was detected more frequently among women who had partners living with human immunodeficiency virus, who were not pregnant, and who were ≥24 years. "
133,29524096,"Although pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use is increasing among men who have sex with men (MSM), condoms remain key to HIV prevention. Implementation intentions-which link a behavioral action plan with a situation or cue-may predict condom use. The Strength of Implementation Intentions Scale (SIIS), which assesses condom use implementation intentions, has not been evaluated among MSM. A structural model tested whether the SIIS mediated the relationship between condom use intentions and condomless sex acts among 266 sexually-active MSM (56% White, 26% Black, 15% Latino, M "
134,12453805,"The primary goal of HIV prevention is to prevent as many infections as possible. This requires allocating HIV-prevention resources according to cost effectiveness principles: those activities that prevent more infections per dollar are favored over those that prevent fewer. This is not current practice in the United States, where prevention resources from the federal government to the states flow in proportion to reported AIDS cases. Although such allocations might be considered equitable, more infections could be prevented for the same expenditures were cost-effectiveness principles invoked. The downside of pure cost-effective allocations is that they violate common norms of equity. In this article, we argue for a middle ground that promotes both equity and efficiency in allocating federal HIV-prevention resources. "
135,1925601,"To better understand the basis for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) persistence and latency, the form in which viral DNA exists in the peripheral T lymphocyte reservoir of infected individuals was investigated. In asymptomatic individuals, HIV-1 was harbored predominantly as full-length, unintegrated complementary DNA. These extrachromosomal DNA forms retained the ability to integrate upon T cell activation in vitro. In patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), there was an increase in integrated relative to extrachromosomal DNA forms. By analysis of DNA from patient lymphocyte subpopulations depleted of human lymphocyte antigen-Dr receptor-positive cells, quiescent T cells were identified as the source of extrachromosomal HIV-1 DNA. Thus quiescent T lymphocytes may be a major and inducible HIV-1 reservoir in infected individuals. "
136,15611202,"People living with HIV/AIDS are stigmatized. Although personal and social consequences of this stigmatization have been documented, research regarding its impact on social interactions is scarce. Latinos, and Puerto Ricans in particular, have voiced concern regarding AIDS stigma. The authors investigated the key role of social interaction in the process of stigmatization through in-depth, semistructured interviews in a sample of 30 Puerto Ricans living with HIV/AIDS. Participants reported instances in which AIDS stigma negatively influenced social interactions with family, friends, sexual partners, coworkers, and health professionals. Some of the consequences they described were loss of social support, persecution, isolation, job loss, and problems accessing health services. Findings support the need for interventions to address AIDS stigma and its consequences. "
137,18519882,"Effective treatment regimens for HIV infection demand very high levels of adherence and people infected with HIV are expected to adhere to safer sex and drug use practices throughout their lives. Treatment nonadherence overlaps with continued unsafe sexual practices for some people living with HIV/AIDS. The co-occurrence of nonadherence and HIV transmission risk behavior poses particular risk for the spread of drug-resistant variants of HIV. There are common correlates of both nonadherence and risk behavior, particularly substance use and depression. Interventions designed to address treatment nonadherence and those designed to reduce risk behavior also share common elements, particularly self-efficacy enhancement and behavioral skills training. The common correlates and shared intervention elements suggest that integrated intervention approaches that simultaneously address adherence and risk reduction may be feasible. Research is currently testing interventions that simultaneously increase HIV treatment adherence and reduce behaviors that risk HIV transmission. "
138,25124457,"In the USA, men who have sex with men (MSM) in primary partnerships are at elevated risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a new biomedical prevention strategy, has potential to reduce HIV transmission. This study examined predictors of PrEP adoption intentions among HIV-negative MSM in primary partnerships. The sample included HIV-negative MSM (n = 164) who participated in an ongoing cross-sectional study with an in-person interview examining PrEP adoption intentions. Higher HIV risk perception, intimacy motivations for condomless sex, recent condomless anal sex with outside partners, education, and age were each independently associated with PrEP adoption intentions. In a multivariate model, only age, education, and intimacy motivations for condomless sex were significantly associated with PrEP adoption intentions. Intimacy motivations may play a central role in PrEP adoption for MSM couples. Incorporating relationship dynamics into biomedical strategies is a promising avenue for research and intervention. "
139,21424866,"While well documented in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, neurologic sequelae have not been systematically evaluated in HIV-2. After excluding for confounding comorbidities, 67 individuals from a rural cohort in Guinea-Bissau (22 HIV-2 participants, 45 seronegative controls) were evaluated. HIV + individuals were divided into CD4 < 350 and CD4 ≥ 350 for analysis. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), assessed by the International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS), distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSPN), and myelopathy were the main outcome variables. In univariate analysis, there was no difference in IHDS scores among groups. When analyzed by primary education attainment, IHDS scores were nonsignificantly higher (p = 0.06) with more education. There was no significant difference in DSPN prevalence among groups; overall, 45% of participants had DSPN. There were no cases of myelopathy. In multivariate linear regression, higher IHDS scores were significantly correlated with older age (coefficient = -0.11, p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that older age (odds ratio (OR) 95% CI 1.04-1.20), lower CD4 count (OR 95% CI 0.996-0.999), and higher BMI (OR 95% CI 1.02-1.43) significantly predicted the presence of DSPN. While a significant increase in cognitive impairment was not observed in HIV-2-infected individuals, the study suggests the IHDS may be a less effective screening tool for HAND in settings of lower educational attainment as encountered in rural Guinea-Bissau. Similar to HIV-1, DSPN seems to occur with lower CD4 counts in HIV-2. Further study of the viral-host interactions in HIV-2 and its consequent neurological diseases may provide an avenue for understanding the epidemic problems of HIV-1. "
140,30267365,"Men who have sex with men (MSM) who use websites and smartphone applications to meet sexual partners (""hookup sites"") may be at increased HIV risk. Many sites provide profile options to disclose HIV status and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use. Little is known about the acceptability of disclosure options which may guide sexual decision-making. We evaluated 104 MSM presenting to a publicly-funded STD clinic. Most (86%) had met a partner online in the last 12 months; 55 and 27% reported using the HIV and PrEP disclosure options, respectively. White MSM were less likely to disclose HIV status than MSM of color (46% vs 74%, p < 0.05). Fifty-three percent of men were more likely to contact a potential partner who disclosed being HIV-negative, and 48% were more likely to do so if the person disclosed being on PrEP. Future HIV prevention approaches should promote disclosure options among MSM meeting partners online. "
141,18040840,"Invasion of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) into the central and peripheral nervous system produces a wide range of neurological symptoms, which continue to persist even with adequate therapeutic suppression of the systemic viremia. The development of therapies designed to prevent the neurological complications of HIV require a detailed understanding of the mechanisms of virus penetration into the nervous system, infection, and subsequent neuropathogenesis. These processes, however, are difficult to study in humans. The identification of animal lentiviruses similar to HIV has provided useful models of HIV infection that have greatly facilitated these efforts. This review summarizes contributions made from in vitro and in vivo studies on the infectious and pathological interactions of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) with the nervous system. In vivo studies on FIV have provided insights into the natural progression of CNS disease as well as the contribution of various risk factors. In vitro studies have contributed to our understanding of immune cell trafficking, CNS infection and neuropathogenesis. Together, these studies have made unique contributions to our understanding of (1) lentiviral interactions at the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier within the choroid plexus, (2) early FIV invasion and pathogenesis in the brain, and (3) lentiviral effects on intracellular calcium deregulation and neuronal dysfunction. The ability to combine in vitro and in vivo studies on FIV offers enormous potential to explore neuropathogenic mechanisms and generate information necessary for the development of effective therapeutic interventions. "
142,26034832,"Pediatric human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection remains a global health crisis. Children are much more susceptible to HIV-1 neurological impairments than adults, which can be exacerbated by coinfections. Neurological characteristics of pediatric HIV-1 infection suggest dysfunction in the frontal cortex as well as the hippocampus; limited MRI data indicate global cerebral atrophy, and pathological data suggest accelerated neuronal apoptosis in the cortex. An obstacle to pediatric HIV-1 research is a human representative model system. Host-species specificity of HIV-1 limits the ability to model neurological consequences of pediatric HIV-1 infection in animals. Several models have been proposed including neonatal intracranial injections of HIV-1 viral proteins in rats and perinatal simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of infant macaques. Nonhuman primate models recapitulate the complexity of pediatric HIV-1 neuropathogenesis while rodent models are able to elucidate the role specific viral proteins exert on neurodevelopment. Nonhuman primate models show similar behavioral and neuropathological characteristics to pediatric HIV-1 infection and offer a stage to investigate early viral mechanisms, latency reservoirs, and therapeutic interventions. Here we review the relative strengths and limitations of pediatric HIV-1 model systems. "

144,22333749,"Although the balance of recent evidence supports the efficacy of antiretroviral (ARV)-based pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) against HIV-1 infection, recent negative trial results are perplexing. Of seven trials with available HIV endpoints, three different products have been tested: tenofovir 1% vaginal gel, oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) tablets, and TDF/emtricitabine tablets. Six of these trials were conducted exclusively in sub-Saharan Africa; all found the products to be well tolerated, and four demonstrated effectiveness. Furthermore, the HIV Prevention Trial Network (HPTN) 052 trial recently confirmed that antiretroviral treatment leads to 96% reduction in transmission to HIV-negative partners in HIV-serodiscordant couples. These results, along with human and animal data, provide substantial evidence for the efficacy of antiretroviral-based HIV prevention. Yet assessment of oral TDF/emtricitabine in the FEM-PrEP study and of oral and vaginal tenofovir in the Microbicide Trial Network (MTN)-003 trial (VOICE) was stopped for futility. How do we make sense of these discrepant results? We believe that adherence is a key factor, although it cannot be the only factor. Expanding upon a recent editorial in the Lancet, we discuss the impact of suboptimal product adherence on PrEP efficacy in the context of variable drug concentration at the exposure site, integrity of the vaginal epithelium, and the role of acute infection. "
145,36112336,"Cabotegravir is a potent integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) recently approved as a long-acting injectable formulation for HIV prevention (CAB-LA). We summarize what is known about cabotegravir pharmacokinetics, activity, and emergence of resistance from in vitro, macaque and clinical studies, and we evaluate the risk of resistance from CAB-LA with on-time injections and after CAB-LA discontinuation. The accumulation of multiple INSTI mutations is required for high-level cabotegravir resistance, and the same mutation combinations may cause cross-resistance to dolutegravir, which is widely used for first-line antiretroviral therapy in low- and middle-income countries. Though CAB-LA was highly effective in preventing HIV, breakthrough infections did occur in trials of CAB-LA despite on-time injections, resulting in selection of single and combinations of INSTI resistance mutations. As CAB-LA is scaled-up, prompt HIV diagnosis to prevent resistance, and resistance monitoring could help preserve the effectiveness of INSTIs for both HIV treatment and prevention. "
146,32207327,"Communication around condom use in the context of PrEP services presents a potential conundrum for patients and providers. Within the Partners Scale-Up Project, which supports integration of PrEP delivery in HIV care clinics, we interviewed 41 providers and 61 PrEP users and identified themes relating to condom messaging and use. Most providers counselled PrEP initiators to always use both PrEP and condoms, except when trying to conceive. However, others reported contexts and rationales for not emphasizing condom use. Providers reported that PrEP users were sometimes confused, even frustrated, with their insistence on using condoms in addition to PrEP. PrEP users generally regarded PrEP as a more feasible and desirable HIV prevention method than condoms, enabling increased sexual pleasure and conception, and reducing the conflict and stigma associated with condom use. Innovative approaches to condom counselling in PrEP programs are needed. "
147,22943414,"To date, research on mental health in HIV-affected children (children who have an HIV-positive caregiver or live with the virus themselves) has focused on risk factors associated with the disease. However, simultaneous identification of factors that contribute to resilience in the face of risks is also needed. A greater understanding of modifiable protective processes that contribute to resilience in the mental health of children affected by HIV can inform the design of interventions that bolster naturally occurring supports and contribute to early prevention or better management of risks. We reviewed the recent literature on mental health and resilience in children and adolescents affected by HIV/AIDS. Literature searches of PsycInfo and PubMed were conducted during July-December 2011 consistent with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standards. Qualitative and quantitative studies were included for review if primary research questions pertained to mental health and coping or protective processes in children and families affected by HIV/AIDS. All studies subject to full review were evaluated for quality using a modified Systematic Assessment of Quality in Observational Research (SAQOR) rating system. One hundred and seventy one unique studies were returned from online searches of the literature and bibliography mining. Of these, 29 were evaluated as pertaining directly to mental health and resilience in families and children living with HIV/AIDS. Eight studies presented qualitative analyses. Ten quantitative studies examined individual resources contributing to child resilience and four quantitative studies looked at family-level resources. Ten studies also investigated community level interactions. Four presented findings from resilience-focused interventions. There is a clear need for rigorous research on mental health and resilience in HIV-affected children and adolescents. The evidence base would greatly benefit from more standardized and robust approaches to thinking about resilience from an ecological perspective inclusive of resources at multiple levels and their interactions.

148,31295427,"Evaluation of HIV cure strategies is complicated by defective proviruses that persist in ART-treated patients but are irrelevant to cure. Non-human primates (NHP) are essential for testing cure strategies. However, the persisting proviral landscape in ART-treated NHPs is uncharacterized. Here, we describe viral genomes persisting in ART-treated, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected NHPs, simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-infected NHPs, and humans infected with HIV-2, an SIV-related virus. The landscapes of persisting SIV, SHIV, and HIV-2 genomes are also dominated by defective sequences. However, there was a significantly higher fraction of intact SIV proviral genomes compared to ART-treated HIV-1 or HIV-2 infected humans. Compared to humans with HIV-1, SIV-infected NHPs had more hypermutated genomes, a relative paucity of clonal SIV sequences, and a lower frequency of deleted genomes. Finally, we report an assay for measuring intact SIV genomes which may have value in cure research. "
149,35190430,"Novel mechanisms of service delivery are needed to expand access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention. Providing PrEP directly through pharmacies could offer an additional option for reaching potential users. We conducted a systematic review of studies examining effectiveness, values and preferences of end users and health workers, and cost of PrEP initiation and continuation through pharmacies (pharmacy access). We searched PubMed, CINAHL, LILACS and EMBASE through 2 December 2020. We also searched clinical trial registries and recent HIV conference abstracts. Standardised methods were used to search, screen and extract data from included studies. No studies met the inclusion criteria for the effectiveness review, for either PrEP initiation or continuation. However, six 'case studies' presenting non-comparative data from PrEP pharmacy programmes demonstrated feasibility of this model in the USA. Eleven studies reported values and preferences of end users and health workers. In the USA, Kenya and South Africa, potential PrEP clients generally supported pharmacy access, although some preferred clinics. One study of PrEP pharmacy clients found all would 'definitely recommend' the programme. Six studies found pharmacists were generally supportive of offering PrEP; one study including doctors found more limited favour, while one study of diverse Kenyan stakeholders found broad support. Three studies reported cost data indicating client willingness to pay in the USA and Kenya and initial sustainability of a clinic financial model in the USA. Provision of PrEP through pharmacies has been demonstrated to be feasible in the USA and acceptable to potential end users and stakeholders in multiple settings. Limited evidence on effectiveness and requirements for laboratory testing and assurance of high-quality services may limit enthusiasm for this approach. Further research is needed to determine if pharmacy access is a safe and effective way to help achieve global HIV prevention goals. CRD42021231650. "
150,34874976,"HIV-1 replication within the central nervous system (CNS) impairs neurocognitive function and has the potential to establish persistent, compartmentalized viral reservoirs. The origins of HIV-1 detected in the CNS compartment are unknown, including whether cells within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) produce virus. We measured viral RNA+ cells in CSF from acutely infected macaques longitudinally and people living with early stages of acute HIV-1. Active viral transcription (spliced viral RNA) was present in CSF CD4+ T cells as early as four weeks post-SHIV infection, and among all acute HIV-1 specimens (N = 6; Fiebig III/IV). Replication-inactive CD4+ T cell infection, indicated by unspliced viral RNA in the absence of spliced viral RNA, was even more prevalent, present in CSF of >50% macaques and human CSF at ~10-fold higher frequency than productive infection. Infection levels were similar between CSF and peripheral blood (and lymph nodes in macaques), indicating comparable T cell infection across these compartments. In addition, surface markers of activation were increased on CSF T cells and monocytes and correlated with CSF soluble markers of inflammation. These studies provide direct evidence of HIV-1 replication in CD4+ T cells and broad immune activation in peripheral blood and the CNS during acute infection, likely contributing to early neuroinflammation and reservoir seeding. Thus, early initiation of antiretroviral therapy may not be able to prevent establishment of CNS viral reservoirs and sources of long-term inflammation, important targets for HIV-1 cure and therapeutic strategies.

151,35316471,"Cisgender women, particularly pregnant and postpartum women in Eastern and Southern Africa, face an unacceptably high risk of HIV acquisition. Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective HIV prevention intervention that can reduce HIV acquisition and vertical transmission. In this qualitative study, we interviewed 21 postpartum women from Cape Town, South Africa who initiated PrEP during pregnancy and who self-reported low PrEP adherence or missed > 1 PrEP follow-up collection. We identified multiple overlapping barriers to PrEP continuation and/or adherence. Individual factors included forgetting to take PrEP daily, being away from home when PrEP should be taken, anticipated stigma and limited disclosure of PrEP use. Women also reported pill-related factors such as side effects and having to take PrEP in addition to other tablets during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Facility-related barriers included logistics around PrEP collection especially when not in antenatal care, as well as transport and financial barriers. "

153,24965676,"Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) can reduce HIV incidence among at-risk persons. However, for PrEP to have an impact in decreasing HIV incidence, clinicians will need to be willing to prescribe PrEP. HIV specialists are experienced in using antiretroviral medications, and could readily provide PrEP, but may not care for HIV-uninfected patients. Six focus groups with 39 Boston area HIV care providers were conducted (May-June 2012) to assess perceived barriers and facilitators to prescribing PrEP. Participants articulated logistical and theoretical barriers, such as concerns about PrEP effectiveness in real-world settings, potential unintended consequences (e.g., risk disinhibition and medication toxicity), and a belief that PrEP provision would be more feasible in primary care clinics. They identified several facilitators to prescribing PrEP, including patient motivation and normative guidelines. Overall, participants reported limited prescribing intentions. Without interventions to address HIV providers' concerns, implementation of PrEP in HIV clinics may be limited. "
154,34240317,"Uganda piloted HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for priority populations (sex workers, fishermen, truck drivers, discordant couples) in 2017. To assess facilitators and barriers to PrEP uptake and adherence, we explored perceptions of PrEP before and experiences after rollout among community members and providers in south-central Uganda. We conducted 75 in-depth interviews and 12 focus group discussions. We analyzed transcripts using a team-based thematic framework approach. Partners, family, peers, and experienced PrEP users provided adherence support. Occupational factors hindered adherence for sex workers and fishermen, particularly related to mobility. Pre-rollout concerns about unskilled/untrained volunteers distributing PrEP and price-gouging were mitigated. After rollout, awareness of high community HIV risk and trust in PrEP effectiveness facilitated uptake. PrEP stigma and unexpected migration persisted as barriers. Community-initiated, tailored communication with successful PrEP users may optimize future engagement by addressing fears and rumors, while flexible delivery and refill models may facilitate PrEP continuation and adherence. En 2017, Uganda introdujo profilaxis pre-exposición (PrEP), dirigida a las populaciones con alto riesgo de contraer al VIH (trabajadoras sexuales, pescadores, camioneros, parejas sero-discordantes). Para investigar facilitadores y barreras para la adopción y la adherencia a la PrEP, exploramos percepciones de PrEP antes y después de su introducción en Uganda. Realizamos 75 entrevistas y 12 grupos focales con miembros de la comunidad y trabajadores de salud. Analizamos las transcripciones temáticamente usando un marco de referencia. Parejas, familias, compañeros, y clientes usando PrEP apoyaron a los demás mantener adherencia. Movilidad fue una barrera para la adherencia a la PrEP para trabajadoras sexuales y pescadores. Preocupaciones sobre el entrenamiento de los distribuidores de PrEP y la especulación de precios no fueron realizadas. Percepciones del riesgo del VIH y confianza en la eficacia de PrEP facilitaron su adopción. Estigma y migración inesperada persistieron como barreras para la adopción de PrEP. Comunicaciones manejadas por clientes usando PrEP pueden motivar interés en PrEP y abordar rumores. Sistemas flexibles del entrego y la recarga de medicinas pueden permitir continuación de, y adherencia a, la PrEP. "
155,17589187,"To determine whether higher viral concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or peripheral blood were associated with greater severity of cognitive impairment in HIV-1-seropositive subjects with cognitive-motor impairment. Cognitive performance measurements and viral load were obtained from HIV-1-seropositive individuals with cognitive-motor impairment entering a clinical trial before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). CSF viral load (UltraSensitive Roche HIV-1 Monitor test with detection limit of 50 copies/ml) was available from 179 patients, and peripheral (plasma or serum) viral load from 111 patients. Of these patients, 62% met the 1993 Centers for Disease Control (CDC) criteria for AIDS, and 19% had clinically significant cognitive impairment (i.e., global deficit score > or = 0.5). Possible associations between viral load and cognitive scores were examined with general linear regression models with and without adjustment for age, education, study site, antiretroviral use, CD4 cell count, and CDC stage. The mean CSF viral load was 2.83 log(10)/ml +/- 0.94 (SD) (undetectable in 19.5%). Mean peripheral viral load was 4.11 log(10)/ml +/- 0.90 (SD). No statistically significant associations emerged between either CSF or peripheral viral load and the global deficit score, or any of the seven cognitive domain deficit scores. Among these HIV-1-sero-positive individuals with mainly minor HIV-1-associated cognitive deficits and not receiving HAART, no association between CSF or blood concentration of HIV-1 RNA and cognitive performance could be found. These results suggest that the severity of HIV-1-associated cognitive impairment is not directly related to concurrent viral concentration in the CSF or the peripheral blood. "
156,31707556,"Many recent studies have compared men currently taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to men not taking PrEP. However, less is known about demographic, behavioral, and geographic characteristics of men formerly, but not currently, taking PrEP. Using a 2017-2018 U.S. national, internet-based sample (n = 10,504) of men, transmen, and transwomen who have sex with men, we compared three groups based on their PrEP experiences. Results highlight individual-level financial and geo-contextual barriers to PrEP use that can inform prevention efforts to improve PrEP initiation and continuation for both PrEP-naïve and PrEP-experienced individuals, respectively. Muchos estudios recientes han comparado a hombres que actualmente toman PrEP con hombres que no toman PrEP. Sin embargo, se conoce menos sobre las características demográficas, conductuales y geográficas de los hombres que antes, pero no actualmente, tomaban PrEP. Utilizando una muestra nacional de los EE. UU. obtenida de Internet entre el 2018–2018 (n = 10,504) de hombres, hombres transgénero y mujeres transgénero que tienen sexo con hombres, comparamos tres grupos basado en sus experiencias con PrEP. Los resultados destacan barreras financieras a nivel individual, y barreras geo-contextuales al uso de PrEP que pueden informar los esfuerzos de prevención para mejorar la iniciación y la continuación de PrEP tanto de individuos sin experiencia previa con PrEP como y aquellos con experiencia, respectivamente.

157,34561792,"With oral antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) rollout expanding to include adolescents in South Africa, research is needed to better understand perceptions of PrEP acceptability among adolescents and clinical service providers. We conducted an exploratory mixed-methods study among 57 adolescents, 16-17 years of age, living with and without HIV, and 25 clinical service providers in Cape Town, South Africa from 2015 to 2016. Cross-sectional survey and semi-structured qualitative interview data were used to explore (1) willingness to use PrEP and support partner PrEP use among adolescents living with and without HIV, (2) willingness to prescribe or support prescription of PrEP among service providers, and (3) perceptions of barriers and facilitators to PrEP implementation and interpretations of PrEP efficacy messaging for adolescent HIV prevention among all participants. Acceptability of PrEP among participants was high. Support for PrEP uptake was linked to messages that positively framed PrEP's protection potential (i.e., success- versus failure-framed messaging) among both adolescents and providers. Adolescents living without HIV endorsed high willingness to use PrEP and adolescents living with HIV endorsed high support for partner PrEP use. However, both groups noted that potential side effects, stigma, and PrEP's partial efficacy may hinder uptake. Clinical service providers endorsed PrEP for sexually active adolescents and shared stigma and efficacy concerns. Further, service providers expressed desire for adolescent-tailored training and integration of PrEP delivery into primary care and family planning services. Efforts to educate adolescents and service providers about PrEP should consider how message framing may influence acceptability. Community PrEP education and adolescent-friendly delivery should be prioritized to alleviate predicted PrEP stigma and facilitate uptake. "
158,33826022,"As countries scale up pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention, diverse PrEP delivery models are needed to expand access to populations at HIV risk that are unwilling or unable to access clinic-based PrEP care. To identify factors that may influence implementation of retail pharmacy-based PrEP delivery in Kenya, we conducted in-depth interviews with 40 pharmacy clients, 16 pharmacy providers, 16 PrEP clients, and 10 PrEP providers from two provinces. Most participants expressed strong support for expanding PrEP to retail pharmacies, though conditioned their acceptance on assurances that care would be private, respectful, safe, and affordable. Participant-reported determinants of feasibility centered primarily on ensuring that the intervention is compatible with retail pharmacy operations (e.g., staffing levels, documentation requirements). Future research is needed to develop and test tailored packages of implementation strategies that are most effective at integrating PrEP delivery into routine pharmacy practice in Kenya and other high HIV prevalence settings. Ya que varios países están ampliando sus programas de profilaxis previa a la exposición al VIH (PrEP, por sus siglas en inglés), se necesitan modelos diversos para ampliar el acceso a poblaciones que no están dispuestos a acceder, o que no pueden acceder, a los servicios de PrEP que se ofrecen en las instalaciones de salud. Para identificar los factores que pueden influir en la prestación de servicios de PrEP a través de farmacias privadas, realizamos entrevistas en profundidad con 40 clientes de farmacia, 16 proveedores de servicios de farmacia, 16 usuarios de PrEP, y 10 proveedores de PrEP. La mayoría de los participantes manifestó su firme apoyo a la propuesta de expandir la provisión de PrEP a las farmacias privadas, aunque condicionó su aceptación a la garantía de que la atención sea privada, respetuosa, segura, y asequible. Según los participantes, los factores determinantes de la viabilidad de ofrecer PrEP en las farmacias privadas se centran en asegurar de que la intervención sea compatible con las operaciones de las farmacias privadas (p. ej., el número de personal, los requisitos de documentación). Se necesitan investigaciones adicionales para desarrollar y evaluar diferentes paquetes de estrategias de implementación para descubrir cuáles son los más eficaces para integrar los servicios de PrEP en la prestación rutinaria de servicios de farmacia tanto en Kenia como en otros lugares de alta prevalencia del VIH.

159,20367240,"The interplay between pathology and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) expansion in brain tissues has not been thoroughly assessed in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era. HIV-associated dementia (HAD) is marked by progressive brain infection due to recruitment and migration of macrophages in brain tissues; however, the cellular and viral events occurring prior to HAD development and death are under debate. In this study, 66 brain tissues from 11 autopsies were analyzed to assess HIV-1 DNA concentration in brain tissues. In most patients without HAD, it was impossible to amplify HIV-1 from brain tissues. Amplifiable DNA was obtained from three cases of patients on HAART who died due to primary pathology other than HAD: (1) cardiovascular disease, a disease associated with HAART therapy; (2) bacterial infections, including Mycobacterium avium complex, rapid occurrence of extreme dementia; and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related lymphoma with meningeal involvement. HIV-1 DNA was also amplified from multiple tissues of two HAD patients. Analysis of HIV-1 nef, gp120, and gp41 sequences showed reduced viral evolution within brain tissues for the non-HAD cases relative to patients with clinical and histological HAD. The present study is the first to show a potential correlation between HIV-1 evolutionary patterns in the brain and different neuropathologies. "
160,37415442,"Despite the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Mississippi, access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is mostly limited to urban areas. Remote PrEP care via telemedicine, HIV self-testing, and prescription mail delivery can improve care in underserved communities. This mixed methods study assessed the acceptability and feasibility of using remote PrEP care, compared to alternatives. This consisted of (1) a cross-sectional survey and (2) interviews. PrEP-eligible adults were recruited from community-based organizations across Mississippi while accessing HIV testing between December 2019 and May 2022. Those surveyed (n = 63) indicated the greatest comfort in receiving PrEP via mail delivery ( "
161,35703760,"Strengthening HIV prevention services is a key priority of the Ending the HIV Epidemic plan. Informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we examined HIV testers' perceived barriers and facilitators to implementing HIV prevention services, including testers' strengths and weaknesses; enabling factors within the inner and outer settings; and willingness to adopt potential implementation strategies. In 2019, the Penn Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) partnered with the Philadelphia Department of Public Health (PDPH) to examine system-level challenges and opportunities experienced by PDPH-funded HIV testers (individuals conducting HIV testing) in Philadelphia. We recruited HIV testers to complete 2 web surveys (n ≈ 40 each) and in-depth interviews (n = 11). Testers self-reported high HIV testing self-efficacy and competence, despite identifying gaps in their knowledge of STI testing, reporting moderate willingness to recommend pre-exposure prophylaxis, and having insufficient cultural competency when working with priority populations. Testers indicated that educational materials and policies within their agencies might require realignment to affirm sexual and gender minority clients. In qualitative interviews, testers noted challenges to implementing PDPH priorities because limited funding fueled competition between local agencies, deterred interagency partnerships, and limited their ability to serve key populations locally. HIV testers are critical partners in addressing agency-level barriers to HIV prevention service provision through multilevel implementation strategies. In partnership with PDPH, we will create and implement a train-the-trainers program consisting of skill-building activities, technical assistance, and capacity-building for all agency personnel to address missed opportunities in HIV prevention. These activities will reinforce scalability and sustainability of PDPH-supported HIV prevention programs. "
162,9697940,"Protease inhibitor combination therapies can reduce HIV viral load, improve immune system functioning, and decrease mortality from AIDS. These medical developments raise a host of critical new issues for behavioral research on HIV/AIDS. This article reviews developments in HIV combination therapy regimens and behavioral factors involved in these regimens and focuses on four key behavioral research areas: (a) the development of interventions to promote treatment adherence, (b) psychological coping with HIV/AIDS in the context of new treatments for the disease, (c) the possible influence of treatment on continued risk behavior, and (d) behavioral research in HIV prevention and care policy areas. Advances in HIV medical care have created important new opportunities for health psychologists to contribute to the well-being of persons with HIV/AIDS. "
163,36807245,"Given poor adherence to treatment and prevention techniques, condomless sex jeopardizes adolescents and young adults (AYA) with perinatally-acquired HIV-infection (PHIV) or perinatal HIV-exposure who are uninfected (PHEU). We examined condomless sex and its association with PHIV-status, psychiatric disorder, and sociodemographics. Data come from a US-based study of primarily Black and Latinx AYAPHIV and AYAPHEU (N = 340). Linear regression models examined condomless sex longitudinally by PHIV-status, psychiatric trajectories, and sociodemographics. Rates of viremia (AYAPHIV) and PrEP use (AYAPHEU) were assessed. 56% of participants reported recent condomless sex, with higher prevalence among: AYAPHEU vs. AYAPHIV (24% vs. 19%, p = 0.017); Latinx vs. non-Latinx AYA (25% vs. 17%, p = 0.014); and AYA with increasing psychiatric comorbidity (44%) and consistent anxiety (23%) vs. low-level disorder (17%; p < 0.05). AYAPHIV had high rates of unsuppressed viral load and AYAPHEU limited PrEP use. Preventing condomless sex is challenging within AYAPHIV and AYAPHEU. Developing accessible combination HIV/mental health interventions is much-needed. "
164,33535887,"Since the beginning of the HIV epidemic in the USA, effective interventions to reduce HIV risk among cisgender women have been lacking. Although oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective in pharmacologically preventing HIV infection, there is a gap between the recommended use of PrEP and PrEP uptake among eligible women. This study aimed to identify the role of patient-provider communication in PrEP decision-making among women considering PrEP. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 41 PrEP-eligible women in Philadelphia and New York City. A thematic analysis of the responses was conducted, and a conceptual model developed and confirmed as analysis continued. Of the women interviewed, 53.6% were African American and 29.3% were Latina. Women noted that having a trusting relationship with their health care provider, receiving a tailored recommendation for PrEP based upon their specific needs and using their health care provider as support were crucial facilitators of PrEP decision-making. Lack of provider knowledge about PrEP, perceived health care provider stigma about their drug use and sexual activity, and lack of care continuity were all identified as barriers to effective communication. Study findings can inform future interventions to enhance patient-provider communication about PrEP and increase PrEP uptake among women. "
165,39272987,"Blood-brain barrier (BBB) injury and dysfunction following infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) enables viral entry into the brain, infection of resident brain cells, neuronal injury and subsequent neurodegeneration leading to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Although combination antiretroviral therapy has significantly reduced the incidence and prevalence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and increased the life expectancy of people living with HIV, the prevalence of HAND remains high. With aging of people living with HIV associated with increased comorbidities, the prevalence of HIV-related central nervous system (CNS) complications is expected to remain high. Considering the principal role of the brain endothelium in HIV infection of the CNS and HAND, the purpose of this manuscript is to review the current literature on the pathobiology of the brain endothelium structural and functional dysregulation in HIV infection, including in the presence of HIV-1 and viral proteins (gp120, Tat, Nef, and Vpr). We summarize evidence from human and animal studies, in vitro studies, and associated mechanisms. We further summarize evidence of synergy or lack thereof between commonly abused substances (cocaine, methamphetamine, alcohol, tobacco, opioids, and cannabinoids) and HIV- or viral protein-induced BBB injury and dysfunction.

166,23903845,"We compared the plasma viromes of HIV-infected subjects with low versus high CD4(+) T cell counts from the United States and Uganda by using deep sequencing and detected HIV, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, GB virus C, anellovirus, and human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) reads. An increase in the proportion of reads for anelloviruses, a family of highly prevalent and genetically diverse human viruses, was seen in subjects with AIDS from both countries. The proportion of endogenous human retrovirus reads was increased in AIDS subjects from Uganda but not the United States. Progression to AIDS is therefore associated with changes in the plasma concentration of commensal viruses. "
167,22999095,"Standard methods used to estimate HIV-1 population diversity are often resource intensive (e.g., single genome amplification, clonal amplification and pyrosequencing) and not well suited for large study cohorts. Additional approaches are needed to address the relationships between intraindividual HIV-1 genetic diversity and 2 disease. With a small cohort of individuals, we validated three methods for measuring diversity: Shannon entropy and average pairwise distance (APD) using single genome sequences, and counts of mixed bases (i.e. ambiguous nucleotides) from population based sequences. In a large cohort, we then used the mixed base approach to determine associations between measure HIV-1 diversity and HIV associated disease. Normalized counts of mixed bases correlated with Shannon Entropy at both the nucleotide (rho=0.72, p=0.002) and amino acid level (rho=0.59, p=0.015), and APD (rho=0.75, p=0.001). Among participants who underwent neuropsychological and clinical assessments (n=187), increased HIV-1 population diversity was associated with both a diagnosis of AIDS and neuropsychological impairment.

In the brain, lentiviruses replicate principally in microglia and trafficking macrophages. The impact of ART on this viral reservoir is unknown. We investigated the activity of contemporary ART in various models of lentivirus brain infection. HIV-1 RNA and total and integrated DNA were detected in cerebral cortex from all PWH ( "
169,29327091,"Individual perceptions of HIV risk influence willingness to use pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention. Among men who have sex with men (MSM) and male sex workers (MSWs), temporal or episodic changes in risk behavior may influence perceived risk and PrEP acceptability over time. We investigated fluctuations in perceived HIV risk and PrEP acceptability, comparing MSWs against MSM who do not engage in sex work. We conducted 8 focus groups (n = 38) and 56 individual interviews among MSM and MSWs in Providence, RI. Perceived HIV risk shaped willingness to use PrEP among both MSWs and MSM who did not engage in sex work, and risk perceptions changed over time depending on behavior. For MSWs, perceived risk cycled according to patterns of substance use and sex work activity. These cycles yielded an ""access-interest paradox"": an inverse relationship between willingness to use and ability to access PrEP. MSM who did not engage in sex work also reported temporal shifts in risk behavior, perceived risk, and willingness to use PrEP, but changes were unrelated to access. MSM attributed fluctuations to seasonal changes, vacations, partnerships, behavioral ""phases,"" and episodic alcohol or drug use. Efforts to implement PrEP among MSM and street-based MSWs should address temporal changes in willingness to use PrEP, which are linked to perceived risk. Among MSWs, confronting the access-interest paradox may require intensive outreach during high-risk times and efforts to address low perceived risk during times of reduced sex work. "

Patients who were HIV+ and had clinically significant fatigue (according to the Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS]) were included in a 4-week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. This was followed by an additional 8 weeks of open-label treatment for modafinil responders and 12 weeks for placebo nonresponders. The primary outcome measure for fatigue and depression was the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale, supplemented by the FSS, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory. Safety was assessed with assays of CD4 cell count and HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load. Visits were weekly for 4 weeks, then biweekly, with a follow-up visit at 6 months. Maximum trial dose of modafinil was 200 mg/d. Data for this study were collected between December 2004 and December 2008. 115 patients were randomly assigned. In intention-to-treat analyses, fatigue response rate to modafinil was 73% and to placebo, 28%. Attrition was 9%. Modafinil did not have an effect on mood alone in the absence of improved energy. At week 4, CD4 cell counts did not change significantly; HIV RNA viral load showed a trend decline for patients taking modafinil but not for those taking placebo. At 6 months, those still taking modafinil had more energy and fewer depressive symptoms than patients who were not taking modafinil, and only those still taking modafinil showed a significant decline from baseline in their HIV RNA viral load. Modafinil appears to be effective and well tolerated in treating fatigue in HIV+ patients. Consideration of its use is warranted considering the high prevalence of fatigue in the HIV community, its minimal side effects, and overall patient acceptance. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00118378.

174,37196008,"HIV disproportionately affects Black/African American cisgender women (hereafter women) in the United States. Despite its proven effectiveness, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention remains vastly under-prescribed to women based on their need. Increasing PrEP uptake and persistence among women is crucial to reducing HIV transmission; however, there have been few studies designed specifically for women. This article describes the study protocol used to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of implementation strategies to improve PrEP uptake and persistence among Black women in the Midwest and South. PrEP Optimization among Women to Enhance Retention and Uptake (POWER Up) is an evidence-based, woman-focused set of five implementation science strategies that addresses barriers of PrEP utilization at the provider, patient, and clinic levels. POWER Up includes 1) routine PrEP education for patients, 2) standardized provider training, 3) electronic medical record (EMR) optimization, 4) PrEP navigation, and 5) PrEP clinical champions. These strategies will be adapted to specific clinics for implementation, tested via a stepped-wedge trial, and, if effective, packaged for further dissemination. We will utilize a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial (SW-CRT) to measure change in PrEP utilization across diverse geographic areas. Preparation for adapting and implementing the bundle of strategies is needed to determine how to tailor them to specific clinics. Implementation challenges will include adapting strategies with the available resources at each site, maintaining stakeholder involvement and staff buy-in, adjusting the study protocol and planned procedures as needed, and ensuring minimal crossover. Additionally, strengths and limitations of each strategy must be examined before, during, and after the adaptation and implementation processes. Finally, the implementation outcomes of the strategies must be evaluated to determine the real-world success of the strategies. This study is an important step toward addressing the inequity in PrEP service delivery and increasing PrEP utilization among Black women in the U.S. "
175,25972502,"Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) has been shown to be effective in preventing transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A dose-response relationship between adherence and HIV transmission is illustrated in the current PrEP literature, and adherence interventions for PrEP may be useful, although currently few effective programs have been developed and tested. There is a paucity of randomized controlled trials testing PEP adherence interventions, and further research is needed. We conclude by proposing the importance of tailoring adherence counseling to address psychosocial factors and mental health stressors that may negatively affect adherence. "
176,8267298,"Children with AIDS frequently have neurological manifestations due to complications of immunodeficiency or intrinsic effects of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) on the central nervous system (CNS). The most common neurological disorders not directly related to HIV-1 infection include cerebrovascular disease and lymphoma. Global anoxic-ischemic and necrotizing encephalopathies are frequent, while CNS hemorrhages and arteriopathies are less frequent. Opportunistic CNS infections are uncommon, limited predominantly to monilial and cytomegaloviral encephalitides. Only a few cases of CNS toxoplasmosis have been reported in children. CNS lymphomas often occur in the setting of systemic polymorphous, polyclonal B-cell proliferations that have been associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. Intrinsic effects of HIV-1 on the CNS include microcephaly, diffuse gliosis, basal ganglia mineralization, HIV encephalitis, and corticospinal tract degeneration. Although viral antigens can be detected in microglia and multinucleated cells in HIV encephalitis, most of the CNS effects of HIV-1 infection cannot be attributed to detectable levels of viral antigen, suggesting that the pediatric CNS is unusually susceptible to low-level HIV-1 infection or to systemic effects of HIV-1 infection, possibly mediated by soluble factors, including the inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which have been shown to be increased in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of children with AIDS.

177,32860114,"The effects of mental health comorbidities and social support on the HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) care continuum are unknown. We conducted a cross-sectional study of men and transgender individuals, ≥ 18 years-old, with ≥ 2 male or transgender partners, or recent condomless anal intercourse. Surveys assessed demographics, mental health treatment, depressive symptomatology, social support, and PrEP-related social contacts. Logistic regression assessed associations between these factors and PrEP uptake and persistence. Participants (n = 247) were 89% cis-male and 46% African-American. Median age was 27 (IQR:23-33). Thirty-seven percent had ever used PrEP, of whom 18% discontinued use. High depressive symptomology was identified in 11% and 9% were receiving mental health treatment. There were no significant associations between depressive symptoms or mental health treatment on the odds of PrEP uptake or discontinuation. Each additional PrEP contact conferred a greater odds of uptake (aOR:1.24, 95% CI: 1.09-1.42). Network-level targets may produce fruitful interventions to increase PrEP uptake. "

179,31584857,"Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has the potential to significantly reduce HIV incidence among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States. However, the extent to which suboptimal PrEP adherence and retention in care may limit successful implementation is unknown. An agent-based model was used to represent the entire population of MSM in Rhode Island from 2013 to 2017. The impact of potential interventions to improve PrEP adherence and retention in care on HIV transmission was evaluated. Demographics, behaviors, and PrEP adherence and retention in care rates were based on local clinical data. We assumed that 20% of HIV-negative MSM had ever taken PrEP. The primary outcome was HIV incidence over the 5-year period. The model included 23,815 MSM with an estimated 4.1% HIV prevalence based on local surveillance data. An estimated 173.1 new infections occurred over 5 years [95% simulation interval (SI): 171.5-174.7], including 29.1 new infections among individuals who had ever initiated PrEP (95% SI: 28.6-29.7). Interventions that improved retention in PrEP care by an odds of 5.0 compared with the base case maximized reductions in HIV incidence among MSM who had ever initiated PrEP by 37.5%. Interventions focusing on improving PrEP adherence had little to no effect on HIV incidence, regardless of intervention efficacy. Retention in care is a critical component of the PrEP care continuum. Interventions that improve retention in PrEP care may lead to greater reductions in population-level HIV incidence compared with interventions focused exclusively on adherence. "
180,33791880,"Training lay health workers is a critical intervention strategy to support HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) implementation. However, few evaluations of such trainings have been published. We conducted multi-time-point surveys to evaluate the effect of a training intervention on knowledge, PrEP stigma, and implementation behavior among lay HIV workers in China. Results indicated high acceptability and appropriateness of the training. PrEP knowledge score increased by 65% from pre- to post-training, and remained high one-month post-training. We observed a significant decrease in PrEP stigma and a positive influence on determinants of implementation behaviors. All lay HIV workers surveyed one-month after the training reported having disseminated PrEP information in social networks; 43% reported integrating PrEP education into routine work. The training is an effective strategy to build lay HIV workers' capacity in PrEP implementation. Longer-term post-training follow up would be ideal to further assess actual PrEP uptake and sustained effects on PrEP implementation. "
181,30953305,"We conducted a records-based cohort study of patients who initiated pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) at a large federally qualified health center in Los Angeles, CA to characterize patterns of PrEP use, identify correlates of PrEP discontinuation, and calculate HIV incidence. Of 3121 individuals initiating PrEP between 2014 and 2017, 42% (n = 1314) were active (i.e., had a current PrEP prescription) in April 2018. HIV incidence was 0.1/100 person-years among active PrEP patients, compared to 2.1/100 person-years among patients who discontinued. Compared to patients accessing PrEP through government programs with no prescription copay, risk of discontinuation was higher among those with private insurance (ARR = 1.4, 95% CI 1.2, 1.7), or no insurance (ARR = 4.5, 95% CI 3.2, 6.4). Sixty-three percent of active PrEP patients had gaps between PrEP prescriptions, averaging one gap per year (median length = 65 days). Increasing access to free or low-cost PrEP can improve PrEP continuity. Llevamos a cabo un estudio de cohorte basada en registros de pacientes quienes iniciaron profilaxis preexposición (PrEP) en un centro de salud grande y federalmente calificado en Los Ángeles, CA para caracterizar patrones del uso de PrEP, identificar correlaciones de la discontinuación de PrEP y calcular la incidencia de VIH.

182,32692101,"HIV testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are effective HIV prevention strategies often underused by transgender people. Recruitment occurred in 2 phases to identify transgender respondents in a probability sample of adults in the United States. Transgender respondents completed a self-administered paper or web-based survey designed to assess transgender population health. Sexually active respondents (HIV-negative and had sex in the 5 years previously, N = 190) and a subsample of those at risk for sexual HIV acquisition (sex with cisgender men or transgender women, n = 120) were included in analyses. Of the full sample of sexually active respondents, those who were transfeminine were less likely to be familiar with PrEP; most (72%) reported favorable attitudes toward PrEP. Of those at risk for HIV acquisition, 23% had never tested for HIV. Respondents of color were more likely than white respondents to meet Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for HIV testing. Respondents who met Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for HIV testing were more likely to report looking online for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender or transgender-specific health information. Few respondents reported currently taking PrEP (3%); those who reported higher levels of nonaffirmation of their gender identity were less likely to currently use PrEP. These findings may indicate some success of HIV testing outreach programs that prioritize people at higher risk for acquiring HIV, focusing on those who are vulnerable to structural marginalization. Ongoing public health efforts are needed to increase HIV testing and PrEP awareness among transgender adults, who are disproportionately impacted by HIV. "
183,36219270,"Data on challenges with pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake and adherence among Kenyan gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) are limited. In this mixed-methods sequential explanatory design study, our quantitative phase followed 157 at-risk, HIV-negative GBMSM who accepted PrEP and enrolled in a cohort with 12-month follow-up. Stored dried blood spots collected at two intervals were batch tested for tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) concentrations at study end. Despite high self-reported adherence, only 14.6% of individuals had protective TFV-DP levels at any visit. Protective TFV-DP levels were positively associated with injection drug use and a self-assessed moderate risk of acquiring HIV, and negatively associated with time since enrolment. In our subsequent qualitative phase, an intensive workshop was conducted with the GBMSM community to identify barriers and facilitators to PrEP uptake and adherence. These data revealed numerous challenges with traditional PrEP programs that must be addressed through community collaborations. La evidencia respecto a desafíos existentes con aceptación y adherencia de la profilaxis previa a la exposición (PrEP) de VIH, entre los hombres homosexuales, bisexuales y otros hombres que tienen sexo con hombres (GBMSM) en Kenia es limitada. Condujimos un estudio de métodos mixtos y diseño explicativo secuencial. En la fase cuantitativa seguimos a 157 GBMSM VIH-negativos en riesgo que aceptaron PrEP y se inscribieron en una cohorte con un seguimiento de 12 meses. Analizamos, por lotes y al final del estudio, gotas de sangre seca recolectada a dos intervalos de tiempo y previamente almacenada, para determinar las concentraciones de difosfato de tenofovir (TFV-DP). A pesar de la alta adherencia autoinformada, solo el 14,6% de las personas tenían niveles protectores de TFV-DP en alguna visita. Los niveles protectores de TFV-DP se asociaron positivamente con el uso de drogas inyectables y un riesgo moderado autoevaluado de contraer el VIH, y negativamente con el tiempo transcurrido desde la inscripción. En la fase cualitativa posterior, conversamos con GBMSM de la comunidad para identificar las barreras y los facilitadores para la concientización, aceptación, adherencia y retención a PrEP. Estos datos revelaron numerosos desafíos con los programas tradicionales de PrEP que deben abordarse mediante colaboraciones comunitarias. "
184,2181004,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of AIDS, was the second retrovirus to be associated with human diseases. The unique life cycle of retroviruses involves reverse transcription of their RNA to DNA, which is incorporated into their host's genes. HIV, despite its small genome, contains multiple structural and regulatory genes, the latter controlling the rate of viral replication. Experimental vaccines are aimed at inhibiting binding of HIV to host cells. Azidothymidine (AZT) and other nucleoside analogues inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme. HIV induces profound and specific immunosuppression by depleting helper lymphocytes that bear the cluster determinant 4 (CD4, formerly T4). The clinical course of HIV infection is mainly determined by the number of CD4 lymphocytes in the blood. A comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to patient management can reduce the adverse medical, psychosocial, and economic impact of AIDS. "
185,33624193,"Nearly a decade after becoming formally available in the U.S., HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) remains underutilized by populations at risk for HIV acquisition. The next generation of PrEP research is pivoting toward implementation research in order to identify the most impactful avenues for scaling up PrEP uptake. Rapid identification of patients who may be at risk for HIV in primary care settings and the ability to provide brief consultation and prescription or referral for PrEP could help to increase PrEP uptake. The current study aimed to develop and pilot-test a PrEP screening instrument that could be integrated into the workflow of busy primary care clinics to help facilitate PrEP uptake among at-risk men. During the study, PrEP screening occurred for 12 months in two primary care clinics nested within a large integrated healthcare delivery system in Southern California. An interrupted time series analysis found a significant increase in PrEP referrals overall during the screening intervention period as compared to the preceding 12 months. Findings suggest that brief HIV risk screening in primary care is acceptable, feasible, and shows preliminary effects in increasing PrEP referral rates for Black and Hispanic/Latinx men. Casi una década después de estar disponible formalmente en los EE.UU., la profilaxis previa a la exposición al VIH (PrEP) sigue siendo subutilizada por las poblaciones en riesgo de contraer VIH. La próxima generación de investigación de PrEP está girando hacia la investigación de implementación con el fin de identificar las vías de mayor impacto para ampliar el consumo de PrEP. La identificación rápida de los pacientes que pueden estar en riesgo de contraer VIH en entornos de atención primaria y la capacidad de proporcionar una consulta breve y prescripción o referencia para PrEP podría ayudar a aumentar el consumo de PrEP. El estudio actual tuvo como objetivo desarrollar y probar un instrumento de detección de PrEP que podría integrarse en el flujo de trabajo de las clínicas de atención primarias concurridas para ayudar a facilitar el consumo de PrEP entre los hombres en riesgo. Durante el estudio, la detección de PrEP se realizó durante 12 meses en dos clínicas de atención primaria ubicadas dentro de un gran sistema integrado de prestación de atención médica en el sur de California. Un análisis de series de tiempo interrumpido encontró un aumento significativo en las referencias de PrEP en general durante el periodo de intervención de detección en comparación con los 12 meses anteriores. Los hallazgos sugieren que la detección breve del riesgo de VIH en la atención primara es aceptable, factible y muestra efectos preliminares en el aumento de las tasas de referencia de PrEP para hombres negros e hispanos/latinos.

186,36215734,"Despite the efficacy of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), retention in care in the United States remains suboptimal. The goal of this study was to explore factors that lead to suboptimal retention in PrEP care for men who have sex with men (MSM) in real-world clinical settings in the United States. Trained interviewers conducted semi-structured interviews with MSM (N = 49) from three clinics who had been engaged in PrEP care in the Midwest (n = 15), South (n = 15), and Northeast (n = 19) geographic regions and had experienced a lapse in PrEP use. Factors that emerged as related to suboptimal retention in PrEP care included structural factors such as transportation and out-of-pocket costs; social factors such as misinformation on media and in personal networks; clinical factors such as frequency and timing of appointments; and behavioral factors such as changes in sexual behavior and low perceived risk for HIV. Participants suggested reducing the out-of-pocket costs of medications and lab visits, having flexible appointment times, culturally responsive services, and comprehensive patient navigation to help retention in care. These findings leveraged real-world experiences and opinions of patients to inform gaps in current services and how to make changes to optimize PrEP care. "
187,26293904,"One barrier to wider preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) availability is uncertainty about the most appropriate providers and practice settings for offering PrEP. The authors conducted in-depth interviews with 30 clinicians--primary care and HIV specialists--in the New York City (NYC) region to explore issues related to PrEP rollout, including who should provide it and in what settings. A diverse group favored offering PrEP in non-HIV specialty settings in order to reach high-risk HIV-negative individuals. Yet, for each clinical skill or ancillary service deemed important for providing PrEP--knowledge of the medications, ability to assess and counsel around sexual risk behavior, and ability to provide support for retention and medication adherence--participants were divided in whether they thought primary care providers/practices could achieve it. Five participants strongly favored providing PrEP in HIV care practices. Although there may be multiple ""homes"" for PrEP, implementation research is needed to identify the most effective delivery approaches. "
188,16764941,"This pilot study examined rates of major depression and suicidality and their associations with daily functioning in HIV infected (HIV+) and uninfected (HIV-) persons in China. HIV+ participants (N=28) and demographically matched HIV- controls (N=23) completed the Chinese Composite International Diagnostic Interview to determine lifetime rates of major depressive disorder (MDD) and suicidality. Current mood and suicidal ideation were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-I. The impact of depression and HIV infection on daily functioning was measured by an Activity of Daily Living questionnaire. Mean duration of known HIV+ status was 2 years. Almost 79% (n=22) of HIV+ but just 4% (n=1) of HIV- groups reported lifetime major depression. Of the 22 HIV+ individuals with lifetime MDD, only one had onset before learning of HIV status. The remainder developed MDD within 6 months after testing HIV positive. In those HIV+ subjects who met MDD criteria after HIV diagnosis, only two (9%) had received depression treatment, yet four (18%) had persisting active suicidal thoughts. Depression and HIV+ status independently predicted worse daily functioning. Representativeness is limited in this small sample of convenience. This preliminary study presents evidence of high rates of major depression and suicidality in HIV-infected persons in China. Despite this, few had sought mental health assistance, suggesting a need to increase awareness of psychiatric comorbidity and access to mental health services. "

190,8543713,"Curtailing the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic requires the development of effective strategies for helping people reduce high-risk sexual behavior patterns. Because the objective of HIV prevention involves changing how people behave sexually, research findings in human sexuality are extremely pertinent to efforts to promote AIDS risk reduction. Unfortunately, most public health HIV prevention programs rarely reflect findings of human sexuality research. In this article, research is reviewed in the areas of the relationship contexts of sexuality, including variations in monogamy, condom use in affectionate versus casual relationships, sexual communication, and coercion; the modification of sexual behavior repertoires; substance use in relation to sexual intercourse; and sexual schema and scripts relevant to HIV risk. Policy and training issues related to human sexuality may have hindered efforts to incorporate sexuality research findings in HIV prevention programs. Advances and refinements in the success of HIV prevention efforts are likely if research on human sexuality is better integrated in AIDS prevention programs. "

We enrolled 47 HIV+ adults (12 of whom underwent a second visit at least 24weeks after starting therapy) as well as 11 HIV negative controls. At baseline, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sMAC was detectable in 27.7% of HIV+ individuals. CSF sMAC correlated with CSF HIV RNA levels and was more likely to be detectable in HIV+ individuals on cART compared to HIV negative controls. In HIV+ participants, there were negative association trends between sMAC and neurocognitive performance but these did not reach statistical significance. "
192,8395480,"Psychosocial associations have been observed with level of cervical dysplasia or ""pre-cancer"" and invasive cervical cancer [related to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection]. Psychoneuroimmunological relationships have been observed in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, which is being described in an increasing number of women. Our objective was to review these relationships regarding effects that might be expected in HIV-1 and HPV co-infected women. This review was based on a Medline literature search supplemented by a manual search of selected journals unrepresented in that database. Relationships of psychosocial factors and level of cervical dysplasia were similarly observed with reference to immunological and health status in asymptomatic and early symptomatic HIV-1 infected homosexual men, suggesting that a potentiating effect may occur in HIV-1 and HPV co-infected women. Consistency of relationships across studies appeared to be enhanced by the use of a biopsychosocial model integrating the effects of life stressors, social support and coping style as well as psychiatric disorders. Research is indicated on the relationships between psychosocial factors, immunological status and clinical health status in this group of women. Because of the high prevalence of psychosocial risk factors for chronic psychological distress in these women and the known immunological and health status decrements occurring with progression of these two infections, a clinical screening program based on the biopsychosocial model is recommended as a means of secondary prevention. If effective in generating treatment referrals, such a program would likely improve quality of life and could aid in the determination of relationships with immunological and health status as well. "

195,18202907,"This article reviews recent literature in chronic illness or long-term health management including asthma, contraception, diabetes, HIV disease, and hypertension/cardiovascular disease, mental disorders, pain, and other diseases to determine the relationship between regimen factors and adherence to medications. The authors conducted an electronic literature search to detect articles published between 1998 and 2007. Articles were included if they pertained to a chronic illness or to contraception, included a clear definition of how adherence was measured, and included regimen factors as primary or secondary explanatory variables. Methodology of the studies varied greatly, as did methods of measuring adherence and regimen factors. Surprisingly few of these articles concerned (1) chronic treatment, (2) regimen factors such as dosing, pill burden, and regimen complexity, and (3) adherence measured in a clear manner. Most studies failed to use state-of-the-art methods of measuring adherence. Despite these flaws, a suggestive pattern of the importance of regimen factors, specifically dose frequency and regimen complexity, emerged from this review. "
196,16641237,"CNS abnormalities can be detected during chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, before the development of opportunistic infections or other sequelae of immunodeficiency. However, although end-stage dementia caused by HIV has been linked to the presence of infected and activated macrophages and microglia in the brain, the nature of the changes resulting in the motor and cognitive disorders in the chronic stage is unknown. Using simian immunodeficiency virus-infected rhesus monkeys, we sought the molecular basis for CNS dysfunction. In the chronic stable stage, nearly 2 years after infection, all animals had verified CNS functional abnormalities. Both virus and infiltrating lymphocytes (CD8+ T-cells) were found in the brain. Molecular analysis revealed that the expression of several immune response genes was increased, including CCL5, which has pleiotropic effects on neurons as well as immune cells. CCL5 was significantly upregulated throughout the course of infection, and in the chronic phase was present in the infiltrating lymphocytes. We have identified an altered state of the CNS at an important stage of the viral-host interaction, likely arising to protect against the virus but in the long term leading to damaging processes. "
197,29404757,"In high prevalence environments relationship characteristics are likely to be associated with HIV risk, yet evidence indicates general underestimation of risk. Furthermore uncertainty about partner's risk may challenge PrEP demand among young African women. We conducted quantitative and qualitative interviews with women before and after HIV discussions with partners, to explore how partner's behavior affected risk perceptions and interest in PrEP. Twenty-three women were interviewed once; twelve had a follow-up interview after speaking to their partners. Fourteen women were willing to have their partner contacted; yet two men participated. Several themes related to relationships and risk were identified. These highlighted that young women's romantic feelings and expectations influenced their perceptions of risk within their relationships, consistent with the concept of motivated reasoning. Findings emphasize challenges in using risk to promote HIV prevention among young women. Framing PrEP in a positive empowering way that avoids linking it to relationship risk may ultimately encourage greater uptake. "
198,15922953,"Progress in developing effective gene transfer approaches to treat HIV-1 infection has been steady. Many different transgenes have been reported to inhibit HIV-1 in vitro. However, effective translation of such results to clinical practice, or even to animal models of AIDS, has been challenging. Among the reasons for this failure are uncertainty as to the most effective cell population(s) to target, the diffuseness of these target cells in the body, and ineffective or insufficiently durable gene delivery. Better understanding of the HIV-1 replicative cycle, host factors involved in HIV-1 infection, vector biology and application, transgene technology, animal models, and clinical study design have all contributed vastly to planning current and future strategies for application of gene therapeutic approaches to the treatment of AIDS. This review focuses on the newest developments in these areas and provides a strong basis for renewed optimism that gene therapy will have an important role to play in treating people infected with HIV-1.
