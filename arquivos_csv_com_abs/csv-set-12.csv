0,31811919,"Amoxicillin has been in use since the 1970s; it is the most widely used penicillin both alone and in combination with the β-lactamase clavulanic acid. In this narrative review, we re-examine the properties of oral amoxicillin and clavulanic acid and provide guidance on their use, with emphasis on the preferred use of amoxicillin alone. Published medical literature (MEDLINE database via Pubmed). While amoxicillin and clavulanic acid have similar half-lives, clavulanic acid is more protein bound and even less heat stable than amoxicillin, with primarily hepatic metabolism. It is also more strongly associated with gastrointestinal side effects, including Clostridium difficile infection, and, thus, in oral combination formulations, limits the maximum daily dose of amoxicillin that can be given. The first ratio for an amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination was set at 4:1 due to clavulanic acid's high affinity for β-lactamases; ratios of 2:1, 7:1, 14:1 and 16:1 are currently available in various regions. Comparative effectiveness data for the different ratios are scarce. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is often used as empiric therapy for many of the World Health Organization's Priority Infectious Syndromes in adults and children, leading to extensive consumption, when some of these syndromes could be handled with a delayed antibiotic prescription approach or amoxicillin alone. Using available epidemiological and pharmacokinetic data, we provide guidance on indications for amoxicillin versus amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and on optimal oral administration, including choice of combination ratio. More data are needed, particularly on heat stability, pharmacodynamic effects and emergence of resistance in 'real-world' clinical settings. "
1,36031053,"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common infection among pregnant women and have been associated with maternal and foetal complications. Antimicrobial exposure during pregnancy is not without risk. International guidelines recommend a single screen-and-treat approach to asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB); however, this approach has been questioned by recent studies. The aim of this narrative review was to assess the pathophysiology, current risk factors and management of UTI during pregnancy, its impact on pregnancy outcomes, and to develop recommendations on the best use of antimicrobials. PubMed, Cochrane database, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Owing to the physiological changes related to pregnancy, pregnant women are at higher risk of UTI. All types of UTIs combined have been estimated to affect approximately 2% to 15% of women. ASB affects 2% to 7% of pregnant women. Recent studies do not provide good-quality evidence for an association between ASB and acute pyelonephritis if ASB is untreated. There is low-to-moderate-quality evidence that treatment of ASB results in a reduction in the incidence of low birth weight and preterm birth, which justifies screening practices for ASB with only a single urine culture in the first trimester. If the clinician opts for treatment, a short course of β-lactams, nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin should be favoured. Studies on cystitis during pregnancy are limited. Acute pyelonephritis has been shown to be associated with increased maternal complications and in some studies has also been associated with preterm delivery and low birth weight. Preferred antimicrobials for the management of pyelonephritis are amoxicillin combined with an aminoglycoside, third-generation cephalosporins, or carbapenems. Studies on recurrent UTIs during pregnancy are limited, making it difficult to draw conclusions regarding prophylactic measures. Further research is required to understand the true incidence of ASB-related complications and the benefit and modalities of screening for ASB and to further explore prophylactic measures. "
2,23529866,"The adequate management of central nervous system (CNS) infections requires that antimicrobial agents penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and achieve concentrations in the CNS adequate for eradication of the infecting pathogen. This review details the currently available literature on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of antibacterials in the CNS of children. Clinical trials affirm that the physicochemical properties of a drug remain one of the most important factors dictating penetration of antimicrobial agents into the CNS, irrespective of the population being treated (i.e. small, lipophilic drugs with low protein binding exhibit the best translocation across the BBB). These same physicochemical characteristics determine the primary disposition pathways of the drug, and by extension the magnitude and duration of circulating drug concentrations in the plasma, a second major driving force behind achievable CNS drug concentrations. Notably, these disposition pathways can be expected to change during the normal process of growth and development. Finally, CNS drug penetration is influenced by the nature and extent of the infection (i.e. the presence of meningeal inflammation). Aminoglycosides have poor CNS penetration when administered intravenously. Intrathecal gentamicin has been studied in children with more promising results, often exceeding the minimum inhibitory concentration. There are very limited data with intrathecal tobramycin in children. However, in the few patients that have been studied, the CSF concentrations were highly variable. Penicillins generally have good CNS penetration. Aqueous penicillin G reaches greater concentrations than procaine or benzathine penicillin. Concentrations remain detectable for ≥ 12 h. Of the aminopenicillins, both ampicillin and parenteral amoxicillin reach adequate CNS concentrations; however, orally administered amoxicillin resulted in much lower concentrations. Nafcillin and piperacillin are the final two penicillins with pediatric data: their penetration is erratic at best. Cephalosporins vary greatly in regard to their CSF penetration. Few first- and second-generation cephalosporins are able to reach higher CSF concentrations. Cefuroxime is the only exception and is usually avoided due to its adverse effects and slower sterilization of the CSF than third-generation agents. Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefixime and cefepime have been studied in children and are all able to adequately penetrate the CSF. As with penicillins, concentrations are greatest in the presence of meningeal inflammation. Meropenem and imipenem are the only carbapenems with pediatric data. Imipenem reaches higher CSF concentrations; however, meropenem is preferred due to its lower incidence of seizures. Aztreonam has also demonstrated favorable penetration but only one study has been completed in children. Both chloramphenicol and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (cotrimoxazole) penetrate into the CNS well; however, significant toxicities limit their use. The small size and minimal protein binding of fosfomycin contribute to its favorable CNS PK. Although rarely used, it achieves higher concentrations in the presence of inflammation and accumulation is possible. Linezolid reaches high CSF concentrations; however, more frequent dosing might be required in infants due to their increased elimination. Metronidazole also has very limited information but it demonstrated favorable results similar to adult data; CSF concentrations even exceeded plasma concentrations at certain time points. Rifampin (rifampicin) demonstrated good CNS penetration after oral administration. Vancomycin demonstrates poor CNS penetration after intravenous administration. When combined with intraventricular therapy, CNS concentrations are much greater. Of the antituberculosis agents, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and streptomycin have been studied in children. Isoniazid and pyrazinamide have favorable CSF penetration. Streptomycin appears to produce unpredictable CSF levels. No pediatric-specific data are available for clindamycin, daptomycin, macrolides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones. Daptomycin, fluoroquinolones, and tetracyclines have demonstrated favorable CNS penetration in adults; however, data are limited due to their potential pediatric-specific toxicities and newness within the marketplace. Macrolides and clindamycin have demonstrated poor CNS penetration in adults and thus have not been studied in pediatrics. "
3,14726904,"Treatment guidelines developed by the Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) were originally published in 2000. These guidelines were designed to: (1) educate clinicians and patients (or patients’ families) about the differences between viral and bacterial rhinosinusitis; (2) reduce the use of antibiotics for nonbacterial nasal/sinus disease; (3) provide recommendations for the diagnosis and optimal treatment of ABRS; (4) promote the use of appropriate antibiotic therapy when bacterial infection is likely; and (5) describe the current understanding of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics and how they relate to the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy. The original guidelines are updated here to include the most recent information on management principles, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, and therapeutic options. An estimated 20 million cases of ABRS occur annually in the United States. According to National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) data, sinusitis is the fifth most common diagnosis for which an antibiotic is prescribed. Sinusitis accounted for 9% and 21% of all pediatric and adult antibiotic prescriptions, respectively, written in 2002. The primary diagnosis of sinusitis results in expenditures of approximately $3.5 billion per year in the United States. ABRS is most often preceded by a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI). Allergy, trauma, dental infection, or other factors that lead to inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses may also predispose individuals to developing ABRS. Patients with a “common cold” (viral URI) usually report some combination of the following symptoms: sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, hyposmia/anosmia, facial pressure, postnasal drip, sore throat, cough, ear fullness, fever, and myalgia. A change in the color or the characteristic of the nasal discharge is not a specific sign of a bacterial infection. Bacterial superinfection may occur at any time during the course of a viral URI. The risk that bacterial superinfection has occurred is greater if the illness is still present after 10 days. Because there may be cases that fall out of the “norm” of this typical progression, practicing clinicians need to rely on their clinical judgment when using these guidelines. In general, however, a diagnosis of ABRS may be made in adults or children with symptoms of a viral URI that have not improved after 10 days or worsen after 5 to 7 days. There may be some or all of the following signs and symptoms: nasal drainage, nasal congestion, facial pressure/pain (especially when unilateral and focused in the region of a particular sinus), postnasal drainage, hyposmia/anosmia, fever, cough, fatigue, maxillary dental pain, and ear pressure/fullness. Physical examination provides limited information in the diagnosis of ABRS. While sometimes helpful, plain film radiographs, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging scans are not necessary for cases of ABRS. The most common bacterial species isolated from the maxillary sinuses of patients with ABRS are  The increasing prevalence of penicillin nonsusceptibility and resistance to other drug classes among  These guidelines apply to both adults and children. When selecting antibiotic therapy for ABRS, the clinician should consider the severity of the disease, the rate of progression of the disease, and recent antibiotic exposure. The guidelines now divide patients with ABRS into two general categories: (1) those with mild symptoms who have not received antibiotics within the past 4 to 6 weeks, and (2) those with mild disease who have received antibiotics within the past 4 to 6 weeks or those with moderate disease regardless of recent antibiotic exposure. The difference in severity of disease does not imply infection with a resistant pathogen. Rather, this terminology indicates the relative degree of acceptance of possible treatment failure and the likelihood of spontaneous resolution of symptoms—patients with more severe symptoms are less likely to resolve their disease spontaneously. The primary goal of antibiotic therapy is to eradicate bacteria from the site of infection, which, in turn, helps (1) return the sinuses back to health; (2) decrease the duration of symptoms to allow patients to resume daily activities more quickly; (3) prevent severe complications such as meningitis and brain abscess; and (4) decrease the development of chronic disease. Severe or life-threatening infections with or without complications are rare, and are not addressed in these guidelines. Prior antibiotic use is a major risk factor associated with the development of infection with antimicrobial-resistant strains. Because recent antimicrobial exposure increases the risk of carriage of and infection due to resistant organisms, antimicrobial therapy should be based upon the patient’s history of recent antibiotic use. The panel’s guidelines, therefore, stratify patients according to antibiotic exposure in the previous 4 to 6 weeks. Lack of response to therapy at ≥72 hours is an arbitrary time established to define treatment failures. Clinicians should monitor the response to antibiotic therapy, which may include instructing the patient to call the office or clinic if symptoms persist or worsen over the next few days. The predicted bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of antibiotics in adults and children has been determined according to mathematical modeling of ABRS developed by Michael Poole, MD, PhD, based on pathogen distribution, resolution rates without treatment, and in vitro microbiologic activity. Antibiotics can be placed into the following relative rank order of predicted clinical efficacy for adults: 90% to 92% = respiratory fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), ceftriaxone, high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (4 g/250 mg/day), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (1.75 g/250 mg/day); 83% to 88% = high-dose amoxicillin (4 g/day), amoxicillin (1.5 g/day), cefpodoxime proxetil, cefixime (based on  "
4,20557952,"Tonsillectomy is the most common surgery performed in the pediatric and young adult populations. Although recent guidelines based on meta-analysis suggest that perioperative chemoprophylaxis plays a role in reducing bacteraemia-related post-tonsillectomy complications, there is no evidence or agreement upon which specific antibiotic, dosage or administration route should be preferred. Since few previous studies have assessed the effectiveness of prophylaxis by direct measurement of antibiotic levels both in plasma and tissue, we designed an experimental study to quantitatively evaluate amoxicillin concentrations in children ready for tonsillectomy and compare these plasma and tissue levels with the Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) of the bacteria more commonly involved in the upper airway infections. Thirty-three pediatric patients under 14 years of age (median 5.0, IQR 4-7, range 3-11; M:F 18:15) with recurrent tonsillitis were treated with 3 doses (established on patient's weight) of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid given orally the day before plus a further dose 2h before tonsillectomy. Amoxicillin concentrations on both homogenated tonsillar cores and plasma were measured by HPLC-UV. Bacterial epidemiology and susceptibility were derived respectively from survey data collected by Microbiology Unit and MIC according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Median plasma and tissue amoxicillin concentrations were respectively 4.7 microg/ml (IQR 2.1-8.0; min-max 0.4-14.3) and 1.1 microg/g (IQR 0.4-2.1; min-max 0.4-12.9), considerably below the selected target MIC of pathogens involved in the upper respiratory tract infections (S. aureus, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis). 20 Children showed undetectable amoxicillin levels in one or both tonsils. Interestingly, 7 out of these patients (35%) had plasma concentrations higher than the target MIC (8 microg/ml). No patient displayed plasma concentrations under the limit of sensitivity of the method. Poor core-plasma and left-right core correlation was observed among patients, suggesting that fibrosis developed after recurrent tonsillitis may hamper antibiotic penetration. Based upon direct measurement of antibiotic levels in plasma and tissue, this study suggests that a revision of the oral prophylaxis in children is required in order to reduce microbial charge in the operative field and accordingly improve the recovery after tonsillectomy.

5,37820258,"Doxycycline is considered the first-line treatment of Lyme disease in adolescents and adults, but largely disproven concerns of permanent tooth staining prevented its use and evaluation in children <8 years old. We sought to describe short-term adverse effects and treatment failures among young children receiving oral doxycycline for Lyme disease. We completed a 2-pronged evaluation of children with Lyme disease treated with doxycycline. We performed a retrospective case series of patients <8 years old who were diagnosed with Lyme disease and treated with doxycycline. We then performed a telephone follow-up survey study of the patients' parents to gather additional details regarding clinical outcomes and adverse reactions to doxycycline. Descriptive statistics were calculated. A total of 32 patients were identified through the retrospective case series and 18 participated in the follow-up survey. The most common clinical diagnosis (22/32; 69%) was single erythema migrans. Seven (22%) had neurological Lyme disease. Three patients (9%) stopped doxycycline treatment prematurely due to adverse effects. During telephone follow-up, 2 children were reported to have dental staining. No patients were identified with treatment failure during the retrospective case series. On telephone follow-up, 3 patients had residual symptoms after treatment, though none were convincing of treatment failure. Our study suggests that doxycycline is generally well-tolerated and an effective treatment of Lyme disease in young children. Prospective, observational studies with long-term assessment of dental staining and clinical outcomes are needed. Alternative antibiotics, principally amoxicillin, remain the preferred treatment of non-neurological Lyme disease manifestations in young children, but doxycycline is likely a safe and effective alternative when needed.

6,27080965,"Most human orofacial infections originate from odontogenic infections and prescribing antibiotics has become a ubiquitous phenomenon. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recognized the inappropriate, indiscriminate, and irrational use of antibiotics leading to antibiotic resistance as a global problem. The objective of this survey is to compare the antibiotic prescription pattern and the awareness of antibiotic resistance among Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) practitioners and pediatric dentists. A hundred BDS practitioners and 100 pediatric dentists included in the study were given a questionnaire containing both open-ended and closed-ended questions. The questionnaire comprised information pertaining to antibiotic prescription for most common oral conditions, commonly prescribed antibiotics, their dosage, etc. The majority of the practitioners prescribed antibiotics for managing oral diseases. On comparing the prescription patterns between the BDS practitioners and pediatric dentists, there was an overprescription in the BDS group for many conditions, which was statistically significant. Amoxicillin was the most commonly prescribed drug in both the groups. In the presence of an anaerobic infection, the most preferred drug was a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid with metronidazole. With regard to the duration of antibiotic prescription, 74% BDS practitioners prescribed antibiotics as a 3-day course and 60% pediatric dentists resorted to a 5-day course, which was statistically significant. The awareness regarding antibiotic prophylaxis and antibiotic resistance was found to be adequate in both the groups. However, there was a general lack of awareness with regard to the guidelines for antibiotic prescribing in both the groups. Practitioners should prescribe antibiotics in accordance with the guidelines to curb antibiotic resistance, an emerging public health problem. "
7,28894828,"Presenting the role of antibiotics in pediatric chronic rhinosinusitis based on its pathophysiology and microbiology. Review of the literature searching PubMed for microbiology and treatment of pediatric chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is an inflammatory condition of the paranasal sinuses that persists for 12 weeks or longer, despite medical management. The microbiology of rhinosinusitis evolves through several stages. The early phase (acute) is generally caused by a virus that may be followed by an aerobic bacterial infection in 2% to 10% of patients. Aerobic ( Antimicrobial therapy of pediatric chronic rhinosinusitis should be adequate against the potential aerobic and anaerobic pathogens. 7. "
8,35558354,"Palatability of medication is an important factor for adherence, especially in pediatric populations that tend to use oral suspensions for antibiotic therapy. Our study is the first to evaluate the impact of taste on prescribing patterns of antibiotic suspensions. The objective was to determine if taste testing common antibiotic suspensions altered prescribing patterns of medical residents, through data extracted from the electronic health record. After assessing 5 ""primer"" tastes (sweet, salty, bitter, sour, umami [savory]), residents were randomized to sample 6 antibiotic suspensions to rate their taste perception. A 12-month retrospective and prospective analysis of outpatient prescribing practices of the residents followed, and the results were compared to the resident cohort randomized to no taste test. The 43 residents prescribed 207 liquid antibiotic prescriptions for 176 patients, with no difference in patient characteristics between residents in the taste test versus non-taste test group. Although amoxicillin was most preferable and amoxicillin-clavulanate least, the only significant finding was a greater prescribing rate of cefdinir among those who had tasted it and an inverse relationship between cephalexin taste preference and percentage prescribing amoxicillin in the taste group. Residents who tasted were poor in identifying primer tastes, but this did not impact prescribing patterns. Among 6 commonly prescribed antibiotic suspensions, amoxicillin remains a highly preferred taste among prescribers. Interestingly, after the taste test there was a significantly greater prescribing rate of cefdinir among those who had tasted it and somewhat lower prescribing rate for amoxicillin-clavulanate. "
9,20152073,"Upper respiratory tract infections in children are common and usually self-limiting conditions, which include acute otitis media (AOM), acute rhinosinusitis (ARS), and acute pharyngitis (AP). Management of pediatric AOM considers observation strategy for selected and uncomplicated cases, older than 2 years of age, only when adequate follow-up can be ensured. Otherwise, an antibiotic treatment should be prescribed. Amoxicillin should be preferred as the first-choice therapy. Switch therapy to ceftriaxone is suggested if amoxicillin regimen failure occurs within 48-72 hours. The diagnosis of ARS is established by the persistence of purulent nasal of post-nasal draining lasting at least 10 days especially if accompanied by supporting symptoms and signs. Amoxicillin is the first choice drug for mild ARS in children. When symptoms persist or worsen, amoxicillin/clavulanate or cefpodoxime proxetil, or ceftriaxone are recommended. Clinical criteria alone are not sufficiently accurate in children with AP to distinguish bacterial and viral etiology. Thus microbiological evaluation is needed and positive throat culture or rapid antigen detection test are required to establish the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis and consequently to prescribe antibiotic treatment. The first choice treatment in European countries still remains amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate. "
10,14632102,"Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) is the most common bacterial cause of acute pharyngitis. Although children infected with GABHS will recover clinically without antibiotics, treatment is recommended in order to prevent acute rheumatic fever and probably suppurative complications, hasten resolution of clinical signs and symptoms, and prevent transmission to close contacts. Streptococcal pharyngitis usually cannot be reliably distinguished from other etiologies on the basis of epidemiologic or physical findings, and therefore a throat culture or a rapid antigen detection test is generally necessary to confirm the diagnosis. All isolates of GABHS are sensitive to penicillins and cephalosporins, whereas resistance to macrolides has been identified in some geographic regions. The recommended first-line therapy for streptococcal pharyngitis is a 10-day course of penicillin V, usually given 2 or 3 times per day. A number of alternatives to penicillin V are available, including other penicillins, macrolides, and cephalosporins. As a class, the cephalosporins are noteworthy because they may provide somewhat higher bacteriologic eradication rates than penicillin V. Many cephalosporins can be administered twice daily, but they also must be given for 10 days. Two third-generation cephalosporins, cefdinir and cefpodoxime proxetil, are approved for use in a more convenient 5-day dosing schedule, thus possibly increasing the likelihood of adherence to the full course of therapy. Palatability is also an important consideration when prescribing antibiotics to children. In a series of studies, children preferred the pleasant strawberry-cream taste of cefdinir to that of amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefprozil, and azithromycin. Cefdinir may offer an alternative to penicillin V for children with streptococcal pharyngitis, particularly when compliance is a clinical concern. "

The overall aim of this paper is to unravel the major current insights into the antibiotic treatment of AOM in children. Our approach is three-fold: 1. a preclinical evaluation of antibiotics in animal models of AOM stressing on the advantages of different species when testing for different schemes of antibiotics; 2. an overview on the new antimicrobial agents whose efficacy has been demonstrated in refractory cases of AOM in children; and 3. an analysis of the different guidelines stressing on the differences and similarities between the various schemes of antibiotic treatment.

12,28230273,"A large number of population in both developing and developed countries are affected by bronchitis, among all the factors, bacterial infection was considered as a critical cause of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. Although several anti-bacterial agents were proved to have the effect of alleviating bronchitis, their relative efficacies and potential side effects remained not clear. We are keen to compare the pathogen eradication rate and safety of anti-bacterial agents for bronchitis. Relevant studies were searched in multiple sources and data were extracted from eligible studies. Then conventional meta-analysis and network meta-analysis (NMA) were conducted to determine the relative efficacy and safety of bronchitis medications. The efficacy of bronchitis medications was determined by using the outcome of pathogen eradication, including total pathogen eradication, pathogen eradication of Haemophilus influenzae, pathogen eradication of Moraxella catarrhalis, and pathogen eradication of Streptococcus pneumoniae. In addition, safety was assessed by using the outcome of adverse effects and diarrhoea. A 27 RCTs with 9,414 participants were included in the study. Among the medications, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited better performance than clarithromycin with respect to pathogen eradication of H. influenzae (OR = 21.37, CI: 1.22-541.28; OR = 7.43, CI: 1.79-30.50). Clarithromycin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and telithromycin appeared to be more preferable than amoxicillin + clavulanate and azithromycin with respect to diarrhoea (all OR <1). The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) results suggested that gemifloxacin and levofloxacin had a relatively high ranking in total pathogen eradication, whereas amoxicillin + clavulanate and azithromycin exhibited relatively lower ranking with respect to adverse effects and diarrhoea. Gemifloxacin and levofloxacin are more preferable than others for lowering respiratory tract inflammation and infections considering their balanced performance between pathogen eradication and adverse effects.

13,35709220,"Antimicrobial stewardship encourages appropriate antibiotic use, the specific activities of which will vary by institutional context. We investigated regional variation in antibiotic use by surveying three regional public hospitals in Kenya. Hospital-level data for antimicrobial stewardship activities, infection prevention and control, and laboratory diagnostic capacities were collected from hospital administrators, heads of infection prevention and control units, and laboratory directors, respectively. Patient-level antibiotic use data were abstracted from medical records using a modified World Health Organization point-prevalence survey form. Altogether, 1,071 consenting patients were surveyed at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH, n = 579), Coast Provincial General Hospital (CPGH, n = 229) and Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH, n = 263). The majority (67%, 722/1071) were ≥18 years and 53% (563/1071) were female. Forty-six percent (46%, 489/1071) were receiving at least one antibiotic. Antibiotic use was higher among children <5 years (70%, 150/224) than among other age groups (40%, 339/847; P < 0.001). Critical care (82%, 14/17 patients) and pediatric wards (59%, 155/265) had the highest proportion of antibiotic users. Amoxicillin/clavulanate was the most frequently used antibiotic at KNH (17%, 64/383 antibiotic doses), and ceftriaxone was most used at CPGH (29%, 55/189) and MTRH (31%, 57/184). Forty-three percent (326/756) of all antibiotic prescriptions had at least one missed dose recorded. Forty-six percent (204/489) of patients on antibiotics had a specific infectious disease diagnosis, of which 18% (37/204) had soft-tissue infections, 17% (35/204) had clinical sepsis, 15% (31/204) had pneumonia, 13% (27/204) had central nervous system infections and 10% (20/204) had obstetric or gynecological infections. Of these, 27% (56/204) had bacterial culture tests ordered, with culture results available for 68% (38/56) of tests. Missed antibiotic doses, low use of specimen cultures to guide therapy, high rates of antibiotic use, particularly in the pediatric and surgical population, and preference for broad-spectrum antibiotics suggest antibiotic use in these tertiary care hospitals is not optimal. Antimicrobial stewardship programs, policies, and guidelines should be tailored to address these areas. "
14,37076936,"Fixed-dose combinations (FDC) are medicine formulations that combine two or more ingredients in fixed ratios in a single dose form. Although advantageous in tuberculosis and malaria (efficacy, adherence, protection against resistance), only a few antibiotic FDC (FDC-AB) have been developed along full microbiological, pharmacological and clinical validation and safety studies. The World Health Organization (WHO) database of Access, Watch and Reserve (AWaRe) antibiotics contains, since 2021, a list of ""Not Recommended"" FDC-AB (n = 103) which are rejected for use in clinical practice. BODY: The share of non-recommended FDC-AB in global antimicrobial use (2000-2015) was < 3% but substantially higher in middle income countries. The share increases over time, but recent data particular concerning sub-Saharan Africa are rare. Along three non-recommended FDC-AB listed in the Tanzanian National Essential Medicine List (ampicillin-cloxacillin, flucloxacillin-amoxicillin and ceftriaxone-sulbactam) we discuss the concerns and reasons behind use of these products. Non-recommended FDC-AB have poor rationale (ratios of both ingredients), lack evidence of efficacy (pharmacological, microbiological and clinical), have difficulties in dosing (underdosing of the single ingredients, absence of pediatric dosing) and risks of safety (additive toxicity). They are expected to fuel antimicrobial resistance (unnecessary broad spectrum coverage) and are incompatible with antimicrobial stewardship. The specific context of low- and middle-income countries contributes to their increased use: at the side of prescriber and supplier are the lack of diagnostics, poor training in antibiotic prescribing, patients' preferences, role-model of senior prescribers and pharmaceutical promotion. International market mechanisms include economic motivation for development, branding and promotion, poor access to the single antibiotic forms and weak national regulatory capacity. There is an urgent need for monitoring consumption of non-recommended FDC-AB in low- and middle-income countries, particular in Sub-Saharan Africa. A multinational and multisectoral antimicrobial stewardship strategy is needed in order to abolish the use of non-recommended FDC-AB. "
15,8188841,"A cohort of children with Lyme arthritis was used to evaluate the clinical and serologic profile of the disease. During a 42-month period (June 1989 to December 1991), 44 patients (13 girls and 31 boys, ages 4-18 years) were included and followed for 6-36 months. Inclusion required the presence of arthritis, as well as positive serology. Thirty-four children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis or spondyloarthropathy were used as a serologic comparison group. Five different patterns of arthritis were found. Preceding erythema migrans was seen in seven children. Antinuclear antibodies were positive in 30% of the patients. Three treatments were used and selected according to physician preference, patient age, and presence of extraarticular disease: amoxicillin, doxycycline, and ceftriaxone. Articular disease reached complete resolution in all patients within 2-12 weeks. Lyme arthritis in children may mimic other pediatric arthritides. Prognosis for children with clearly defined Lyme arthritis was excellent. "
16,32823360,"The present guideline aims to improve the evidence-based management of children and adolescents with pediatric community-acquired pneumonia (pCAP). Despite a prevalence of approx. 300 cases per 100 000 children per year in Central Europe, mortality is very low. Prevention includes infection control measures and comprehensive immunization. The diagnosis can and should be established clinically by history, physical examination and pulse oximetry, with fever and tachypnea as cardinal features. Additional signs or symptoms such as severely compromised general condition, poor feeding, dehydration, altered consciousness or seizures discriminate subjects with severe pCAP from those with non-severe pCAP. Within an age-dependent spectrum of infectious agents, bacterial etiology cannot be reliably differentiated from viral or mixed infections by currently available biomarkers. Most children and adolescents with non-severe pCAP and oxygen saturation > 92 % can be managed as outpatients without laboratory/microbiology workup or imaging. Anti-infective agents are not generally indicated and can be safely withheld especially in children of young age, with wheeze or other indices suggesting a viral origin. For calculated antibiotic therapy, aminopenicillins are the preferred drug class with comparable efficacy of oral (amoxicillin) and intravenous administration (ampicillin). Follow-up evaluation after 48 - 72 hours is mandatory for the assessment of clinical course, treatment success and potential complications such as parapneumonic pleural effusion or empyema, which may necessitate alternative or add-on therapy.

Hauptsymptome der pCAP sind Fieber und Tachypnoe, die Diagnosestellung erfolgt primär klinisch durch Anamnese, körperliche Untersuchung und Pulsoxymetrie. Das zusätzliche Vorliegen von Warnsymptomen wie stark reduzierter Allgemeinzustand, Nahrungsverweigerung, Dehydratation, Bewusstseinsstörung oder Krampfanfälle definiert die schwere pCAP in Abgrenzung zur nicht-schweren pCAP. Das Erregerspektrum ist altersabhängig, zur Differenzierung zwischen viraler, bakterieller oder gemischt viral-bakterieller Infektion stehen jedoch keine zuverlässigen Biomarker zur Verfügung. Die meisten Kinder und Jugendlichen mit nicht-schwerer pCAP und O "
17,14608265,"A first step in management decisions regarding otitis media must focus on accurate diagnosis to distinguish normal from acute otitis media (AOM) from otitis media with effusion (OME) or a retracted tympanic membrane without middle ear effusion. There are several classification schemes for AOM that may impact management decisions: patients with acute, persistent, recurrent, or chronic AOM may have a different distribution of bacterial pathogens and a different likelihood of success from antimicrobial therapy. Patient age, prior treatment history and daycare attendance are other important variables. The natural history of AOM without antibiotic treatment is generally favorable; however, from the few studies available, this is difficult to quantitate because the diagnosis was infrequently confirmed by tympanocentesis leaving the possibility that many patients entered into these trials may not have had bacterial AOM. Antibiotic choices should reflect pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data and clinical trial results demonstrating effectiveness in eradication of the most likely pathogens based on tympanocentesis sampling and antibiotic sensitivity testing. Thereafter, compliance factors such as formulation, dosing schedule and duration of treatment and accessibility factors such as availability and cost should be taken into account. The increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance among AOM pathogens and the changing susceptibility profiles of these bacteria should be considered in antibiotic selection. Current best practice recommends amoxicillin for uncomplicated AOM; continuing or switching to an alternative antibiotic based on clinical response after 48 hours of therapy; and selection of second line antibiotics as first line choices when the patient has already been on an antibiotic within the previous month or is otitis prone. Preferred second-line agents frequently noted in various guidelines include amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefdinir, cefpodoxime, cefprozil, and cefuroxime. Three injections of ceftriaxone or gatifloxacin (when approved) or diagnostic/therapeutic tympanocentisis (when approved) become a third-line treatment option. No single antibiotic or management strategy is ideal for all patients. "
18,24586287,"To summarize recommendations of existing guidelines on the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in children, and to assess the methodological quality of these guidelines. We searched seven databases and web sites of relevant academic agencies. Evidence-based guidelines on pediatric URTIs were included. AGREE II was used to assess the quality of these guidelines. Two researchers selected guidelines independently and extracted information on publication years, institutions, target populations, recommendations, quality of evidence, and strength of recommendations. We compared the similarities and differences of recommendations and their strength. We also analyzed the reasons for variation. Thirteen guidelines meeting our inclusion criteria were included. Huge differences existed among these 13 guidelines concerning the categorization of evidence and recommendations. Nearly all of these guidelines lacked the sufficient involvement of stake holders. Further, the applicability of these guidelines still needs to be improved. In terms of recommendations, penicillin and amoxicillin were suggested for group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate were recommended for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS). An observation of 2-3 days prior to antibiotic therapy initiation for mild acute otitis media (AOM) was recommended with amoxicillin as the suggested first choice agent. Direct evidence to support strong recommendations on the therapy for influenza is still lacking. In addition, the antimicrobial durations for pharyngitis and ABRS were still controversial. No consensus was reached for the onset of antibiotics for ABRS in children. Future guidelines should use a consistent grading system for the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. More effort needs to be paid to seek the preference of stake holders and to improve the applicability of guidelines. Further, there are still areas in pediatric URTIs that need more research. "
19,36919441,"Penicillin (PCN) allergy labels are widely recognized to be highly inaccurate. Little is known about parental perceptions of the PCN allergy evaluation and removal process, especially in the hospital setting. Focus groups were held with parents of children and adolescents with a PCN allergy label discharged from a large academic children's hospital between January 1, 2019, and April 15, 2020. The open-ended, semistructured moderator guide included questions about PCN allergy testing and evaluation, accuracy of the PCN allergy diagnosis, amoxicillin oral challenges, delabeling process, and preferred setting for PCN allergy delabeling evaluation (outpatient clinic, hospital, etc). Study investigators coded the transcripts and identified underlying themes using inductive and deductive thematic analysis. A total of 21 parents and 2 adolescents participated across 4 focus groups. We developed a theoretical framework depicting key elements of parents' and adolescents' experiences with PCN allergies, consisting of 4 major interconnected themes: (1) family context; (2) the invitation to delabel; (3) decision context; and (4) the PCN delabeling outcome. PCN allergies remained a concern for families even if their children passed an oral challenge. Some parents preferred testing to be performed in the hospital and felt this was a safer location for the procedure. Parents are amenable to hospital based PCN allergy evaluation and delabeling. Further studies should incorporate parental and patient preferences to implement safe and effective PCN allergy delabeling processes in the hospital setting. "
20,18574657,"We prospectively compared the efficacy of oral cefditoren-pivoxil and conventional oral amoxicillin for pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococcus in children. Either oral cefditoren-pivoxil (3 mg/kg t.i.d. for 5 days) or amoxicillin (10 mg/kg t.i.d. for 10 days) was administered to patients with group A streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis attending the pediatric outpatient clinic of Showa Hospital (Konan, Japan) between January and December 2006. Diagnosis was based on isolation of bacteria from a pharyngeal swab. Culture was always done to confirm eradication, and urinalysis and follow-up were performed at least once weekly for 4 weeks. Among 258 patients, 103 (aged 5.5 +/- 2.3 years) received cefditoren-pivoxil and 155 (aged 5.2 +/- 2.0 years) received amoxicillin. There were no significant between-group differences in age, sex, or symptoms. Eradication was confirmed in 99% (102/103) of the cefditoren-pivoxil group and 100% of the amoxicillin group. Recurrence within 4 weeks occurred in 8 and 15 patients in the cefditoren-pivoxil and amoxicillin groups, respectively, showing no significant difference in the recurrence rate, and all isolates had the same serotypes as before. There were no clinically significant adverse reactions or complications. The 50%/90% minimum inhibitory concentrations (microg/ml) of cefditoren-pivoxil and amoxicillin for the 258 isolates were < or =0.03/< or =0.03 and < or =0.03/0.06, respectively, so all isolates were susceptible to both agents. Because the efficacy for pediatric group A streptococcus pharyngotonsillitis was similar between oral cefditoren-pivoxil for 5 days and amoxicillin for 10 days, the shorter treatment period may make the former regimen preferable.

21,16507381,"This analysis of the results of 7 trials compared the taste and smell acceptability scores of cefdinir oral suspension and 4 other pediatric antibiotic oral suspensions--amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium, cefprozil, azithromycin, or generic amoxicillin--using a visual smile-face scale. Data from 7 randomized, single-blind, cross-over trials were pooled and analyzed. In each study, children aged 4 to 8 years were asked to taste and smell 2 different antibiotic suspensions and assign preference using a visual smile-face scale. Ratings were converted to a numeric score ranging from 5 (really good) to 1 (really bad). A total of 1011 healthy subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment-order groups; 965 were evaluable for the taste and smell analyses. Baseline demographics of evaluable subjects were similar among test groups. Approximately even proportions of participants were female or male (50.1 % vs 49.9%), most (84.1%) were white, and slightly more participants were aged 7 or 8 years rather than younger (age 4 years, 16.0%; age 5 years, 17.4%; age 6 years, 18.7%; age 7 years, 23.2%; age 8 years, 24.8%). Of the 965 children who tasted both antibiotic suspensions and determined their preference, 798 (82.7%) rated the taste of cefdinir as really good or good (the highest possible ratings); 712 (73.8%) assigned the same ratings to amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium, cefprozil, azithromycin, or generic amoxicillin (P < or = 0.001). With regard to smell, 671 (69.5%) rated the smell of cefdinir as really good or good; 636 (65.9%) assigned these same ratings to the comparator agents (P = NS). In this pooled analysis of data from 7 randomized, single-blind, crossover trials, children between the ages of 4 and 8 years preferred the taste of cefdinir oral suspension to that of other pediatric antibiotic suspensions. Based on smile-face scores, subjects found the smell of cefdinir oral suspension to be at least as good as that of the comparators. "
22,12765486,"The approaches to diagnosing and treating Lyme disease (LD) have been improved and refined as a result of basic and clinical research, and considerable practical experience. In addition, there have been recent studies that have allowed improvements in the ability to prevent infection with Borrelia burgdorferi. This paper will review the relevant literature and address recent developments in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of LD. Issues specifically related to the management of children will be identified. Controversies regarding treatment approaches will be examined in some detail. Understanding the clinical manifestations, or stage, of LD is crucial when approaching both diagnosis and treatment. Early localized disease is best diagnosed by recognizing the characteristic skin lesion, erythema migrans. Early disease will frequently, but not always, be accompanied by a detectable antibody response, particularly IgM antibody to the spirochete. Late disease, chiefly arthritis, is generally associated with high levels of IgG antibody. Western blot technology allows confirmation of enzyme immunoassay results and is especially useful when the latter is in the low or equivocal range. Early localized disease responds well to oral antibacterial therapy. Early disseminated disease, often associated with neurologic findings, may require parenteral therapy. The arthritis associated with LD frequently responds to oral antibacterials, but some refractory cases may require intravenous therapy, and occasionally surgery. Doxycycline is the oral antibacterial of choice, while amoxicillin and cefuroxime axetil are alternatives that may be preferred in young children. Owing to its long half-life and once daily dose administration, intravenous ceftriaxone has become the accepted standard for parenteral therapy. Tick avoidance has long been the mainstay for preventing LD. Antibacterial prophylaxis, using doxycycline, for tick bites has been shown to be an effective approach to prevention, but its relevance to pediatrics is uncertain. Vaccines designed to prevent infection have also been developed. "
23,32675908,"Penicillins are commonly prescribed to children. Recommendations in the product information may not be the most appropriate doses for children and may list clinical indications that are preferably treated with other antibiotics Reputable guidelines, for example Therapeutic Guidelines: Antibiotic, offer up-to-date advice on optimal choice, route, dosage and duration of oral penicillins in children In most instances, the child’s weight should be used to calculate the dose in mg per kg without exceeding the maximum adult dose When prescribing higher weight-based doses of amoxicillin or flucloxacillin, check the volume of oral liquid required to complete a treatment course to ensure adequate supply "
24,11144401,"Patient adherence to therapeutic regimens is extremely important to successful treatment of acute otitis media. Among pediatric patients medication palatability, particularly that of oral suspensions, is essential for patient acceptance, therapeutic compliance and successful outcome. A series of six randomized, single blind, crossover trials were conducted, each comparing cefdinir oral suspension with one of the following antibiotic oral suspensions: amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium; cefprozil; or azithromycin. Each medication comparison was evaluated in a single center and multicenter study. Subjects 4 to 8 years of age were asked to taste and smell each medication and assign preference using a visual ""smile-face"" scale. Ratings were converted to a numeric score ranging from 5 (""really good"") to 1 (""really bad""). Among the 715 subjects 85% rated the taste of cefdinir as good or really good, the highest possible ratings; 63% of subjects assigned the same ratings to amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium, cefprozil or azithromycin. Seventy-one percent rated the smell of cefdinir as good or really good; 64% assigned the same ratings to the comparators. Based on the findings from these trials, children 4 to 8 years of age preferred the taste and smell of cefdinir oral suspension to that of the comparator agents. "
25,25404720,"Previous research suggests that physicians may be less likely to diagnose otitis media (OM) and to prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics for black versus nonblack children. Our objective was to determine whether race is associated with differences in OM diagnosis and antibiotic prescribing nationally. We examined OM visit rates during 2008 to 2010 for children ≤14 years old using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. We compared OM visits between black and nonblack children, as percentages of all outpatient visits and visit rates per 1000. We compared antibiotic prescribing by race as the percentage of OM visits receiving narrow-spectrum (eg, amoxicillin) versus broader-spectrum antibiotics. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine whether race was independently associated with antibiotic selection for OM. The percentage of all visits resulting in OM diagnosis was 30% lower in black children compared with others (7% vs 10%, P = .004). However, OM visits per 1000 population were not different between black and nonblack children (253 vs 321, P = .12). When diagnosed with OM during visits in which antibiotics were prescribed, black children were less likely to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics than nonblack children (42% vs 52%, P = .01). In multivariable analysis, black race was negatively associated with broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing (adjusted odds ratio 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.86). Differences in treatment choice for black children with OM may indicate race-based differences in physician practice patterns and parental preferences for children with OM. "
26,33292528,"Beta-lactam allergy is reported in 5-10% of children in North America, but up to 94-97% of patients are deemed not allergic after allergist assessment. The utility of standardized skin testing for penicillin allergy in the pediatric population has been recently questioned. Oral drug challenges when appropriate, are preferred over skin testing, and can definitively rule out immediate, IgE-mediated drug allergy. To our knowledge, this is the only pediatric study to assess the reliability of a penicillin allergy stratification tool using a paper and electronic clinical algorithm. By using an electronic algorithm, we identified 61 patients (of 95 deemed not allergic by gold standard allergist decision) as low risk for penicillin allergy, with no false negatives and without the need for allergist assessment or skin testing. In this study, we demonstrate that an electronic algorithm can be used by various pediatric clinicians when evaluating possible penicillin allergy to reliably identify low risk patients. We identified the electronic algorithm was superior to the paper version, capturing an even higher percentage of low risk patients than the paper version. By developing an electronic algorithm to accurately assess penicillin allergy risk based on appropriate history, without the need for diagnostic testing or allergist assessment, we can empower non-allergist health care professionals to safely de-label low risk pediatric patients and assist in alleviating subspecialty wait times for penicillin allergy assessment.

28,26349821,"There is little data available to guide amoxicillin-clavulanic acid dosing in critically ill children. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of both compounds in this pediatric subpopulation. Patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) in whom intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was indicated (25 to 35 mg/kg of body weight every 6 h) were enrolled. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted, and the clinical outcome was documented. A total of 325 and 151 blood samples were collected from 50 patients (median age, 2.58 years; age range, 1 month to 15 years) treated with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, respectively. A three-compartment model for amoxicillin and a two-compartment model for clavulanic acid best described the data, in which allometric weight scaling and maturation functions were added a priori to scale for size and age. In addition, plasma cystatin C and concomitant treatment with vasopressors were identified to have a significant influence on amoxicillin clearance. The typical population values of clearance for amoxicillin and clavulanic acid were 17.97 liters/h/70 kg and 12.20 liters/h/70 kg, respectively. In 32% of the treated patients, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid therapy was stopped prematurely due to clinical failure, and the patient was switched to broader-spectrum antibiotic treatment. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated that four-hourly dosing of 25 mg/kg was required to achieve the therapeutic target for both amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. For patients with augmented renal function, a 1-h infusion was preferable to bolus dosing. Current published dosing regimens result in subtherapeutic concentrations in the early period of sepsis due to augmented renal clearance, which risks clinical failure in critically ill children, and therefore need to be updated. (This study has been registered at Clinicaltrials.gov as an observational study [NCT02456974].). "
29,27264915,"The objective of this study was to determine if physicians would alter their prescribing preferences after sampling liquid formulations of medications for common pediatric diagnoses. This was a prospective interventional before/after study conducted at an academic medical center in the United States. The participants of interest included emergency, family medicine, and pediatric physicians. Participants initially completed a brief survey for their primary oral liquid medication of choice for the treatment of selected disease states. These included otitis media, sinusitis, cellulitis, asthma, colitis, and pneumonia. Participants were asked to choose one of the medication options for each disease and then were given all medications to sample for a taste test. The prescribing preference survey was then repeated. The primary outcome was change in prescribing. McNemar's test was used to evaluate change in proportion of medications chosen before and after taste testing. There were 101 physicians who participated in the study. There were three conditions for which participants changed their prescribing preferences significantly. These were otitis media (change from amoxicillin to cefdinir, difference = 13.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.5% to 21.0%), asthma exacerbation (change from dexamethasone or prednisone to prednisolone, 28%, 95% CI = 15.9% to 40.1%), and pneumonia (change from azithromycin to amoxicillin, 16.0%, 95% CI = 6.4% to 25.6%). There was no significant change with respect to the other scenarios. Physicians showed preferences for certain pediatric medications based on taste and showed significant changes in prescribing preferences for some common pediatric diagnoses after tasting different medications for these conditions.

30,33783918,"Acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common indications for antibiotic prescriptions in otherwise healthy women. We compared the risk of treatment failure of antibiotic regimens for outpatient treatment of UTI in real-world practice. We identified non-pregnant, premenopausal women diagnosed with uncomplicated, lower tract UTI and prescribed an oral antibiotic with activity against common uropathogens. We used propensity score-weighted Kaplan-Meier functions to estimate 30-day risks and risk differences (RD) for pyelonephritis and UTI-related antibiotic prescription switch. Of 1 140 602 patients, the distribution of index prescriptions was 44% fluoroquinolones (non-first-line), 28% trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) (first-line), 24% nitrofurantoin (first-line), 3% narrow-spectrum β-lactams (non-first-line), 1% broad-spectrum β-lactams (non-first-line), and 1% amoxicillin/ampicillin (non-recommended). Compared to the risk of pyelonephritis for nitrofurantoin (0.3%), risks were higher for TMP/SMX (RD, 0.2%; 95% CI, 0.2%-0.2%) and broad-spectrum β-lactams (RD, 0.2%; 95% CI, 0.1%-0.4%). Compared to the risk of prescription switch for nitrofurantoin (12.7%), the risk was higher for TMP/SMX (RD 1.6%; 95% CI 1.3%-1.7%) but similar for broad-spectrum β-lactams (RD -0.7%; 95% CI -1.4%-0.1%) and narrow-spectrum β-lactams (RD -0.3%; 95% CI -0.8%-0.2%). Subgroup analyses suggest TMP/SMX treatment failure may be due in part to increasing uropathogen resistance over time. The risk of treatment failure differed by antibiotic agent, with higher risk associated with TMP/SMX versus nitrofurantoin, and lower or similar risk associated with broad- versus narrow-spectrum β-lactams. Given serious safety warnings for fluoroquinolones, these results suggest that nitrofurantoin may be preferable as the first-line agent for outpatient treatment of uncomplicated UTI. "
31,33553339,"Protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) is a common cause of chronic wet cough in children. However, it is often misdiagnosed and inappropriately treated in clinical practices. This study aims to investigate the current diagnosis and management of PBB among Chinese pediatricians. An electronic questionnaire designed to assess the diagnosis and management of PBB was sent to pediatricians in China. A total of 1,022 pediatricians completed the questionnaire. Most (68.8%) of the pediatricians diagnosed PBB in compliance with the guidelines, 44.3% and 24.5% of them followed microbiology-based and clinical-based diagnosis criteria, respectively. Only 40.4% of the pediatricians chose amoxicillin-clavulanate as the first-line antibiotic for PBB treatment, 23.7% and 23.5% of them chose third-generation cephalosporins and macrolides, respectively. The majority of pediatricians (75.4%) reported 2-4 weeks of antibiotics course, 19.3% of them prescribed a shorter course and 5% of them selected a longer course. Only 26.3% of the pediatricians performed combined investigations of chest high-resolution computed tomography scan (c-HRCT), bronchoscopy, and immunological tests for recurrences of PBB. Compared with general pediatricians (GP), pediatric pulmonologists (PP) preferred microbiology-based diagnosis criteria, prescribed more amoxicillin-clavulanate, and performed more investigations for recurrent patients (P<0.05). The majority of Chinese pediatricians diagnosed PBB in compliance with guidelines. However, the reasonable antibiotics applications and the investigations for recurrent PBB need to be improved. "
32,11880740,"Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis is an infection of the nasal epithelium and paranasal sinus mucosa, usually caused in children by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and, less frequently, group A Streptococcus species. The clinical diagnosis is based on daytime cough that may be worse at night or purulent rhinorrhea, or both, lasting at least 10 days, often worsening after a period of initial improvement after initial symptoms of the common cold, and often associated with facial or dental pain, facial fullness, or swelling, headache, and fever. Sinusitis is diagnosed clinically; radiographic evaluation is not indicated for diagnosis. When the disease persists despite treatment, or is complicated by potential intracranial or orbital extension, CT is the preferred imaging modality. Initial therapy should be amoxicillin in a high dosage (80-90 mg/kg/day). Treatment is generally for 10 to 14 days and for at least 7 days beyond the time of substantial improvement in symptoms. Complications of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in children are rare. "
33,14608264,"Antibiotic therapy remains the treatment of choice for otitis media in most countries despite persuasive evidence that antibiotic therapy provides limited clinical benefit and promotes bacterial resistance. Meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials demonstrated that antibiotics increased resolution at 1 week by only 13%. Amoxicillin remains as effective as any other antibiotic, despite increasing resistance to amoxicillin among the major bacterial pathogens. Immediate antibiotic treatment has been shown to reduce the duration of symptoms by 1 day but not until after the first 24 hours when symptoms were already improving. A delayed prescribing strategy is currently utilized in most children for management of acute otitis media in the Netherlands; this method is now being evaluated elsewhere. Antibiotic therapy is delayed for 48-72 hours after diagnosis; thereafter, antibiotics are initiated only if symptoms persist or worsen. In 2 studies utilizing this strategy (England and the United States), only 24-30% of the patients in the delayed treatment group initiated antibiotic therapy; a majority of parents of children in the delayed group were satisfied with their child's treatment. Treatment of bacterial otitis media (""pus drum"") with high dose amoxicillin (80-100 mg/kg/kd) is recommmended; for acute otitis media without bulging, watchful waiting with a delayed prescribing strategy and treatment of pain is preferred. Yearly administration of the influenza vaccine and/or treatment of influenza with an antiviral (oseltamivir) can significantly decrease the incidence of acute otitis media during influenza season. Although pneumococcal vaccination effectively reduces the incidence of acute otitis media due to vaccine-related serotypes, there is a significant increase in the number of episodes of acute otitis media due to other serotypes of S. pneumoniae such that the overall incidence of acute otitis media is reduced only minimally by pneumoccocal vaccine. The careful use of strict diagnostic criteria coupled with judicious use of antibiotic therapy will direct antibiotic treatment to only those patients likely to benefit. "
34,9310510,"Treatment of otitis media is the most frequent reason for administering antibiotics to children in the United States. However, only limited data are available on medical effectiveness of antibiotic prescribing patterns for otitis media and their associated expenditures or the factors that influence antibiotic prescribing. The study population consisted of 131 169 children during 1991 and 157 065 children during 1992 who were </=13 years of age and enrolled in Colorado's fee-for-service Medicaid program. Among these children, 5127 (1991) and 7254 (1992) were enrolled in the cohort treated for a ""new"" episode of acute otitis media. An analysis using this cohort was performed to document the antibiotics used to treat a new episode of acute otitis media, factors influencing antibiotic selection, and the short-term outcomes of therapy. An analysis using the entire Medicaid population was performed to document the annual use of antibiotics for otitis, the associated antibiotic expenditures, and factors influencing antibiotic selection. In the cohort analysis, office-based physicians prescribed second- and third-generation cephalosporins more often than did physicians in other settings (17% vs 9.7% and 11.8%), whereas hospital clinics prescribed trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole more frequently than did office-based physicians (19.2% vs 7.1% and 10.9%). Family physicians prescribed second- and third-generation cephalosporins more often than did pediatricians (16.6% vs 12.3%) but trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin plus sulfisoxazole less often than did pediatricians (10.5% vs 17%). The average rate of prescribing a second course of antibiotics within 24 days after initial antibiotic treatment of a new acute otitis media episode was 11.6% when less expensive antibiotics (amoxicillin, trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole, or erythromycin plus sulfisoxazole) were prescribed, and 13.2% when more expensive antibiotics (cefaclor, amoxicillin plus clavulanate, or cefixime) were prescribed. The average adverse drug reaction rate was 5.9% when less expensive antibiotics were prescribed, compared with 6.1% when more expensive antibiotics were prescribed. In each of the two study years, amoxicillin accounted for almost half of the total antibiotic fills but only 9% to 10% of the expenditures. Low-cost antibiotics (amoxicillin, trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole, and erythromycin plus sulfisoxazole) were prescribed for 66% to 67% of the total fills and accounted for 21% of the total projected expenditures. More expensive antibiotics (cefaclor, cefixime, amoxicillin plus clavulanate) prescribed for 30% of the fills generated 76% to 77% of expenditures. Cefaclor, prescribed for 17% to 18% of the total fills, generated 43% to 45% of total antibiotic expenses. The findings of this study document a preference for amoxicillin as the initial antibiotic for a new episode of acute otitis media. Although there was a wide variation in the selection of antibiotics to treat otitis, the more expensive antibiotics were not associated with better outcomes. This wide variation has important financial implications because of differences in antibiotic costs. Changes in prescribing patterns among initially uncomplicated children that reduce the use of high-cost antibiotics could reduce expenditures substantially without compromising short-term outcomes. "
35,14658923,"The treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children is empirical, being based on the knowledge of the etiology of CAP at different ages. As a result of currently available methods in everyday clinical practice, a microbe-specific diagnosis is not realistic in the majority of patients. Even the differentiation between viral, 'atypical' bacterial (Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydia pneumoniae) and 'typical' bacterial (Streptococcus pneumoniae) CAP is often not possible. Moreover, up to one-third of CAP cases seem to be mixed viral-bacterial or dual bacterial infections. Recent serologic studies have confirmed that S. pneumoniae is an important causative agent of CAP at all ages. M. pneumoniae is common from the age of 5 years onwards, and C. pneumoniae is common from the age of 10 years onwards. In addition to age, the etiology and treatment of CAP are dependent on the severity of the disease. Pneumococcal infections are predominant in children treated in hospital, and mycoplasmal infections are predominant in children treated at home.In ambulatory patients with CAP, amoxicillin (or penicillin V [phenoxymethylpenicillin]) is the drug of choice from the age of 4 months to 4 years, and at all ages if S. pneumoniae is the presumptive causative organism. Macrolides, preferably clarithromycin or azithromycin, are the first-line drugs from the age of 5 years onwards. In hospitalized patients who need parenteral therapy for CAP, cefuroxime (or penicillin G [benzylpenicillin]) is the drug of choice. Macrolides should be administered concomitantly if M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae infection is suspected. Radiologic findings and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels offer limited help for the selection of antibacterials; alveolar infiltrations and high CRP levels indicate pneumococcal pneumonia, but the lack of these findings does not rule out bacterial CAP. Most guidelines recommend antibacterials for 7-10 days (except azithromycin, which has a recommended treatment duration of 5 days). If no improvement takes place within 2 days, therapy must be reviewed. "
36,23039319,"10 days of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid high dose and 5 days of cefdinir have been the preferred first- or second-line antibiotics for treatment of children with acute otitis media (AOM) since 2004, as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics in the USA, but no head-to-head comparison study has been done. The purpose of the study was to compare the clinical efficacy of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid high-dose therapy for 10 days with cefdinir therapy for 5 days for AOM at recommended doses. This was an investigator-blind trial in young children 6-24 months old with no history of recurrent AOM who were randomly assigned to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (80 mg/kg/day amoxicillin) or cefdinir (14 mg/kg/day), both in two divided doses. The diagnosis of AOM was based on specific clinical criteria by validated otoscopists at two AOM research centres. The outcome measure for clinical cure was resolution of all symptoms and signs of AOM except for persistence of middle-ear effusion at test-of-cure (TOC) 11-14 days after initiation of antibiotic treatment. Clinical failure was defined as persistence of symptoms and signs of AOM and the need for additional antibiotic therapy. Subjects lost to follow up or who had not taken at least 80% of the prescribed medication were classified as having an indeterminate response. Compliance was monitored using Medical Electronic Monitoring System (MEMS) caps and antibiotic bottle volume measurement at the TOC visit. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the association of age with cure rate. Full interactions in terms of age with treatment were included to estimate any age gradient differential. A total of 330 children (average age 13.1 months) with AOM were studied. At TOC, 256 children had clinical cure, 69 had clinical failure, and 5 were lost to follow-up. High-dose amoxicillin/clavulanic acid-treated children had a better cure rate (86.5%) than cefdinir-treated patients (71.0%; p = 0.001). Cefdinir was correlated with less frequent cure outcomes as children increased in age between 6 and 24 months. The odds ratios for clinical cure per increasing month of age estimated from a logistic regression model for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid high dose and cefdinir treatment groups was 0.992 (95% CI 0.932, 1.056), p > 0.05 and 0.932 (95% CI 0.881, 0.986), p = 0.01. The differences in the odds ratios are significant at p < 0.002, indicating a stable clinical cure rate across the ages of children studied for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and decreasing clinical cure rates as children increased in age for cefdinir. In children with bona fide AOM for whom clinical outcomes are assessed by validated otoscopists, 10 days of high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is significantly more effective than 5 days of cefdinir as therapy for AOM. Because of the identified age effect (correlated to child weight), higher doses of cefdinir may have led to a different conclusion; 10 days of cefdinir may also have led to a different conclusion. "
37,15977962,"Ticks can transmit bacterial, protozoal, and viral infections to humans. Specific therapy is available for several of these infections. Doxycycline is the antimicrobial treatment of choice for all patients, regardless of age, with Rocky Mountain spotted fever, human monocytic ehrlichiosis, or human granulocytic ehrlichiosis. Chloramphenicol has been used to treat these infections in children but is demonstrably inferior to doxycycline. In patients with Mediterranean spotted fever, doxycycline, chloramphenicol, and newer macrolides all appear to be effective therapies. Therapy of Lyme disease depends on the age of the child and stage of the disease. For early localized disease, amoxicillin (for those aged <8 years) or doxycycline (for those aged >/=8 years) is effective. Doxycycline, penicillin V (phenoxymethylpenicillin) or penicillin G (benzylpenicillin) preparations, and erythromycin are all effective treatments for tick-borne relapsing fever. Hospitalized patients with tularemia should receive gentamicin or streptomycin. Doxycycline and ciprofloxacin have each been investigated for the treatment of tularemia in outpatients; however, these agents do not yet have established roles in the treatment of this disease in children. Combination therapy with clindamycin and quinine is preferred for children with babesiosis; the combination of azithromycin and atovaquone also appears promising. Ribavirin has been recently shown to markedly improve survival in patients with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. The role of antiviral therapy in the treatment of other tick-borne viral infections, including other hemorrhagic fevers and tick-borne encephalitis, is not yet defined. "
38,1448307,"To determine current opinions among experts in pediatric infectious diseases for treatment of bacterial sepsis, meningitis and acute otitis media, we polled directors of training programs in January, 1992. Responses were received from 69 centers in the United States and Canada. For initial treatment of presumed bacterial meningitis, the third generation cephalosporins alone or combined with ampicillin have become drugs of choice in all age groups. Most infectious disease programs include dexamethasone in the management of presumed bacterial meningitis for children 2 months of age and older. Third generation cephalosporins are also drugs of choice for presumed sepsis: combined with ampicillin for infants 5 weeks of age; used alone for children 5 months and 12 years of age. Amoxicillin remains the preferred drug for initial treatment of acute otitis media. The combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid is favored in the setting of an increased proportion of beta-lactamase-producing bacterial pathogens. Comparison of these results with polls in 1987 and 1989 indicates a shift in recommendations of therapy of presumed bacterial sepsis and meningitis from ampicillin alone or combined with an aminoglycoside or chloramphenicol to use of a third generation cephalosporin alone or combined with ampicillin. "
39,38484862,"Amoxicillin, doxycycline, and clindamycin are among the commonly used antibiotics to treat bacterial infections. However, dosage forms of antibiotics for pediatric patients may not be as readily available as the formulations for adult patients. As such, it is anticipated that during a public health emergency, special instruction may need to be provided on home preparation and administration procedures to dose pediatric patients using available stockpiles of oral tablet and capsule dosage forms. Mixing crushed tablets or capsule contents with soft- or liquid- foods is one of the most common home preparation procedures. To gain knowledge for safe and effective use of prepared drug product instead of the intended intact dosage form, the impact of manipulation of the dosage form was studied. Capsule opening, capsule content assay and uniformity, dissolution, homogeneity, and stability studies of drug mixed with various liquid and soft foods were carried out using intact capsules of amoxicillin, doxycycline, and clindamycin. Higher recovery of capsule contents was achieved when using hands or knives to open capsules compared to using scissors. The capsules of all three antibiotic products contained the labeled amount of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). The peanut butter-drug mixtures failed both United States Pharmacopeia (USP) assay and dissolution criteria because the peanut butter significantly affected the solubility of the drugs, and hence it was omitted from further study. All drug-food mixtures of the three antibiotic products and 15 selected foods exhibited fast dissolution (e.g., >80 % in 60 min) in the tested medium, except for the amoxicillin-chocolate pudding mixture. Three household containers (cups, plates, and bowls) and four mixing times (0.5 min, 1 min, 2 min, and 5 min) were found to be suitable for preparation of homogeneous mixtures of the antibiotics and foods. For practical purposes, 1 to 2 min mixing time is sufficient to produce homogeneous mixtures. The results of this study provided product quality data on the interactions between the antibiotics and the foods and can potentially support future development of home preparation instructions of antibiotics for pediatric patients or patients with swallowing difficulties.

40,26549167,"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of death and a major cause of morbidity in children under the age of 5. Appropriate antimicrobial use is one crucial tool in controlling childhood CAP mortality and suffering. Structured search of current literature. PubMed was consulted for published trials conducted in children with CAP. We aimed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of antimicrobials used to treat childhood CAP, including a critical appraisal of the methodological aspects of these clinical trials. Amoxicillin is the preferred option to treat non-severe non-complicated CAP among children aged ≥2 months. Amoxicillin may be used to treat children in this age group with severe CAP if they do not require hospital assistance. If the patient warrants hospitalization, intravenous penicillin is the chosen option. Heterogeneity was high in the included trials, in regard to clinical inclusion criteria, use of radiological inclusion criteria, placebo use and masking. Higher quality evidence was found in the studies which included amoxicillin. There is a clear dearth of randomized, placebo-controlled, well-performed clinical trials evaluating children with CAP aged under 2 months, or aged 2 months and above with very severe or complicated CAP, or in specific age groups like teenagers.

41,35490055,"Despite evidence supporting short course outpatient antibiotic treatment following appendectomy for perforated appendicitis, evidence of real-world implementation and consensus for antibiotic choice is lacking. We therefore aimed to compare outpatient antibiotic treatment regimens in a national cohort. We identified children who underwent surgery for perforated appendicitis between 2010 and 2018 using the PearlDiver database and compared 45-day disease-specific readmission between children who received shortened (5-8 days) versus prolonged (10-14 day) total antibiotic courses (inpatient intravenous and/or oral) completed with outpatient Amoxicillin/Clavulanate versus Ciprofloxacin/Metronidazole, and compared antibiotic type (5-14 days) to each other. 4916 children were identified, 2001 (90.0%) treated with Amoxicillin/Clavulanate (5-14 days), 381 (19.0%) with shortened (5-8 days), 1464 (73.2%) with prolonged (10-14 days) courses. 222 (10.0%) were treated with Ciprofloxacin/Metronidazole, 44 (19.8%) with shortened, 174 (78.4%) with prolonged courses. Freedom from readmission was not different between prolonged and shortened course whether they received Amoxicillin/Clavulanate (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1.54, 95%CI 0.95-2.5) or Ciprofloxacin/Metronidazole (AHR 3.49, 95%CI 0.45-27.3). Antibiotic type did not affect readmission rate (Amoxicillin/Clavulanate versus Ciprofloxacin/Metronidazole, AHR 1.21, 95%CI 0.71-2.05). Prolonged antibiotic regimens are routinely prescribed despite evidence suggesting shorter courses and antibiotic choice are not associated with greater treatment failure. As it is better tolerated, we recommend a shortened course of Amoxicillin/Clavulanate for oral management of perforated appendicitis. Retrospective. Level III. "
42,1906097,"Cefixime was compared with amoxicillin for treatment of acute otitis media in a randomized trial. Results of tympanocentesis on day 3 to 5 of therapy were used as the major outcome. Total daily doses were 8 mg/kg of cefixime and 40 mg/kg of amoxicillin. One hundred twenty-six patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment; 64 cultures grew pathogens. Pathogens were eradicated from the middle ear after 3 to 5 days of therapy in 27 (79.4%) of 34 children given amoxicillin and 26 (86.7%) of 30 children given cefixime (p = 0.47). When Streptococcus pneumoniae cases were analyzed, bacteriologic cure occurred in 14 (93.3%) of 15 children given amoxicillin and 12 (75%) of 16 given cefixime (p = 0.333). When cases of Haemophilus influenzae infection were analyzed, significantly more cures occurred with cefixime (10/10, 100%) than amoxicillin (8/13, 62%) (p = 0.046). Pathogens associated with failure of amoxicillin therapy were H. influenzae (five cases, two beta-lactamase-positive), S. pneumoniae (one case), and Moraxella catarrhalis (one case, beta-lactamase-positive). The four failures with cefixime therapy were all in patients infected with S. pneumoniae. Rates of rash, diarrhea, and vomiting were the same in both groups and did not necessitate stopping therapy. We conclude the following: (1) Cefixime and amoxicillin were equivalent in overall clinical and bacteriologic efficacy for otitis media. (2) Cefixime was more efficacious than amoxicillin in treating H. influenzae otitis media and should be preferred when H. influenzae is the suspected etiologic agent. (3) Side effects of both drugs were mild and equivalent. "
43,34206831,"In Italy, the bacterial lysate OM-85 (Broncho-Vaxom This study included children aged 1 to 14 years enrolled in Pedianet, a paediatric general practice research database, from January 2007 to June 2017, having at least one prescription of OM-85. Children with less than 12 months of follow-up before (PRE period) and after (POST period) the OM-85 prescription were excluded. The frequency of antibiotic prescriptions and the frequency of RTI episodes in the PRE and POST periods were compared through the post-hoc test. Subgroup analysis was performed in children with recurrent RTIs. 1091 children received 1382 OM-85 prescriptions for a total follow-up of 619,525.5 person-years. Overall, antibiotic prescriptions decreased from a mean of 2.8 (SD (standard deviation) 2.7) prescriptions in the PRE period to a mean of 2.2 (SD 2.6) prescriptions in the POST period ( OM-85 is effective in preventing both antibiotic prescriptions and RTIs in children.

44,28791973,"Inappropriate use of antibiotics by clinicians leads to antibiotic resistance, and is a serious global health concern. The aim of this study was to determine antibiotic prescription practices of dental practitioners and their adherence to professional guidelines while treating oral health problems among children. All the dentists working in Jeddah were invited to participate and 126 dentists consented to be a part of this study. A two-part questionnaire was applied. First section explored the demographics and questions related to antibiotic use for certain dental clinical procedures, whereas the second section used five different clinical case scenarios to elicit the antibiotics prescription practices and adherence to professional guidelines by the dentists. Amoxicillin (73.8%) was the most commonly preferred antibiotic for most of the orofacial infections among the dentists. The overall adherence to the professional guidelines ranged from 9.5 to 45%. A lack of consistency in the antibiotic prescription pattern among dentists in Jeddah and overall low adherence to the professional guidelines was observed. "
45,11919528,"The prevalence of otitis media is increasing, which affects health care resource utilization across all segments, including the urgent care setting. One of the greatest challenges in the management of acute otitis media (AOM) is the effective treatment of cases caused by pathogens that are resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Whereas the production of beta-lactamases among strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis is an important consideration for antimicrobial therapy, the high prevalence of resistance to penicillin and other classes of antibiotics among strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae represents a greater clinical concern. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently convened the Drug Resistant S. pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group to develop evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of AOM in an era of prevalent resistance. The recommendations from this group included amoxicillin as the preferred first-line drug because of the demonstrated activity against penicillin-intermediate and -resistant strains of S. pneumoniae, using higher dosages of up to 90 mg/kg per day in certain settings. For patients in whom initial treatment is unsuccessful after 3 days, the recommended agents included high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (for activity against beta-lactamase-producing pathogens), clindamycin, cefuroxime axetil, or 1 to 3 doses of intramuscular ceftriaxone. The principles set forth in these guidelines can assist the therapeutic decisionmaking process for practitioners in the urgent care setting. "
46,38886111,"Neonatal sepsis (NS) is a global health issue, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, where it accounts for a substantial portion of neonatal morbimortality. This multicountry survey aimed to elucidate current practices, challenges and case definitions in managing NS among clinicians in Sub-Saharan Africa. The survey targeted physicians and medical practitioners working in neonatal care who participated in a Self-Administered Web Questionnaire. The main objective was to understand NS and infection case definitions and management from the clinician's point of view and to identify challenges and opportunities in sepsis management. Participants were queried on demographics, definitions and diagnostic criteria, treatment approaches, and infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. A total of 136 participants from 93 healthcare structures responded, providing valuable insights into NS management practices. From May to July 2022 across 21 Sub-Saharan African countries, 136 neonatal clinicians with an average from 93 structures with on average 10-year experience took the survey. NS ranked highest among prevalent neonatal conditions. Diagnostic case definitions between sepsis and infection were attributed to clinical signs, anamnesis, C reactive protein, white blood cll count and blood cultures with no statistically significant differences. Early-onset sepsis was defined within 72 hours by 48%, while late-onset varied. Antibiotics were likely on admission (86.4%) and during the stay (82.2%). Treatment abandonment was reported unlikely. The preferred antibiotic regimen for early-onset sepsis was intravenous amoxicillin (or ampicillin), gentamycin and cefotaxime. Blood culture availability and IPC protocols were reported as limited, particularly concerning patient environment, pharmacy protocols and clean-dirty circuits. This NS survey emphasises clinicians' challenges due to limited access to diagnostic tools and raises concerns about antimicrobial overexposure. IPC also seem limited, according to participants. Addressing these challenges can enhance diagnostic practices, antibiotic stewardship and infection control in the region. "
47,25934607,"Urine dipsticks have to be used more frequently for the screening of urinary tract infections (UTI) in febrile infants and children (grade A). Confirmation of the UTI by urine culture should prefer other methods of sampling than the urine bag: sampling jet, urethral catheterization, or pubic puncture (grade A). The percentage of Escherichia coli producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) in children accounts for less than 10 % in France and does not justify revising the 2007 recommendations (grade B). An increase in the use of carbapenems in first-line treatment is a major environmental hazard and exposes the patient to the risk of untreatable infections. For febrile UTI, the expert group recommended: (1) recover the results of susceptibility testing as soon as possible to quickly adapt treatment for possible resistant strains; (2) favor initial treatment with aminoglycosides (particularly amikacin) which remain active in the majority of ESBL strains for patients seen in the pediatric emergency department and/or hospital; (3) ceftriaxone (IV or IM) remains an appropriate treatment for patients seen in the emergency department or outpatient clinic because the percentage of ESBL-producing enterobacteria strains remains low; (4) use oral cefixime (grade B) in nonsevere cases and low-risk patients defined as age>3 months, general condition preserved, disease duration of fever<4 days, no associated comorbidity, and no history of urinary tract infection, uropathy, or prior antibiotic therapy in the last 3 months; (5) oral relay for parenteral treatment is guided by in vitro susceptibility testing, in an attempt to reduce the use of oral cephalosporins to limit the selection of resistant bacterial strains. The total duration of treatment recommended is usually 10 days. Except for special circumstances, there is no need to prescribe retrograde cystography or antibiotic prophylaxis after a first febrile urinary tract infection. For cystitis, the panel recommends systematic urinalysis and initial prescription before the results of the urine culture of one of the three following oral antibiotics: amoxicillin-clavulanate, cotrimoxazole, cefixime. The total duration of antibiotic treatment is 5days to tailor treatment based on clinical progression and antibiotic susceptibility. "
48,26676711,"Current evidence suggests that nonoperative management of uncomplicated appendicitis is safe, but overall effectiveness is determined by combining medical outcomes with the patient's and family's perspective, goals, and expectations. To determine the effectiveness of patient choice in nonoperative vs surgical management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in children. Prospective patient choice cohort study in patients aged 7 to 17 years with acute uncomplicated appendicitis presenting at a single pediatric tertiary acute care hospital from October 1, 2012, through March 6, 2013. Participating patients and families gave informed consent and chose between nonoperative management and urgent appendectomy. Urgent appendectomy or nonoperative management entailing at least 24 hours of inpatient observation while receiving intravenous antibiotics and, on demonstrating improvement of symptoms, completion of 10 days of treatment with oral antibiotics. The primary outcome was the 1-year success rate of nonoperative management. Successful nonoperative management was defined as not undergoing an appendectomy. Secondary outcomes included comparisons of the rates of complicated appendicitis, disability days, and health care costs between nonoperative management and surgery. A total of 102 patients were enrolled; 65 patients/families chose appendectomy (median age, 12 years; interquartile range [IQR], 9-13 years; 45 male [69.2%]) and 37 patients/families chose nonoperative management (median age, 11 years; IQR, 10-14 years; 24 male [64.9%]). Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups. The success rate of nonoperative management was 89.2% (95% CI, 74.6%-97.0%) at 30 days (33 of 37 children) and 75.7% (95% CI, 58.9%-88.2%) at 1 year (28 of 37 children). The incidence of complicated appendicitis was 2.7% in the nonoperative group (1 of 37 children) and 12.3% in the surgery group (8 of 65 children) (P = .15). After 1 year, children managed nonoperatively compared with the surgery group had fewer disability days (median [IQR], 8 [5-18] vs 21 [15-25] days, respectively; P < .001) and lower appendicitis-related health care costs (median [IQR], $4219 [$2514-$7795] vs $5029 [$4596-$5482], respectively; P = .01). When chosen by the family, nonoperative management is an effective treatment strategy for children with uncomplicated acute appendicitis, incurring less morbidity and lower costs than surgery. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01718275.

49,3052769,"Although amoxicillin has long been the preferred drug for treatment of acute otitis media, resistant strains of two relatively common causal organisms have emerged, prompting a search for other antibiotics. We performed a randomized double-blind trial comparing amoxicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in 221 children in whom acute otitis media was diagnosed in an outpatient setting. Diagnosis was on the basis of symptoms, otoscopic examination and acoustic reflectometry. No culture specimens were taken. A research nurse, using the same methods, evaluated patients in a follow-up home visit at around 14 days and measured compliance by examination of the medicine bottle. Equal proportions of children in the two groups were cured or improved (88% and 87%). Therapeutic efficacy was related to compliance in both groups, and there were few side effects in either group. This study had statistical power of 80% to detect a difference of 15%. We conclude that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can be considered a first-line antibiotic in the treatment of acute otitis media.

50,9114989,"This study examined the palatability of 22 antimicrobial suspensions by using five independent categories for scoring: appearance, smell, texture, taste, and aftertaste. The likely overall influence on patient compliance was also evaluated. Drugs were compared within their respective classes. The only antibiotics judged to be so unpalatable as to potentially jeopardize compliance were dicloxacillin, oxacillin, erythromycin/sulfisoxazole, and cefpodoxime. Among the penicillins, amoxicillin and ampicillin were preferred. Azithromycin was slightly superior to erythromycin and clarithromycin within the macrolide class. Many cephalosporins were ranked quite high, the best being loracarbef, cefadroxyl, cefprozil, and cefixime. "
51,28418807,"Human milk is the preferred nutrition for neonates and a source of bacteria. Research aim: The authors aimed to characterize the molecular epidemiology and genetic content of staphylococci in the human milk of mothers of preterm and term neonates. Staphylococci were isolated once per week in the 1st month postpartum from the human milk of mothers of 20 healthy term and 49 preterm neonates hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit. Multilocus variable-number tandem-repeats analysis and multilocus sequence typing were used. The presence of the mecA gene, icaA gene of the ica-operon, IS 256, and ACME genetic elements was determined by PCR. The human milk of mothers of preterm compared with term neonates had higher counts of staphylococci but lower species diversity. The human milk of mothers of preterm compared with term neonates more often contained Staphylococcus epidermidis mecA (32.7% vs. 2.6%), icaA (18.8% vs. 6%), IS 256 (7.9% vs. 0.9%), and ACME (15.4% vs. 5.1%), as well as Staphylococcus haemolyticus mecA (90.5% vs. 10%) and IS 256 (61.9% vs. 10%). The overall distribution of multilocus variable-number tandem-repeats analysis (MLVA) types and sequence types was similar between the human milk of mothers of preterm and term neonates, but a few mecA-IS 256-positive MLVA types colonized only mothers of preterm neonates. Maternal hospitalization within 1 month postpartum and the use of an arterial catheter or antibacterial treatment in the neonate increased the odds of harboring mecA-positive staphylococci in human milk. Limiting exposure of mothers of preterm neonates to the hospital could prevent human milk colonization with more pathogenic staphylococci. "
52,29986729,"Retail drug shops play a significant role in managing pediatric fevers in rural areas in Uganda. Targeted interventions to improve drug seller practices require understanding of the retail drug shop market and motivations that influence practices. This study aimed at describing the operational environment in relation to the Uganda National Drug Authority guidelines for setup of drug shops; characteristics, and dispensing practices of private retail drug shops in managing febrile conditions among under-five children in rural western Uganda. Cross sectional survey of 74 registered drug shops, observation checklist, and 428 exit interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire with care-seekers of children under five years of age, who sought care at drug shops during the survey period. The survey was conducted in Mbarara and Bushenyi districts, South Western Uganda, in May 2013. Up to 90 and 79% of surveyed drug shops in Mbarara and Bushenyi, largely operate in premises that meet National Drug Authority requirements for operational suitability and ensuring medicines safety and quality. Drug shop attendants had some health or medical related training with 60% in Mbarara and 59% in Bushenyi being nurses or midwives. The rest were clinical officers, pharmacists. The most commonly stocked medicines at drug shops were Paracetamol, Quinine, Cough syrup, ORS/Zinc, Amoxicillin syrup, Septrin® syrup, Artemisinin-based combination therapies, and multivitamins, among others. Decisions on what medicines to stock were influenced by among others: recommended medicines from Ministry of Health, consumer demand, most profitable medicines, and seasonal disease patterns. Dispensing decisions were influenced by: prescriptions presented by client, patients' finances, and patient preferences, among others. Most drug shops surveyed had clinical guidelines, iCCM guidelines, malaria and diarrhea treatment algorithms and charts as recommended by the Ministry of Health. Some drug shops offered additional services such as immunization and sold non-medical goods, as a mechanism for diversification. Most drug shops premises adhered to the recommended guidelines. Market factors, including client demand and preferences, pricing and profitability, and seasonality largely influenced dispensing and stocking practices. Improving retail drug shop practices and quality of services, requires designing and implementing both supply-side and demand side strategies. "
53,15060689,"In order to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety profiles of single-dose ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg, not exceeding 1 g) and a 10-day course of amoxicillin-clavulanate (amoxi-clav) [45 mg/kg/day, in 3 divided doses] in children with acute otitis media (AOM), we conducted a prospective, comparative, randomized trial. Between February 2000 and April 2002, 110 children with a mean age of 30.73 +/- 20.79 months were enrolled. 109 patients were evaluated for the safety assessment. The intent-to treat population included 96 patients who completed at least 3 days of treatment. The standard analysis population included 73 patients who completed the 10-day treatment period without any major violation. For the standard analysis population, 57 out of 73 patients experienced treatment success; 31 out of 41 patients in the ceftriaxone group were cured compared with 25 out of 32 patients in the amoxi-clav group. The rate of persistence of middle-ear fluid did not differ between the 2 groups at day 11 or day 28. A higher treatment preference rate was observed in the ceftriaxone group (93.9% vs 58.6%). The most common drug-related adverse effects were found in the digestive system, skin and appendages in both treatment groups. A single dose of ceftriaxone is as safe and effective as amoxi-clav for curing patients with acute otitis media. In addition, a substantially higher proportion of patients receiving single-dose ceftriaxone showed a preference for the study medication compared with those treated with amoxi-clav for 10 days. "
54,33806477,"Standard surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis (SAP) regimens are less effective in preventing surgical site infections (SSIs) due to rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR) rates, particularly for patients undergoing colorectal surgery. This study aimed to evaluate whether ertapenem should be a preferred strategy for the prevention of SSIs following elective colorectal surgery compared to three standard SAP regimens: amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, and cefazolin plus metronidazole. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using decision tree models. Probabilities of SSIs and AMR-SSIs, costs, and effects (in terms of quality-adjusted life-years) were considered in the assessment of the alternative strategies. Input parameters integrated real data from the Italian surveillance system for SSIs with data from the published literature. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the potential impact of the decreasing efficacy of standard SAP regimens in preventing SSIs. According to our models, ertapenem was the most cost-effective strategy only when compared to amoxicillin-clavulanate, but it did not prove to be superior to cefoxitin and cefazolin plus metronidazole. The sensitivity analysis found ertapenem would be the most cost-effective strategy compared to these agents if their failure rate was more than doubled. The findings of this study suggest ertapenem should not be a preferred strategy for SAP in elective colorectal surgery. "
55,32836139,"The Italian Guideline for the management of acute otitis media (AOM) in children has been recently updated. We conducted a cross-sectional survey to investigate the adherence of Italian primary care paediatricians to the guideline recommendations. A questionnaire including 13 closed-ended questions was administered to the paediatricians participating in the 24th National Congress of Practical Pediatrics, held in Florence in November 2019. The answers were collected and analyzed. Eight hundred fifty-four out of 1000 questionnaires were collected (85.4%). Most of the participants declared that they did not remove the cerumen (63.9%). Pneumatic otoscope and tympanometry were routinely used by a minority of paediatricians (9.6% and 3.9%, respectively); all the participants declared to routinely prescribe oral analgesic drugs and 97.6% of them considered amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid as the first-choice antibiotic. In an uncomplicated unilateral AOM case, the preferred strategy was immediate antibiotic therapy in children under two years of age (83.1%) and watchful waiting in those >2 years (77.3%). Oral amoxicillin was most commonly prescribed at the 80-100 mg/kg/day (56.6%), in 3 daily doses (87.7%), while amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was equally prescribed at 80-100 or 50 mg/kg/day (47.1%-48.5%), mainly in 2 doses (58.6%). However, both drugs are recommended at a dosage of 80-90 mg/kg/day (calculated on amoxicillin), in 3 daily doses. Although the Guideline recommends ten days of therapy, both drugs were most commonly prescribed for 7-8 days (55.5%-57.7%). Pneumococcal and flu vaccines were recommended only by 41.6% and 31.6% of participants, respectively. Our data suggest adequate adherence of the guideline recommendations considering the preferred antibiotic drug, pain management and the choice between immediate antibiotic therapy and watchful waiting. Conversely, targeted training programs are needed to improve adherence to recommendations on cerumen removal, use of pneumatic otoscopy, correct use of antibiotics in terms of optimal dosage, duration and number of daily administrations, and to implement proper AOM prevention strategies.

56,33108920,"To gain an overview of the current management of patients with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) in Swiss maternity hospitals. We conducted a survey among all maternity hospitals in Switzerland from January to December 2018, irrespective of their annual birth rate and level of complexity. The survey consisted of an 11-item questionnaire, which was developed to retrieve information relevant to different areas of PPROM management. Of 64 questionnaires distributed by email, 36 (56.3%) centers responded to the survey. Up to 12 different antibiotic regimens were reported. Among these, 91.7% included a beta-lactam, with amoxicillin as the preferred agent (55.6%). Combined antibiotic schemes were used in 30.6% of hospitals. All centers considered the use of corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity if PPROM occurred before 34 weeks, although 36.1% would consider their use until 37 weeks' gestation in the presence of an increased risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Maternity hospitals who accept deliveries at any gestational age usually used magnesium sulfate as fetal neuroprotection when delivering babies <32 weeks, with the exception of two hospitals where it was either not used or only indicated if maternal preeclampsia was present. Concerning the time to delivery, 58.3% centers tended to wait until 37 weeks' gestation, while the others considered that it was not necessary to go beyond 34 weeks. Our survey shows that the current management of PPROM in Switzerland appears to be mostly in line with international recommendations. However, some heterogeneity exists, thus reflecting a lack of international consensus across guidelines, together with the absence of national Swiss guidelines, and this needs to be addressed to ensure high quality care for all patients and neonates.

57,20660544,"The use of cochlear implants is increasingly common, particularly in children younger than 3 years. Bacterial meningitis, often with associated acute otitis media, is more common in children with cochlear implants than in groups of control children. Children with profound deafness who are candidates for cochlear implants should receive all age-appropriate doses of pneumococcal conjugate and Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccines and appropriate annual immunization against influenza. In addition, starting at 24 months of age, a single dose of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine should be administered. Before implant surgery, primary care providers and cochlear implant teams should ensure that immunizations are up-to-date, preferably with completion of indicated vaccines at least 2 weeks before implant surgery. Imaging of the temporal bone/inner ear should be performed before cochlear implantation in all children with congenital deafness and all patients with profound hearing impairment and a history of bacterial meningitis to identify those with inner-ear malformations/cerebrospinal fluid fistulas or ossification of the cochlea. During the initial months after cochlear implantation, the risk of complications of acute otitis media may be higher than during subsequent time periods. Therefore, it is recommended that acute otitis media diagnosed during the first 2 months after implantation be initially treated with a parenteral antibiotic (eg, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime). Episodes occurring 2 months or longer after implantation can be treated with a trial of an oral antimicrobial agent (eg, amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate at a dose of approximately 90 mg/kg per day of amoxicillin component), provided the child does not appear toxic and the implant does not have a spacer/positioner, a wedge that rests in the cochlea next to the electrodes present in certain implant models available between 1999 and 2002. ""Watchful waiting"" without antimicrobial therapy is inappropriate for children with implants with acute otitis media. If feasible, tympanocentesis should be performed for acute otitis media, and the material should be sent for culture, but performance of this procedure should not result in an undue delay in initiating antimicrobial therapy. For patients with suspected meningitis, cerebrospinal fluid as well as middle-ear fluid, if present, should be sent for culture. Empiric antimicrobial therapy for meningitis occurring within 2 months of implantation should include an agent with broad activity against Gram-negative bacilli (eg, meropenem) plus vancomycin. For meningitis occurring 2 months or longer after implantation, standard empiric antimicrobial therapy for meningitis (eg, ceftriaxone plus vancomycin) is indicated. For patients with meningitis, urgent evaluation by an otolaryngologist is indicated for consideration of imaging and surgical exploration. "
58,34556347,"This study set out to determine the antimicrobial resistance trends of Haemophilus influenzae isolates from pediatric hospitals in Mainland China, which would provide basis for clinical treatment. The Infectious Disease Surveillance of Pediatrics (ISPED) collaboration group conducted this study. H. influenzae strains isolated from nine pediatric hospitals in Mainland China were included. Disk diffusion method was used for antimicrobial susceptibility test. Cefinase disc was used for detection of β-lactamase. In total, 13810 H. influenzae isolates were included during 2017-2019: 93.17% of which were from respiratory tract specimens, 4.63% from vaginal swabs, 1.10% from secretion, and 1.10% from others. Of all strains, 63.32% isolates produced β-lactamase; 8.22% isolates were β-lactamase-negative and ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR). The resistance to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim was 70.98%, followed by resistance to ampicillin (69.37%), cefuroxime (51.35%), ampicillin-sulbactam (38.82%), azithromycin (38.21%), amoxicillin-clavulanate (35.28%). More than 90% of H. influenzae isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, meropenem, levofloxacin and chloramphenicol. The resistance rate of ampicillin and azithromycin in H. influenzae showed an increasing trend through the years. Statistically significant differences in antibiotic-resistance rates of all the antibiotics except chloramphenicol were found in different regions. The major Multi-Drug Resistance pattern was resistant to β-lactams, macrolides, and sulfonamides. There is a rising trend of resistance rate of ampicillin and azithromycin in H. influenzae. Antimicrobial resistance of H. influenzae deserves our ongoing attention. Third-generation cephalosporin could be the preferred treatment option of infections caused by ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae. "
59,29273072,"Children are the most vulnerable population exposed to the use of antibiotics often incorrectly prescribed for the treatment of infections really due to viruses rather than to bacteria. We designed the MAREA study which consisted of two different studies: i) a surveillance study to monitor the safety/efficacy of the antibiotics for the treatment of pneumonia (CAP), pharyngotonsillitis and acute otitis media in children younger than 14 yrs old, living in Liguria, North-West Italy and ii) a pre-/post-interventional study to evaluate the appropriateness of antibiotic prescription for the treatment these infections. In this paper, we show only results of the appropriateness study about the antibiotic prescription for the treatment of pneumonia. Patients included in this study met the following inclusion criteria: i) admission to the Emergency/Inpatient Dpt/outpatient clinic of primary care pediatricians for pneumonia requiring antibiotics, ii) informed written consent. The practice of prescribing antibiotics was evaluated before-and-after a 1 day-educational intervention on International/National recommendations. Global adherence to guidelines was fulfilled in 45%: main reason for discordance was duration (shorter than recommended). Macrolide monotherapy and cephalosporins were highly prescribed; ampicillin/amoxicillin use was limited. 61% of patients received >1 antibiotic; parenteral route was used in 33%. After intervention, i) in all CAP, cephalosporin prescription decreased (-23%) and the inappropriate macrolide prescriptions was halved and, ii) in not hospitalized CAP (notH-CAP), macrolides were prescribed less frequently (-25%) and global adherence to guidelines improved (+39%); and iii) in H-CAP antibiotic choice appropriateness increase. Prescribing practices were sufficiently appropriate but widespread preference for multidrug empirical regimens or macrolide in monotherapy deserve closer investigation. "
60,9265886,"To assess the management strategies and knowledge of board-certified pediatricians regarding group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis. Survey of 1000 US pediatricians in 1991, chosen randomly from the membership of the American Academy of Pediatrics. The survey included questions related to 2 clinical scenarios, respondent demographics, and knowledge of streptococcal pharyngitis. Pediatricians who treated patients with pharyngitis. Of the 690 surveys that were returned, 510 pediatricians treated patients with pharyngitis and were included in the data analysis. Data were analyzed using Chi 2 statistics for categorical data and the Student t test for continuous variables. Antigen detection tests (ADTs) were used by 64% of the pediatricians; 85% used throat cultures. Strategies for diagnosing streptococcal pharyngitis were throat culture alone (38%), consider positive ADTs definitive and use throat culture when ADTs are negative (42%), ADT alone (13%), ADT and throat culture for all patients with pharyngitis (5%), and no tests for GABHS performed (2%). Thirty-one percent usually or always treated with antibiotics before test results were available. Only 29% of these ""early treaters"" always discontinued antibiotics when tests did not confirm the presence of group A streptococci. The drug of choice for treatment was penicillin (73%); another 26% preferred a derivative of penicillin, particularly amoxicillin. Many pediatricians altered their management when a patient had recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis. Nearly half of the respondents would use a different antibiotic than they used for routine acute streptococcal pharyngitis. They most often changed to erythromycin (25%), cefadroxil (23%), or amoxicillin-clavulanate (20%). Follow-up throat culture was obtained by 51% of pediatricians after treatment of recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis. A patient with chronic carriage of GABHS and symptoms of pharyngitis would be treated with an antibiotic by 84%; most (62%) would use a penicillin. Other choices were cephalosporins (19%), erythromycin (12%), clindamycin (3%), or rifampin plus penicillin (3%). Tonsillectomy was recommended for symptomatic carriers by 31% of respondents. Carriers without symptoms were less likely to be treated with antibiotics (23%) or referred for tonsillectomy (21%). Most surveyed board-certified pediatricians managed acute GABHS pharyngitis appropriately, but 15% to 20% used diagnostic or treatment strategies that are not recommended. There was lack of a consensus about the management of recurrent GABHS pharyngitis and chronic carriage of GABHS. "
61,15672640,"With the discovery of penicillin and entrance into the antibiotic era, the capability of dentists to treat dental infections have changed dramatically. Many antibacterial agents have developed since, but bacterial resistance using diverse mechanisms, have increased concomitantly. Since antimicrobial agents are frequently needed in dentistry, their judicious use is of prime importance. Dental infections can be divided to two main groups according to the origin of the infection. First, odontogenic infections (acute dento-alveolar abscess) originating from the dental pulp are most commonly caused by gram-positive anaerobic or facultative bacteria. Systemic antibiotic should be given concomitantly with drainage of the dento-alveolar abscess, debridment of the root canal of the infected tooth, and placement of inta-canal antimicrobial medication such as calcium hydroxide. Penicillin G, penicillin V (Rafapen) or amoxycillin (moxypen) are the first line systemic antimicrobial agents. In case of no improvement within 2-3 days, second line regimens such as amoxycillin-clavulanate (augmentin), cefuroxime (zinnat) or penicillin and metronidazole are recommended. In patients allergic to penicillin, clindamycinn (dalacin) is preferred over macrolides. The second group of infections originates from the periodontal apparatus, and is caused usually by gram-negative anaerobes bacilli, sometimes with Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitance (Aa). Systemic antibiotics are only infrequently indicated in this situation, and always accompanied by scaling, root planning and curettage of the infected root and gingiva. In regenerative or post surgical periodontitis, augmentin, metronidazole or metronidazole in combination with penicillin or amoxycillin augmentin are recommended. In aggressive periodontitis the most common pathogen is Aa and therefore tetracycline, augmentin, or metronidazole and amoxicillin are recommended. In necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, which is caused usually by fusiform bacilli and spirochetes, metronidazole or augmentin are appropriate. In patients with periodontal disease who are allergic to penicillin can be treated with a macrolides. "
62,23433920,"Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most frequent diagnoses and reasons for prescribing antibiotics in children. The aims of this prospective study were the following: (1) to assess the continuing education of physicians and the sources of information about AOM; (2) to assess the current knowledge of and attitudes toward AOM as well as the compliance with AOM guidelines; (3) to evaluate opinions about vaccines against AOM; and (4) to estimate the potential costs of AOM on the healthcare system in Turkey. This is a web-based cross-sectional survey of a national convenience sample of 600 physicians in Turkey (325 pediatricians (PEDs), 214 family physicians/general practitioners (FP&GPs) and 61 otolaryngologists (ENTs)). Approximately 38.6% of participants (39.4% of PEDs, 44.3% of GP&FPs and 14.7% of ENTs) stated that pneumatic otoscopy is essential for AOM diagnosis. Regarding the most common etiological agents of AOM in children, 54.2% of PEDs, 51.4% of FP&GPs and 57.4% of ENTs stated that the most common causative agents of AOM are Streptococcus pneumoniae and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae. Nearly 76% of participants indicated they use direct antibiotic therapy when they diagnose AOM in certain situations. The first-line choice of antibiotic therapy is amoxicillin clavulanate, and 67% of participants prefer to use antibiotic therapy for 7-10 days. Approximately 31% of all participants stated that ""viruses"" are the main cause of AOM; however, 62% of these participants reported using antibiotic therapy. In comparison, 32% participants from private clinics prefer to treat AOM primarily with observation, a rate that is significantly higher than that of other clinical settings. Physicians who prefer to use observation strategy also prefer the combination of paracetamol and NSAIDs. Approximately 41% of participants have undergone postgraduate medical education on the topic of AOM. In total, 73% of all participant physicians believe that otitis media is a vaccine-preventable disease. With the information from all of the participants, the calculated mean cost per case of AOM is 28 ± 4 USD. In Turkey, the estimated incidence of AOM is 24,000-33,000 cases per 10,000 children <5 years of age (1,820,000-2,100,000 cases per year), and the estimated total cost of AOM is 61,152,000 USD (not including acute otitis media-related complications and otitis media-related hospitalizations). The medical and economic burden of AOM to the health economics in Turkey is considerable. Specific educational programs and evidence-based national guidelines concerning AOM should be implemented. Improving diagnostic accuracy with education will lead to improved management, judicious use of antibiotics, decreased antibiotic resistance, and potential economic benefits. A more prudent use of antibiotics would also lower the economic burden of this disease. Vaccination seems to be promising for the prevention of AOM. "

64,38663978,"To evaluate the implementation of an antimicrobial stewardship programme-led inpatient beta-lactam allergy de-labelling programme using a direct oral provocation test (OPT). One-year quality improvement study using a before-after design. Free-standing tertiary care paediatric hospital. Patients with a reported beta-lactam allergy admitted to the paediatric medicine inpatient unit. Following standardised assessment and risk stratification of reported symptoms, patients with a low-risk history were offered an OPT. Beta-lactam allergy labels were removed if a reported history was considered non-allergic or after successful OPT. Removal of inappropriate beta-lactam allergy labels. 80 patients with 85 reported beta-lactam allergies were assessed. Median age was 8.1 years (IQR 4.8-12.9) and 34 (42%) were female. The majority (n=55, 69%) had an underlying medical condition. Amoxicillin was the most reported allergy (n=25, 29%). Reported reactions were primarily dermatological (n=65, 77%). Half of participants (n=40) were ineligible for OPT, with equal proportions due to clinical reasons or the nature of the reported reaction. Of the 40 eligible patients, 28 patients (70%) were de-labelled either by history alone (n=10) or OPT (n=18). All OPTs were successful. De-labelling allowed five additional patients (11% of those receiving antibiotics) to receive the preferred beta-lactam. Including patients who were subsequently assessed in the allergy clinic, almost half of all evaluated patients were de-labelled (n=37, 46%). An antimicrobial stewardship programme-led programme using a direct OPT was feasible and safe for expanding beta-lactam allergy de-labelling to paediatric patients admitted to the paediatric medicine inpatient unit.

66,24766676,"Despite convincing evidence that oral and injected amoxicillin have equal efficacy in children with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospitalized children often receive injected antibiotics. To investigate whether shared decision-making (choosing the antibiotic route) influences parental satisfaction. In a one-year questionnaire-based study, we enrolled consecutive children hospitalized for CAP. At admission, all children's parents received a leaflet on CAP. Parents arriving during the daytime were assigned to a shared group and could choose the antibiotic route, those admitted at other times were assigned to an unshared group for whom physicians chose the antibiotic route. Shared group parents answered anonymous questionnaire investigating why they chose a specific route. Parents in both groups answered another anonymous questionnaire at discharge assessing perceived satisfaction with care. Parents' satisfaction with perceived medical information as assessed by data from a questionnaire. Of the 95 children enrolled, more children's parents were assigned to the unshared than the shared group (77 vs. 18). Of the 18 children's parents in the shared group, 14 chose the oral antibiotic route mainly to avoid painful injections. Doctors explanations were considered better in the shared than in the unshared group (P = 0.02). The larger number of children's parents assigned to the unshared group reflects paediatricians' reluctance to offer shared-decision making. Well-informed parents prefer oral antibiotic therapy for children with severe CAP. Allowing parents choose the antibiotic route respects parents' wishes, reduces children's pain and improves satisfaction. "

68,8451092,"We mailed a checklist survey to 1600 randomly selected pediatricians, family practice physicians (FPPs) and emergency medicine physicians (EMPs) in the United States regarding their management of children with high fever and no focus of infection at various ages: 3 weeks; 7 weeks; 4 months; and 16 months. Completed questionnaires were returned by 211 of 600 (35.2%) pediatricians, 145 of 500 (29%) FPPs and 141 of 500 (28.2%) EMPs. Most pediatricians, FPPs and EMPs would hospitalize a 3- or 7-week-old infant with fever and most pediatricians and FPPs would treat infants of this age group empirically with antibiotics. Most pediatricians, FPPs and EMPs would not hospitalize a 4-month-old or a 16-month-old with high fever with no focus of infection but 44 and 25% of pediatricians, 38 and 24% of FPPs and 41 and 34% of EMPs, respectively, would treat a 4- and 16-month-old child with high fever and no focus of infection with antibiotics. The preferred antibiotic treatment for hospitalized 3- and 7-week-old infants was ampicillin plus gentamicin or ampicillin plus cefotaxime; for older outpatients preferred treatment was amoxicillin or ceftriaxone. We conclude that hospitalization and empiric antibiotic treatment of very young infants (< 2 months of age) with high fever and no focus of infection are preferred by most of the pediatricians, FPPs and EMPs surveyed. Nearly one-half of these physicians would treat 4-month-olds and a fourth would treat 16-month-olds with high fever and no focus of infection with antibiotics as outpatients. "
69,25378379,"To describe current practice among European paediatricians regarding diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections in children aged 1-36 months and to compare these practices with recently published guidelines. Web-based large scale survey evaluating knowledge of, attitudes towards and the methods for diagnosing, treating and managing urinary tract infections in children. Primary and secondary care practices in Europe. 1129 paediatricians. A diagnosis of urinary tract infection is considered by 62% of the respondents in children aged 1-36 months with unexplained fever. The preferred method of urine collection is use of a bag (53% for infants <3 months and 59% for children 4-36 months of age). 60% of paediatricians agree that oral and parenteral antibiotics have equal efficacy. Co-amoxiclav is the antibiotic of choice for 41% of participants, while 9% prescribe amoxicillin. 80% of respondents prescribe ultrasound in all children with a confirmed urinary tract infection. 63% of respondents prescribe a cystography when abnormalities are revealed during ultrasound evaluation. A quarter of respondents recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for all children with any vesicoureteral reflux. The data among European countries are very heterogeneous. The three most recent urinary tract infection guidelines (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the American Academy of Paediatrics and the Italian Society of Paediatric Nephrology) are not followed properly. Management of febrile urinary tract infections remains controversial and heterogeneous in Europe. Simple, short, practical and easy-to-remember guidelines and educational strategies to ensure their implementation should be developed. "
70,23667800,"Aims of the study were to compare the paediatric outpatient antibiotic use in two countries with low overall antibiotic consumption and antibacterial resistance levels - Sweden and Estonia - and to describe the adherence to Estonian treatment guideline. All prescriptions for systemic antibiotics for children less than 18 years during 2007 from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register and Estonian Health Insurance Fund database were identified to conduct a descriptive drug utilisation study. The total paediatric antibiotic use was 616 and 353 per 1000 in Estonia and Sweden, respectively. The greatest between country differences occurred in the age group 2 to 6 years -Estonian children received 1184 and Swedish children 528 prescriptions per 1000. Extended spectrum penicillin amoxicillin (189 per 1000) or its combination with beta-lactamase inhibitor (81 per 1000) and a newer macrolide clarithromycin (127 per 1000) were prescribed most often in Estonia whereas narrow spectrum penicillin phenoxymethylpenicillin (169 per 1000) and older generation macrolide erythromycin (21 per 1000) predominated in Sweden. For acute bronchitis, 17 different antibiotics (most commonly clarithromycin) were prescribed in Estonia despite the guideline recommendation not to use antibiotics. The higher rate of antibiotic use especially of extended spectrum antibiotics in Estonia compared to Sweden emphasizes the need for national activities to promote appropriate use of antibiotics while treating children, even when the overall antibiotic consumption is low.

In a taste test of 4 antimicrobial agents, azithromycin (cherry flavored), cefprozil (bubble gum flavored), cefixime (strawberry flavored), and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (banana flavored) were compared. An urban inner-city primary care clinic. A volunteer sample of 30 healthy children (aged 5-8 years). Palatability was determined using a single-blind taste test of 4 flavored antimicrobial agents. The 4 antimicrobial agents used were azithromycin, cefprozil, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. After each antimicrobial test dose, subjects rated the taste on a 10-cm visual analog scale incorporating a facial hedonic scale. Preference assessments for the best-tasting and worst-tasting agent were also conducted. Of the 20 children who expressed a preference, significantly more children (9 [45%], P<.05) selected the cefixime preparation as the best-tasting formulation compared with the other preparations. The cefixime preparation was also significantly the least likely to be selected as the worst-tasting preparation (2 [10%], P<.05). There were no significant differences between the other 3 preparations with respect to being selected as either the best or worst tasting. The mean (+/- SD) visual analog scale score for cefixime was highest (8.53 [2.49]) compared with the scores for azithromycin (6.78 [3.45]), cefprozil (6.26 [4.04]), and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (6.24 [4.01]). The cefixime preparation was most commonly rated as best tasting by children. "
72,32727466,"Urinary tract infections (UTI) are mostly caused by bacteria. Urine cultures are usually a definitive measure to select the appropriate antibiotics for the elimination of a uropathogen and subsequent recovery from the infection. However, the preferred antibiotics as determined by urine culture and sensitivity may still not eliminate the infection and would require further examination to ascertain the cause of treatment failure which could be unresolved bacteriuria, bacterial persistence, immediate reinfection with a different uropathogen or misdiagnosis. A 2-years 7 months-old female was admitted in the Regional hospital of Buea following persistent fever. An auto medication with amoxicillin was reported. Urinalysis was done on the first day and the sediment of the cloudy urine revealed many bacteria and few pus cells. Ceftriaxone was prescribed as empirical treatment and a request for urine and blood culture was made. Three days after admission, the temperature and CRP were 39.0 °C and 96 mg/l, respectively. The urine culture results (> 10 Antibiotics tailored towards the elimination of a particular bacterial species may as well provide a favorable environment for other bacterial species that are resistant to it in the course of treating a UTI episode. This apparent treatment failure may first of all require a second urine culture for confirmation rather than considering the possibilities of a misdiagnosis. "
73,10608630,"Noncompliance with a prescribed therapy is a common problem in ambulatory pediatrics. To establish a nationwide status quo of compliance of German ambulatory pediatric patients with oral antibiotics prescribed for various bacterial infections. In this study, organized and financed by the German Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases, 42 pediatricians in private practice who were selected to represent the 3 main regions of Germany and residence in large cities or small towns, respectively, enrolled consecutive patients who had bacterial infections that required therapy with oral antibiotics. Choice of agent and duration of treatment were left to the study physicians. Compliance was measured by a standardized telephone interview on the penultimate day and a urine bioassay for antibacterial activity on the last day of the planned treatment period. Parents did not know the true purpose of the study. Five hundred eight-four patients were fully evaluable. The most frequent diagnoses included tonsillopharyngitis (n = 231), otitis media (n = 170) and lower respiratory tract infections (n = 114). Most frequently prescribed antibiotics included amoxicillin (n = 102), potassium penicillin V (n = 81) and clarithromycin (n = 67). Overall compliance (positive urine test) on the last day of therapy was 69.5% (406 of 584 patients). Compliance was not significantly influenced by the region of residence or the underlying bacterial infection. It was significantly associated with the antibiotic used (macrolides, 89.0%; penicillins, 62.2%; cephalosporins, 66.4%; P = 0.0001 for macrolides vs. the others). Best compliance was found with clarithromycin (94.0%) and erythromycin estolate (89.8%). Compliance was also significantly better in patients > or =6 years old (77.7%; P = 0.016); with a treatment duration of < or =7 days (77.6%; P = 0.014); when the drug package contained a dose-taking reminder (79.7%; P = 0.003); and when the pediatrician's behavior toward the patient was assessed by the parents as ""very sympathetic"" or ""sympathetic"" (72.6%; P = 0.017). Subjecting all variables to logistic regression analysis, we found 3 variables to be significant predictors of treatment compliance: choice of antibiotic (P = 0.0001); patient age (P = 0.0008); and residence in town or city (P = 0.03). A noncompliance rate of >30% is unsatisfactory. Whereas some variables significantly associated with compliance cannot be influenced (patient age; place of residence in town or city), others are amenable to modifications. These include the physician-patient interaction and the choice of antibiotic. Agents should be preferred that are well-accepted by patients, that enable short-term therapy with few daily doses and with a package that contains a dose-taking reminder. "
74,15272984,"To standardize the use of antibiotics to treat community-acquired pneumonia in children and adolescents in Brazil. The following data sources were utilized: the Medline and LILACS (Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde) bibliographic databases; World Health Organization and Pan American Health Organization documents published between 1980 and 2002; Internet materials in Portuguese, Spanish, or English located using the search terms ""pneumonia, child, adolescent, etiology, treatment""; and interviews with renowned experts in the field. Hospitalization is always required for children younger than 2 months of age. That age group should be treated with ampicillin and aminoglycosides or third-generation cephalosporins. Children older than 2 months must be hospitalized if there is severe pneumonia. Tachypnea should be used as the criterion to distinguish between acute respiratory infection and pneumonia. Pneumonia is considered to be very severe when there are seizures, sleepiness, stridor at rest, severe malnutrition, no ingestion of fluids, or signs of respiratory failure such as central cyanosis. Children who are 2 months of age or older may receive outpatient treatment with amoxicillin or penicillin G procaine. In the case of inpatient treatment, crystalline penicillin or ampicillin may be used for severe cases, and oxacillin and chloramphenicol or ceftriaxone for very severe cases. A macrolide, preferably erythromycin, should be employed when the etiologic agent is suspected to be Chlamydia trachomatis, C. pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or Bordetella pertussis. The diagnosis of pneumonia and the need for hospitalization can be based on clinical assessment. The main antibiotics to be used are amoxicillin, penicillin, erythromycin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chloramphenicol, ceftriaxone, and aminoglycosides, depending on the age of the patient and the severity of the disease.

75,7966433,"The role of single-dose therapy was evaluated by pooling data on 320 infants and children included in 12 clinical trials that differed from each other in many variables. Single-dose therapy achieved an overall cure rate of 89%, but varied with different antimicrobial agents. Intramuscular aminoglycosides were the best (cure rate: 96%) closely followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or a sulfa drug with a cure rate of 90%. The cure rate with amoxicillin (75%) was significantly less. Single-dose therapy was most effective (cure rate: 90%) in well-documented lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) and slightly less effective (cure rate: 89%) among those in whom upper UTI could not be excluded. In patients with a normal urinary tract, single-dose therapy was significantly more effective (cure rate: 93%) than in the group of 36 patients with a urinary tract malformation (cure rate: 69%). Single-dose therapy can be used with confidence in patients with lower UTIs and in those with normal urinary tracts. In patients with abnormal urinary tracts and lower UTIs, single-dose therapy may be used with caution, preferably using aminoglycosides. Further studies are required to establish a definitive role of single-dose therapy in patients with urinary tract malformation. "
76,8634735,"To determine if parents prefer single-dose intramuscular (IM) therapy or standard 10-day oral therapy for treatment of acute otitis media (AOM). Parents were asked their preference at the time their child was enrolled in a randomized controlled trial comparing the clinical efficacy of single-dose IM ceftriaxone sodium with 10 days of oral amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for AOM. Additional information was collected at days 3 to 5 and 14 to 16 after the initiation of the therapy. Primarily private practices; 15 sites. For this study, 648 children aged 3 months to 6 years were randomly assigned to receive IM (n=327) or oral (n=321) therapy. The groups were equivalent in all measured sociodemographic factors. At the time of enrollment, 85% of parents expressed a preference for single-dose IM therapy. At days 3 to 5, no differences were reported in days children were absent from school or day care, parental absence from work, or loss of sleep by children. However, more parents with children in the IM therapy group than in the oral therapy group reported loss of sleep by the parent (35% vs 26%, P=.02, chi(2)). At days 14 to 16, more parents with children in the IM group reported being ""very satisfied"" with the antibiotic (65%) compared with parents whose children were assigned to the oral therapy group (38%, P<.001). In comparing current therapy to past oral therapy for AOM, 71% of the parents with children in the IM therapy group reported more satisfaction with current therapy, in contrast to 21% of parents with children in the oral therapy group (P<.001). Of the parents, 83% indicated they would prefer single-dose IM therapy for AOM in the future. All of the parents prefer single-dose IM therapy for AOM over standard 10-day oral therapy. "
77,16225499,"Failures of Helicobacter pylori eradication in children are common. To evaluate the efficacy of amoxicillin, bismuth subcitrate and omeprazole and nifuratel or furazolidone for H. pylori eradication in children who failed initial treatment with a standard triple therapy. Seventy-six consecutive H. pylori-positive paediatric out-patients (aged 12-16 years; mean age 13.7 +/- 1.4) with chronic abdominal complaints who had failed one attempt of eradication of H. pylori using metronidazole-containing triple therapy were enrolled. It was an open prospective study. Patients were randomized to receive a 2-week course of bismuth subcitrate (8 mg/kg/day, q.d.s.), amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/day, q.d.s.), with either nifuratel (15 mg/kg/day, q.d.s.) or furazolidone (10 mg/kg/day, q.d.s.), plus omeprazole (0.5 mg/kg, once daily). There were 37 patients in the nifuratel group and 39 in the furazolidone group. Helicobacter pylori was eradicated in 33 of 37 (89%; 95% CI: 74.5-96.9; intention-to-treat) in nifuratel group and in 34 of 39 (87%; 95% CI: 72.5-95.7) in furazolidone group, respectively. Frequency of severe side-effects was greater with furazolidone (21%) than with nifuratel (3%; P = 0.0289). Nitrofuran-containing therapies consisting of a proton-pump inhibitor, amoxicillin and bismuth citrate plus either nifuratel or furazolidone produced good cure rates even among those who had failed prior therapy. Nifuratel is preferred because of the lower frequency of side-effects. "
78,3322754,"Upper respiratory tract infections, particularly pharyngitis and acute otitis media (AOM) are the commonest diseases in children. Although viruses are the main causative agents, bacteria may play an important role. With regard to antibiotic therapy, clinicians must solve two problems: differentiation between viral and bacterial aetiology and choice of the optimal drug for each bacterial disease. In patients with pharyngitis the identification of group A haemolytic streptococci as the causative agent may be very difficult if only clinical and haematological data are considered. Throat culture is time consuming and difficult to perform in ambulatory practice; the recent techniques for rapid detection of streptococcal antigens are a possible answer to this problem. In bacterial pharyngitis a single injection of benzathine penicillin is considered to be first choice. However local pain and the significant increase of the relative risk of allergic problems in comparison with the decrease of incidence of rheumatic fever may shift therapeutic preference towards macrolides. The recently marketed ones, especially miocamycin, seem to offer easier administration, fewer side-effects and better efficacy. With regard to AOM, the differentiation between bacterial and viral disease is less important because over 70% of cases are of bacterial origin. Besides, an exact aetiological diagnosis is possible only by tympanocentesis, an invasive method. In Italy amoxicillin is still the drug of choice: a twice-daily regimen has been demonstrated to be as effective as the traditional thrice-daily schedule. "
79,16151562,"The antibiotic preferences of 2,190 pediatricians (peds) 360 general practitioners (GPs), and 273 otolaryngologists (ENTs) in the United States and concurrence with treatment guideline recommendations for acute otitis media (AOM) for suspected drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP) and beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae before and after an educational workshop were compared. Peds and GPs preferred amoxicillin/clavulanate high-dose, whereas ENTs preferred higher generation cephalosporins. Before the workshop, endorsement of guideline-recommended antibiotics for treatment of AOM caused by DRSP by Peds, GPs, and ENTs was 80%, 75%, and 78%, respectively, and for Haemophilus influenzae was 73%, 63%, and 84%, respectively. After the workshop concurrence with AOM guideline recommendations for DRSP increased to 96%, 95%, and 97% and for H. influenzae increased to 93%, 94%, and 96% for Peds, GPs, and ENTs, respectively (p<0.0001 for all comparisons). Peds, GPs, and ENTs select appropriate antibiotics for AOM 63-84% of the time. After instruction that provides the rationale for guideline-recommended agents based on pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and double tympanocentesis trials, endorsement of recommended antibiotics significantly improved to >90%.

80,11196033,"To determine the nasopharyngeal carriage rate, serogroups/types, and antibiotic resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae in children attending paediatric practices in the private sector in Johannesburg and to relate patterns of resistance to antimicrobial exposure and other demographic characteristics in individual children. A total of 303 children aged from 1 month to 5 years were recruited from eight private paediatric practices in northern Johannesburg. Nasopharyngeal samples were taken and parent interviews were conducted. Pneumococci were isolated from 121 children (40%). The most common serotypes were 6B, 19F, 6A, 23F, 14, and 19A. Carriage was significantly associated with prior hospital admission (odds ratio 1.89) and day care attendance (odds ratio 2.31) and was negatively associated with antibiotic use within the previous 30 days. Antibiotic resistance was found in 84 isolates (69.4%); 45 (37.2%) were multiply resistant. One-third of the pneumococci showed intermediate level resistance to penicillin and 12.4% were highly resistant. There was a high level erythromycin resistance in 38% of the isolates. A total of 94/214 children (42%) had recently used antibiotics and were four times more likely to carry antibiotic-resistant pneumococci (P < 0.05). Pneumococcal resistance was significant in this group of children with easy access to paediatric services and antibiotic use. The implication of such high resistance for the treatment of pneumococcal diseases is that high-dose amoxicillin is the preferred empirical oral therapy for treatment of otitis media. Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime should be used in combination with vancomycin for the treatment of meningitis until a cephalosporin-resistant pneumococcal cause is excluded. Intravenous penicillin or ampicillin will successfully treat pneumococcal pneumonia in this population. Antimicrobial resistance among pneumococci colonising children in the private sector has increased dramatically in recent years. "
81,11582912,"Despite major advances in pediatrics intensive care, meningococcemia remains an important cause of mortality en France (10 to 30%). Parenteral antibiotic given immediately is associated with a substantial reduction in mortality. So the Conseil supérieur d'hygiène publique de France recommend that general practitioners should administer promptly, preferably intravenously, whenever purpura fulminans is suspected, ceftriaxone (i.m., i.v.), cefotaxime (i.v.) or Amoxicillin (i.m., i.v.). "
82,7699847,"We assessed the in vitro antimicrobial activity and the clinical efficacy and safety of SY5555 in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized below. 1. In vitro antibacterial activities of SY5555 against 52 clinical isolates were compared with those of clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (CVA/AMPC), cefotiam (CTM), cefpodoxime (CPDX), cefaclor (CCL) and cefdinir (CFDN). Against Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, SY5555 displayed antimicrobial activities superior or nearly equivalent to those of the reference agents used in the study. In cases of Gram-negative bacteria, the antimicrobial activity of SY5555 against Haemophilus influenzae was inferior to those of CPDX and CFDN. Against Klebsiella pneumoniae, the antimicrobial activity of SY5555 was less potent than that of CPDX. 2. Forty-seven children with infectious diseases were treated with SY5555 dry syrup (powder dissolved just before use). The clinical results were excellent in 24 and good in 16, with an efficacy rate of 85.1%. 3. Bacteriological screening identified 30 pathogenic organisms, and the eradication rate was 76.7%. 4. Side effects consisted of diarrhea in 12.5% (6 cases), loose stools in 4.2% (2 cases) and urticaria in 2.1% (1 case) of the patients. The only abnormal laboratory test value observed was an increase in eosinophil count in one child. 5. The palatability of SY5555 dry syrup was very good; it was very easily ingestable or easily ingestable by 32 of the 48 children. From the above results, SY5555 dry syrup appears to be a useful drug with a preferable safety profile in the treatment of pediatric patients with infectious diseases. "
83,11155733,"FAILURES OF ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT: The number of failures after treatment of acute middle ear infections with the 2 main antibiotics prescribed (amoxicillin and the combination amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) is on the rise. These failures appear to be related to increased resistance of the 2 principal pathogens, pneumococci and Hemophilus influenzae. A NEW FORMULATION: In order to reduce the rate of failure, it has been necessary to both increase the dose of penicillin to overcome the reduced susceptibility of pneumococci to penicillin and to prescribe a beta-lactam because of the frequent isolation of beta-lactamase producing Hemophilus influenzae. A new formulation has been developed where the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid dose is 14 to 1. This allows a daily dose of 80 mg/kg for amoxicillin and 6.4 mg/kg for clavulanic acid. In one open multicentric study including 51 pediatric patients aged 3 to 48 months with acute middle ear infections, it was demonstrated that this new formulation can be very effective in eradicating the causal agents of acute middle ear infections, including pneumococci and penicillin-resistant Hemophilus. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GOOD EFFICACY: Amoxicillin must always be prescribed, either alone or in combination with clavulanic acid, at the dose of 45 to 50 mg/kg b.i.d. the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination should be preferred for children under 2 years due to the risk of beta-lactamase producing Hemophilus. "
84,11851047,"Increasing antimicrobial resistance among clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae calls for a revision of treatment strategies for pediatric infections, particularly for acute otitis media. Restrictive use of antimicrobials is the key strategy for slowing the spread of resistances. Before initiation of antimicrobial therapy, suspected bacterial infections should be confirmed clinically (e.g. by observation of the natural evolution) or microbiologically. For acute otitis media, oral amoxicillin remains the drug of choice because of superior middle ear pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Treatment failure caused by resistance of the infecting pneumococcus can be overcome be increasing the dose, and not by switching to another class of antibiotics (e.g., cephalosporin, macrolide, cotrimoxazole), which is less likely to achieve middle ear eradication a priori. Widespread macrolide resistance among isolates of S. pneumoniae precludes the use of this class of antimicrobials for empiric therapy of community-acquired pneumonia in children. Aminopenicillins are preferred because of their rapidly bactericidal activity against the most common organisms causing potentially progressive pneumonia in children. "
