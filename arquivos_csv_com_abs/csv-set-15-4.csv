1,36175913,"Fusarium species are saprophytic fungi with a worldwide distribution. These fungi cause various infections among immunocompromised patients; however, they can also involve immunocompetent individuals. We report a case of a 41-year-old Iranian woman who presented with ulcerative lesions on her lips 10 months ago. She had a long history of anxiety but had no history of classical risk factors such as trauma, cosmetic lip tattoo, burning in her lips, smoking or use of alcohol and opium. A skin biopsy from the lower lip was performed and sent for microbiological examinations. Hyaline septate hyphae were seen on direct microscopy with potassium hydroxide. The clinical specimen was subcultured on sabouraud dextrose agar with chloramphenicol and prepared for antifungal susceptibility testing and molecular identification. Considering the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for antifungals, itraconazole (100 mg orally twice a day) was started for her, and after 2 months, the lesions were treated. She followed up for 3 months, and no signs of disease recurrence were observed. Selecting an appropriate treatment strategy according to the laboratory assessments is essential in clinical practice and the management of rare infections to prevent related mortality and morbidity of opportunistic fungal infections.

2,37594910,"Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by perturbed glucose and lipid metabolism, resulting in high blood glucose levels. Many complications induced by endothelial dysfunction can cause disability and even death of diabetic patients. Here, we found that the protein level of casein kinase 2α (CK2α) was increased in the endothelium of mice with type I diabetes (T1D) induced by streptozotocin (STZ) injection. Although a potential correlation between the protein level of CK2α and endothelial dysfunction in diabetes was established, the contribution of CK2α to the progression of endothelial dysfunction in diabetes remained largely unknown. By using CX4945 (a selective CK2α antagonist) and Si-csnk2a1 (small interfering RNA targeting CK2α), we found that inhibition of CK2α accelerated skin wound healing in T1D mice by promoting proliferation of endothelial cells. Administration of CX4945 or Si-csnk2a1 rescued the impaired Hedgehog signaling pathway in high glucose-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Exploration of the underlying molecular mechanism revealed that the protective effect of CK2α inhibition on angiogenesis, which contributes to skin wound healing in diabetic mice, was blocked by administration of GANT61 (an inhibitor targeting the Hedgehog signaling pathway). Our findings establish CK2α as a regulator of endothelial dysfunction in diabetes and demonstrate that inhibition of CK2α accelerates skin wound healing in T1D mice by promoting endothelial cell proliferation via the Hedgehog signaling pathway.

3,30661159,"Studies report increased risk of congenital heart defects (CHD) in the offspring of mothers with diabetes, where high blood glucose levels might confer the risk. We explored the association between intake of sucrose-sweetened soft beverages during pregnancy and risk of CHD. Prospective cohort data with 88,514 pregnant women participating in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study was linked with information on infant CHD diagnoses from national health registers and the Cardiovascular Diseases in Norway Project. Risk ratios were estimated by fitting generalized linear models and generalized additive models. The prevalence of children with CHD was 12/1000 in this cohort (1049/88,514). Among these, 201 had severe and 848 had non-severe CHD (patent ductus arteriosus; valvular pulmonary stenosis; ventricular septal defect; atrial septal defect). Only non-severe CHD was associated with sucrose-sweetened soft beverages. The adjusted risk ratios (aRR) for non-severe CHD was 1.30 (95% CI 1.07-1.58) for women who consumed 25-70 ml/day and 1.27 (95% CI 1.06-1.52) for women who consumed ≥ 70 ml/day when compared to those drinking ≤ 25 ml/day. Dose-response analyses revealed an association between the risk of non-severe CHD and the increasing exposure to sucrose-sweetened soft beverages, especially for septal defects with aRR = 1.26 (95% CI 1.07-1.47) per tenfold increase in daily intake dose. The findings persisted after adjustment for maternal diabetes or after excluding mothers with diabetes (n = 19). Fruit juices, cordial beverages and artificial sweeteners showed no associations with CHD. The findings suggest that sucrose-sweetened soft beverages may affect the CHD risk in offspring. "
4,32735622,"There is a significant unmet need for a safe and effective therapy for the treatment of children with congenital hyperinsulinism. We hypothesized that amplification of the glucagon signaling pathway could ameliorate hyperinsulinism associated hypoglycemia. In order to test this we evaluated the effects of loss of Prkar1a, a negative regulator of Protein Kinase A in the context of hyperinsulinemic conditions. With reduction of Prkar1a expression, we observed a significant upregulation of hepatic gluconeogenic genes. In wild type mice receiving a continuous infusion of insulin by mini-osmotic pump, we observed a 2-fold increase in the level of circulating ketones and a more than 40-fold increase in Kiss1 expression with reduction of Prkar1a. Loss of Prkar1a in the Sur1-/- mouse model of KATP hyperinsulinism significantly attenuated fasting induced hypoglycemia, decreased the insulin/glucose ratio, and also increased the hepatic expression of Kiss1 by more than 10-fold. Together these data demonstrate that amplification of the hepatic glucagon signaling pathway is able to rescue hypoglycemia caused by hyperinsulinism. "
5,30266553,"To explore the effect of cinnamaldehyde on the distal femur in ovariectomized rats and its influence on osteoblast in vitro. Female Sprague-Dawley rats which underwent either bilateral ovariectomy or sham operation were divided into five groups randomly: group OVX (OVX, N = 10) and group sham (SHAM, N = 10) received normal saline (NS) by gavage at a dose of 50 ml/kg·d; group low dose, group middle dose and group high dose received cinnamaldehyde by gavage at a dose of 25 mg/kg·d (OLD, N = 10), 50 mg/kg·d (OMD, N = 10), and 75 mg/kg·d (OHD, N = 10) respectively. Distal femurs were harvested for hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, micro-ct scanning and immunohistochemical analysis. Murine mesenchymal stem cells were cultured and dealt with the presence of either cinnamaldehyde at a dose of 15ug/ml (OLD), 30ug/ml (OMD), 60ug/ml (OHD) or vehicle. ALP staining and western blot were performed to observe the influence of cinnamaldehyde on the differentiation of osteoblast. HE and micro-ct results indicated that osteogenesis were promoted with the treatment of cinnamaldehyde. Immunohistochemical results showed that cinnamaldehyde increased the number of osteoblast and decreased the number of osteoclast. In vitro studies indicated that cinnamaldehyde promoted expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), osteocalcin (OCN) and collagen type Iɑ1 (COL1ɑ1). The treatment effect behaved as dose-dependently. Thus, cinnamaldehyde inhibits osteoclastogenesis and promotes osteoblastogenesis, and may plays an important role in the treatment of osteoporosis clinically. "
6,31890665,"Smoking behavior as a harmful trend among adolescents and young adults has increased over last two decades. Many children and adolescents are at the risk of ""second-hand"" smoking at home due to their exposure to parents' or siblings' smoking. These second hand smokers are called ""passive smokers"" and are at risk of several health complications like cardiometabolic risk factors. The present study aims to evaluate the association between passive smoking and increase of cardiometabolic risk factors in a sample of Iranian's children and adolescents, aged 7-18 years. This multicenter cross-sectional study was carried out over 14,400 students (aged 7-18 years). Blood sampling were randomly collected from a sub-sample of 4200 selected pupils. According to their degree of exposure to smoke for both cigarette and hookah, water pipes that are used to smoke specially made tobacco that comes in different flavors, all participants were divided to the two separate groups of positive and negative exposure. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is defined as a constellation of at least three out of five cardiometabolic risk factors, including abdominal obesity, elevated blood pressure, elevated fasting plasma glucose concentration, high serum levels of triglycerides (TG), and depressed high-density cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. The mean and standard deviation (SD) age of participants was 12.3 ± 2.24 years. 49.4% were girls and 71.4% of them were urban residents. The mean SD for BMI of participants was 18.5 (4.7) Kg/m2. The mean TG levels were considerably higher among passive smoker children and adolescents. MetS and being overweight were found to have a major association with passive smoking (OR 1.63 CI 95% 1.17-2.29  This study confirms that passive smoking or second-hand smoking is linked with the increased prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors and places children and adolescents at a higher risk of being overweight. Preventive strategies could be incorporated against passive smoking to recognize it as a health priority among children and adolescents. "
7,35879296,"Whether amino acids act on cellular insulin signaling remains unclear, given that increased circulating amino acid levels are associated with the onset of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here, we report that phenylalanine modifies insulin receptor beta (IRβ) and inactivates insulin signaling and glucose uptake. Mice fed phenylalanine-rich chow or phenylalanine-producing aspartame or overexpressing human phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (hFARS) develop insulin resistance and T2D symptoms. Mechanistically, FARS phenylalanylate lysine 1057/1079 of IRβ (F-K1057/1079), inactivating IRβ and preventing insulin from promoting glucose uptake by cells. SIRT1 reverse F-K1057/1079 and counteract the insulin-inactivating effects of hFARS and phenylalanine. F-K1057/1079 and SIRT1 levels in white blood cells from T2D patients are positively and negatively correlated with T2D onset, respectively. Blocking F-K1057/1079 with phenylalaninol sensitizes insulin signaling and relieves T2D symptoms in hFARS-transgenic and db/db mice. These findings shed light on the activation of insulin signaling and T2D progression through inhibition of phenylalanylation. "
8,28648676,"The rate of glucose influx to skeletal muscles is determined primarily by the number of functional units of glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) in the myotube plasma membrane. The abundance of GLUT4 in the plasma membrane is tightly regulated by insulin or contractile activity, which employ distinct pathways to translocate GLUT4-rich vesicles from intracellular compartments. Various studies have indicated that GLUT4 intrinsic activity is also regulated by conformational changes and/or interactions with membrane components and intracellular proteins in the vicinity of the plasma membrane. Here we show that the non-metabolizable glucose analog 3-O-methyl-d-glucose (MeGlc) augmented the rate of hexose transport into myotubes by increasing GLUT4 intrinsic activity without altering the content of the transporter in the plasma membrane. This effect was not a consequence of ATP depletion or hyperosmolar stress and did not involve Akt/PKB or AMPK signal transduction pathways. MeGlc reduced the inhibitory potency (increased K "
9,34198013,"Congenital tufting enteropathy (CTE) is an intractable diarrheal disease of infancy caused by mutations of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). The cellular and molecular basis of CTE pathology has been elusive. We hypothesized that the loss of EpCAM in CTE results in altered lineage differentiation and defects in absorptive enterocytes thereby contributing to CTE pathogenesis. Intestine and colon from mice expressing a CTE-associated mutant form of EpCAM (mutant mice) were evaluated for specific markers by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunostaining. Body weight, blood glucose, and intestinal enzyme activity were also investigated. Enteroids derived from mutant mice were used to assess whether the decreased census of major secretory cells could be rescued. Mutant mice exhibited alterations in brush-border ultrastructure, function, disaccharidase activity, and glucose absorption, potentially contributing to nutrient malabsorption and impaired weight gain. Altered cell differentiation in mutant mice led to decreased enteroendocrine cells and increased numbers of nonsecretory cells, though the hypertrophied absorptive enterocytes lacked key features, causing brush border malfunction. Further, treatment with the Notch signaling inhibitor, DAPT, increased the numbers of major secretory cell types in mutant enteroids (graphical abstract 1). Alterations in intestinal epithelial cell differentiation in mutant mice favor an increase in absorptive cells at the expense of major secretory cells. Although the proportion of absorptive enterocytes is increased, they lack key functional properties. We conclude that these effects underlie pathogenic features of CTE such as malabsorption and diarrhea, and ultimately the failure to thrive seen in patients. "
10,28092375,"The deleterious effect of chronic activation of the IL-1β system on type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases is well documented. However, a possible physiological role for IL-1β in glucose metabolism has remained unexplored. Here we found that feeding induced a physiological increase in the number of peritoneal macrophages that secreted IL-1β, in a glucose-dependent manner. Subsequently, IL-1β contributed to the postprandial stimulation of insulin secretion. Accordingly, lack of endogenous IL-1β signaling in mice during refeeding and obesity diminished the concentration of insulin in plasma. IL-1β and insulin increased the uptake of glucose into macrophages, and insulin reinforced a pro-inflammatory pattern via the insulin receptor, glucose metabolism, production of reactive oxygen species, and secretion of IL-1β mediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome. Postprandial inflammation might be limited by normalization of glycemia, since it was prevented by inhibition of the sodium-glucose cotransporter SGLT2. Our findings identify a physiological role for IL-1β and insulin in the regulation of both metabolism and immunity. "
11,30395838,"Microglia metabolize exogenous 2'-AMP and 3'-AMP (non-canonical nucleotides) to adenosine and exogenous 2'-AMP and 3'-AMP (via conversion to adenosine) inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines by microglia. This suggests that if microglia release endogenous 2'-AMP and/or 3'-AMP in response to injurious stimuli, this would complete an autocrine/paracrine mechanism that attenuates the over-activation of microglia during brain injury. Here we investigated in microglia (and for comparison astrocytes and neurons) the effects of injurious stimuli on extracellular and intracellular levels of 2',3'-cAMP (2'-AMP and 3'-AMP precursor), 2'-AMP, and 3'-AMP. Experiments were conducted in primary cultures of rat microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. Cells were exposed to oxygen/glucose deprivation, iodoacetate plus 2,4-dinitrophenol (metabolic inhibitors), glutamate, or H In microglia, H Oxidative stress (but not oxygen/glucose deprivation, energy deprivation, or excitotoxicity) induces microglia (but not astrocytes or neurons) to release 2'-AMP, but not 3'-AMP. The 2',3'-cAMP/2'-AMP/adenosine pathway mechanism may serve to prevent over-activation of microglia in response to oxidative stress. "
12,10862126,"Pulmonary surfactant is a complex mixture of phospholipids and proteins which lowers surface tension and maintains alveolar expansion at end expiration. Developmental and genetic disruption of pulmonary surfactant metabolism leads to respiratory distress in newborns. Stable isotope labeling of metabolic precursors of disaturated phospholipids, the most abundant and specific component of pulmonary surfactant, permits the measurement of the kinetics of surfactant metabolism in vivo. We measured [U-(13)C(6)]glucose incorporation into palmitic acid derived from disaturated surfactant phospholipids. A 24 h infusion of [U-(13)C(6)]glucose (140 mg kg(-1)) was administered to a premature infant who required mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome; tracheal aspirate samples were obtained at the start of the infusion and at regular intervals for the next 70 h. Each tracheal aspirate sample was incubated with osmium tetroxide to isolate disaturated surfactant phospholipids. Methyl esters of the fatty acids in the disaturated phospholipids were prepared and the enrichment of [(13)C]methyl palmitate was measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and gas chromatography/combination/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS). Mass isotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA) was used to calculate the fractional synthetic rate (FSR) of palmitate synthesized from acetate. With both GC/MS and GC/C/IRMS, palmitate (13)C enrichment was first detected 12.3 h after the start of the tracer infusion. The enrichment increased in a linear fashion, reached a peak at 47 h and remained constant in the remainder of the samples. The FSR of palmitate from acetate was 5.2% per day. Stable isotope techniques and MIDA will provide insights into the kinetics of surfactant metabolism in newborns with respiratory dysfunction. "
13,35546014,"The management of prediabetes and hyperglycemia is an increasingly important aspect of care in patients with thalassemia. In light of the limited evidence about the management of GD (glucose dysregulation) with glucose-lowering agents (GLAs), we have conducted a retrospective survey in TDT and NTDT patients with diabetes mellitus to collect more detailed information on GLA use in order to make preliminary recommendations. A questionnaire was prepared and distributed to the tertiary thalassemia care Centers of ICET-A Network. Eight  thalassemia care Centers [Bulgaria, Greece, Iran, Italy (4 Centers) and Qatar], following 1.554 with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT), 132 (8.4%) with diabetes and 687 with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT), 27 (3.9%) with diabetes, participated in the retrospective survey. The records of 117 TDT patients and 9 NTDT patients with diabetes treated with GLAs were analyzed. Metformin, a biguanide, was the most frequently used drug (47.6 %), followed by alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (5.5 %), incretins (4.7%) and insulin secretagogues (3.1%).  In 68 (61.2) patients  GLAs was prescribed as monotherapy, while the remaining  49  (38.8%), who had inadequate glucose control with metformin, were treated with combination treatment. Fifty-one patients  of 126 (40.4%) initially treated with oral GLA, for a mean duration of 61.0 ± 35.6 months (range: 12- 120 months), required insulin therapy for better metabolic control. This retrospective study covers an unexplored area of research in patients with thalassemia and GD. Oral GLAs appear to be safe and effective for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in patients with thalassemia, and can achieve adequate glycemic control for a substantial period of time. "
14,33020800,"Our prior studies revealed that infant somatic growth is influenced by fructose in breast milk, and fructose in breast milk is increased in response to maternal sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake in lactation. It is unknown whether infant neurodevelopmental outcomes are also influenced by maternal SSBs in lactation. To determine whether infant cognitive development at 24 postnatal months was influenced by maternal fructose consumption during lactation, and whether this relation persisted after accounting for maternal SSB and juice (SSB + J) intake. Hispanic mother-infant pairs (n = 88) were recruited across the spectrum of prepregnancy BMI. Mothers completed two 24-h dietary recalls at 1 and 6 postnatal months, and reported breastfeedings per day. The Bayley-III Scales of Infant Development were administered at 24 postnatal months to assess infant cognition. Linear regressions were used to examine associations, reported as unstandardized (B) coefficients, 95% CIs, and P values. Mothers consumed 1656 ± 470 kcal, 21.8 ± 12 g fructose, and 2.5 ± 2.6 servings SSBs + J, and reported 6.9 ± 2.1 breastfeedings per day at 1 postnatal month. Controlling for maternal age, prepregnancy BMI, education level, kilocalories, infant age, sex, and birthweight revealed that infant cognitive development scores at 24 postnatal months correlated inversely with maternal fructose consumption at 1 postnatal month (B = -0.08; 95% CI = -0.13, -0.03; P < 0.01). The association of infant cognitive development scores with maternal fructose consumption was no longer significant after adjustment for maternal SSB + J intake (B = -0.05; 95% CI = -0.10, 0.00; P = 0.07), whereas maternal SSB + J intake was significant in the same model (B = -0.29; 95% CI = -0.52, -0.05; P = 0.02). Infant cognitive development scores were not associated with maternal fructose and SSB + J consumption at 6 postnatal months. Our findings suggest that infant neurodevelopmental outcomes at 24 postnatal months can be adversely influenced by maternal fructose intake in early lactation, and this could be attributed to maternal SSB + J intake.

15,37742307,"DOCK (dedicator of cytokinesis) is an 11-member family of typical guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) expressed in the brain, spinal cord, and skeletal muscle. Several DOCK proteins have been implicated in maintaining several myogenic processes such as fusion. We previously identified DOCK3 as being strongly upregulated in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), specifically in the skeletal muscles of DMD patients and dystrophic mice. Dock3 ubiquitous KO mice on the dystrophin-deficient background exacerbated skeletal muscle and cardiac phenotypes. We generated Dock3 conditional skeletal muscle knockout mice (Dock3 mKO) to characterize the role of DOCK3 protein exclusively in the adult muscle lineage. Dock3 mKO mice presented with significant hyperglycemia and increased fat mass, indicating a metabolic role in the maintenance of skeletal muscle health. Dock3 mKO mice had impaired muscle architecture, reduced locomotor activity, impaired myofiber regeneration, and metabolic dysfunction. We identified a novel DOCK3 interaction with SORBS1 through the C-terminal domain of DOCK3 that may account for its metabolic dysregulation. Together, these findings demonstrate an essential role for DOCK3 in skeletal muscle independent of DOCK3 function in neuronal lineages. "

17,2753235,"The minimal model approach to estimating insulin sensitivity (Sl) and glucose effectiveness in promoting its own disposition at basal insulin (SG) is a powerful tool that has been underutilized given its potential applications. In part, this has been due to its inability to separate insulin and glucose effects on peripheral uptake from their effects on hepatic glucose inflow. Prior enhancements, with radiotracer labeling of the dosage, permit this separation but are unsuitable for use in pregnancy and childhood. In this study, we labeled the intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) dosage with [6,6-2H2]glucose, [2-2H]glucose, or both stable isotopically labeled glucose tracers and modeled glucose kinetics in six postabsorptive, nonobese adults. As previously found with the radiotracer model, the tracer-estimated S*l derived from the stable-label IVGTT was greater than Sl in each case except one, and the tracer-estimated SG* was less than SG in each instance. More importantly, however, the stable-label IVGTT estimated each parameter with an average precision of +/- 5% (range 3-9%) compared to average precisions of +/- 74% (range 7-309%) for SG and +/- 22% (range 3-72%) for Sl. In addition, because of the different metabolic fates of the two deuterated tracers, there were minor differences in basal insulin-derived measures of glucose effectiveness, but these differences were negligible for parameters describing insulin-stimulated processes. In conclusion, the stable-label IVGTT is a simple, highly precise means of assessing insulin sensitivity and glucose effectiveness at basal insulin that can be used to measure these parameters in individuals of all ages, including children and pregnant women.

18,33040825,"Diarrhea is a disease, and patients must have bowel movements at least three times per day. This condition may last for several days and may cause dehydration due to fluid loss. Spleen-deficiency makes a person more vulnerable to some infectious diseases. Persistent diarrhea due to spleen-deficiency may affect amino acids and glucose metabolic pathways, and urinary metabolic characteristics. For this purpose, this research was carried out to investigate the pathogenesis and changes of metabolic profiling in urine samples that come from 3 months to 3 years old children with persistent diarrhea due to Spleen-deficiency were analyzed by metabolomics methods based on gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The urine samples were collected and divided into normal children group (NC group, n=30), persistent diarrhea group (PD group, n=30)．The endogenous metabolites in urine were obtained by GC-MS. Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was used to analyze the data．The results were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and Fold change．Finally，there was a significant difference between the normal group and the diarrhea group, and the significant metabolites, glutamic acid, serine，phenylalanine, histidine, and et al. were identified between two groups. The metabolism of glycine, serine and threonine, arginine and proline, glutathione and pentose phosphate were involved. The result demonstrated that amino acid metabolism and glucose metabolism were the main metabolic pathways and responsible for persistent diarrhea due to Spleen-deficiency. "
19,36145224,"Background: Although animal experiments have shown that spermidine (SPD) affects insulin resistance (IR), the evidence for this in humans is still scarce. We aimed to investigate the associations between serum SPD levels and the TyG index in the adult population. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out with 4336 participants, all of whom were adults aged 35+ years. The SPD levels in serum were detected using high performance liquid chromatography with a fluorescence detector (HPLC-FLD). The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index was calculated as Ln [fasting triglycerides (TG) (mg/dL) × fasting glucose (mg/dL)/2]. Results: After multivariable adjustment, including demographic characteristics, behavioral factors associated with heath, and a history of taking medicine, SPD was inversely associated with the TyG index (β = −0.036; SE: 0.009; p < 0.001). Furthermore, each increase of 1 lnSPD significantly decreased the risk of IR with an odds ratio (ORs) (95% confidence intervals (CIs)) of 0.89 (0.83−0.96). Relative to the first quintile, the multivariate-adjusted ORs (95% CIs) for the third and fourth quartile group were 0.80 (0.65, 0.99) and 0.71 (0.57, 0.88), respectively. Conclusions: In conclusion, SPD was inversely associated with the TyG index. Our findings inform future exploratory research on the further mechanism of the association between spermidine and IR. "

21,32103160,"To examine the effects of 30% oral dextrose on biochemical markers of pain, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) degradation, and oxidative stress in preterm neonates experiencing a clinically required heel lance. Utilizing a prospective study design, preterm neonates that met study criteria (n = 169) were randomized to receive either (1) 30% oral dextrose, (2) facilitated tucking, or (3) 30% oral dextrose and facilitated tucking 2 min before heel lance. Plasma markers of ATP degradation (hypoxanthine, uric acid) and oxidative stress (allantoin) were measured before and after the heel lance. Pain was measured using the premature infant pain profile-revised (PIPP-R). Oral dextrose, administered alone or with facilitated tucking, did not alter plasma markers of ATP utilization and oxidative stress. A single dose of 30% oral dextrose, given before a clinically required heel lance, decreased signs of pain without increasing ATP utilization and oxidative stress in premature neonates. "
22,28715355,"Oral sucrose is administered routinely to reduce pain of minor procedures in premature infants and is recommended as standard care in international guidelines. No human or animal studies on effects of early repeated sucrose exposure on long-term brain development have been done in the context of pain. We evaluated the effects of repeated neonatal sucrose treatment before an intervention on long-term brain structure in mouse pups. Neonatal C57Bl/6J mice (n = 109) were randomly assigned to one of 2 treatments (vehicle vs sucrose) and one of 3 interventions (handling, touch, or needle-prick). Mice received 10 interventions daily from postnatal day 1 to 6 (P1-6). A dose of vehicle or 24% sucrose was given orally 2 minutes before each intervention. At P85-95, brains were scanned using a multichannel 7.0 T MRI. Volumes of 159 independent brain regions were obtained. Early repetitive sucrose exposure in mice (after correcting for whole brain volume and multiple comparisons) lead to smaller white matter volumes in the corpus callosum, stria terminalis, and fimbria (P < 0.0001). Cortical and subcortical gray matter was also affected by sucrose with smaller volumes of hippocampus and cerebellum (P < 0.0001). These significant changes in adult brain were found irrespective of the type of intervention in the neonatal period. This study provides the first evidence of long-term adverse effects of repetitive sucrose exposure and raises concerns for the use of this standard pain management practice during a period of rapid brain development in very preterm infants.

23,14747296,"While the incidence of diabetes increases with age, a decrease in beta-cell function independent of age-related insulin resistance has not been conclusively determined. We studied insulin secretion (by hyperglycemic clamp) in 3-, 9-, and 20-month-old chronically catheterized, awake, Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (n = 78). Insulin action was modulated in a group of old rats by caloric restriction (CR) or by surgical removal of visceral fat (VF-). During the first 2 h of the clamp (11 mmol/l glucose), insulin secretion and insulin resistance (S(i hyper clamp)) demonstrated the characteristic hyperbolic relationship. However, after hyperglycemia for an additional 2 h, the ability to maintain insulin secretion, commensurate with the degree of insulin resistance, was decreased in all aging rats (P < 0.05). Increasing plasma glucose levels to 18 mmol/l glucose, after clamp at 11 mmol/l, increased insulin secretion by approximately threefold in young rats, but failed to induce similar magnitude of response in the aging rats ( approximately 50%). However, elevation of plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels by twofold (by intralipid infusion during 11 mmol/l glucose clamp) resulted in a robust, approximate twofold response in both young and old rats. Thus, prolonged stimulation by hyperglycemia unveiled a functional defect in insulin secretion with aging. This age-related defect is independent of insulin action and is specific to glucose and not FFAs. We suggest that prolonged hyperglycemic stimulation can be a tool to identify functional defects in insulin secretion, particularly in the context of the hyperbolic relationship with insulin action, in elderly subjects or those at risk for type 2 diabetes.

25,30006480,"The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is known to regulate lipid metabolism in many tissues, including macrophages. Here we report that peritoneal macrophage respiration is enhanced by rosiglitazone, an activating PPARγ ligand, in a PPARγ-dependent manner. Moreover, PPARγ is required for macrophage respiration even in the absence of exogenous ligand. Unexpectedly, the absence of PPARγ dramatically affects the oxidation of glutamine. Both glutamine and PPARγ have been implicated in alternative activation (AA) of macrophages, and PPARγ was required for interleukin 4 (IL4)-dependent gene expression and stimulation of macrophage respiration. Indeed, unstimulated macrophages lacking PPARγ contained elevated levels of the inflammation-associated metabolite itaconate and express a proinflammatory transcriptome that, remarkably, phenocopied that of macrophages depleted of glutamine. Thus, PPARγ functions as a checkpoint, guarding against inflammation, and is permissive for AA by facilitating glutamine metabolism. However, PPARγ expression is itself markedly increased by IL4. This suggests that PPARγ functions at the center of a feed-forward loop that is central to AA of macrophages. "
26,8796395,"To determine whether intravenous mannitol administration reduces intracranial pressure (ICP) in a cat model of brain edema by changing serum osmolality. Prospective, controlled study. Pediatric intensive care unit laboratory in a university hospital. Intraparenchymal ICP monitors were placed in 12 adult cats which subsequently underwent 60 min of continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration with countercurrent dialysis (CAVH-D), using sterile water with potassium chloride as a dialysate. The ultrafiltrate was replaced with a hypotonic solution causing a rapid reduction in serum osmolality while maintaining a euvolemic state. In six cats (control group) no further interventions were instituted, while in the six other cats (mannitol group) 1g/kg mannitol was administered intravenously immediately after CAVH-D had been discontinued. ICP was monitored continuously, and serum osmolality was determined at 15-min intervals during CAVH-D and for 30 min thereafter. ICP increased significantly in both the control and mannitol groups during 60 min of CAVH-D. After CAVH-D, ICP was reduced in the mannitol group while ICP remained significantly higher in the control group. An inverse linear correlation was demonstrated between serum osmolality and ICP values in the control group throughout the experiment, as well as during the first 60 min in the mannitol group. However, no such correlation existed in the mannitol group after mannitol administration, as no significant changes in serum osmolality were observed while a marked reduction in ICP values occurred. Mannitol is effective in reducing increased ICP in this model of euvolemic brain edema. However, 15 min after mannitol administration, no relationship between a continued decrease in ICP and a change in serum osmolality could be established. We postulate that the beneficial effect on ICP by mannitol outlasts its possible instantaneous and short-lived effect on serum osmolality. "
27,15800693,"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an increasing recognized form of chronic liver condition affecting both children and adults within the wide spectrum of fatty liver diseases. Recently NASH has been often associated with insulin resistance and has shown potential harmful evolution towards end-stage liver disease. Its incidence and prevalence is increasing, paralleling the rise in obesity and diabetes mellitus in Western Countries. Once all the other causes of persistent elevation of serum transaminase levels are excluded, the diagnosis of NASH can be only confirmed by liver histology. Non-invasive diagnostic tools, however, are awaited to allow the follow-up of patients at higher risk for major liver dysfunction. This article focus on current thoughts on the natural history and clinical presentation of NASH and describes current trends in the diagnosis and treatment of this emerging condition. "
28,37937690,"Glioblastoma (GBM) treatment is extremely challenging due to the high complexity of the tumor. It is one of the tumors in which a subpopulation of highly resistant glioma initiating cells (GICs) has been clearly identified. Thus, understanding the differences between GICs and tumor bulk cells is therefore essential to move to less conventional but more efficient approaches. It was found that, unlike their differentiated progeny, GICs survival and maintenance of stem cell properties depend on mitochondrial metabolism. GICs present higher glucose uptake and mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced lactate dehydrogenase activity, being more sensitive to mitochondrial inhibition than their differentiated counterparts. Calcium flux to the mitochondria appears to play an essential role in the maintenance of this distinct metabolic phenotype with a decrease in the expression of voltage‑dependent anionic channel (VDAC) and Grp75, two of the proteins of the IP3R‑Grp75‑VDAC complex that transfers calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the mitochondria. Disruption of ER homeostasis using ER stress inducers or inhibition of ER‑mitochondrial contact sites using the Grp75 inhibitor MKT‑077 resulted in cytotoxicity of GICs and loss of stemness. Moreover, MKT‑077 also potentiates the effect of temozolomide, current treatment for glioblastoma. In summary, the present data indicated that ER‑mitochondrial homeostasis is essential for regulation of GICs glucose metabolism and survival. "
29,27444544,"Bromodomain-containing protein 7 (BRD7) is a member of bromodomain-containing protein family and its function has been implicated in several diseases. We have previously shown that BRD7 plays a role in metabolic processes. However, the effect of BRD7 deficiency in glucose metabolism and its role in in vivo have not been fully revealed. Here, we report the essential role of BRD7 during embryo development. Mice homozygous for BRD7 led to embryonic lethality at mid-gestation. Homozygous BRD7 knockout (KO) mice showed retardation in development, and eventually all BRD7 KO embryos died in utero prior to E16.5. Partial knockdown of Brd7 gene displayed mild changes in glucose metabolism. "
30,34751119,"MiR-582-5p has been demonstrated to protect against ischemic stroke. However, its implication in the progression of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) has not been explored. In this study, we used an in vitro model of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) to investigate the protective effect of miR-582-5p on PC12 cells. OGD-induced inhibition of cell viability and promotion of cell death was assessed by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry. Real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were utilized to examine the levels of inflammatory cytokines. The effects of miR-582-5p on OGD-induced oxidative injury were assessed by the determination of oxidative stress indicators. Furthermore, dual-luciferase reporter assay and gain-offunction assay were used to determine the mechanism of miR-582-5p in OGD-induced cell injury. The expression of miR-582-5p was reduced upon OGD treatment in PC12 cells. Overexpression of miR-582-5p inhibited OGD-induced PC12 cell injury by regulating cell viability, apoptosis, inflammatory responses, and oxidative stress. MiR-582-5p targeted and negatively regulated high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). MiR-582-5p presented protective effects on OGD-induced PC12 cell injury by targeting HMGB1. Our results indicated that miR-582-5p ameliorates neuronal injury by inhibiting apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress through targeting HMGB1. "

33,10644548,"To improve upon the [U-(13)C]glucose method to estimate ""gluconeogenesis"" as described by J. Katz and J. A. Tayek (Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 272: E476-E484, 1997, and 275: E537-E542, 1998), we describe the reciprocal pool model by using only the isotopomer data of plasma glucose during infusion of [U-(13)C]glucose. The glucose pool serves as both precursor and product for the calculation of the fraction of molecules generated by gluconeogenesis and to correct for exchange and loss of labeled carbon at the level of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. We have applied this model to both our own data and those of other investigators using [U-(13)C]glucose and have demonstrated excellent agreement between the Katz and Tayek model and our reciprocal pool model. When we compare the results of the reciprocal pool model with those of Hellerstein ([2-(13)C]glycerol) and Landau ((2)H(2)O-glucose-C-5), the results are similar in short- and long-term fasted adult humans. Finally, when we apply the reciprocal pool model to our data from premature infants, it is clear that we account for the inflow of unlabeled glycerol and presumably amino acids. This is not surprising, because the vast majority of gluconeogenesis is the result of recycling of glucose and pyruvate carbon. "
34,35620386,"When delivered directly into the brain, vitamin D, can improve glucose levels in male mice. Additionally, the loss of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in male mice's paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) results in impaired glucose tolerance. Data in humans shows that low vitamin D levels are detrimental to glucose homeostasis, an effect that may be more prominent in men. However, it is unknown if vitamin D action in the brain is required for normal glucose regulation in female mice. This study shows that in both viral and genetic models, male mice with obesity and PVH VDR loss have impaired glucose tolerance while female mice are unaffected. Weights were unaltered in both sexes by PVH VDR loss. Additionally, PVH VDR loss did not cause any glucose abnormalities in either sex when the mice were on a chow diet. Utilizing electrophysiology studies, we show PVH VDR loss resulted in decreased baseline firing frequency and resting membrane potential in males, but not females. Additionally, male mice with PVH VDR loss had impaired miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSC), while females were unaffected. Interestingly, the PVH neurons of both sexes were activated by exogenous vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3), an effect dependent upon the VDR. Thus, there is sexual dimorphism, for the actions of the PVH VDR on glucose regulation. PVH VDRs are necessary for normal glucose homeostasis in males but not females and this may be secondary to actions of the VDR on neuronal activity. "
35,25684072,"Glucose is essentially the sole fuel for the adult brain and the mapping of its metabolism has been extensive in the adult but not in the neonatal brain, which is believed to rely mainly on ketone bodies for energy supply. However, glucose is absolutely indispensable for normal development and recent studies have shed light on glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway and metabolic interactions between astrocytes and neurons in the 7-day-old rat brain. Appropriately (13)C labeled glucose was used to distinguish between glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway during development. Experiments using (13)C labeled acetate provided insight into the GABA-glutamate-glutamine cycle between astrocytes and neurons. It could be shown that in the neonatal brain the part of this cycle that transfers glutamine from astrocytes to neurons is operating efficiently while, in contrast, little glutamate is shuttled from neurons to astrocytes. This lack of glutamate for glutamine synthesis is compensated for by anaplerosis via increased pyruvate carboxylation relative to that in the adult brain. Furthermore, compared to adults, relatively more glucose is prioritized to the pentose phosphate pathway than glycolysis and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. The reported developmental differences in glucose metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis may determine the ability of the brain at various ages to resist excitotoxic insults such as hypoxia-ischemia.

36,18185074,"Lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH) is expressed only in the small intestine and is confined to absorptive enterocytes on the villi with a tightly controlled pattern of expression along the proximal to distal and crypt-villus axes of the intestine. LPH expression is regulated mainly at the level of lactase (LCT) gene transcription that directs 2 phenotypes: a decline in LCT activity (LCT nonpersistence) in mid-childhood in the majority of the world's population, and maintenance of the lactase levels found in infancy (LCT persistence) in people of northern European extraction and scattered populations elsewhere. The molecular mechanisms that regulate these phenotypes are not completely understood. A population genetic association of lactase persistence with 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the distal 5'-flanking region of LCT (-13.9T and -22A) has been confirmed in northern Europeans, but this fails to explain lactase persistence found in some African groups. Any hypothesis for the control of lactase expression must reconcile the presence of high levels of activity in early life in all humans and the characteristic loss of activity found subsequently in many but not all people.

37,35608871,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading joint disease characterized by cartilage destruction and loss of mobility. Accumulating evidence indicates that the incidence and severity of OA increases with diabetes, implicating systemic glucose metabolism in joint health. However, a definitive link between cellular metabolism in articular cartilage and OA pathogenesis is not yet established. Here, we report that in mice surgically induced to develop knee OA through destabilization of medial meniscus (DMM), expression of the main glucose transporter Glut1 is notably reduced in joint cartilage. Inducible deletion of Glut1 specifically in the Prg4-expressing articular cartilage accelerates cartilage loss in DMM-induced OA. Conversely, forced expression of Glut1 protects against cartilage destruction following DMM. Moreover, in mice with type I diabetes, both Glut1 expression and the rate of glycolysis are diminished in the articular cartilage, and the diabetic mice exhibit more severe cartilage destruction than their nondiabetic counterparts following DMM. The results provide proof of concept that boosting glucose metabolism in articular chondrocytes may ameliorate cartilage degeneration in OA. "
38,31070671,"To determine whether high fructose intake (HFI) influences the daily transcriptional clock rhythms of murine extraorbital lacrimal glands (ELGs). Timed ELGs were collected from two groups of C57BL/6J mice subjected to a 12-hour light/12-hour dark (LD) cycle for 10 days; the first group received water-only feeding and the second received water with 15% fructose. Total RNA was extracted and subjected to RNA sequencing. A JTK_CYCLE algorithm and computational software were used to determine the periodicity, rhythmicity, and amplitude of the cycling transcripts. The rhythmic transcripts from different conditions were analyzed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. HFI feeding caused massive remodeling of the preexisting rhythmic genes in the normal control (NC)-fed ELGs. The induced transcripts in HFI-fed mice resulted in a profound reorganization of the coordinated transcriptional oscillations and KEGG pathways. Moreover, HFI feeding significantly altered the distribution of the KEGG pathways over an LD in the ELGs. Finally, we found that the ELGs have a robust core clock machinery and HFI feeding altered amplitude and the peak phase of clock gene transcriptional oscillation in ELGs. Short-term HFI reprograms the daily transcriptomic oscillation of murine ELGs. This information may deepen our understanding of the outcomes of lacrimal glands altered by nutritional challenge. "
39,33415802,"This study aimed to determine the causal association between salt added to food and body mass index (BMI) by integrating a summary-level genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. We performed two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses using summary statistics of GWAS. Inverse-variance weighted (IVW), maximum likelihood estimation, and random effect model were used to analyse the effect of salt added to food on BMI. A bidirectional MR analysis with BMI as the exposure and salt added to food as the outcome was also performed. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected from the UK Biobank (n = 462 630) and a meta-analysis of 322 154 European-descent individuals. The IVW method estimate indicated that salt added to food was positively associated with BMI (β = 0.1416, SE = 0.0576, P = .0139). Results from maximum likelihood estimation (β = 0.1476, SE = 0.0363, P < .0001) and the random effect model (β = 0.1411, SE = 0.0572, P = .0137) were consistent with the IVW. Bidirectional MR analysis suggested that BMI did not causally affect salt added to food. Our results provided qualitative evidence supporting a causal relationship between salt intake and BMI. "
40,9481634,"The effect of adding rice cereal to formula on calcium and iron bioavailability was studied. Fourteen healthy infants were studied at 2-week intervals to assess the absorption of calcium and iron from formula or formula mixed with rice cereal. Infants were randomly assigned to initiate the study either on a lactose-containing formula (F) or the same formula mixed with 6.5 g/dl of rice cereal (F + R). Calcium and iron absorption were determined using a multiple tracer approach in which calcium and iron isotopes were given orally mixed with either F or F + R and a different tracer of calcium given intravenously. Nine infants underwent calcium and iron studies and five underwent calcium studies only. A tracer amount of 46Ca was administered intravenously. Calcium absorption was determined as the ratio of the recovered oral versus intravenous tracer in the urine during the 24 hr after tracer administration. Iron incorporation into red blood cells (RBCs) was determined from the enrichment of the iron isotopes in the RBCs at 14 days after dosing. Mean (+/- SD) percent absorption of calcium from F was 58% (+/- 13) and from F + R 57% (+/- 18). Absorption of iron from F was 5.8% (+/- 7) and from F + R 6.3% (+/- 4) (p = 0.06). Analyses of variance for repeated measures indicated no significant correlation between amount of calories, calcium, or iron ingested, and calcium or iron absorbed. Adding rice cereal to formula does not impair bioavailability of calcium or iron from infant formulas. Because of the increased total calcium and iron in the mixture of formula and cereal, the overall amount of minerals absorbed from F + R may be greater than from formula alone. "
41,39363038,"To assess the impact of prophylactic dextrose gel on short-term outcomes in infants at risk for hypoglycemia. Retrospective, single-center, observational study of neonates at risk for hypoglycemia -infants of diabetic mothers, large and small for gestational age infants, born between January 2015 and May 2023. Infants were categorized into two groups for analysis. 1. Pre- dextrose gel (01/2015 to 04/2018, n = 788) and 2. Dextrose gel (01/2019 to 05/2023, n = 1495). Infant demographic data and outcome variables were compared between the two groups. 2283 infants were eligible. Prophylactic dextrose gel use was associated with decreased admission rates to NICU secondary to hypoglycemia (2.7% vs. 6.5%), reduced incidence of hypoglycemia (32% vs. 43.3%), and higher exclusive breastmilk use at discharge (47% vs. 37.3%). The use of prophylactic dextrose gel in certain high-risk newborns was associated with improved patient outcomes. "
42,30508817,"In 1979, we tested dietary monosodium glutamate (MSG) for developmental neurotoxicity in rats. The study was recently cited for establishing a No Observable Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for MSG as a food additive resulting in a change in the acceptable daily intake (ADI). Therefore, I re-evaluated the study [Vorhees et al.: Toxicol Appl Pharmacol 1979; 50: 267-282]. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed diets containing 0, 1.7, 3.4, or 5.1% MSG prior to conception, throughout gestation and lactation, and the same diets were fed to the offspring until 90 days of age. About 18-20 L were tested per dose with litter and sex factors in data analyses. There were 21 functional tests with 36 dependent variables and 10 body weight and histological outcomes. Of the functional tests, 4 were significant involving 6 effects. Two effects were on swimming ontogeny: one was an improvement and the other an atypical minor delay of no significance. Two effects were on active avoidance: one was a low-dose female-only extinction effect and the other a high-dose male-only acquisition effect, neither providing evidence of consistency. One was on passive avoidance, but was an improvement not a deficit. The last was on open-field rearing in the absence of its normal association with locomotion changes. Thus, it can be concluded, as was done in 1979 and by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration who sponsored the study, that there is no evidence in these data that dietary MSG is developmentally neurotoxic, hence, the study provides no basis for the establishment of a NOAEL and changing the ADI for dietary MSG.

43,21129345,"Patients and physicians expect accurate whole blood glucose monitoring even when patients are anemic, are undergoing peritoneal dialysis, or have slightly elevated ascorbate levels. The objective of this study was to estimate analytical error in two consumer and two hospital glucose meters contributed by variations in hematocrit, maltose, ascorbate, and imprecision. The influence of hematocrit (20-60%), maltose, and ascorbate were tested alone and in combination with each glucose meter and with a reference plasma glucose method at three concentrations of glucose. Precision was determined by consecutive analysis (n=20) at three levels of glucose. Multivariate regression analysis was used to estimate the bias associated with the interferences, alone and in combination. Total analytical error was estimated as |% bias|+1.96 (% imprecision). Three meters demonstrated hematocrit bias that was dependent upon glucose concentration. Maltose had profound concentration-dependent positive bias on the consumer meters, and the extent of maltose bias was dependent on hematocrit. Ascorbate produced small but statistically significant biases on three meters. Coincident low hematocrit, presence of maltose, and presence of ascorbate increased the observed bias and was summarized by estimation of total analytical error. Among the four glucose meter devices assessed, estimates of total analytical error in glucose measurement ranged from 6 to 68% under the conditions tested. The susceptibility of glucose meters to clinically significant analytical biases is highly device-dependent, and low hematocrit exacerbated the observed analytical error. "
44,10718117,"Products released by polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) during an acute inflammatory response can result in diffuse tissue injury. Integrins are cell surface adhesion proteins that play a pivotal role in inflammation by allowing PMNs to adhere to the endothelium and migrate through the extracellular matrix. We examined the expression of beta1 and beta2 integrins on neutrophils from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in an animal model of Group B Streptococcal meningitis. We further evaluated whether integrin expression correlates with pathophysiologic markers of central nervous system inflammation. Our data demonstrate that beta3 and beta2 integrin expression on circulating neutrophils does not significantly increase as a consequence of meningitis. In extravesated CSF neutrophils, a significant increase in expression of both beta1 and beta2 integrins is noted. Furthermore, a majority of the beta1 integrins on extravesated neutrophils have undergone affinity modulation. Using regression analysis, we demonstrated that increasing beta1 integrin expression correlates with decreasing CSF glucose concentration and serum/CSF glucose ratio. Regression analysis approached significance when CSF protein was compared to PMN beta1 integrin expression. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes beta1 integrin expression also showed a direct correlation to myeloperoxidase activity in brain tissue. Beta2 expression on CSF PMNs did not correlate with these markers of inflammation/sequestration. These data demonstrate integrin expression on extravesated neutrophils markedly increases during meningitis and support a role for beta1 integrins on neutrophils in the pathophysiologic consequences of meningitis.

45,35334815,"Gestational low-protein (LP) diet leads to glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in adult offspring. We had earlier demonstrated that LP programming affects glucose disposal in females. Mitochondrial health is crucial for normal glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle. In this study, we sought to analyze mitochondrial structure, function, and associated genes in skeletal muscles to explore the molecular mechanism of insulin resistance LP-programmed female offspring. On day four of pregnancy, rats were assigned to a control diet containing 20% protein or an isocaloric 6% protein-containing diet. Standard laboratory diet was given to the dams after delivery until the end of weaning and to pups after weaning. Gestational LP diet led to changes in mitochondrial ultrastructure in the gastrocnemius muscles, including a nine-fold increase in the presence of giant mitochondria along with unevenly formed cristae. Further, functional analysis showed that LP programming caused impaired mitochondrial functions. Although the mitochondrial copy number did not show significant changes, key genes involved in mitochondrial structure and function such as Fis1, Opa1, Mfn2, Nrf1, Nrf2, Pgc1b, Cox4b, Esrra, and Vdac were dysregulated. Our study shows that prenatal LP programming induced disruption in mitochondrial ultrastructure and function in the skeletal muscle of female offspring. "
46,31827178,"Increasing evidence suggests that mitochondria play a critical role in driving innate immune responses against bacteria and viruses. However, it is unclear if differential reprogramming of mitochondrial function contributes to the fine tuning of pathogen specific immune responses. Here, we found that TLR3 and TLR4 engagement on murine bone marrow derived macrophages was associated with differential remodeling of electron transport chain complex expression. This remodeling was associated with differential accumulation of mitochondrial and cytosolic ROS, which were required to support ligand specific inflammatory and antiviral cytokine production. We also found that the magnitude of TLR3, but not TLR4, responses were modulated by glucose availability. Under conditions of low glucose, TLR3 engagement was associated with increased ETC complex III expression, increased mitochondrial and cytosolic ROS and increased inflammatory and antiviral cytokine production. This amplification was selectively reversed by targeting superoxide production from the outer Q-binding site of the ETC complex III. These results suggest that ligand specific modulation of the ETC may act as a rheostat that fine tunes innate immune responses via mitochondrial ROS production. Modulation of these processes may represent a novel mechanism to modulate the nature as well as the magnitude of antiviral vs. inflammatory immune responses. "

48,10226080,"Lactosylated poly-L-lysine is a nonviral vector that transfers genes into airway epithelial cells, including those from individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Substitution of 40% of the epsilon-amino groups of poly-L-lysine with lactosyl residues not only provided a ligand for receptor-mediated endocytosis, but also reduced the toxicity when compared with nonsubstituted poly-L-lysine. Lactosylated poly-L-lysine/pCMVLuc complex is not toxic to cells in amounts that gave the maximum gene expression. The level of gene expression was regulated by using different combinations of chloroquine, glycerol, and E5CA peptide. Using cultured CF cells, chloroquine, combined with E5CA peptide, increased the transfer of the pCMVLuc/ lactosylated poly-L-lysine complex 10,000-fold compared with transfer without additives. In many systems, a high efficiency is of paramount importance and the enhancing agents can be used to modulate the expression of the gene. For example, transfer of pCMVLacZ/lactosylated poly-L-lysine complexes with chloroquine added to the transfection medium gave only 20% transfection efficiency of the reporter gene. However, when chloroquine was combined with glycerol, the efficiency was increased to 90%, thus approaching that reported with viral vectors. This highly efficient vector may be of great value for the future development of gene transfer systems. "
49,1880418,"The heat shock/stress response is characterized by the induction of several highly evolutionarily conserved proteins during thermal stress, chemical stress, or glucose starvation. It has recently been recognized that members of the stress protein family are synthesized constitutively and subserve functions that are critical to protein folding during intracellular transport. In this study we examined the expression of heat shock/stress proteins in human mononuclear phagocytes, cells dependent on intracellular transport for Ag processing, Ag presentation, generation of reactive oxygen intermediates, and secretion of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory polypeptides. The results indicate that there are distinct patterns in expression of individual members of the highly homologous SP70, SP90, and ubiquitin gene families during different stress states. There is a marked increase in expression of the heat-inducible form of SP70 and SP90 in human monocytes during heat shock. Expression of GRP 78/BiP and GRP 94 increases predominantly during glucose starvation but also increases during heat shock. Ubiquitin gene expression increases during both heat shock and glucose starvation. There is no change in synthesis of the constitutive form of SP 70 or of the ubiquitin activating enzyme E1 during heat shock or glucose starvation. Synthesis of the constitutive form of SP 70 and novel SP 90-like polypeptides increase during endotoxin-mediated inflammatory activation. One intracellular transport process of the mononuclear phagocyte, secretion of specific proinflammatory and antiinflammatory polypeptides, is affected by glucose starvation and by heat shock. "

This study was designed to study contents of macronutrients (fat, lactose, and protein) in human milk collected in the first 2 weeks of life in older (≥35 years) compared with younger (<35 years) mothers. Seventy-two lactating mothers (38 older, 34 younger) of newborns were recruited within the first 3 days of delivery. Macronutrient contents were measured at 72 hours, 7 days, and 14 days after delivery using infrared transmission spectroscopy. The groups did not differ in terms of maternal prepregnancy weight, height, and diet or infant birth weight or gestational age. They differed significantly in terms of maternal age and maternal weight after pregnancy. Fat content in colostrum and carbohydrate content in mature milk were significantly higher in the older mothers group. Moreover, carbohydrates in mature milk correlated positively with maternal age. Fat content at an infant age of 7 days and 2 weeks was not affected by maternal age. There was no significant relationship between maternal body weight for height (or body mass index) and energy, protein, fat or lactose content at any stage. Fat content of colostrum and carbohydrate content of mature milk obtained from mothers with advanced age are elevated compared with those of younger mothers. Moreover, there is a positive correlation between maternal age and carbohydrate content in mature milk. The biological significance of our findings is yet to be determined. "
52,18540249,"There is virtually no information on the metabolic impact of dietary fructose intake in adolescents despite their high fructose consumption, particularly via sweetened beverages. To determine the short-term metabolic effects of dietary fructose intake in obese adolescents. Six volunteers (3 M/3 F; 15.2 +/- 0.5 yr; 35 +/- 2 kg/m2; 39 +/- 2% body fat) were studied twice following 7 d of isocaloric, isonitrogenous high carbohydrate (60% CHO; 25% fat) diets with fructose accounting for 6% and 24% of total energy intake, respectively (random order). Insulin sensitivity and secretion were analyzed by the stable labeled intravenous glucose tolerance test and glucose and lipid kinetics using GCMS. A fourfold increase in dietary fructose intake did not affect insulin sensitivity or secretion, glucose kinetics, lipolysis or glucose, insulin, C-peptide, triglycerides, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol concentrations. In the short term, when energy intake is constant, dietary fructose per se is not a contributor to insulin resistance and hypersecretion in obese adolescents. "
53,17596403,"Successful islet transplantation depends on the infusion of sufficiently large quantities of islets, but only a small fraction of implanted islets become engrafted. The underlying mechanisms remain elusive. To probe the mechanism of islet revascularization, we determined the effect of angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), a proangiogenic and antiapoptotic factor, on the survival, function, and revascularization of transplanted islets using a syngeneic model. Islets were transduced with adenoviruses expressing Ang-1 or control LacZ, followed by transplantation under the renal capsule. Diabetic mice receiving a marginal mass of 150 islets pretransduced with Ang-1 vector exhibited near normoglycemia posttransplantation. In contrast, diabetic mice receiving an equivalent islet mass pretransduced with control vector remained hyperglycemic. At 30 days posttransplantation, mice were killed and islet grafts retrieved for immunohistochemistry. Islet grafts with elevated Ang-1 production retained significantly increased microvascular density, improved glucose profiles, and increased glucose-stimulated insulin release. Cultured islets expressing Ang-1 displayed improved viability and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the presence of cytokines. In contrast, control islets exhibited increased apoptosis and diminished glucose-stimulated insulin release in response to cytokine treatment. These results indicate that Ang-1 confers a cytoprotective effect on islets, enhancing islet engraftment and preserving functional islet mass in transplants. "
54,37066881,"Insulin secretion by pancreatic β cells is a dynamic and highly regulated process due to the central importance of insulin in enabling efficient utilization and storage of glucose. Multiple regulatory layers enable β cells to adapt to acute changes in nutrient availability as well as chronic changes in metabolic demand. While epigenetic factors have been well established as regulators of chronic β cell adaptations to insulin resistance, their role in acute adaptations in response to nutrient stimulation has been relatively unexplored. In this issue of the JCI, Wortham et al. report that short-term dynamic changes in histone modifications regulated insulin secretion and acute β cell adaptations in response to fasting and feeding cycles. These findings highlight the importance of investigating whether other epigenetic mechanisms may contribute to acute physiologic adaptations in β cells. "
55,35927975,"Monitoring glucose excursions is important in diabetes management. This can be achieved using continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). However, CGMs are expensive and invasive. Thus, alternative low-cost noninvasive wearable sensors capable of predicting glycemic excursions could be a game changer to manage diabetes. In this article, we explore two noninvasive sensor modalities, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and accelerometers, collected on five healthy participants over two weeks, to predict both hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic excursions. We extract 29 features encompassing heart rate variability features from the ECG, and time- and frequency-domain features from the accelerometer. We evaluated two machine learning approaches to predict glycemic excursions: a classification model and a regression model. The best model for both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia detection was the regression model based on ECG and accelerometer data, yielding 76% sensitivity and specificity for hypoglycemia and 79% sensitivity and specificity for hyperglycemia. This had an improvement of 5% in sensitivity and specificity for both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia when compared with using ECG data alone. Electrocardiogram is a promising alternative not only to detect hypoglycemia but also to predict hyperglycemia. Supplementing ECG data with contextual information from accelerometer data can improve glucose prediction. "

57,32204442,"Infancy is a time of plasticity in development of taste preference. Complementary feeding (CF) may be a ""sensitive period"" for learning new taste preferences and establishing healthy dietary behaviors that may track later in life. Among 1162 children in the U.S. prospective cohort study Project Viva, we aimed to identify patterns of CF behaviors around 1 year and examine associations with diet quality in early childhood (median age 3.1y). We identified patterns of CF using latent class analysis (LCA) and examined later diet quality based on scores on the Youth Healthy Eating Index (YHEI). We identified four distinct CF patterns (latent classes). Later YHEI scores were highest in the class characterized by ""breast milk and delayed sweets and fruit juice"" and lowest in the ""picky eaters"" class. The classes defined as ""late flavor introduction and delayed sweets"" and ""early flavor introduction and more fruit juice"" had similar, moderate scores. Our results suggest that CF patterns that increase food acceptance and discourage the innate preference for sweetness may have persistent influences on diet quality. "
58,37550630,"Sepsis is characterized as an insulin resistant state. However, the effects of sepsis on insulin's signal transduction pathway are unknown. The molecular activity driving insulin signaling is controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor β-subunit (IRβ) and of insulin receptor substrate molecules (IRS) -1 and IRS-2. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) attenuates IRβ, IRS-1 and IRS-2 phosphorylation. IACUC-approved studies conformed to ARRIVE guidelines. CLP was performed on C57BL/6 mice; separate cohorts received intraperitoneal insulin at baseline (T CLP did not affect the concentrations of IRβ, IRS-1or IRS-2 in muscle or liver homogenate or of IRS-1 in liver. Muscle IRS-1 concentration at 48 h. post-CLP was higher than at T CLP impaired insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both IRS-1 in muscle and IRS-2 in liver. These findings suggest that the molecular mechanism underlying CLP-induced insulin resistance involves impaired IRS-1/IRS-2 phosphorylation. "
59,27890515,"Patterns of waterpipe smoking and associated other tobacco use were assessed among U.S. young adults (aged 18-24 years). A descriptive analysis of baseline data (2013-2014) from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study was conducted in 2016. The study included 9,119 young adults-44% ever and 11% past-30 day waterpipe smokers (12% of men and 9% of women were past-30 day smokers). Among past-30 day smokers, waterpipe smoking frequency was distributed as follows: 4% daily, 23% weekly, 36% monthly, and 37% less than monthly. The average session exceeded 30 minutes for 79% of respondents. In this age group, 29% were exclusive waterpipe smokers, 16% were dual (waterpipe/cigarette) smokers, 8% were dual (waterpipe/e-cigarette) users, 19% were waterpipe/cigarette/e-cigarette users, and 28% presented with other combinations of poly use. Waterpipe smoking is widespread among U.S. young adults. Although waterpipe patterns are predominantly intermittent, the average smoking session provides prolonged exposure. Waterpipe smoking among young adults is primarily characterized by the use of flavored tobacco, the café culture, and poly tobacco use. Rising trends in waterpipe smoking among U.S. youth warrant a strong regulatory response to prevent future waterpipe-related morbidity and mortality. "
60,32856709,"Uromodulin modulates the sodium-potassium-two-chloride transporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, and its overexpression in murine models leads to salt-induced hypertension. We hypothesized that individuals with higher baseline levels of urine uromodulin would have a greater increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) for the same increase in sodium compared with those with lower uromodulin levels. We used data from 157 subjects randomized to the control diet of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-Sodium trial who were assigned to 30 days of low (1,500 mg/d), medium (2,400 mg/d), and high salt (3,300 mg/d) diets in random order. Blood pressure was measured prerandomization and then weekly during each feeding period. We evaluated the association of prerandomization urine uromodulin with change in SBP between diets, as measured at the end of each feeding period, using multivariable linear regression. Baseline urine uromodulin stratified by tertiles was ≤17.64, 17.65-31.97, and ≥31.98 µg/ml. Across the tertiles, there were no significant differences in SBP at baseline, nor was there a differential effect of sodium diet on SBP across tertiles (low to high, P = 0.81). After adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and race, uromodulin levels were not significantly associated with SBP change from low to high sodium diet (P = 0.42). In a randomized trial of different levels of salt intake, higher urine uromodulin levels were not associated with a greater increase in blood pressure in response to high salt intake. "
61,27986330,"The work-up and initial management of a critically ill neonate is challenging and anxiety provoking for the Emergency Physician. While sepsis and critical congenital heart disease represent a large proportion of neonates presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) in shock, there are several additional etiologies to consider. Underlying metabolic, endocrinologic, gastrointestinal, neurologic, and traumatic disorders must be considered in a critically ill infant. Several potential etiologies will present with nonspecific and overlapping signs and symptoms, and the diagnosis often is not evident at the time of ED assessment. We present the case of a neonate in shock, with a variety of nonspecific signs and symptoms who was ultimately diagnosed with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy secondary to a resolved dysrhythmia. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: This case highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the critically ill neonate in the ED, and expands the differential diagnosis beyond sepsis and critical congenital heart disease. Knowledge of the potential life-threatening etiologies of shock in this population allows the Emergency Physician to appropriately test for, and empirically treat, several potential etiologies simultaneously. Additionally, we discuss the diagnosis and management of supraventricular tachycardia and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome in the neonatal and pediatric population, which is essential knowledge for an Emergency Physician.

62,17241777,"Formalisms based on one or other flavor of description logic (DL) are sometimes put forward as helping to ensure that terminologies and controlled vocabularies comply with sound ontological principles. The objective of this paper is to study the degree to which one DL-based biomedical terminology (SNOMED CT) does indeed comply with such principles. We defined seven ontological principles (for example: each class must have at least one parent, each class must differ from its parent) and examined the properties of SNOMED CT classes with respect to these principles. Our major results are 31% of these classes have a single child; 27% have multiple parents; 51% do not exhibit any differentiae between the description of the parent and that of the child. The applications of this principles to quality assurance for ontologies are discussed and suggestions are made for dealing with the phenomenon of multiple inheritance. The advantages and limitations of our approach are also discussed. "
63,32317687,"Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption is a known independent risk factor for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Non-caloric sweeteners (NCS) are food additives providing sweetness without calories and are considered safe and/or not metabolized by the liver. The potential role of newer NCS in the regulation of NASH, however, remain unknown. Our study aimed to determine the impact of newer NCS including Rebaudioside A and sucralose on NASH using high fat diet induced obesity mouse model by substituting fructose and sucrose with NCS in the drinking water. We characterized the phenotype of NCS- treated obesity and investigated the alterations of hepatic function and underlying mechanisms. We found that NCS have no impact on weight gain and energy balance in high fat diet induced obesity. However, in comparison to fructose and sucrose, Rebaudioside A significantly improved liver enzymes, hepatic steatosis and hepatic fibrosis. Additionally, Rebaudioside A improved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress related gene expressions, fasting glucose levels, insulin sensitivity and restored pancreatic islet cell mass, neuronal innervation and microbiome composition. We concluded that Rebaudioside A significantly ameliorated murine NASH, while the underlying mechanisms requires further investigation. "
64,34298883,"As the cornerstone of high-grade glioma (HGG) treatment, radiotherapy temporarily controls tumor cells via inducing oxidative stress and subsequent DNA breaks. However, almost all HGGs recur within months. Therefore, it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms of radioresistance, so that novel strategies can be developed to improve the effectiveness of radiotherapy. While currently poorly understood, radioresistance appears to be predominantly driven by altered metabolism and hypoxia. Glucose is a central macronutrient, and its metabolism is rewired in HGG cells, increasing glycolytic flux to produce energy and essential metabolic intermediates, known as the Warburg effect. This altered metabolism in HGG cells not only supports cell proliferation and invasiveness, but it also contributes significantly to radioresistance. Several metabolic drugs have been used as a novel approach to improve the radiosensitivity of HGGs, including dichloroacetate (DCA), a small molecule used to treat children with congenital mitochondrial disorders. DCA reverses the Warburg effect by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases, which subsequently activates mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation at the expense of glycolysis. This effect is thought to block the growth advantage of HGGs and improve the radiosensitivity of HGG cells. This review highlights the main features of altered glucose metabolism in HGG cells as a contributor to radioresistance and describes the mechanism of action of DCA. Furthermore, we will summarize recent advances in DCA's pre-clinical and clinical studies as a radiosensitizer and address how these scientific findings can be translated into clinical practice to improve the management of HGG patients.

65,26897110,"It has been established that iodine prophylaxis prevents endemic goiter. In this study we reported the amount of iodized salt sold by the retailers of Cassino, a city of central Italy. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of an iodine prophylaxis program started in 2005 on urinary iodine concentration (UIC) and thyroid volume (TV), and their correlation with anthropometric parameters in a population of schoolchildren. The study included 234 schoolchildren (119 girls and 115 boys) ages 13 to 14 y. Each student provided a morning urine sample for UIC determination, and TV was evaluated by ultrasonography. Body weight and height also were measured. Each participant completed a questionnaire reporting the presence of thyroid disease and the consumption of iodized salt and iodine-rich food. The percentage of iodized salt sold by local markets was 42.4%. Median UIC in schoolchildren was 133.9 μg/L (range 33.2-819.5 μg/L), with 71 children having mild (range 50.1-99.9 μg/L) and 10 moderate (range 33.2-48.8 μg/L) iodine deficiency. Eleven children showed excessive iodine intake (range 300.4-819.5 μg/L). Median UIC was higher in children using iodized salt or consuming milk. Goiter prevalence was 3.8%. A positive correlation between TV and body weight, height, and surface was observed. The data reported may suggest the presence of an adequate iodine intake in the population of Cassino despite the low percentage of iodized salt sold by local retailers. This indicates that silent iodine prophylaxis through the consumption of iodine-rich or iodine-enriched food is of importance in the prevention of iodine deficiency disorders. "
66,25930995,"Diabetes is characterized by progressive beta cell dysfunction and loss due in part to oxidative stress that occurs from gluco/lipotoxicity. Treatments that directly protect beta cell function and survival in the diabetic milieu are of particular interest. A growing body of evidence suggests that osteocalcin, an abundant non-collagenous protein of bone, supports beta cell function and proliferation. Based on previous gene expression data by microarray, we hypothesized that osteocalcin protects beta cells from glucose-induced oxidative stress. To test our hypothesis we cultured isolated rat islets and INS-1E cells in the presence of normal, high, or high glucose ± osteocalcin for up to 72 h. Oxidative stress and viability/mitochondrial function were measured by H2O2 assay and Alamar Blue assay, respectively. Caspase 3/7 activity was also measured as a marker of apoptosis. A functional test, glucose stimulated insulin release, was conducted and expression of genes/protein was measured by qRT-PCR/western blot/ELISA. Osteocalcin treatment significantly reduced high glucose-induced H2O2 levels while maintaining viability/mitochondrial function. Osteocalcin also significantly improved glucose stimulated insulin secretion and insulin content in rat islets after 48 h of high glucose exposure compared to untreated islets. As expected sustained high glucose down-regulated gene/protein expression of INS1 and BCL2 while increasing TXNIP expression. Interestingly, osteocalcin treatment reversed the effects of high glucose on gene/protein expression. We conclude that osteocalcin can protect beta cells from the negative effects of glucose-induced oxidative stress, in part, by reducing TXNIP expression, thereby preserving beta cell function and survival.

This research aims to explore the association between the TyG index and the incidence of T2DM in an older Chinese population aged over 75 years. This longitudinal analysis study was performed based on a database from a health check screening program in China. The participants were stratified based on the quintile ranges of the TyG index (Q1 to Q5 groups). T2DM was defined as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥ 7.00 mmol/L and/or self-reported T2DM. The cumulative incidences of T2DM in various quintile groups were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to examine the independent impact of the TyG index on the risk of T2DM during the follow-up period. Subgroup analysis was performed by gender and BMI to further validate the credibility of the results. During the follow-up period, a total of 231 new-onset T2DM cases were recorded among the 2,571 individuals aged over 75 years. After adjusting confounding factors, elevated TyG index independently indicated a higher risk of T2DM (HR = 1.89; 95% CI, 1.47-2.44;  Triglyceride-glucose index independently correlated with the risk of incident T2DM in Chinese adults aged over 75 years. The TyG index might be useful in monitoring T2DM in the older populations. "

However, recent studies, particularly in individuals with type 1 diabetes, have demonstrated increases in the absolute risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Some cases presented with near-normal blood glucose levels or mild hyperglycemia, complicating the recognition/diagnosis of DKA and potentially delaying treatment. Several SGLT inhibitors are currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European regulatory agencies as adjuncts to insulin therapy in people with type 1 diabetes. Strategies must be developed and disseminated to the medical community to mitigate the associated DKA risk. This Consensus Report reviews current data regarding SGLT inhibitor use and provides recommendations to enhance the safety of SGLT inhibitors in people with type 1 diabetes. "

71,35995971,"Glucose metabolism is impaired in brain aging and several neurological conditions. Beneficial effects of ketones have been reported in the context of protecting the aging brain, however, their neurophysiological effect is still largely uncharacterized, hurdling their development as a valid therapeutic option. In this report, we investigate the neurochemical effect of the acute administration of a ketone d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-βHB) monoester in fasting healthy participants with ultrahigh-field proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). In two within-subject metabolic intervention experiments, 7 T MRS data were obtained in fasting healthy participants (1) in the anterior cingulate cortex pre- and post-administration of D-βHB (N = 16), and (2) in the posterior cingulate cortex pre- and post-administration of D-βHB compared to active control glucose (N = 26). Effect of age and blood levels of D-βHB and glucose were used to further explore the effect of D-βHB and glucose on MRS metabolites. Results show that levels of GABA and Glu were significantly reduced in the anterior and posterior cortices after administration of D-βHB. Importantly, the effect was specific to D-βHB and not observed after administration of glucose. The magnitude of the effect on GABA and Glu was significantly predicted by older age and by elevation of blood levels of D-βHB. Together, our results show that administration of ketones acutely impacts main inhibitory and excitatory transmitters in the whole fasting cortex, compared to normal energy substrate glucose. Critically, such effects have an increased magnitude in older age, suggesting an increased sensitivity to ketones with brain aging. "
72,32734729,"Neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is an essential factor underlying neonatal death and disability. This study sought to explore the role of miR-146b-5p in regulating neonatal HIE. In vitro and in vivo HIE models were established in PC12 cells and 10-day neonatal Sprague Dawley rats, respectively. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to assess miR-146b-5p expression and inflammatory factors [interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α] in brain lesions and PC12 cells, while enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was employed to detect the expression of oxidative stress factors (SOD and GSH-Px). Gain- and loss-assays of miR-146b-5p were conducted to verify its role in modulating the viability and apoptosis of PC12 cells under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) treatment. Expression of TLR4, IRAK1, TRAF6, TAK1, and NF-κB were examined by qRT-PCR and/or Western blot. Dual luciferase activity assay was conducted to identify relationships between miR-146b-5p and IRAK1. In the HIE models, significant oxidative stress and inflammatory responses emerged upon upregulation of TLR4/IRAK1/TRAF6/TAK1/NF-κB signaling. Overexpression of miR-146b-5p greatly inhibited OGD-induced PC12 cell injury, inflammatory responses, and oxidative stress. Inhibiting miR-146b-5p, however, had the opposite effects. IRAK1 was found to be a target of miR-146b-5p, and miR-146b-5p overexpression suppressed the activation of IRAK1/TRAF6/TAK1/NF-κB signaling. This study demonstrated that miR-146b-5p overexpression alleviates HIE-induced neuron injury by inhibiting the IRAK1/TRAF6/TAK1/NF-κB pathway. "

75,29299743,"A previous in vivo study demonstrated that intracerebroventricular injection of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in middle cerebral artery occlusion rats increased the expression of caveolin-1 (cav-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in cerebral ischemia penumbra. Because astrocytes are the largest population in the brain, the aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the influence of bFGF on cav-1 and VEGF expression in rat astrocytes following oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). For this, an ischemic model in vitro of oxygen glucose deprivation lasting for 6 h, followed by 24 h of reoxygenation was used. Primary astrocytes from newborn rats were pre-treated with siRNA targeting bFGF before OGD/R. Cell viability was measured by a CCK-8 assay. The protein and mRNA expressions of bFGF, cav-1, and VEGF were evaluated by western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that OGD/R reduced cell viability, which was decreased further following bFGF knockdown; however, restoring bFGF improved cell survival. A cav-1 inhibitor abrogated the effect of bFGF on cell viability. The expression levels of bFGF mRNA, bFGF protein, cav-1 mRNA, cav-1 protein, and VEGF protein were higher in OGD/R astrocytes. bFGF knockdown markedly decreased the expression levels of cav-1 mRNA, cav-1 protein, and VEGF protein, which were effectively reversed by exogenous bFGF treatment. Moreover, exogenous bFGF treatment significantly increased the expression levels of cav-1 mRNA, cav-1 protein, and VEGF protein in OGD/R astrocytes; however, a cav-1 inhibitor abolished the effect of bFGF on VEGF protein expression. These results suggested that bFGF may protect astrocytes against ischemia/reperfusion injury by upregulating caveolin-1/VEGF signaling pathway. "

We aimed to evaluate the relationship between parity and BMI among highly parous Amish women, both before and after menopause, and to evaluate the associations of parity with glucose, blood pressure, and lipids. We conducted a cross-sectional study among 3,141 Amish women 18 years or older from Lancaster County, PA, who participated in our community-based Amish Research Program between 2003 and 2020. We evaluated the association between parity and BMI across different age groups, both before and after the menopausal transition. We further assessed associations between parity and cardiometabolic risk factors among the 1,128 postmenopausal women. Finally, we evaluated the association of change in parity with change in BMI in 561 women followed longitudinally. Approximately 62% of women in this sample (mean age, 45.2 y) reported having four or more children, and 36% reported having seven or more. A one-child increase in parity was associated with increased BMI in both premenopausal women (estimate [95% confidence interval], 0.4 kg/m 2 [0.2-0.5]) and to a lesser degree in postmenopausal women (0.2 kg/m 2 [0.02-0.3], Pint = 0.02), suggesting that the impact of parity on BMI decreases over time. Parity was not associated with glucose, blood pressure, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, or triglycerides ( Padj > 0.05). Higher parity was associated with increased BMI in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women, but more so in younger/premenopausal women. Parity was not associated with other indices of cardiometabolic risk. "

Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a central transcription factor regulating antioxidant responses. The present study aimed to explore the effects of Klotho on DN and the underlying mechanisms related to Nrf2. Low glucose (LG) or high glucose (HG) medium-cultured podocytes and diabetic db/db mice were overexpressed with Klotho via adenoviral transfer to evaluate the effects of Klotho on Nrf2 signaling, oxidative stress, podocyte apoptosis, and renal function and histopathology. Klotho overexpression significantly induced the expression and activation of Nrf2 as well as its downstream targets SOD2 and NQO1 in podocytes. Moreover, Klotho overexpression inhibited HG-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in podocytes. Co-treatment with Nrf2 inhibitor trigonelline prevented Klotho-induced expression of SOD2 and NQO1, and abolished Klotho-conferred antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. In db/db mice, Klotho overexpression also activated Nrf2 signaling, and suppressed diabetes-induced oxidative stress and podocyte apoptosis, which were accompanied by improved renal function and decreased glomerulosclerosis. Our data highlight a novel Nrf2-mediated antioxidant mechanism underlying the protective effects of Klotho in podocytes and indicate the therapeutic potential of targeting Klotho to activate Nrf2 in DN.

79,29025046,"Low protein (LP) diet during pregnancy leads to reduced plasma insulin levels in rodents, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Glucose is the primary insulin secretagogue, and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in beta cells contributes to compensation for insulin resistance and maintenance of glucose homeostasis during pregnancy. In this study, we hypothesized that plasma insulin levels in pregnant rats fed LP diet are reduced due to disrupted GSIS of pancreatic islets. We first confirmed reduced plasma insulin levels, then investigated in vivo insulin secretion by glucose tolerance test and ex vivo GSIS of pancreatic islets in the presence of glucose at different doses, and KCl, glibenclamide, and L-arginine. Main findings include (1) plasma insulin levels were unaltered on day 10, but significantly reduced on days 14-22 of pregnancy in rats fed LP diet compared to those of control (CT) rats; (2) insulin sensitivity was unchanged, but glucose intolerance was more severe in pregnant rats fed LP diet; (3) GSIS in pancreatic islets was lower in LP rats compared to CT rats in the presence of glucose, KCl, and glibenclamide, and the response to L-arginine was abolished in LP rats; and (4) the total insulin content in pancreatic islets and expression of Ins2 were reduced in LP rats, but expression of Gcg was unaltered. These studies demonstrate that decreased GSIS in beta cells of LP rats contributes to reduced plasma insulin levels, which may lead to placental and fetal growth restriction and programs hypertension and other metabolic diseases in offspring.

81,38959864,"Population-level variation and mechanisms behind insulin secretion in response to carbohydrate, protein, and fat remain uncharacterized. We defined prototypical insulin secretion responses to three macronutrients in islets from 140 cadaveric donors, including those with type 2 diabetes. The majority of donors' islets exhibited the highest insulin response to glucose, moderate response to amino acid, and minimal response to fatty acid. However, 9% of donors' islets had amino acid responses, and 8% had fatty acid responses that were larger than their glucose-stimulated insulin responses. We leveraged this heterogeneity and used multi-omics to identify molecular correlates of nutrient responsiveness, as well as proteins and mRNAs altered in type 2 diabetes. We also examined nutrient-stimulated insulin release from stem cell-derived islets and observed responsiveness to fat but not carbohydrate or protein-potentially a hallmark of immaturity. Understanding the diversity of insulin responses to carbohydrate, protein, and fat lays the groundwork for personalized nutrition. "
82,33838294,"Sucrose preference test (SPT) is a most frequently applied method for measuring anhedonia, a core symptom of depression, in rodents. However, the method of SPT still remains problematic mainly due to the primitive, irregular, and inaccurate various types of home-made equipment in laboratories, causing imprecise, inconsistent, and variable results. To overcome this issue, we devised a novel method for automatic detection of anhedonia in mice using an electronic apparatus with its program for automated detecting the behavior of drinking of mice instead of manual weighing the water bottles. In this system, the liquid surface of the bottles was monitored electronically by infrared monitoring elements which were assembled beside the plane of the water surface and the information of times and duration of each drinking was collected to the principal machine. A corresponding computer program was written and installed in a computer connected to the principal machine for outputting and analyzing the data. This new method, based on the automated system, was sensitive, reliable, and adaptable for evaluation of stress- or drug-induced anhedonia, as well as taste preference and effects of addictive drugs. Extensive application of this automated apparatus for SPT would greatly improve and standardize the behavioral assessment method of anhedonia, being instrumental in novel antidepressant screening and depression researching.

84,25519680,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A disease (CMT1A) is a rare orphan inherited neuropathy caused by an autosomal dominant duplication of a gene encoding for the structural myelin protein PMP22, which induces abnormal Schwann cell differentiation and dysmyelination, eventually leading to axonal suffering then loss and muscle wasting. We favour the idea that diseases can be more efficiently treated when targeting multiple disease-relevant pathways. In CMT1A patients, we therefore tested the potential of PXT3003, a low-dose combination of three already approved compounds (baclofen, naltrexone and sorbitol). Our study conceptually builds on preclinical experiments highlighting a pleiotropic mechanism of action that includes downregulation of PMP22. The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability of PXT3003. The secondary objective aimed at an exploratory analysis of efficacy of PXT3003 in CMT1A, to be used for designing next clinical development stages (Phase 2b/3). 80 adult patients with mild-to-moderate CMT1A received in double-blind for 1 year Placebo or one of the three increasing doses of PXT3003 tested, in four equal groups. Safety and tolerability were assessed with the incidence of related adverse events. Efficacy was assessed using the Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Score (CMTNS) and the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (ONLS) as main endpoints, as well as various clinical and electrophysiological outcomes. This trial confirmed the safety and tolerability of PXT3003. The highest dose (HD) showed consistent evidence of improvement beyond stabilization. CMTNS and ONLS, with a significant improvement of respectively of 8% (0.4% - 16.2%) and 12.1% (2% - 23.2%) in the HD group versus the pool of all other groups, appear to be the most sensitive clinical endpoints to treatment despite their quasi-stability over one year under Placebo. Patients who did not deteriorate over one year were significantly more frequent in the HD group. These results confirm that PXT3003 deserves further investigation in adults and could greatly benefit CMT1A-diagnosed children, usually less affected than adults. EudraCT Number: 2010-023097-40. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01401257. The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products issued in February 2014 a positive opinion on the application for orphan designation for PXT3003 (EMA/OD/193/13). "
85,8410255,"A 2-month-old infant demonstrated clinical brain death 48 hours after suffering a closed head injury accompanied by cardiac arrest. Two nuclear cerebral blood flow (CBF) studies demonstrated normal perfusion. On the 11th day following injury, cerebral electrical activity ceased and a normal glucose metabolic gradient between gray and white matter was documented on positron emission tomography. Autopsy revealed widespread necrosis with mononuclear cell infiltrates throughout all cerebral cortical layers. Nine children have previously been described with clinical brain death, electrocerebral silence, and evidence of CBF by radionuclide scan. The dissociation between cerebral electrical activity and blood flow may be explained by an increase in cranial volume allowed by the expansile neonatal skull, preventing both intracranial hypertension and a reduction in perfusion pressure. The persistence of glucose metabolism may be associated with the presence of inflammatory microglial cells in the ischemic cortex. The authors conclude that persistence of CBF and glucose metabolism in brain-dead children may not indicate neuronal survival. If repeated neurological examinations with or without electroencephalography support the diagnosis of brain death, the presence of CBF and glucose metabolism should not alter this conclusion. "

87,12936930,"Preterm infants often receive total parenteral nutrition (TPN) before enteral feeding. Although TPN has been linked to mucosal atrophy, its effects on intestinal digestion, absorption, and metabolism are unknown. Our aim was to determine the effects of TPN on rates of intestinal nutrient absorption and metabolism in infant pigs after initiation of enteral feeding. Piglets were surgically implanted with catheters in the carotid artery, jugular vein, portal vein, and duodenum; an ultrasonic blood flow probe was inserted in the portal vein. Piglets were given TPN (TPN group) or enterally fed formula (enteral group) for 6 d. On day 7, both groups were enterally fed a milk-based formula, and the net portal absorption and metabolism of enteral [(2)H]glucose and [(13)C]leucine were measured. After enteral feeding began, portal blood flow increased by 27% and 41% above the basal rate in the enteral and TPN groups, respectively; oxygen consumption remained lower in the TPN group. During enteral feeding, the net portal absorption of glucose was lower in the TPN group and that of galactose was not significantly different between the groups; lactate release was higher in the TPN group. Portal absorption accounted for only approximately 37% of galactose intake in both groups. The TPN group had lower net portal absorption of arginine, lysine, threonine, and glycine. The portal absorption of dietary leucine was not significantly different between the groups; the arterial utilization and oxidation of leucine were significantly lower in the TPN group. Short-term TPN results in decreased lactose digestion and hexose absorption and increased intestinal utilization of key essential amino acids when enteral feeding is initiated in piglets. "
88,30698123,"Intravenous dextrose aids in the resolution of ketosis in dehydrated patients not tolerating oral glucose and is often recommended in this clinical scenario. Our aim was to determine whether the addition of dextrose to intravenous rehydration solutions results in decreased hospital admissions or other clinically important benefits among dehydrated children or adults. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane Library were searched by a medical librarian from inception through November 2017. The inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials comparing dextrose containing intravenous solutions with intravenous solutions without dextrose in patients being treated for dehydration, and not already hospitalized. The database and bibliographies search identified 1,472 unique citations. Only two trials (N = 333) met the inclusion criteria. Both compared normal saline with solutions of dextrose in normal saline. There was no statistically significant difference in admission rates (relative risk = 0.83; 95% confidence interval = 0.62 to 1.10) or revisits (relative risk = 0.54; 95% confidence interval = 0.24 to 1.22). Heterogeneity was low (I2 = 0). No other outcome results were eligible for pooling, but neither study found differences in any clinical outcomes. No adverse events were reported in either trial. The addition of dextrose to intravenous saline has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes in dehydrated children presenting to the emergency department with gastroenteritis, but the confidence intervals around the estimate of effect are wide and include the possibility of substantial benefit. Les perfusions de dextrose aident à neutraliser la cétose chez les patients en état de déshydratation qui ne tolèrent pas la prise orale de glucose, et le traitement est souvent recommandé dans ces situations cliniques. L’étude visait donc à déterminer si l'adjonction de dextrose aux solutions de réhydratation intraveineuse se traduisait par une réduction du nombre d'hospitalisations ou offrait d'autres avantages cliniques importants chez les enfants et les adultes. Une recherche a été menée dans les bases de données MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, la plateforme Web of Science et la bibliothèque Cochrane Library par un bibliothécaire spécialisé dans le domaine médical, depuis leur mise sur pied jusqu’à novembre 2017. Les critères de sélection consistaient en la recherche d'essais à répartition aléatoire, dans lesquels étaient comparées des solutions de perfusion additionnées de dextrose à celles n'en contenant pas chez les patients externes, traités pour de la déshydratation. La recherche documentaire dans les bibliographies et les bases de données a permis de relever 1472 citations uniques; toutefois, 2 essais (n = 333) seulement satisfaisaient aux critères de sélection. Dans les deux cas, on comparait des solutions physiologiques salées à des solutions physiologiques salées additionnées de dextrose. Il n'est ressorti aucun écart significatif en ce qui concerne le taux d'hospitalisation (taux relatif [TR] = 0,83; intervalle de confiance [IC] à 95% = 0,62–1,10) ou de reconsultation (TR = 0,54; IC à 95% = 0,24–1,22). Quant à l'hétérogénéité, elle était faible (I2 = 0). Aucun autre résultat ne se prêtait à une mise en commun, mais il ne s'est pas dégagé non plus de différence entre les deux études à l’égard de quelque résultat clinique que ce soit. Enfin, aucun événement indésirable n'a été signalé dans l'un ou l'autre des essais. L'adjonction de dextrose aux solutions physiologiques salées ne s'est pas traduite par une amélioration des résultats cliniques chez les enfants en état de déshydratation, traités au service des urgences pour une gastroentérite; toutefois, les intervalles de confiance entourant l'estimation des effets sont larges et pourraient comporter des avantages importants.

91,34055688,"The use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and vaping among adolescents has risen exponentially in the last decade. E-cigarette flavors has driven adolescents to use these convenient, USB-like devices, designed to create a desired social image, while being seemingly unaware of the serious health consequences of their behavior. Vaping impacts protective pulmonary barriers by attenuating the mucociliary clearance and by increasing peribronchial inflammation and fibrosis. The recent SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has been characterized by a plethora of unusual disease presentations. Among them, a unique presentation seen exclusively in children and adolescents was multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Seventy percent of adolescents who had MIS-C also had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and we speculate that there may exist common denominator that links MIS-C and adolescents: the use of e-cigarettes. The virus targets the angiotensin converting receptor (ACE receptor), and studies have shown nicotine-based e-cigarettes or vaping cause oxidative stress and resulting in the upregulation of ACE2, which might worsen ARDS in MIS-C. Our mini-review highlights that adolescents using e-cigarette have alterations in their pulmonary defenses against SARS-CoV-2: an upregulation of the ACE2 receptors, the primary target of SARS-CoV-2. Their compromised immune system makes them more uniquely vulnerable to Covid-19 related MIS-C, increasing their risk for ARDS and related morbidities. Currently, studies have shown an association between MIS-C and vaping, we speculate that adolescents who vape/smoke might be especially vulnerable to serious respiratory symptoms if they develop a hyper-inflammatory state MIS-C.

93,2202802,"This study was undertaken to test the glycemic response of five infants with glycogen storage disease type 1, aged 0.7 to 1.5 years, to uncooked cornstarch under various dietary conditions, and to evaluate the long-term effects of a dietary regimen consisting of uncooked cornstarch in milk every 4 hours, in addition to three meals daily, on biochemical values and physical growth. The results were compared with previous experience in treating six infants with continuous overnight glucose infusion via gastrostomy plus multiple daily feedings containing an adequate source of glucose. A test dose of cornstarch (1.6 to 1.8 gm/kg) providing four times the calculated hourly glucose production rate, when given in water 15 to 30 minutes after a continuous overnight intragastric glucose infusion was stopped, did not maintain normoglycemia. When the same dose was given in 2% cow milk 4 hours later, mean blood glucose levels remained greater than 68 mg/dl (3.8 mmol/L) for up to 4 hours. A regimen of uncooked cornstarch in 2% cow milk at 4-hour intervals in addition to three meals daily prevented hypoglycemia, and maintained blood lactate at nearly normal levels and serum uric acid and cholesterol within the normal range; triglyceride levels were increased only modestly. Overnight blood glucose levels were comparable to those achieved with continuous intragastric glucose infusion. With this regimen the five infants have maintained linear growth rates normal for their age and genetic potential; the mean percentage of ideal body weight for length percentile did not change significantly, although two of the five patients were overweight (123% and 124% of ideal body weight respectively) after 3 years of treatment. We conclude that a trial of uncooked cornstarch in feedings of milk every 4 hours should be attempted as soon as a more frequent feeding schedule with dextrose-containing formulas proves ineffective, because the former has the potential to provide the continuous glucose required by infants with glycogen storage disease type 1 in a safer and less invasive fashion than continuous intragastric glucose infusion.

94,30092608,"To model breastfed infant growth and body composition patterns over the first 4 months with multiple bioactive components of human milk (HM) and clinical factors (including maternal BMI status), which are related to growth. Longitudinal observation of infant growth and body composition from 0 to 4 months among 41 predominantly breastfed infants (25 mothers of Normal-weight and 16 mothers with overweight/obesity). Fasted morning HM samples were collected at 5 time-points. Macronutrients, leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin, insulin, cytokines and n-6:n-3 esterified fatty acid ratio were measured. Infant weight-for-length Z-score (WLZ) trajectory, fat-free mass (FFM) gain, fat mass gain and %fat gain were modelled controlling for clinical covariates. HM insulin negatively associated with WLZ trajectory among infants of NW mothers (P = 0.028), but not associated with WLZ trajectory among infants of OW/Ob mothers. HM glucose (P < 0.001) was associated with slower rates of infant FFM gain. Infants of mothers with OW/Ob exhibited slower rates of FFM gain. HM protein, adiponectin and insulin concentrations, and n-6:n-3 ratio were all significant predictors in the model of infant fat mass gain (P < 0.03). Any amount of formula supplementation was associated with faster fat gain (P = 0.002). The model of %fat gain was similar to that of fat mass gain, excepting HM adiponectin was not a significant covariate, and a trend for maternal OW/Ob to correlate with faster %fat gain (P = 0.056). Bioactive components in HM may contribute to regulation of partitioning of body composition, and these contributions may differ between mothers of normal-weight vs. with OW/Ob. "
95,31567404,"Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of hospital visits for children. Hyperosmolar therapy is often used to treat severe traumatic brain injury. Hypertonic saline is used predominantly, yet there remains disagreement about whether hypertonic saline or mannitol is more effective. Literature search was conducted using Pubmed, Cochrane, and Embase. Systematic review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Retrospective and prospective studies assessing use of hyperosmolar therapy in pediatric patients with severe traumatic brain injury were included. Two independent authors performed article review. Two-thousand two-hundred thirty unique articles were initially evaluated, 11 were included in the final analysis, with a total of 358 patients. Study quality was assessed using Modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Jadad score. Of the 11 studies, all evaluated hypertonic saline and four evaluated both hypertonic saline and mannitol. Nine reported that hypertonic saline lowered intracranial pressure and two reported that mannitol lowered intracranial pressure. The studies varied significantly in dose, concentration, and administrations schedule for both hypertonic saline and mannitol. Five studies were prospective, but only one directly compared mannitol to hypertonic saline. The prospective comparison study found no difference in physiologic outcomes. Clinical outcomes were reported using different measures across studies. For hypertonic saline-treated patients, mechanical ventilation was required for 6.9-9 days, decompressive craniectomy was required for 6.25-29.3% of patients, ICU length of stay was 8.0-10.6 days, in-hospital mortality was 10-48%, and 6-month mortality was 7-17%. In mannitol-treated patients, ICU length of stay was 9.5 days, in-hospital mortality was 56%, and 6-month mortality was 19%. Both hypertonic saline and mannitol appear to lower intracranial pressure and improve clinical outcomes in pediatric severe traumatic brain injury, but the evidence is extremely fractured both in the method of treatment and in the evaluation of outcomes. Given the paucity of high-quality data, it is difficult to definitively conclude which agent is better or what treatment protocol to follow. "

97,28972537,"Overconsumption of high-fat diet (HFD) and sugar-sweetened beverages are risk factors for developing obesity, insulin resistance, and fatty liver disease. Here we have dissected mechanisms underlying this association using mice fed either chow or HFD with or without fructose- or glucose-supplemented water. In chow-fed mice, there was no major physiological difference between fructose and glucose supplementation. On the other hand, mice on HFD supplemented with fructose developed more pronounced obesity, glucose intolerance, and hepatomegaly as compared to glucose-supplemented HFD mice, despite similar caloric intake. Fructose and glucose supplementation also had distinct effects on expression of the lipogenic transcription factors ChREBP and SREBP1c. While both sugars increased ChREBP-β, fructose supplementation uniquely increased SREBP1c and downstream fatty acid synthesis genes, resulting in reduced liver insulin signaling. In contrast, glucose enhanced total ChREBP expression and triglyceride synthesis but was associated with improved hepatic insulin signaling. Metabolomic and RNA sequence analysis confirmed dichotomous effects of fructose and glucose supplementation on liver metabolism in spite of inducing similar hepatic lipid accumulation. Ketohexokinase, the first enzyme of fructose metabolism, was increased in fructose-fed mice and in obese humans with steatohepatitis. Knockdown of ketohexokinase in liver improved hepatic steatosis and glucose tolerance in fructose-supplemented mice. Thus, fructose is a component of dietary sugar that is distinctively associated with poor metabolic outcomes, whereas increased glucose intake may be protective. "
98,38883928,"Nearly 3 million U.S. adolescents use e-cigarettes. E-cigarette marketing is associated with adolescent e-cigarette use; however, studies have not asked adolescents their perceptions about whether and which e-cigarette marketing in retail stores influences purchase and use. Eleven 90-minute focus groups with 12-19-year-olds (mean age 15.7, 46.6 % female) from 11 U.S. states (n = 58) recruited through Instagram and schools (May 2021-Aug 2022). Photographs of e-cigarette marketing in and around retail stores were used to aid discussion. Thematic analysis identified themes related to appealing marketing characteristics. Adolescents indicated that e-cigarette marketing in and around retail stores arouses their curiosity, reminds them to buy, and normalizes using e-cigarettes. Adolescents identified specific e-cigarette marketing characteristics that they believed influence their decision to purchase and use e-cigarettes including the Tobacco Power Wall, free samples and flavor smelling samples, price incentives such as discounts and starter-kits, e-cigarette displays near checkout encouraging grab-and-go, displays near food, snacks or candy, and e-cigarette advertising through posters on store windows and stickers at checkout. Adolescents reported combining online and social media strategies to bypass age verification in retail stores (e.g., buying gift cards online and using them in stores). Adolescents suggested adding warning images on negative health effects of e-cigarettes, increasing prominence of minimum-age-of-tobacco-sale signs, and developing marketing education as counter-marketing strategies. Adolescents indicate that specific e-cigarette marketing characteristics in retail stores influence their purchase and use decisions. Addressing such e-cigarette marketing exposures in retail stores through counter-marketing messages may bolster adolescent e-cigarette prevention efforts. "
99,25468647,"Mathematical models of biological pathways facilitate a systems biology approach to medicine. However, these models need to be updated to reflect the latest available knowledge of the underlying pathways. We developed a mathematical model of the insulin signal transduction pathway by expanding the last major previously reported model and incorporating pathway components elucidated since the original model was reported. Furthermore, we show that inputting gene expression data of key components of the insulin signal transduction pathway leads to sensible predictions of glucose clearance rates in agreement with reported clinical measurements. In one set of simulations, our model predicted that glycerol kinase knockout mice have reduced GLUT4 translocation, and consequently, reduced glucose uptake. Additionally, a comparison of our extended model with the original model showed that the added pathway components improve simulations of glucose clearance rates. We anticipate this expanded model to be a useful tool for predicting insulin sensitivity in mammalian tissues with altered expression protein phosphorylation or mRNA levels of insulin signal transduction pathway components.

100,32339667,"Hypoxia induces reversible κ-opioid receptor (KOR) internalization similar to the internalization that is induced by KOR agonists. In the current study, we demonstrate that this KOR internalization is a protective mechanism via the β-arrestin specific pathway in an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model. Mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2A cells were stably transfected with mouse KOR-tdTomato fusion protein (N2A-mKOR-tdT cells). Various concentrations of salvinorin A (SA), a highly selective KOR agonist, were given in the presence and absence of norbinaltorphimine (norBNI), which is a KOR antagonist, or Dyngo-4a (internalization inhibitor) or API-2 (Akt/Protein kinase B signaling inhibitor-2). Various concentrations of SA and RB-64 (22-thiocyanatosalvinorin A, selective for the G protein signaling pathway) were administered both in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Autophagosomes and ultrastructural components of cells were observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cell viability, severity of cell injury, and levels of proteins related to the Akt signaling pathway were evaluated using live cell counting (by Cell Counting Kit-8), the lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) release rate, and Western blot analysis, respectively. SA promoted cell survival and attenuated OGD-induced cell injury. The Akt signaling pathway is activated by SA. KOR internalization, when blocked by norBNI or Dyngo-4a, increased LDH release and decreased cell viability under OGD. Treatment with SA significantly inhibited autophagy, and the effects of SA on autophagy were reversed by API-2 pretreatment. RB-64 in a low concentration without β-arrestin recruitment did not reduce LDH release and increase cell viability as observed with SA. KOR internalization through β-arrestin activation is a protective mechanism against OGD. The Akt pathway might play a critical role in modulating these protective effects by inhibiting autophagy. "
101,29206655,"Cerebral impairment and acute kidney injury (AKI) are independent predictors of mortality in both adults and children with severe falciparum malaria. In this review, we present recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology, clinical features, and management of these complications of severe malaria, and discuss future areas of research. Cerebral malaria and AKI are serious and well recognized complications of severe malaria. Common pathophysiological pathways include impaired microcirculation, due to sequestration of parasitized erythrocytes, systemic inflammatory responses, and endothelial activation. Recent MRI studies show significant brain swelling in both adults and children with evidence of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome-like syndrome although targeted interventions including mannitol and dexamethasone are not beneficial. Recent work shows association of cell-free hemoglobin oxidation stress involved in the pathophysiology of AKI in both adults and children. Paracetamol protected renal function likely by inhibiting cell-free-mediated oxidative stress. It is unclear if heme-mediated endothelial activation or oxidative stress is involved in cerebral malaria. The direct causes of cerebral and kidney dysfunction remain incompletely understood. Optimal treatment involves prompt diagnosis and effective antimalarial treatment with artesunate. Renal replacement therapy reduces mortality in AKI but delayed diagnosis is an issue. "

103,32576825,"Understanding tumor metabolism holds the promise of new insights into cancer biology, diagnosis and treatment. To assess human cancer metabolism, here we report a method to collect intra-operative samples of blood from an artery directly upstream and a vein directly downstream of a brain tumor, as well as samples from dorsal pedal veins of the same patients. After performing targeted metabolomic analysis, we characterize the metabolites consumed and produced by gliomas in vivo by comparing the arterial supply and venous drainage. N-acetylornithine, D-glucose, putrescine, and L-acetylcarnitine are consumed in relatively large amounts by gliomas. Conversely, L-glutamine, agmatine, and uridine 5-monophosphate are produced in relatively large amounts by gliomas. Further we verify that D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG) is high in venous plasma from patients with isocitrate dehydrogenases1 (IDH1) mutations. Through these paired comparisons, we can exclude the interpatient variation that is present in plasma samples usually taken from the cubital vein. "
104,28640802,"Peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBD) are a group of multi-system human diseases due to mutations in the PEX genes that are responsible for peroxisome assembly and function. These disorders lead to global defects in peroxisomal function and result in severe brain, liver, bone and kidney disease. In order to study their pathogenesis we undertook a systematic genetic and biochemical study of Drosophila pex16 and pex2 mutants. These mutants are short-lived with defects in locomotion and activity. Moreover these mutants exhibit severe morphologic and functional peroxisomal defects. Using metabolomics we uncovered defects in multiple biochemical pathways including defects outside the canonical specialized lipid pathways performed by peroxisomal enzymes. These included unanticipated changes in metabolites in glycolysis, glycogen metabolism, and the pentose phosphate pathway, carbohydrate metabolic pathways that do not utilize known peroxisomal enzymes. In addition, mutant flies are starvation sensitive and are very sensitive to glucose deprivation exhibiting dramatic shortening of lifespan and hyperactivity on low-sugar food. We use bioinformatic transcriptional profiling to examine gene co-regulation between peroxisomal genes and other metabolic pathways and we observe that the expression of peroxisomal and carbohydrate pathway genes in flies and mouse are tightly correlated. Indeed key steps in carbohydrate metabolism were found to be strongly co-regulated with peroxisomal genes in flies and mice. Moreover mice lacking peroxisomes exhibit defective carbohydrate metabolism at the same key steps in carbohydrate breakdown. Our data indicate an unexpected link between these two metabolic processes and suggest metabolism of carbohydrates could be a new therapeutic target for patients with PBD. "
105,18489729,"Evidence is accumulating that chromatin plays a major role in the control of cellular response to stress. This is best illustrated by the recent findings that chromatin-modifying factors of class III histone deacetylases (sirtuins) are capable of protecting cells from oxidative and genotoxic stress. In particular, Sirt1 has been shown to mimic the action of caloric restriction for the prevention of aging-associated diseases. In the present study, we have investigated the potential role of class I and II histone deacetylases (HDACs) in cellular protection against various stresses, including those caused by nutrient deprivation. For this, we utilized a cellular model in which expression of class I and II HDACs was altered as a result of cellular adaptation to trichostatin A (TSA), a selective inhibitor of these deacetylases. Our results indicated that TSA-resistant cells also developed resistance to H(2)O(2), DNA-damaging agents, and to nutrient deprivation. Interestingly, the insulin signaling pathway mediated by Akt was inhibited in the TSA-resistant cells, mirroring the effect of glucose deprivation on this pathway. Since expression of HDAC4 was consistently enhanced in the TSA-resistant cell lines, we suggest that this enzyme may contribute to their anti-stress response. In agreement with this, siRNA-mediated knockdown of HDAC4 in stress-resistant cells enhanced their sensitivity to the DNA-damaging drug doxorubicin and also to glucose deprivation. Akt phosphorylation was also up-regulated in response to HDC4 knockdown. Together, these findings suggest that cellular conditioning with TSA may represent a useful approach to mimic the effects of caloric restriction. "

108,31664095,"State-of-the-art ultra-sensitive blood glucose-monitoring biosensors, based on glucose oxidase (GOx) covalently linked to a single layer graphene (SLG), will be a valuable next generation diagnostic tool for personal glycemic level management. We report here our observations of sensor matrix structure obtained using a multi-physics approach towards analysis of small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) on graphene-based biosensor functionalized with GOx under different pH conditions for various hierarchical GOx assemblies within SLG. We developed a methodology to separately extract the average shape of GOx molecules within the hierarchical assemblies. The modeling is able to resolve differences in the average GOx dimer structure and shows that treatment under different pH conditions lead to differences within the GOx at the dimer contact region with SLG. The coupling of different analysis methods and modeling approaches we developed in this study provides a universal approach to obtain detailed structural quantifications, for establishing robust structure-property relationships. This is an essential step to obtain an insight into the structure and function of the GOx-SLG interface for optimizing sensor performance. "

New probiotic strains and products, as well as expanding use of probiotics into vulnerable populations, warrants concise, and actionable recommendations on how to work toward their safe and effective use. The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics convened a meeting to discuss and produce evidence-based recommendations on potential acute and long-term risks, risks to vulnerable populations, the importance for probiotic product quality to match the needs of vulnerable populations, and the need for adverse event reporting related to probiotic use. The importance of whole genome sequencing, which enables determination of virulence, toxin, and antibiotic resistance genes, as well as clear assignment of species and strain identity, is emphasized. We present recommendations to guide the scientific and medical community on judging probiotic safety."
110,36410805,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced its intention to reduce the nicotine content in cigarettes as a strategy to promote cessation and reduce smoking-related harm. A low nicotine product standard will apply to all cigarettes on the market, including menthol cigarettes. In December 2021, the FDA approved a modified risk tobacco product application for menthol and non-menthol flavoured very low nicotine cigarettes (VLNC) from the 22nd Century Group. Notably, experimentation with menthol cigarettes is linked to smoking progression, as well as greater nicotine dependence relative to non-menthol cigarette use. If menthol VLNCs are perceived as more appealing than non-menthol VLNCs, this would indicate that some aspect of menthol may maintain smoking even in the absence of nicotine and FDA's regulatory authority to ban or restrict the sale of menthol cigarettes should apply to reduced nicotine content of cigarettes. In April 2022, the FDA announced proposed rulemaking to prohibit menthol cigarettes, however it is unclear if a menthol prohibition would apply to VLNCs. This study will recruit 172 young adult menthol smokers (with a specific subsample of n=40 sexual and gender minority young adults) and measure appeal for smoking experimental menthol and non-menthol VLNCs, and the impact of proposed product standards on tobacco product purchasing behaviour using an Experimental Tobacco Marketplace. Appeal across product standards will be assessed in a controlled laboratory and using ecological momentary assessment. The protocol was approved by the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center Institutional Review Board (#11865). Findings will examine the effects of a reduced nicotine standard and a menthol ban on young adult smoking and will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal articles and presentations at scientific conferences.

111,36153375,"Children with obesity and those with type 1diabetes (T1D) exhibit subtle neurocognitive deficits, the mechanism of which remains unknown. α-synuclein plays a fundamental role in neurodegeneration. Moreover, its role in glucose and lipids metabolism is emerging. This study aims to assess whether α-synuclein is correlated with the degree of neurodegeneration in children with obesity and those with T1D in comparison to healthy controls and correlate it to various neurocognitive and metabolic parameters. Forty children with obesity, 40 children with T1D and 40 matched-healthy controls were assessed for anthropometric measurements and blood-pressure. Cognitive evaluation was performed using Stanford-Binet scale and Barkley Deficits in Executive Functioning (EF) Scale-Children and Adolescents. α-synuclein, fasting lipids and glucose were measured with calculation of the homeostatic model of insulin-resistance and estimated-glucose disposal rate. Children with obesity and those with T1D had significantly higher α-synuclein (p < 0.001) and total EF percentile (p = 0.001) than controls. α-synuclein was negatively correlated to total IQ (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001), and positively correlated with total EF percentile (p = 0.009 and p = 0.001) and EF symptom count percentile (p = 0.005 and p < 0.001) in children with T1D and obesity, respectively. Multivariate-regression revealed that α-synuclein was independently related to age (p = 0.028), diabetes-duration (p = 0.006), HbA1C% (p = 0.034), total IQ (p = 0.013) and EF symptom count percentile (p = 0.003) among children with T1D, and to diastolic blood-pressure percentile (p = 0.013), waist/hip ratio SDS (p = 0.007), total EF percentile (P = 0.033) and EF symptom count percentile (p < 0.001) in children with obesity. α-synuclein could have a mechanistic role in neurocognitive deficit among children with obesity and T1D.

112,32251313,"Although sociological studies affirm the importance of parental care in the survival of offspring, maltreatment-including child neglect-remains prevalent in many countries. While child neglect is well known to affect child development, the causes of maternal neglect are poorly understood. Here, we found that female mice with a deletion mutation of CAST (a presynaptic release-machinery protein) showed significantly reduced weaning rate when primiparous and a recovered rate when multiparous. Indeed, when nurturing, primiparous and nulliparous CAST knock out (KO) mice exhibited less crouching time than control mice and moved greater distances. Contrary to expectations, plasma oxytocin (OXT) was not significantly reduced in CAST KO mice even though terminals of magnocellular neurons in the posterior pituitary expressed CAST. We further found that compared with control mice, CAST KO mice drank significantly less water when nurturing and had a greater preference for sucrose during pregnancy. We suggest that deficiency in presynaptic release-machinery protein impairs the facilitation of some maternal behaviours, which can be compensated for by experience and learning. "
113,31680189,"To study if second-generation antipsychotic (S-GA) use during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of pregnancy and neonatal complications. A population-based birth cohort study using national register data extracted from the ""Drugs and Pregnancy"" database in Finland, years 1996-2016. The sampling frame included 1,181,090 pregnant women and their singleton births. Women were categorized into three groups: exposed to S-GAs during pregnancy (n = 4225), exposed to first-generation antipsychotics (F-GAs) during pregnancy (n = 1576), and unexposed (no purchases of S-GAs or F-GAs during pregnancy, n = 21,125). Pregnancy outcomes in S-GA users were compared with those in the two comparison groups using multiple logistic regression models. Comparing S-GA users with unexposed ones, the risk was increased for gestational diabetes (adjusted odds ratio, OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.25-1.65), cesarean section (OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.18-1.53), being born large for gestational age (LGA) (OR 1.57; 95% CI 1.14-2.16), and preterm birth (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.03-1.62). The risk for these outcomes increased further with continuous S-GA use. Infants in the S-GA group were also more likely to suffer from neonatal complications. Comparing S-GA users with the F-GA group, the risk of cesarean section and LGA was higher (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.03-1.51; and OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.20-2.99, respectively). Neonatal complications did not differ between the S-GA and F-GA groups. Prenatal exposure to S-GAs is associated with an increased risk of pregnancy complications related to impaired glucose metabolism. Neonatal problems are common and occur similarly in S-GA and F-GA users. "
114,28193492,"Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSLs) convert fatty acids to fatty acyl-CoAs to regulate various physiologic processes. We characterized the ACSL isoforms in a cell line of homogeneous rat beta cells (INS-1 832/13 cells) and human pancreatic islets. ACSL4 and ACSL3 proteins were present in the beta cells and human and rat pancreatic islets and concentrated in insulin secretory granules and less in mitochondria and negligible in other intracellular organelles. ACSL1 and ACSL6 proteins were not seen in INS-1 832/13 cells or pancreatic islets. ACSL5 protein was seen only in INS-1 832/13 cells. With shRNA-mediated gene silencing we developed stable ACSL knockdown cell lines from INS-1 832/13 cells. Glucose-stimulated insulin release was inhibited ∼50% with ACSL4 and ACSL3 knockdown and unaffected in cell lines with knockdown of ACSL5, ACLS6 and ACSL1. Lentivirus shRNA-mediated gene silencing of ACSL4 and ACSL3 in human pancreatic islets inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin release. ACSL4 and ACSL3 knockdown cells showed inhibition of ACSL enzyme activity more with arachidonate than with palmitate as a substrate, consistent with their preference for unsaturated fatty acids as substrates. ACSL4 knockdown changed the patterns of fatty acids in phosphatidylserines and phosphatidylethanolamines. The results show the involvement of ACLS4 and ACLS3 in insulin secretion. "

The aim of this study was to determine if a diet, appropriate for persons of most ages, reduces the excretion of sodium, urea, acid, and decreases mean urine osmolality while gaining acceptance by patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Twelve adults with ADPKD enrolled in a pre-post pilot feasibility study and served as their own controls. Individuals consumed their usual diet for one week then for four weeks followed an isocaloric diet lower in sodium and protein and higher in fruits, vegetables, and water. Three-day diet records and two 24-h urine samples were collected at baseline, week 2, and week 4 visits; blood pressure, weight, and serum were obtained at all three visits. A modified nutrition hassles questionnaire was completed on the last visit. During the dietary intervention, subjects (n = 11) consumed less sodium, protein, and dietary acid precursors 36%, 28%, and 99%, respectively, and increased fluid intake by 42%. Urinary sodium, urea, net acid excretion, osmoles, and osmolality decreased 20%, 28%, 20%, 37%, and 15%, respectively; volume increased 35%. Urine changes were in accord with the diet record. Ninety-one percent of participants reported that none of the hassles were worse than ""somewhat severe"", and most participants felt ""somewhat confident"" or ""very confident"" that they could manage the new diet. A majority of adult patients with ADPKD successfully prepared and followed a composite diet prescription with decreased sodium, protein, acid precursors, and increased fluid intake.

116,35475790,"Early experiences with different flavors play an important role in infant development, including food and taste acceptance. Flavors are already perceived in utero with the development of the taste and olfactory system and are passed on to the child through breast and bottle feeding. Therefore, the first 1000 days of life are considered a critical window for infant developmental programming. The objective of our study is to investigate, both in the prenatal and postnatal period, taste sensitivity, preferences, and dietary diversity of mother-infant pairs. The explorative study design will also report on the impact of these variables on body composition (BC) and biomarkers. In contrast to conventional methods, this study involves long-term follow-up data collection from mother-infant pairs; moreover, the integration of audiovisual tools for recording infants' expressions pertaining to taste stimuli is a novelty of this study. Considering these new methodological approaches, the study aims to assess taste-related data in conjunction with BC parameters like fat-free mass or fat mass, biomarkers, and nutritional intake in infants and children. Healthy pregnant women aged between 18 and 50 years (BMI≥18.5 kg/m Our cohort represents a homogenous group of healthy women with stringent exclusion criteria.

119,22749679,"Excess salt intake impacts on blood pressure (BP) and the pathogenetic mechanisms of atherosclerosis predisposing to stroke and other cardiovascular disorders. The influence of salt starts early in life. Two randomized controlled trials in newborn infants suggest a direct association between dietary sodium intake and BP since the first few months of life. Newborn infants display aversion to the salt taste to develop a ""preference"" for salt only at age 2-3 years, in part in relation to post-natal events: this preference might be associated with later development of hypertension. The amount of sodium to be retained by an infant for proper physiological growth is largely covered by breast feeding (or low sodium formula milk) in the first six months, and later on by the gradual implementation of complementary feeding, without the need for any added salt upon food preparation. Given the lack of dose-dependence data, reference nutrient intakes (RNI) or adequate intakes (AI) for sodium have been established by national health institutions in various countries. The U.K. RNI was set at 242 mg a day for infants 0-6 months with gradual increase to 0.5 g up until age 3. The U.S. AI is somewhat lower for age 0-6 months but larger for age 1-3 years. According to a recent report, the average sodium intake in U.S. children is close to the AI up to age 2 years, to become progressively greater exceeding the Institute of Medicine recommendation later on.

121,25659350,"All forms of diabetes share the common etiology of insufficient pancreatic β-cell function to meet peripheral insulin demand. In pancreatic β-cells, mitochondria serve to integrate the metabolism of exogenous nutrients into energy output, which ultimately leads to insulin release. As such, mitochondrial dysfunction underlies β-cell failure and the development of diabetes. Mitochondrial regulation of β-cell function occurs through many diverse pathways, including metabolic coupling, generation of reactive oxygen species, maintenance of mitochondrial mass, and through interaction with other cellular organelles. In this chapter, we will focus on the importance of enzymatic regulators of mitochondrial fuel metabolism and control of mitochondrial mass to pancreatic β-cell function, describing how defects in these pathways ultimately lead to diabetes. Furthermore, we will examine the factors responsible for mitochondrial biogenesis and degradation and their roles in the balance of mitochondrial mass in β-cells. Clarifying the causes of β-cell mitochondrial dysfunction may inform new approaches to treat the underlying etiologies of diabetes. "

123,25835281,"Obesity causes white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation and insulin resistance in some, but not all individuals. Here, we used a mouse model of early postnatal overfeeding to determine the role of neonatal nutrition in lifelong WAT inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. C57BL/6J mice were reared in small litters of 3 (SL) or normal litters of 7 pups (NL) and fed either regular chow or a 60% high fat diet (HFD) from 5 to 17 weeks. At weaning, SL mice did not develop WAT inflammation despite increased fat mass, although there was an up-regulation of WAT Arg1 and Tlr4 expression. On HFD, adult SL mice had greater inguinal fat mass compared to NL mice, however both groups showed similar increases in visceral fat depots and adipocyte hypertrophy. Despite the similar levels of visceral adiposity, SL-HFD mice displayed greater impairments in glucose homeostasis and more pronounced hepatic steatosis compared to NL-HFD mice. In addition, WAT from SL mice fed a HFD displayed greater crown-like structure formation, increased M1 macrophages, and higher cytokine gene expression. Together, these data suggest that early postnatal overnutrition may be a critical determinant of fatty liver and insulin resistance in obese adults by programming the inflammatory capacity of adipose tissue.

The incidence of hypertension in children is growing, although its connection with metabolic disorders and family history of hypertension has not been previously understood. To evaluate the relationship between a family history of hypertension and metabolic parameters (carbohydrate and lipid metabolism) and anthropometric measurements in children and adolescents. The study group consists of 40 children (mean age 13.6 years +/-2.7 years) with a positive family history of hypertension, and a comparative group of 44 children with a negative family history of hypertension. Anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, plasma insulin, glucose, homeostasis model assessment insulin resistants (HOMA IR), and lipid profiles were determined in all children. Body weight, BMI, WHR, and measurements of skinfolds did not differ significantly between the groups. Systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in the study group (108 vs. 100 Me mmgHg, p = 0.031) Significant differences were observed in the levels of glucose (80 vs. Me. 67 mg/dl, p < 0.001), and insulin (8.89 vs. Me. 5.34 microIU / ml, p = 0.024). The HOMA index showed values significantly higher in the study group (1.68 vs. 0.80 Me p = 0.007). Children with a positive family history of hypertension were characterized by insignificantly higher values of total cholesterol, TG, LDL-cholesterol, and lower HDL-cholesterol.

Additional novel variants have been recently detected in the population. The molecular and cellular effects of these previously unreported variants are still poorly understood and require further characterization. To address this problem, we have evaluated the various functions and biochemical consequences of six novel missense variants that lead to mild VLCAD deficiency. Marked deficiencies in fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and other mitochondrial defects were observed in cells carrying one of these six variants (c.541C>T, c.863T>G, c.895A>G, c.1238T>C, c.1276G>A, and c.1505T>A), including reductions in mitochondrial respiratory-chain function and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, and increased levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Intriguingly, higher apoptosis levels were found in cells carrying the mutant VLCAD under glucose-limited stress. Moreover, the stability of the mutant homodimer was disturbed, and major conformational changes in each mutant VLCAD structure were predicted by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The data presented here may provide valuable information for improving management of diagnosis and treatment of VLCAD deficiency and for a better understanding of the general molecular bases of disease variability.

131,34134142,"Transitional hypoglycemia in normal newborns occurs in the first 3 days of life and has clinical features consistent with hyperinsulinism. We found a lower threshold for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from freshly isolated embryonic day (E) 22 rat islets, which persisted into the first postnatal days. The threshold reached the adult level by postnatal day (P) 14. Culturing P14 islets also decreased the glucose threshold. Freshly isolated P1 rat islets had a lower threshold for insulin secretion in response to 2-aminobicyclo-(2, 2, 1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid, a nonmetabolizable leucine analog, and diminished insulin release in response to tolbutamide, an inhibitor of β-cell KATP channels. These findings suggested that decreased KATP channel function could be responsible for the lower glucose threshold for insulin secretion. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis did not reveal a lower expression of KATP subunit genes in E22 compared with P14 β cells. The investigation of electrophysiological characteristics of dispersed β cells showed that early neonatal and cultured cells had fewer functional KATP channels per unit membrane area. Our findings suggest that decreased surface density of KATP channels may contribute to the observed differences in glucose threshold for insulin release. "

We aimed to illustrate the potential function and molecular mechanism of exosomal microRNA-543 (miR-543) in the oncogenesis and development of OvCa. Differentially expressed microRNAs in exosomes derived from OvCa cell lines were identified by bioinformatic analysis and verified by RT-PCR. Cell proliferation ability was estimated by clonogenic and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assays in vitro and in vivo. Potential involved pathways and targets of exosomal miRNAs were analysed using DIANA and verified by pyrosequencing, glucose quantification, dual-luciferase reporter experiments, and functional rescue assays. Bioinformatic analysis identified miR-543 and its potential target genes involved in the cancer-associated proteoglycan pathway. The expression of miR-543 was significantly decreased in exosomes derived from OvCa cell lines, patient serum, and OvCa tissues, while the mRNA levels of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) were increased. Furthermore, the overexpression of miR-543 resulted in the suppression of OvCa cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, miR-543 was significantly negatively correlated with IGF2 in OvCa tissues in comparison with paracarcinoma tissues. Notably, upregulation of miR-543 led to increased cell supernatant glucose levels and suppressed cell growth, which was rescued by overexpression of IGF2. Exosomal miR-543 participates in the proteoglycan pathway to suppress cell proliferation by targeting IGF2 in OvCa. "

Despite recent advances in glucose sensors and insulin pump technology, only a minority of patients meet their glucose targets and face the risk of both acute and long-term complications, some of which are life-threatening. The JAK-STAT pathway is critical for the immune-mediated pancreatic beta cell destruction in T1D. Our pre-clinical data show that inhibitors of JAK1/JAK2 prevent diabetes and reverse newly diagnosed diabetes in the T1D non-obese diabetic mouse model. The goal of this study is to determine if the JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor baricitinib impairs type 1 diabetes autoimmunity and preserves beta cell function. This will be as a multicentre, two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial in individuals aged 10-30 years with recent-onset T1D. Eighty-three participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio within 100 days of diagnosis to receive either baricitinib 4mg/day or placebo for 48 weeks and then monitored for a further 48 weeks after stopping study drug. The primary outcome is the plasma C-peptide 2h area under the curve following ingestion of a mixed meal. Secondary outcomes include HbA1c, insulin dose, continuous glucose profile and adverse events. Mechanistic assessments will characterize general and diabetes-specific immune responses. This study will determine if baricitinib slows the progressive, immune-mediated loss of beta cell function that occurs after clinical presentation of T1D.

136,25437926,"The IV anesthetic, propofol, when administered as fat emulsion-based formulation (Diprivan) promotes insulin resistance, but the direct effects of propofol and its solvent, Intralipid, on cardiac insulin resistance are unknown. Hearts of healthy and type-2 diabetic rats (generated by fructose feeding) were aerobically perfused for 60 minutes with 10 μM propofol in the formulation of Diprivan or an equivalent concentration of its solvent Intralipid (25 μM) ± insulin (100 mU•L). Glucose uptake, glycolysis, and glycogen metabolism were measured using [H]glucose. Activation of Akt, GSK3β, AMPK, ERK1/2, p38MAPK, S6K1, JNK, protein kinase Cθ (PKCθ), and protein kinase CCβII (PKCβII) was determined using immunoblotting. GLUT4 trafficking and phosphorylations of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) at Ser307(h312), Ser1100(h1101), and Tyr608(hTyr612) were measured. Mass spectrometry was used to determine acylcarnitines, phospholipids, and sphingolipids. Diprivan and Intralipid reduced insulin-induced glucose uptake and redirected glucose to glycogen stores in diabetic hearts. Reduced glucose uptake was accompanied by lower GLUT4 trafficking to the sarcolemma. Diprivan and Intralipid inactivated GSK3β but activated AMPK and ERK1/2 in diabetic hearts. Only Diprivan increased phosphorylation of Akt(Ser473/Thr308) and translocated PKCθ and PKCβII to the sarcolemma in healthy hearts, whereas it activated S6K1 and p38MAPK and translocated PKCβII in diabetic hearts. Furthermore, only Diprivan phosphorylated IRS-1 at Ser1100(h1101) in healthy and diabetic hearts. JNK expression, phosphorylation of Ser307(h312) of IRS-1, and PKCθ expression and translocation were increased, whereas GLUT4 expression was reduced in insulin-treated diabetic hearts. Phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and C18-sphingolipids accumulated in Diprivan-perfused and Intralipid-perfused diabetic hearts. Propofol and Intralipid promote insulin resistance predominantly in type-2 diabetic hearts. "
137,31177907,"The mineralocorticoid aldosterone increases in plasma in healthy pregnancy along with renin and angiotensin II and plays a key role in the physiological plasma volume expansion. In mice, aldosterone contributes to an optimal fetal development by enhancing PlGF (placental growth factor) expression and trophoblast cell proliferation. In preeclampsia, there is coincident suppression of aldosterone and impaired placental development. We hypothesized that aldosterone independently contributes to placental and birth weight in humans, and high dietary sodium and low potassium intakes affect this relationship adversely. We analyzed 24-hour urine collections and plasma samples from gestational week 29 in a subsample of 569 pregnant women from the Odense Child Cohort-a Danish population-based longitudinal cohort study. Plasma and urinary aldosterone were measured by ELISA, sodium and potassium excretions by flame photometer. Predictive values of aldosterone levels and sodium and potassium intakes were assessed by multiple and Cox regression analyses. Primary outcomes were placental weight and birth weight. Secondary outcome was preeclampsia. Urinary aldosterone excretion at gestational week 29 independently contributed to placental and birth weights (adjusted β-coefficients [95% CI], 24.50 [9.66-39.35] and 9.59 [4.57-14.61], respectively). Aldosterone levels were not associated to preeclampsia incidence. Salt intake >6 g/d was associated with development of preeclampsia (hazard ratio [95% CI], 5.68 [1.51-21.36]). At gestational week 29, urinary aldosterone excretion is an independent predictor of placental and birth weights. High salt intake is a risk factor for preeclampsia. In perspective, suppression of aldosterone in pregnancy has adverse trophic effects. "
138,37828472,"Obesity and metabolic syndrome are observed more frequently in infertile women, and insulin resistance (IR) is closely related to them. However, there are no studies that have examined the association between different IR surrogates and female infertility, hence we investigated the potential association between them in the general population. This was a cross-sectional study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2013-2018). The association of different IR surrogates (HOMA-IR index, TyG index and TyG-BMI index) with female infertility was estimated by multivariable regression analysis. After adjusting for confounders, the HOMA-IR index and TyG index did not show an association with female infertility, while the TyG-BMI index was found to have a positive association with female infertility (OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.01; P < 0.0001), and the OR of the TyG-BMI group T3 (≥ 255.55) was significantly different compared to the group T1 (< 185.31) (OR = 3.02, 95% CI: 1.62, 5.60). Similar results were seen in most of the subgroup participants by stratified analysis (P-interaction > 0.05). However, different IR surrogates did not show variability in their ability to predict infertility [TyG-BMI: 0.68 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.74) vs. TyG: 0.62 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.68) vs. HOMA-IR: 0.65 (95% CI: 0.60, 0.71)]. Our result suggests that high levels of TyG-BMI index were positively associated with female infertility in US reproductive-aged females. "
139,27748912,"It has been reported that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) mediates multiple physiological and pathological processes. However, the occurrence and the pathogenic role of high glucose-induced EMT in retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE cells) is unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of high glucose on EMT in RPE cells. Cultured RPE cells were exposed to 25 mM D-glucose. A vector encoding the Snail gene and siRNA targeting Snail (Snail siRNA) were transfected into the cells to induce the overexpression or silencing of Snail, respectively. AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitors were used to block the activation of AKT and ERK, respectively. The levels of EMT markers, fibrogenic factors, phosphorylated ERK and phosphorylated AKT were determined by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining. Cell migration was evaluated by wound healing assay. Our results revealed that high glucose elevated the expression of the key EMT transcriptional factor, Snail, and that of other mesenchymal makers, and promoted cell migration. Moreover, the overexpression of Snail elevated the levels of fibronectin and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), whereas the silencing of Snail decreased the expression of fibronectin and CTGF induced by high glucose in the cells. Mechanistically, the AKT inhibitor (AKT inhibitor IV) and ERK inhibitor (U0126) significantly decreased the expression of Snail, as well as the levels of fibronectin and CTGF which were induced by high glucose. On the whole, and to the best of our knowedge, the present study is the first to demonstrate the upregulation of mesenchymal markers in RPE cells induced by high glucose, and suggest that mesenchymal transition may be involved in the pathological processes of retinal diseases.

140,32982968,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a metabolic disease characterized by obesity, insulin resistance, and the dysfunction of several key glucoregulatory organs. Among these organs, impaired liver function is recognized as one of the earliest contributors to impaired whole-body glucose homeostasis, with well-characterized hepatic insulin resistance resulting in elevated rates of hepatic glucose production (HGP) and fasting hyperglycemia. One portion of this review will provide an overview of how HGP is regulated during the fasted state in healthy humans and how this process becomes dysregulated in patients with T2D. Less well-appreciated is the liver's role in post-prandial glucose metabolism, where it takes up and metabolizes one-third of orally ingested glucose. An abundance of literature has shown that the process of hepatic glucose uptake is impaired in patients with T2D, thereby contributing to glucose intolerance. A second portion of this review will outline how hepatic glucose uptake is regulated during the post-prandial state, and how it becomes dysfunctional in patients with T2D. Finally, it is well-known that exercise training has an insulin-sensitizing effect on the liver, which contributes to improved whole-body glucose metabolism in patients with T2D, thereby making it a cornerstone in the management of the disease. To this end, the impact of exercise on hepatic glucose metabolism will be thoroughly discussed, referencing key findings in the literature. At the same time, sources of heterogeneity that contribute to inconsistent findings in the field will be pointed out, as will important topics for future investigation. "
141,37279930,"When mammals are exposed to a warm environment, overheating is prevented by activation of ""warm-responsive"" neurons (WRNs) in the hypothalamic preoptic area (POA) that reduce thermogenesis while promoting heat dissipation. Heat exposure also impairs glucose tolerance, but whether this also results from activation of POA WRNs is unknown. To address this question, we sought in the current work to determine if glucose intolerance induced by heat exposure can be attributed to activation of a specific subset of WRNs that express pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (ie, POAPacap neurons). We report that when mice are exposed to an ambient temperature sufficiently warm to activate POAPacap neurons, the expected reduction of energy expenditure is associated with glucose intolerance, and that these responses are recapitulated by chemogenetic POAPacap neuron activation. Because heat-induced glucose intolerance was not blocked by chemogenetic inhibition of POAPacap neurons, we conclude that POAPacap neuron activation is sufficient, but not required, to explain the impairment of glucose tolerance elicited by heat exposure.

142,36094907,"Fetal growth restriction (FGR) significantly contributes to neonatal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Currently, there are no effective treatment options for FGR during pregnancy. We have developed a nanoparticle gene therapy targeting the placenta to increase expression of human insulin-like growth factor 1 (hIGF1) to correct fetal growth trajectories. Using the maternal nutrient restriction guinea pig model of FGR, an ultrasound-guided, intraplacental injection of nonviral, polymer-based hIGF1 nanoparticle containing plasmid with the hIGF1 gene and placenta-specific Cyp19a1 promotor was administered at mid-pregnancy. Sustained hIGF1 expression was confirmed in the placenta 5 days after treatment. Whilst increased hIGF1 did not change fetal weight, circulating fetal glucose concentration were 33%-67% higher. This was associated with increased expression of glucose and amino acid transporters in the placenta. Additionally, hIGF1 nanoparticle treatment increased the fetal capillary volume density in the placenta, and reduced interhaemal distance between maternal and fetal circulation. Overall, our findings, that trophoblast-specific increased expression of hIGF1 results in changes to glucose transporter expression and increases fetal glucose concentrations within a short time period, highlights the translational potential this treatment could have in correcting impaired placental nutrient transport in human pregnancies complicated by FGR.

144,39064806,"Glucose is the primary energy source for most mammalian cells and its transport is affected by a family of facilitative glucose transporters (GLUTs) encoded by the SLC2 gene. GLUT1 and GLUT3, highly expressed isoforms in the blood-brain barrier and neuronal membranes, respectively, are associated with multiple neurodevelopmental disorders including epilepsy, dyslexia, ADHD, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Dietary therapies, such as the ketogenic diet, are widely accepted treatments for patients with the GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, while ameliorating certain symptoms associated with GLUT3 deficiency in animal models. A ketogenic diet, high-fat diet, and calorie/energy restriction during prenatal and postnatal stages can also alter the placental and brain GLUTs expression with long-term consequences on neurobehavior. This review focuses primarily on the role of diet/energy perturbations upon GLUT isoform-mediated emergence of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. "
145,25958964,"Losing ≥ 5% of initial weight improves quality of life and risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in obese individuals. Lifestyle modification, the cornerstone of weight reduction, may be complemented by pharmacotherapy. In 2012, the FDA approved the combination of phentermine and topiramate extended release (ER) for chronic weight management, as an adjunct to lifestyle modification. This review examines the safety and efficacy of phentermine-topiramate ER, as determined by randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A preliminary study confirmed the benefit of combining the two medications for improving weight loss and reducing adverse effects, as compared to using equivalent-dose monotherapy alone. Across RCTs, groups prescribed phentermine 15 mg/topiramate ER 92 mg lost an average of 10% of initial weight, ∼ 8% more than placebo and 2% more than phentermine 7.5 mg/topiramate 46 mg. Weight loss reduced the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and improved CVD risk factors. Phentermine-topiramate ER, however, was associated with increased heart rate, the clinical significance of which is being investigated in an FDA-required CVD outcomes study. The medication also must be used with caution in women of child-bearing age because of an increased risk to infants of oral cleft. "

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Recent studies in metabolic dysfunction have extended this beyond simply elevated cholesterol and triglycerides levels and have identified a key role for lipid metabolism. For example, altered phospholipid metabolism has now become central in the pathogenesis of metabolic disease. In this review, we discuss the association between insulin sensitivity and phospholipid metabolism and highlight the most significant discoveries generated over the last several decades. Finally, we summarize the current knowledge surrounding the molecular mechanisms related to phospholipids and insulin resistance and provide new insight for future research into their relationship. "
147,37640940,"Music for neonatal pain has not been exclusively studied in term neonates in a well-designed trial compared to the standard of care. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of music intervention as an adjuvant in relieving acute pain in term newborns undergoing minor painful procedures. This randomized, controlled, blinded trial included any term neonate undergoing heel prick. Both control and intervention groups received oral sucrose 2 min before heel prick. Intervention group was exposed to 'Bedtime Mozart' lullaby recorded music via bedside speakers. Pain was measured using Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) at 1-min intervals. Investigators were blinded using noise-canceling headphones that played random music. A total of 100 neonates were enrolled. Mean gestational age was 39.2 weeks, and mean duration of the procedure was 113 s. Music group was found to have significantly lower pain scores [OR = 0.42 (0.31, 0.56), p < 0.001]. Baseline NIPS scores were similar across groups and there was no interaction effect between groups and time. When NIPS were categorized as pain and no pain, there continued to be statistically significant lower NIPS scores in the music group (p < 0.001). Recorded music, in addition to sucrose, is efficacious in reducing pain, encouraging its use in term neonates. Recorded music effectively reduces pain induced by minor procedures in term neonates. Clinical studies have shown that live and recorded music induces changes in vital signs and pain scores in the NICU's predominantly preterm population. Most of these studies were also conducted in the white ethnic population. Our study objectively proves reduction in pain scores by using recorded music in a randomized, controlled, blinded study of predominantly non-white, term neonates. Recorded music is effective in reducing acute pain in term neonates and can be widely used even in low-resource nurseries. "

149,24100676,"Ghrelin is a multifaceted gut hormone that activates its receptor, growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R). Ghrelin's hallmark functions are its stimulatory effects on growth hormone release, food intake and fat deposition. Ghrelin is famously known as the 'hunger hormone'. However, ample recent literature indicates that the functions of ghrelin go well beyond its role as an orexigenic signal. Here, we have reviewed some of the most recent findings on ghrelin and its signalling in animals and humans. Ghrelin regulates glucose homeostasis by inhibiting insulin secretion and regulating gluconeogenesis/glycogenolysis. Ghrelin signalling decreases thermogenesis to regulate energy expenditure. Ghrelin improves the survival prognosis of myocardial infarction by reducing sympathetic nerve activity. Ghrelin prevents muscle atrophy by inducing muscle differentiation and fusion. Ghrelin regulates bone formation and metabolism by modulating proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts. In addition to ghrelin's effects on appetite and adiposity, ghrelin signalling also plays crucial roles in glucose and energy homeostasis, cardioprotection, muscle atrophy and bone metabolism. These multifaceted roles of ghrelin make ghrelin and GHS-R highly attractive targets for drug development. Ghrelin mimetics may be used to treat heart diseases, muscular dystrophy/sarcopenia and osteoporosis; GHS-R antagonists may be used to treat obesity and insulin resistance. "
150,9356284,"Olestra, a dietary fat substitute, was recently made available to consumers in savory snacks in three cities. Early reports of gastrointestinal complaints attributed to olestra attracted media coverage and fostered confusion among physicians and consumers about the nature of olestra and its effects on the digestive system. We reviewed all published studies of olestra's gastrointestinal effects and all relevant unpublished studies submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. Each study was analyzed by a group of expert gastroenterologists and epidemiologists. The symptoms reported with olestra ingestion are similar to those reported with ingestion of fiber and sorbitol, although the mechanisms involved in changing stool characteristics differ among these food additives. Olestra's effects on stool habit and characteristics are due to its presence in the stool. Large amounts are more likely to induce gastrointestinal symptoms than small amounts. There is no evidence that olestra induces pathological change in bowel function: there is no increased fluid or electrolyte nor is there altered gastrointestinal motility or microflora. Olestra and triglyceride ingestion resulted in a similar frequency of symptoms in normal adults and children and in people with chronic inflammatory bowel disease in remission. Olestra traverses the digestive tract intact to become a stool additive. Some subjects develop a change in bowel habit and stool characteristics due to the presence of more olestra in the stool. These changes resemble those associated with ingestion of sorbitol and fiber. "

152,34087423,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a common group of neurodevelopmental disorders which causes significant alterations in social and communication skills along with repetitive behavior and limited interests. The physiological understanding of ASD is ambiguous. Several reports suggested that environmental, genetic and epigenetic changes, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic alterations orchestrate the pathological outcomes of ASD. A recent report from Saudi Arabia found a mutation in X-chromosomal housekeeping glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) gene in two male ASD patients. Although, the involvement of G6PD-deficiency in the pathogenesis of ASD is poorly understood. Several reports suggested that G6PD deficiency impedes cellular detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which may result in neuronal damage and neuroinflammation. A deficiency of G6PD in newborn children may play a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of ASD. In this review, we will discuss the implications of G6PD deficiency in pathogenesis, male biasness and theranostics in ASD patients. "
153,32341129,"In 1913, eccentric French composer Erik Satie wrote a fragmentary, diary-like essay where he depicted a strikingly rigid diet consisting solely of white foods: eggs, sugar, coconuts, rice, cream cheese, fuchsia juice and so on. Satie's brief essay has later been used as one of many puzzle pieces in attempts to retrospectively diagnose him with autism spectrum disorder. With Satie's white meal as a starting point, this paper explores colour-based food preferences and selective eating in clinical and non-clinical populations, with a special focus on autism spectrum disorder and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). General colour preferences and their causes as well as the impact of colour on taste and food identification are also explored. Selective eating during childhood is immensely common and does not generally lead to disordered eating in the long run, although subgroups may experience rigidity around food of a more enduring nature. Problems related to eating were repeatedly described in Kanner's original 1943 autism case series and continue to be common in autism. Most studies on eating and sensory sensitivity in autism show that the texture and consistency of the food are the most common factors behind selective eating. In contrast, colour-based food preferences appear to be relatively rare, although numerous anecdotal reports exist. Foods that are white or colourless may be particularly appealing or tolerable for individuals with sensory hypersensitivity, which can occur in autism or ARFID. Ultimately, in the case of Erik Satie, this paper concludes that his description of a strictly white diet should not be read as an autobiographical account but rather as an ironic take on contemporary symbolist literature, with the famously decadent all-black dinner party in French novelist Joris-Karl Huysmans'  "

155,23390127,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in adults and children. A number of genetic and environmental factors are known to predispose individuals to NAFLD. Certain dietary sugars, particularly fructose, are suspected to contribute to the development of NAFLD and its progression. The increasing quantity of fructose in the diet comes from sugar additives (most commonly sucrose and high fructose corn syrup) in beverages and processed foods. Substantial links have been demonstrated between increased fructose consumption and obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Growing evidence suggests that fructose contributes to the development and severity of NAFLD. In human studies, fructose is associated with increasing hepatic fat, inflammation, and possibly fibrosis. Whether fructose alone can cause NAFLD or if it serves only as a contributor when consumed excessively in the setting of insulin resistance, positive energy balance, and sedentary lifestyle is unknown. Sufficient evidence exists to support clinical recommendations that fructose intake be limited through decreasing foods and drinks high in added (fructose-containing) sugars. "
156,31964939,"Streptococcus thermophilus ASCC 1275 has two chain length determining genes - epsC and epsD- in its eps gene cluster, and produces two times more EPS in sucrose medium than that in glucose and lactose. Hence, we investigated the influence of sugars (glucose, sucrose and lactose), at log phase (5 h) and stationary phase (10 h), on the global proteomics of S. thermophilus 1275 to understand the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) during EPS production using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomic analysis. Among 98 DEPs in sucrose medium, most of them were mapped into EPS biosynthesis pathway and other related metabolisms. There was an upregulation of several proteins involved in sugar transport (phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) phosphotransferase system), EPS assembly (epsG1D) and amino acid metabolism (methionine, cysteine/arginine metabolism) in sucrose medium. This study showed that increased EPS production in S. thermophilus 1275 requires a well-co-ordinated regulation of pathway involved in both EPS assembly and amino acid metabolism along with the availability of sugars. Thus, it provided valuable insights into the biosynthesis and regulation of EPS in S. thermophilus 1275, and potential gene targets for understanding high-EPS strains. "
157,36170671,"Transcriptional and functional cellular specialization has been described for insulin-secreting β-cells of the endocrine pancreas. However, it is not clear whether β-cell heterogeneity is stable or reflects dynamic cellular states. We investigated the temporal kinetics of endogenous insulin gene activity using live cell imaging, with complementary experiments using FACS and single-cell RNA sequencing, in β-cells from Ins2GFP knockin mice. In vivo staining and FACS analysis of islets from Ins2GFP mice confirmed that at a given moment, ∼25% of β-cells exhibited significantly higher activity at the evolutionarily conserved insulin gene, Ins2. Live cell imaging over days captured Ins2 gene activity dynamics in single β-cells. Autocorrelation analysis revealed a subset of oscillating cells, with mean oscillation periods of 17 h. Increased glucose concentrations stimulated more cells to oscillate and resulted in higher average Ins2 gene activity per cell. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed that Ins2(GFP)HIGH β-cells were enriched for markers of β-cell maturity. Ins2(GFP)HIGH β-cells were also significantly less viable at all glucose concentrations and in the context of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the heterogeneity of insulin production, observed in mouse and human β-cells, can be accounted for by dynamic states of insulin gene activity. "
158,24048086,"Recent therapies directed at proximal targets within cystic fibrosis (CF) pathophysiology hold potential to modulate disease. This review highlights recent clinical trials and future therapies focused on these early steps of disease. Recent approval of a CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein modulator, ivacaftor (Kalydeco), has ignited a wave of investigations for other modulators directed at CFTR mutation classes. Gene replacement therapy continues to be pursued at a slower pace in early phase clinical trials. Airway surface liquid strategies such as dry-powder mannitol and alternate ion channel regulation are discussed as genotype-independent methods of early modulation. The breadth of therapies for early targets of CF holds considerable hope to modify the natural history of this disease. Ongoing focus to develop novel markers of early disease state is paramount. The progress of drug development requires concurrent attention on a spectrum of targets to achieve maximal impact. "
159,23895953,"Many miRNAs are highly expressed in spatiotemporal and precise tissue-specific patterns in development. Thus it is necessary to examine their expression pattern in mouse embryos. However, embryos from one pregnant mouse are more than enough for expression analysis such as RT-qPCR, which results in reluctant disposal of remaining embryos. Due to the limitation of short sampling time, it is vitally important to quickly preserve samples to ensure the RNA quality. Thus, it is necessary to develop appropriate methods to fix samples in advance. In this study, two fixatives [methanol/DMSO (4:1) and paraformaldehyde] were applied for embryo (12.5 dpc) fixation and two preservatives (methanol and 30% sucrose) were used for fixed embryo preservation. After storage for one month, the skin, skeletal muscle and brain tissues were dissected from the fixed and unembedded embryos. Total RNAs were extracted by TRIzol® reagent and measured by a spectrophotometer, then were subjected to amplify Actb, Hprt, Gapdh, Rnu6, Snord68 and miR-206-3p by RT-qPCR. Embryos fixed in methanol/DMSO and preserved in 100% methanol at -20°C were able to yield at least 349 bp amplifiable RNA. Although paraformaldehyde fixation and 30% sucrose preservation method only yielded amplicons less than 156 bp, it showed a remarkable ability in preserving small RNAs. Snord68 was expressed stably across skin, skeletal muscle and brain tissues like Rnu6, making its possibility as an internal control for qPCR data normalization. Using Snord68 and/or Rnu6 as internal control, we found that the miR-206-3p expression level in skin was about one quarter of its highest level in the skeletal muscle. Therefore, the techniques in this study would be useful for us to reasonably utilize and preserve precious samples. "
160,19193815,"Starch is the major source of food glucose and its digestion requires small intestinal alpha-glucosidic activities provided by the 2 soluble amylases and 4 enzymes bound to the mucosal surface of enterocytes. Two of these mucosal activities are associated with sucrase-isomaltase complex, while another 2 are named maltase-glucoamylase (Mgam) in mice. Because the role of Mgam in alpha-glucogenic digestion of starch is not well understood, the Mgam gene was ablated in mice to determine its role in the digestion of diets with a high content of normal corn starch (CS) and resulting glucose homeostasis. Four days of unrestricted ingestion of CS increased intestinal alpha-glucosidic activities in wild-type (WT) mice but did not affect the activities of Mgam-null mice. The blood glucose responses to CS ingestion did not differ between null and WT mice; however, insulinemic responses elicited in WT mice by CS consumption were undetectable in null mice. Studies of the metabolic route followed by glucose derived from intestinal digestion of (13)C-labeled and amylase-predigested algal starch performed by gastric infusion showed that, in null mice, the capacity for starch digestion and its contribution to blood glucose was reduced by 40% compared with WT mice. The reduced alpha-glucogenesis of null mice was most probably compensated for by increased hepatic gluconeogenesis, maintaining prandial glucose concentration and total flux at levels comparable to those of WT mice. In conclusion, mucosal alpha-glucogenic activity of Mgam plays a crucial role in the regulation of prandial glucose homeostasis. "
161,28955049,"Hypertrophy is a prominent feature of damaged podocytes in diabetic kidney disease (DKD). mTORC1 hyperactivation leads to podocyte hypertrophy, but the detailed mechanism of how mTORC1 activation occurs under pathological conditions is not completely known. Moreover, reduced nephrin tyrosine phosphorylation has been observed in podocytes under pathological conditions, but the molecular mechanism linking nephrin phosphorylation and pathology is unclear so far. In this study, we observed a significant increase in C1-Ten level in diabetic kidney and in high glucose-induced damaged podocytes. C1-Ten acts as a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) at the nephrin-PI3K binding site and renders PI3K for IRS-1, thereby activating mTORC1. Furthermore, C1-Ten causes podocyte hypertrophy and proteinuria by increasing mTORC1 activity in vitro and in vivo. These findings demonstrate the relationship between nephrin dephosphorylation and the mTORC1 pathway, mediated by C1-Ten PTPase activity. We suggest that C1-Ten contributes to the pathogenesis of DKD by inducing podocyte hypertrophy under high glucose conditions. "
162,22338071,"Improvement of glucose metabolism after bariatric surgery appears to be from the composite effect of the alterations in multiple circulating gut hormone concentrations. However, their individual effect on glucose metabolism during different conditions is not clear. The objective of this study was to determine whether ghrelin has an impact on glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and insulin sensitivity (using a mice model). Rate of appearance of glucose, glycogenolysis, and gluconeogenesis were measured in wild-type (WT), ghrelin knockout (ghrelin(-/-)), and growth hormone secretagogue receptor knockout (Ghsr(-/-)) mice in the postabsorptive state. The physiological nature of the fasting condition was ascertained by a short-term fast commenced immediately at the end of the dark cycle. Concentrations of glucose and insulin were measured, and insulin resistance and hepatic insulin sensitivity were calculated. Glucose concentrations were not different among the groups during the food-deprived period. However, plasma insulin concentrations were lower in the ghrelin(-/-) and Ghsr(-/-) than WT mice. The rates of gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and indexes of insulin sensitivity were higher in the ghrelin(-/-) and Ghsr(-/-) than WT mice during the postabsorptive state. Insulin receptor substrate 1 and glucose transporter 2 gene expressions in hepatic tissues of the ghrelin(-/-) and Ghsr(-/-) were higher compared with that in WT mice. This study demonstrates that gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis are increased and insulin sensitivity is improved by the ablation of the ghrelin or growth hormone secretagogue receptor in mice. "
163,12375680,"The aim of this article was to review the most current animal models for intrauterine growth restriction. The databases of MEDLINE and Pubmed were searched for articles published between 1969 and 2001. Additional sources included abstract proceedings and relevant reference lists of articles identified by database review. Key words included intrauterine growth retardation, small for gestational age, animal models and glucose metabolism. The inclusion criteria used to select studies included animal models of intrauterine growth retardation in which glucose metabolism was assessed after birth. A variety of physiological and metabolic variables regulate fetal growth, and alteration of these variables can result in fetal growth restriction. Fetal growth restriction is secondary to initiation of fetal adaptation measures in response to inadequate supply of oxygen and nutrients. Several animal models have led to a greater understanding of the pathophysiology and consequences of intrauterine growth restriction. These observations are comparable to those observed in humans born small for gestational age, and are of interest because of the known association between poor fetal growth and development of glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus later in life. Experimental manipulations have apparently altered a number of metabolic and physiological variables, but the pattern of alterations seems to vary with the procedure employed. This allows only a preliminary conclusion to be drawn at best. Either the laboratory procedures vitiate the natural process under study, or the process itself is variable with respect to the triggering mechanism. As yet, we cannot tell which. "
164,31246177,"Decreased forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) activity induces hyperlipidemia and increased PPARγ, leading to hyperlipidemia in association with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In the liver, aging and comorbidities such as hyperlipidemia and diabetes significantly influence a wide variety of steatosis, but the underlying mechanisms are complex and remain elusive.To establish the modulatory role of FoxO1 and the functional consequences of its altered interaction with PPARγ in the present study, we utilized a cell culture system, aged rats and diabetic db/db mice.We found that, under ER stress, FoxO1 induces PPARγ-mediated lipid accumulation in aged rat livers. Our data showed that the FoxO1-induced hepatic lipid accumulation was negatively regulated by Akt signaling. PPARγ, a key lipogenesis transcription factor, was increased in aged liver, resulting in lipid accumulation via hepatic ER stress under hyperglycemic conditions. We further demonstrated that loss of FoxO1 causes a decline in PPARγ expression and reduces lipid accumulation. In addition, the interaction between FoxO1 and PPARγ was shown to induce hepatic steatosis in aging and db/db mice.We provide evidence that, in aged rats, FoxO1 interaction with PPARγ promotes hepatic steatosis, due to hyperglycemia-induced ER stress, which causes an impairment in Akt signaling, such in aging-related diabetes.

165,25634129,"Adiponectin exerts an antidiabetic function through the adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2). The mechanism regulating the expression of adiponectin receptors remains to be elucidated. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that microRNA (miR)‑218 targets the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the AdipoR2 mRNA. The present study aimed to investigate whether miR-218 regulated the expression of AdipoR2 using immunoblotting, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and luciferase assays. The protein level and the mRNA level of AdipoR2 were reduced when miR‑218 was expressed in HepG2 cells. Additionally, overexpression of miR‑218 repressed the activity of a luciferase reporter containing the 3'UTR of AdipoR2. Furthermore, the present study aimed to determine whether miR-218 regulated glucose metabolism through detecting signaling pathways and glucose uptake. The phosphorylation of AMP‑activated protein kinase and p38 mitogen‑activated protein kinase was reduced in miR‑218‑expressing cells. In addition, miR‑218 inhibited adiponectin‑induced glucose uptake. The present results suggested that miR‑218 targets AdipoR2 to inhibit adiponectin signaling. "
166,25520214,"To investigate whether orally applied glucose reduces pain response during oropharyngeal suctioning in preterm infants with a birth weight >1500 g, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial on 32 preterm infants undergoing oropharyngeal suctioning while on nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) score was assessed and compared in a cross-over design to investigate whether there was a significant difference in the patients' pain response. The mean PIPP score during oropharyngeal suctioning after placebo was 8.6 (KI 7.8-9.4). After glucose administration, the mean PIPP score was 8.0 (KI 7.1-8.9). Comparison of the treatment effects reached no statistic significance (p = 0.23). During the oral study drug administration during nasal CPAP, we observed 47 adverse events, but none necessitated therapeutic intervention and none was classified as serious. In our study, late preterm infants in the first days of life did not benefit significantly from analgesia with glucose during oropharyngeal suctioning. The oral administration of glucose under nasal CPAP led to no serious adverse events. "
167,12454850,"Animal studies have shown that more than half of the dietary protein intake is used by the gut and that a large proportion of this utilization is devoted to (glyco-)protein synthesis. Recycling of these secretions may play a critical role in the regulation of overall dietary amino acid bioavailability. Four piglets (age 32 days, 8-10 kg) bearing portal, arterial, and duodenal catheters and a portal flow probe were infused with a complete diet via the duodenum for 12 hours, followed by 12 hours of fasting. The portal balance of glucose and amino acids was measured throughout the 24-hour period. The animals also received duodenal and intravenous infusions of different lysine and threonine tracers. Measurements of intestinal tracer utilization and reappearance in the portal blood were used to calculate intestinal amino acid utilization and recycling. From 0 to 6 hours, one third of the protein intake appeared in the portal blood. As feeding continued, the portal glucose balance (60% of intake) was constant, but the net amino acid portal balance became progressively more positive. Significant net amino acid absorption continued for at least 6 hours after the cessation of feeding. Over 24 hours, 52% of the dietary protein intake appeared in the circulation and one third of this derived from recycled intestinal secretions. Intestinal recycling of amino acids contributes significantly to their systemic availability and may be a critical factor in amino acid nutrition. "
168,37690115,"Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSDIa) is an inborn metabolic disorder characterized by impaired endogenous glucose production (EGP). Monitoring of patients with GSDIa is prioritized because of ongoing treatment developments. Stable isotope tracers may enable reliable EGP monitoring. The aim of this study was to prospectively assess the rate of appearance of endogenous glucose into the bloodstream (Ra) in patients with GSDIa after a single oral D-[6,6-2H2]-glucose dose. Ten adult patients with GSDIa and 10 age-, sex-, and body mass index-matched healthy volunteers (HVs) were enrolled. For each participant, 3 oral glucose tracer tests were performed: (1) preprandial/fasted, (2) postprandial, and (3) randomly fed states. Dried blood spots were collected before D-[6,6-2H2]-glucose administration and 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75, 90, and 120 minutes thereafter. Glucose Ra in fasted HVs was consistent with previously reported data. The time-averaged glucose Ra was significantly higher in (1) preprandial/fasted patients with GSDIa than HV and (2) postprandial HV compared with fasted HV(P < .05). A progressive decrease in glucose Ra was observed in preprandial/fasted patients with GSDIa; the change in glucose Ra time-course was directly correlated with the change in capillary glucose (P < .05). This is the first study to quantify glucose Ra in patients with GSDIa using oral D-[6,6-2H2] glucose. The test can reliably estimate EGP under conditions in which fasting tolerance is unaffected but does not discriminate between relative contributions of EGP (eg, liver, kidney) and exogenous sources (eg, dietary cornstarch). Future application is warranted for longitudinal monitoring after novel genome based treatments in patients with GSDIa in whom nocturnal dietary management can be discontinued. "
169,18497885,"Excessive production of triglyceride-rich VLDL is attributable to hypertriglyceridemia. VLDL production is facilitated by microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) in a rate-limiting step that is regulated by insulin. To characterize the underlying mechanism, we studied hepatic MTP regulation by forkhead box O1 (FoxO1), a transcription factor that plays a key role in hepatic insulin signaling. In HepG2 cells, MTP expression was induced by FoxO1 and inhibited by exposure to insulin. This effect correlated with the ability of FoxO1 to bind and stimulate MTP promoter activity. Deletion or mutation of the FoxO1 target site within the MTP promoter disabled FoxO1 binding and resulted in abolition of insulin-dependent regulation of MTP expression. We generated mice that expressed a constitutively active FoxO1 transgene and found that increased FoxO1 activity was associated with enhanced MTP expression, augmented VLDL production, and elevated plasma triglyceride levels. In contrast, RNAi-mediated silencing of hepatic FoxO1 was associated with reduced MTP and VLDL production in adult mice. Furthermore, we found that hepatic FoxO1 abundance and MTP production were increased in mice with abnormal triglyceride metabolism. These data suggest that FoxO1 mediates insulin regulation of MTP production and that augmented MTP levels may be a causative factor for VLDL overproduction and hypertriglyceridemia in diabetes. "
170,17968588,"Perturbing CAX1, an Arabidopsis vacuolar H+/Ca2+ antiporter, and the related vacuolar transporter CAX3, has been previously shown to cause severe growth defects; however, the specific function of CAX3 has remained elusive. Here, we describe plant phenotypes that are shared among cax1 and cax3 including an increased sensitivity to both abscisic acid (ABA) and sugar during germination, and an increased tolerance to ethylene during early seedling development. We have also identified phenotypes unique to cax3, namely salt, lithium and low pH sensitivity. We used biochemical measurements to ascribe these cax3 sensitivities to a reduction in vacuolar H+/Ca2+ transport during salt stress and decreased plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity. These findings catalog an array of CAX phenotypes and assign a specific role for CAX3 in response to salt tolerance. "
171,38054665,"The gold standard for the measurement of insulin secretion is the hyperglycemic clamp and for insulin sensitivity the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, respectively. A number of surrogate indices, derived from plasma glucose and insulin levels at a fasting state or after oral glucose load, have been proposed to estimate β-cell response, and the ability of β-cells to compensate for changes of insulin sensitivity by modulating insulin secretion (disposition index). Starting from the current recommendations for the annual screening of glucose dysregulation in patients with transfusion dependent β-thalassemia (β-TDT), this article summarizes the most frequently used indirect indices of insulin secretion and resistance derived from the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and discusses the strengths and weaknesses of selected indices and the basic concepts underlying each method for the appropriate evaluation of glucose regulation. Basal indices for β-cell function and insulin sensitivity, albeit simple and cheap, have limited usefulness due to a high coefficient variation and the lack of data about response to glucose load. Therefore, measurement of indices during an OGTT, despite being costly and time-consuming, is suggested since it can detect, even subtle, dynamic changes in insulin secretion and glucose handling. In patients with β-TDT, the indices derived from OGTT may offer an additional factor to evaluate the efficiency of iron chelation therapy and detect patients who may need intensification of iron chelation therapy and/or pharmacological intervention.

172,29967796,"Hyperglycemia is one of the main causes of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) characterized by thickening of the vascular basement membrane. Laminin alpha 1 (LAMA1) is a primary component of laminin, a major protein constituent of the basement membrane. In this study, we investigated the role of LAMA1 in the development of PDR. Retinal choroidal vascular endothelial cells (RF/6A line) were exposed to glucose at different concentrations (5 mM, 15 mM, 25 mM, and 35 mM) and analyzed for cell growth, migration, proliferation, and adhesion. LAMA1 expression was examined 24 and 48 h following glucose treatment using Western blotting, RT-PCR, and immunofluorescence. The results showed that the proliferation, migration, and adhesion of RF/6A cells were increased by high glucose, whereas LAMA1 expression was slightly higher at 15 mM but decreased at 25 mM and 35 mM glucose compared to control. Thus, the changes in the biological behavior of high glucose-exposed retinal vascular endothelial cells correspond to variations in LAMA1 expression, indicating a possibility for LAMA1 involvement in PDR development. Our findings suggest that LAMA1 may play a role in PDR and, thus, may serve as a potential target for DR diagnosis and/or treatment. "
173,25958986,"Individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) are commonly restricted to 60-75% of height-appropriate calorie intake because they rapidly become obese on a normal diet. This study measured changes in energy expenditure, glucose and lipid homeostasis, and metabolic flexibility in response to a meal in PWS adults. 11 adults with PWS were compared with 12 adiposity-matched and 10 lean subjects. Indirect calorimetry was conducted at baseline and 210 min after a standardized 600 kCal breakfast to assess energy expenditure and substrate utilization. Circulating glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, nonesterified fatty acids, and triglycerides were measured up to 240 min. Insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion rate were assessed by HOMA-IR and C-peptide deconvolution, respectively. Body composition was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The PWS group had lower lean mass than the obesity control group. Corrected for lean mass, there were no differences between the PWS and obesity groups in resting metabolic rate or metabolic flexibility. Total and abdominal fat mass, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion rate were also similar between these groups. This study did not detect an intrinsic metabolic defect in individuals with PWS. Rather, lower lean mass, combined with lower physical activity, may contribute to weight gain on an apparent weight-maintenance diet. "
174,22211889,"Studies have suggested that manipulations of the central melanocortin circuitry by pharmacological agents produce robust effects on the regulation of body weight and glucose homeostasis. In this review, we discuss recent findings from genetic mouse models that have further established the physiological relevance of this circuitry in the context of glucose and energy balance. In addition, we will discuss distinct neuronal populations that respond to central melanocortins to regulate food intake, energy expenditure, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion, respectively. Finally, multiple hormonal and neural cues (e.g., leptin, estrogen, and serotonin) that use the melanocortin systems to regulate energy and glucose homeostasis will be reviewed. These findings suggest that targeting the specific branches of melanocortin circuits may be potential avenues to combat the current obesity and diabetes epidemics. "
175,16631612,"Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, links glycolysis to the Krebs cycle, and plays an important role in glucose metabolism and insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells. In beta cells from obese and Type 2 diabetic animals, PDH activity is significantly reduced. PDH is negatively regulated by multiple pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) isotypes (PDK subtypes 1-4). However, we do not know whether fatty acids or high glucose modulate PDKs in islets. To test this we determined PDH and PDK activities and PDK gene and protein expression in C57BL/6 mouse islets. Both high palmitate and high glucose reduced active PDH activity and increased PDK activity. The gene and protein for PDK3 were not expressed in islets. Palmitate up-regulated mRNA expression of PDK1 (2.9-fold), PDK2 (1.9-fold), and PDK4 (3.1-fold). High glucose increased PDK1 (1.8-fold) and PDK2 (2.7-fold) mRNA expression but reduced PDK4 mRNA expression by 40 percent in cultured islets. Changed PDK expression was confirmed by Western blotting. These results demonstrate that in islet cells both fat and glucose regulate PDK gene and protein expression and indicate that hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia contribute to the decline in diabetic islet PDH activity by increasing mRNA and protein expression of PDK.

176,14608101,"This paper reviews the evidence from recent studies in young piglets to examine the hypothesis that glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) is a physiologically relevant hormonal signal linked to the intestinal adaptation associated with enteral nutrition in neonates. Observations that support the hypothesis include, 1) the GLP-2 secretory response to enteral nutrition is functional as early as late gestation, 2) parallel changes in intestinal growth and circulating GLP-2 occur in response to the quantity and composition of enteral nutrition after birth, and 3) the acute temporal changes in intestinal metabolism and circulating GLP-2 concentrations in response to enteral nutrition are generally coincident. In contrast, however, the lack of intestinal trophic responses to both pharmacological GLP-2 concentrations in the fetus and weanling pigs, and to physiological GLP-2 concentrations in neonates raises doubts concerning the physiological relevance of GLP-2 as a enterally mediated trophic signal. A more definitive test of this hypothesis will require further studies that assess the intestinal metabolic response to enteral nutrition using experimental approaches that block GLP-2 action. "
177,39212929,"Pancreatic β cells secrete insulin in response to elevated levels of glucose. Stem cell derived β (SCβ) cells aim to replicate this glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) function, but current preparations cannot provide the same level of insulin as natural β cells. Here, we develop an assay to measure GSIS at the single cell level to investigate the functional heterogeneity of SCβ cells and donor-derived islet cells. Our assay involves randomly depositing single cells and insulin capture microbeads in open-top nanowells (40 × 40 × 55 μm "
178,26494808,"The bidirectional relationship between iron metabolism and glucose homeostasis is increasingly recognized. Several pathways of iron metabolism are modified according to systemic glucose levels, whereas insulin action and secretion are influenced by changes in relative iron excess. We aimed to update the possible influence of iron on insulin action and secretion and vice versa. The mechanisms that link iron metabolism and glucose homeostasis in the main insulin-sensitive tissues and insulin-producing β-cells were revised according to their possible influence on the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The mechanisms leading to dysmetabolic hyperferritinemia and hepatic overload syndrome were diverse, including diet-induced alterations in iron absorption, modulation of gluconeogenesis, heme-mediated disruption of circadian glucose rhythm, impaired hepcidin secretion and action, and reduced copper availability. Glucose metabolism in adipose tissue seems to be affected by both iron deficiency and excess through interaction with adipocyte differentiation, tissue hyperplasia and hypertrophy, release of adipokines, lipid synthesis, and lipolysis. Reduced heme synthesis and dysregulated iron uptake or export could also be contributing factors affecting glucose metabolism in the senescent muscle, whereas exercise is known to affect iron and glucose status. Finally, iron also seems to modulate β-cells and insulin secretion, although this has been scarcely studied. Iron is increasingly recognized to influence glucose metabolism at multiple levels. Body iron stores should be considered as a potential target for therapy in subjects with T2D or those at risk for developing T2D. Further research is warranted. "
179,25816913,"In this study, it was hypothesized that dietary phenolic compounds selectively inhibit the individual C- and N-terminal (Ct, Nt) subunits of the two small intestinal α-glucosidases, maltase-glucoamylase (MGAM) and sucrase-isomaltase (SI), for a modulated glycemic carbohydrate digestion. The inhibition by chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, gallic acid, (+)-catechin, and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on individual recombinant human Nt-MGAM and Nt-SI and on mouse Ct-MGAM and Ct-SI was assayed using maltose as the substrate. Inhibition constants, inhibition mechanisms, and IC50 values for each combination of phenolic compound and enzymatic subunit were determined. EGCG and chlorogenic acid were found to be more potent inhibitors for selectively inhibiting the two subunits with highest activity, Ct-MGAM and Ct-SI. All compounds displayed noncompetitive type inhibition. Inhibition of fast-digesting Ct-MGAM and Ct-SI by EGCG and chlorogenic acid could lead to a slow, but complete, digestion of starch for improved glycemic response of starchy foods with potential health benefit.

180,1677000,"Much recent work has established the efficacy of certain beta-adrenergic agonists in promoting muscle growth. These compounds also lower the deposition of body lipid. Establishing whether treatment of animals with beta-adrenergic agonists alters their metabolism in ways that affect the efficiency of nutrient use will become important if these compounds are to find a place in animal production. Currently the biological basis of amino acid and energy requirements is being reexamined; this paper discusses whether we have sufficient information to conclude that the current dietary recommendations are appropriate for animals receiving beta-adrenergic agonists. When dietary protein is not a primary nutritional limitation to the rate of protein deposition, beta-adrenergic agonists should increase the efficiency with which the existing protein intake is used in growth. Alternatively, diets that supply a higher essential/nonessential amino acid ratio might be desirable. Whether additional nonprotein energy should be fed to these animals remains an open question. On one hand, the compounds increase energy expenditure and probably increase the maintenance energy needs of the recipient animals; on the other, feeding diets of higher energy density may lead to the resumption of undesirably high rates of fat deposition.

181,36985831,"The global burden of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) has led to significant interest in finding novel and effective therapeutic targets for this chronic disorder. Bioactive food components have effectively improved abnormal glucose metabolism associated with this disease. Capsaicin and zinc are food components that have shown the potential to improve glucose metabolism by activating signalling events in the target cells. Capsaicin and zinc stimulate glucose uptake through the activation of distinct pathways (AMPK and AKT, respectively); however, calcium signal transduction seems to be the common pathway between the two. The investigation of molecular pathways that are activated by capsaicin and zinc has the potential to lead to the discovery of new therapeutic targets for T2DM. Therefore, this literature review aims to provide a summary of the main signalling pathways triggered by capsaicin and zinc in glucose metabolism. "
182,36294045,"Antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds are potential candidates to prevent age-related chronic diseases. Broccoli sprouts (BrSp) are a rich source of sulforaphane-a bioactive metabolite known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. We tested the effect of chronic BrSp feeding on age-related decline in cardiometabolic health and lifespan in rats. Male and female Long-Evans rats were fed a control diet with or without dried BrSp (300 mg/kg body weight, 3 times per week) from 4 months of age until death. Body weight, body composition, blood pressure, heart function, and glucose and insulin tolerance were measured at 10, 16, 20, and 22 months of age. Behavioral traits were also examined at 18 months of age. BrSp feeding prolonged life span in females, whereas in males the positive effects on longevity were more pronounced in a subgroup of males (last 25% of survivors). Despite having modest effects on behavior, BrSp profoundly affected cardiometabolic parameters in a sex-dependent manner. BrSp-fed females had a lower body weight and visceral adiposity while BrSp-fed males exhibited improved glucose tolerance and reduced blood pressure when compared to their control counterparts. These findings highlight the sex-dependent benefits of BrSp on improving longevity and delaying cardiometabolic decline associated with aging in rats. "

184,34355526,"The adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an integrative metabolic sensor that maintains energy balance at the cellular level and plays an important role in orchestrating intertissue metabolic signaling. AMPK regulates cell survival, metabolism, and cellular homeostasis basally as well as in response to various metabolic stresses. Studies so far show that the AMPK pathway is associated with neurodegeneration and CNS pathology, but the mechanisms involved remain unclear. AMPK dysregulation has been reported in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and other neuropathies. AMPK activation appears to be both neuroprotective and pro-apoptotic, possibly dependent upon neural cell types, the nature of insults, and the intensity and duration of AMPK activation. While embryonic brain development in AMPK null mice appears to proceed normally without any overt structural abnormalities, our recent study confirmed the full impact of AMPK loss in the postnatal and aging brain. Our studies revealed that Ampk deletion in neurons increased basal neuronal excitability and reduced latency to seizure upon stimulation. Three major pathways, glycolysis, pentose phosphate shunt, and glycogen turnover, contribute to utilization of glucose in the brain. AMPK's regulation of aerobic glycolysis in astrocytic metabolism warrants further deliberation, particularly glycogen turnover and shuttling of glucose- and glycogen-derived lactate from astrocytes to neurons during activation. In this minireview, we focus on recent advances in AMPK and energy-sensing in the brain. "
185,37792692,"The supraclavicular fossa is the dominant location for human brown adipose tissue (BAT). Activation of BAT promotes non-shivering thermogenesis by utilization of glucose and free fatty acids and has been the focus of pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches for modulation in order to improve body weight and glucose homeostasis. Sympathetic neural control of supraclavicular BAT has received much attention, but its innervation has not been extensively investigated in humans. Dissection of the cervical region in human cadavers was performed to find the distribution of sympathetic nerve branches to supraclavicular fat pad. Furthermore, proximal segments of the 4th cervical nerve were evaluated histologically to assess its sympathetic components. Nerve branches terminating in supraclavicular fat pad were identified in all dissections, including those from the 3rd and 4th cervical nerves and from the cervical sympathetic plexus. Histology of the proximal segments of the 4th cervical nerves confirmed tyrosine hydroxylase positive thin nerve fibers in all fascicles with either a scattered or clustered distribution pattern. The scattered pattern was more predominant than the clustered pattern (80% vs. 20%) across cadavers. These sympathetic nerve fibers occupied only 2.48% of the nerve cross sectional area on average. Human sympathetic nerves use multiple pathways to innervate the supraclavicular fat pad. The present finding serves as a framework for future clinical approaches to activate human BAT in the supraclavicular region. "

187,15794187,"A 15-year-old boy with inverted duplication of chromosome 15 was admitted for acute onset of irritability, increasing sleepiness, and worsening of seizures. He had been on valproate and other anti-convulsants. However, he was found to have hyperammonemia within 2 weeks after the addition of low-dose topiramate to valproate. He recovered within 7 days after discontinuation of valproate. Topiramate was tailed off. The reintroduction of valproate monotherapy caused hyperammonemia again without clinical features of encephalopathy. He also developed anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome following the use of phenytoin. We propose the term topiramate-valproate-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy syndrome to include the following features: excessive sleepiness or somnolence, aggravation of seizures, hyperammonemia, and absence of triphasic waves on electroencephalography in any individual on simultaneous topiramate-valproate therapy. The ammonia level ranged from 1.5 to 2 times normal. The serum valproate level might be within the therapeutic range. The possible mechanism is topiramate-induced aggravation of all the known complications of valproate monotherapy. This condition is reversible with cessation of either valproate or topiramate. "
188,26868297,"Adaptive β-cell replication occurs in response to increased metabolic demand during insulin resistance. The intracellular mediators of this compensatory response are poorly defined and their identification could provide significant targets for β-cell regeneration therapies. Here we show that glucose and insulin in vitro and insulin resistance in vivo activate protein kinase C ζ (PKCζ) in pancreatic islets and β-cells. PKCζ is required for glucose- and glucokinase activator-induced proliferation of rodent and human β-cells in vitro. Furthermore, either kinase-dead PKCζ expression (KD-PKCζ) or disruption of PKCζ in mouse β-cells blocks compensatory β-cell replication when acute hyperglycemia/hyperinsulinemia is induced. Importantly, KD-PKCζ inhibits insulin resistance-mediated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation and cyclin-D2 upregulation independent of Akt activation. In summary, PKCζ activation is key for early compensatory β-cell replication in insulin resistance by regulating the downstream signals mTOR and cyclin-D2. This suggests that alterations in PKCζ expression or activity might contribute to inadequate β-cell mass expansion and β-cell failure leading to type 2 diabetes. "
189,18414997,"Methyl succinate (MS) and alpha-ketoisocaproate (KIC) when applied alone to cultured pancreatic islets or INS-1 832/13 cells do not stimulate insulin release. However, when the two metabolites are combined together they strongly stimulate insulin release. Studying the possible explanations for this complementarity has provided clues to the pathways involved in insulin secretion. MS increased carbon incorporation of KIC into acid-precipitable material and lipid in INS-1 cells. In isolated mitochondria, MS alone increased malate, but MS plus KIC increased citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, and isocitrate. These data and the known pathways of their metabolism suggest that MS supplies the oxaloacetate component of citrate and KIC supplies the acetate component of citrate. Other citric acid cycle intermediates can be formed from citrate enabling anaplerosis to supply precursors for extramitochondrial pathways. In addition, KIC, glucose and pyruvate can be metabolized to acetoacetate. In an INS-1 cell line deficient in ATP citrate lyase, incorporation of carbon from pyruvate into acid-precipitable material and lipid was not lowered. This negative result is in agreement with our recent discovery that citrate is not the only carrier of acyl groups from the mitochondria to the cytosol in the beta cell and that acetoacetate can also transfer acyl carbon to the cytosol.

190,25998996,"Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the recommended treatment for patients suffering from intermediate, B stage, hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite an undisputed pharmacokinetic advantage, TACE with microspheres has not been shown to be superior in terms of survival compared to conventional TACE using Lipiodol(®). The best guarantee to reduce toxicity and maximize the efficacy of TACE is to strictly observe the contraindications for the procedure (Child-Pugh>B8, reduced portal flow, very large tumor, any technical contraindication and renal impairment), and rigorous application of the administration requirements for the Lipiodol(®) emulsion or loaded microspheres (assessment of hepatic vascularization investigating for accessory vascularization, injection methods). Tumor response should be assessed after four weeks by CT or MRI using the modified RECIST criteria. "
191,30055509,"The aim of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect on length of labor when patients receive IVF with or without dextrose. Searches were performed in electronic databases from inception of each database to May 2018. Trials comparing intrapartum IVF containing dextrose (i.e. intervention group) with no dextrose or placebo (i.e. control group) were included. Only trials examining low-risk pregnancies in labor at ≥36 weeks were included. Studies were included regardless of oral intake restriction. The primary outcome was the length of total labor from randomization to delivery. The meta-analysis was performed using the random effects model. Sixteen trials (n = 2503 participants) were included in the meta-analysis. Women randomized in the IVF dextrose group did not have a statistically significant different length of total labor from randomization to delivery compared to IVF without dextrose (MD -38.33 min, 95% CI -88.23 to 11.57). IVF with dextrose decreased the length of the first stage (MD -75.81 min, 95% CI -120.67 to -30.95), but there was no change in the second stage. In summary, use of IVF with dextrose during labor in low-risk women at term does not affect total length of labor, but it does shorten the first stage of labor. "
192,32430709,"To investigate if oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) associates with changes in maternal symptoms (ie, flushing, sweating), blood nonenzymatic advanced glycation end products (AGE), acute-phase reactive inflammatory markers, and oxidative stress. Prospective case-control study of patients screened for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). One hundred nonfasting, second-trimester consecutive pregnant women allocated to either 50 g OGTT or water. Five women who had a 3-hour fasting 100 g OGTT also enrolled. Maternal serum glucose, AGE, soluble receptor for AGE (sRAGE), interleukin (IL)-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were immunoassayed. Total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP) estimated with antioxidant capacityperoxyl assay. Data corrected for gestational age and maternal body mass index. During 50 g OGTT there was a decrease in systolic blood pressure not accompanied by the onset of adverse clinical symptoms. There was a decrease in serum glucose levels 1 hour after water (P = .019) but not glucose ingestion. Serum CRP (P = .001) but not IL-6 was increased. The AGE, sRAGE, and TRAP levels remained unchanged. Similar results were seen during 100 g OGTT, except serum glucose was significantly elevated after 1 hour. Results suggest screening tools for gestational diabetes are safe and clinically well tolerated during pregnancy. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03029546. "
193,25649484,"The phenotypic heterogeneity of the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes [group A streptococcus (GAS)] is associated with bacterial virulence variation. During invasive GAS infection, mutations in the two-component regulatory system covR/covS leads to increases in hyaluronic acid capsule production, virulence genes expression, and lethality in the mouse infection model. Phenotypic variation of GAS is also found under in vitro culture conditions. However, whether a specific environmental factor is important for phenotypic variation is still unknown. GAS968 is an emm12-type clinical isolate that converts from mucoid to hypermucoid morphology under in vitro culture conditions. To clarify whether morphology variation can be triggered by specific environmental signals, or whether different morphology variants would be selected under specific environmental stresses, GAS968 was cultured under different conditions, and the changes in the number of mucoid and hypermucoid colonies in the total bacterial population were analyzed. The ratio of mucoid and hypermucoid colonies of GAS968 in the total bacterial population changes dramatically under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The decrease in the number of hypermucoid colonies in the total bacterial population under aerobic conditions is not caused by growth repression, suggesting that the morphology conversion of GAS968 is inhibited by oxygen. Phenotypic heterogeneity has been shown to contribute to invasive GAS infection. Our results suggest that oxygen-dependent morphology variation in GAS968 may have important roles in bacterial pathogenesis. "
194,38754428,"Autophagy is central to the benefits of longevity signaling programs and to hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) response to nutrient stress. With age, a subset of HSCs increases autophagy flux and preserves regenerative capacity, but the signals triggering autophagy and maintaining the functionality of autophagy-activated old HSCs (oHSCs) remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that autophagy is an adaptive cytoprotective response to chronic inflammation in the aging murine bone marrow (BM) niche. We find that inflammation impairs glucose uptake and suppresses glycolysis in oHSCs through Socs3-mediated inhibition of AKT/FoxO-dependent signaling, with inflammation-mediated autophagy engagement preserving functional quiescence by enabling metabolic adaptation to glycolytic impairment. Moreover, we show that transient autophagy induction via a short-term fasting/refeeding paradigm normalizes glycolytic flux and significantly boosts oHSC regenerative potential. Our results identify inflammation-driven glucose hypometabolism as a key driver of HSC dysfunction with age and establish autophagy as a targetable node to reset oHSC regenerative capacity. "

196,12401707,"The purposes of this study were to quantify the impact of the duration of infusion and choice of stable isotope of glucose on measures of glucose rate of appearance (glucose R(a)) and to determine whether the differences observed were due to tracer recycling via the glycogen pool (direct pathway) or gluconeogenesis (indirect pathway). Six healthy adult volunteers were studied on four occasions in the postabsorptive state during infusions of [1-(13)C]glucose and [6,6-(2)H(2)]glucose: 2.5-h infusion of both (A), and 2.5-h infusion of one (B) and 14.5-h infusion of the other isotope (C), and 5-h infusion of [6,6-(2)H(2)]glucose and 2.5-h infusion of [1-(13)C]glucose (D). Infusion of both isotopes for 2.5 h resulted in similar glucose R(a) values. When compared with a 14.5-h infusion, the 2.5-h glucose tracer infusion overestimated glucose R(a) by 26-35%. Glucose (13)C recycled via the Cori cycle, resulting in slower decay from the plasma pool and longer half-life of [1-(13)C]glucose compared with [6,6-(2)H(2)]glucose. There was no detectable release of [(13)C]glucose or [(2)H(2)]glucose tracer into the plasma pool after administration of glucagon. These data demonstrate that glucose R(a) varies not as a result of isotope cycling but as a result of differences in duration of isotope infusion regardless of the isotope used. This is most likely due to incomplete isotope and substrate equilibration with the 2.5-h infusion. The potential error was reduced by nearly 80% using a 5-h infusion of [6,6-(2)H(2)]glucose. These studies demonstrate that the duration of isotope infusion has significantly greater impact on quantitation of glucose R(a) than does the selection of isotope. "
197,38950317,"Glucose plays a key role in shaping pancreatic β cell function. Thus, deciphering the mechanisms by which this nutrient stimulates β cells holds therapeutic promise for combating β cell failure in type 2 diabetes (T2D). β Cells respond to hyperglycemia in part by rewiring their mRNA metabolism, yet the mechanisms governing these changes remain poorly understood. Here, we identify a requirement for the RNA-binding protein PCBP2 in maintaining β cell function basally and during sustained hyperglycemic challenge. PCBP2 was induced in primary mouse islets incubated with elevated glucose and was required to adapt insulin secretion. Transcriptomic analysis of primary Pcbp2-deficient β cells revealed impacts on basal and glucose-regulated mRNAs encoding core components of the insulin secretory pathway. Accordingly, Pcbp2-deficient β cells exhibited defects in calcium flux, insulin granule ultrastructure and exocytosis, and the amplification pathway of insulin secretion. Further, PCBP2 was induced by glucose in primary human islets, was downregulated in islets from T2D donors, and impacted genes commonly altered in islets from donors with T2D and linked to single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with T2D. Thus, these findings establish a paradigm for PCBP2 in governing basal and glucose-adaptive gene programs critical for shaping the functional state of β cells. "

199,34196517,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive malignant tumor. It is difficult to regulate GBM using conventional chemotherapy-based methods due to its anatomical structure specificity, low drug targeting ability, and limited penetration depth capability to reach the tumor interior. Numerous approaches have been proposed to overcome such issues, including nanoparticle-based drug delivery system (DDS) with the development of GBM site targeting and penetration depth enhancing moieties (e.g., peptides, sugars, proteins, etc.). In this study, we prepared four different types of nanoparticles, which are based on porous silicon nanoparticles (pSiNPs) incorporating polyethylene glycol (PEG), iRGD peptide (well-known cancer targeting peptide), and SIWV tetra-peptide (a recently disclosed GBM-targeting peptide), and analyzed their deep-tumor penetration abilities in cell spheroids, in GBM patient-derived tumoroids, and in GBM xenograft mice. We found that SIWV tetra-peptide significantly enhanced the penetration depth of pSiNPs, and its therapeutic formulation (temozolomide-loaded/SIWV-functionalized pSiNPs) showed a higher anticancer efficacy compared with other formulations. These findings hold great promise for the development of nanotherapeutics and peptide-conjugated drugs for GBM. "
200,16166344,"Premature infants receiving chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to feeding intolerance develop intestinal atrophy and reduced nutrient absorption. Although providing the intestinal trophic hormone glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) during chronic TPN improves intestinal growth and morphology, it is uncertain whether GLP-2 enhances absorptive function. We placed catheters in the carotid artery, jugular and portal veins, duodenum, and a portal vein flow probe in piglets before providing either enteral formula (ENT), TPN or a coinfusion of TPN plus GLP-2 for 6 days. On postoperative day 7, all piglets were fed enterally and digestive functions were evaluated in vivo using dual infusion of enteral ((13)C) and intravenous ((2)H) glucose, in vitro by measuring mucosal lactase activity and rates of apical glucose transport, and by assessing the abundances of sodium glucose transporter-1 (SGLT-1) and glucose transporter-2 (GLUT2). Both ENT and GLP-2 pigs had larger intestine weights, longer villi, and higher lactose digestive capacity and in vivo net glucose and galactose absorption compared with TPN alone. These endpoints were similar in ENT and GLP-2 pigs except for a lower intestinal weight and net glucose absorption in GLP-2 compared with ENT pigs. The enhanced hexose absorption in GLP-2 compared with TPN pigs corresponded with higher lactose digestive and apical glucose transport capacities, increased abundance of SGLT-1, but not GLUT-2, and lower intestinal metabolism of [(13)C]glucose to [(13)C]lactate. Our findings indicate that GLP-2 treatment during chronic TPN maintains intestinal structure and lactose digestive and hexose absorptive capacities, reduces intestinal hexose metabolism, and may facilitate the transition to enteral feeding in TPN-fed infants.

201,26882903,"Autophagic (type II) cell death has been suggested to play pathogenetic roles in cerebral ischemia. Growth arrest and DNA damage response 45b (Gadd45b) has been shown to protect against rat brain ischemia injury through inhibiting apoptosis. However, the relationship between Gadd45b and autophagy in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury remains uncertain. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of Gadd45b on autophagy. We adopt the oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) model of rat primary cortex neurons, and lentivirus interference used to silence Gadd45b expression. Cell viability and injury assay were performed using CCK-8 and LDH kit. Autophagy activation was monitored by expression of ATG5, LC3, Beclin-1, ATG7 and ATG3. Neuron apoptosis was monitored by expression of Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase3, p53 and TUNEL assay. Neuron neurites were assayed by double immunofluorescent labeling with Tuj1 and LC3B. Here, we demonstrated that the expression of Gadd45b was strongly up-regulated at 24 h after 3 h OGD treatment. ShRNA-Gadd45b increased the expression of autophagy related proteins, aggravated OGD/R-induced neuron cell apoptosis and neurites injury. ShRNA-Gadd45b co-treatment with autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or Wortmannin partly inhibited the ratio of LC3II/LC3I, and slightly ameliorated neuron cell apoptosis under OGD/R. Furthermore, shRNA-Gadd45b inhibited the p-p38 level involved in autophagy, but increased the p-JNK level involved in apoptosis. ShRNA-Gadd45b co-treatment with p38 inhibitor obviously induced autophagy. ShRNA-Gadd45b co-treatment with JNK inhibitor alleviated neuron cell apoptosis. In conclusion, our data suggested that Gadd45b inhibited autophagy and apoptosis under OGD/R. Gadd45b may be a common regulatory protein to control autophagy and apoptosis. "
202,38777099,"PURA, also known as Pur-alpha, is an evolutionarily conserved DNA/RNA-binding protein crucial for various cellular processes, including DNA replication, transcriptional regulation, and translational control. Comprising three PUR domains, it engages with nucleic acids and has a role in protein-protein interactions. The manifestation of PURA syndrome, arising from mutations in the PURA gene, presents neurologically with developmental delay, hypotonia, and seizures. In our prior work from 2018, we highlighted the unique case of a PURA patient displaying hypoglycorrhachia, suggesting a potential association with GLUT1 dysfunction in this syndrome. In this current study, we expand the patient cohort with PURA mutations exhibiting hypoglycorrhachia and aim to unravel the molecular basis of this phenomenon. We established an in vitro model in HeLa cells to modulate PURA expression and investigated GLUT1 function and expression. Our findings indicate that PURA levels directly impact glucose uptake through the functioning of GLUT1, without influencing significantly GLUT1 expression. Moreover, our study reveals evidence for a possible physical interaction between PURA and GLUT1, demonstrated by colocalization and co-immunoprecipitation of both proteins. Computational analyses, employing molecular dynamics, further corroborates these findings, demonstrating that PURA:GLUT1 interactions are plausible, and that the stability of the complex is altered when PURA is truncated and/or mutated. In conclusion, our results suggest that PURA plays a pivotal role in driving the function of GLUT1 for glucose uptake, potentially forming a regulatory complex. Additional investigations are warranted to elucidate the precise mechanisms governing this complex and its significance in ensuring proper GLUT1 function. "
203,8393281,"Rat C6 glioma cells chronically acclimated to hypertonic media accumulate large quantities of inositol. When returned to isotonic conditions, the cells swell and lose inositol slowly via a four- to fivefold increase in the rate of passive inositol efflux. The inositol efflux pathway is a Na(+)-independent transport mechanism with low affinity for inositol and is inhibited by quinidine, quinine, various anion transport blockers, and cis-unsaturated fatty acids. Ionomycin-induced elevation of intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+i) had no effect on basal or swelling-induced inositol efflux. Inositol efflux was not inhibited by chelation of Ca2+i with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. In addition, Ca2+i measured with fura 2 did not change during cell swelling, indicating that increases in Ca2+i do not regulate inositol efflux. Exposure of C6 cells to 20 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, 0.5 mM adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), or 50 microM forskolin had no effect on basal inositol efflux but stimulated swelling-induced inositol loss by 2.6-, 2.2-, and 3.4-fold, respectively. Exposure to the protein kinase inhibitors 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine or staurosporine or downregulation of protein kinase C (PKC) activity, however, had no inhibitory effect on inositol efflux, and cellular cAMP levels were not altered by cell swelling. Taken together, these results indicate that stimulation of PKC and protein kinase A modulates the activity of the efflux pathway but is not required for swelling-induced activation. Ketoconazole, cinnamyl-3,4-dihydroxy-alpha-cyanocinnamate, and gossypol, inhibitors of lipoxygenase enzymes, blocked both basal and swelling-induced inositol efflux, suggesting indirectly that lipoxygenase metabolites may be responsible for swelling-induced activation of the efflux mechanism. The characteristics of inositol efflux in C6 cells are similar to those described for volume regulatory sorbitol and taurine efflux in a number of cell types, suggesting the existence of a common transport mechanism.

204,27098499,"The objective was to compare the efficacy of an oral sucrose versus placebo in reducing pain in infants 1 to 3 months of age during intravenous (IV) cannulation in the emergency department. A randomized, double-blind, placebo clinical trial was conducted. Participants were randomly allocated to receive 2 mL of an oral 88% sucrose solution or 2 mL of a placebo solution orally. The outcome measure were mean difference in pain score at 1 minute post-IV cannulation assessed by the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability Pain Scale (FLACC) and the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS), crying time, and variations in heart rate. Eighty-seven participants completed the study, 45 in the sucrose group and 42 in the placebo group. There was no statistical difference in variations in both the FLACC score (p = 0.49) and the NIPS score (p = 0.36) between the two groups as per the Mann-Whitney U-test. With the same test, median crying times following IV cannulation were statistically significantly different between both groups (17 seconds in the sucrose group vs. 41 seconds in the placebo group, p = 0.04). Mean changes in heart rate 1 minute after IV cannulation were similar in both groups (16 ± 4 beats/min for sucrose vs. 18 ± 4 beats/min for placebo, p = 0.74). Side effects were similar for both groups and no adverse events were reported. Administration of an oral sucrose solution in infants 1 to 3 months of age during IV cannulation did not lead to statistically significant changes in pain scores. However, the cry time was significantly reduced. "
205,35714482,"Reprogramming of cellular metabolism is a vital event during tumorigenesis. The role of glycolysis in malignant progression promoted by hydroquinone (HQ), one of the metabolic products of benzene, remains to be understood. Recently, we reported the overexpression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in HQ-enhanced malignant progression of TK6 cells and hypothesized that SIRT1 might contribute to glycolysis and favor tumorigenesis. Our data showed that acute exposure of TK6 cells to HQ for 48 h inhibited glycolysis, as indicated by reduction in glucose consumption, lactate production, hexokinase activity, and the expression of SIRT1 and glycolytic enzymes, including HIF-1α, hexokinase-2 (HK-2), ENO-1, glucose transporter 1 (Glut-1), and lactic dehydrogenase A (LDHA). Knockdown of SIRT1 or inhibition of glycolysis using the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) downregulated the levels of SIRT1 and glycolytic enzymes and significantly enhanced HQ-induced cell apoptosis, although knockdown of SIRT1 or 2-DG alone had little effect on apoptosis. Furthermore, immunofluorescence and Co-IP assays demonstrated that SIRT1 regulated the expression of HK-2, and HQ treatment caused a decrease in SIRT1 and HK-2 binding to mitochondria. Importantly, we found that glycolysis was promoted with increasing HQ treatment weeks. Long-term HQ exposure increased the expression of SIRT1 and several glycolytic enzymes and promoted malignant cell progression. Moreover, compared with the PBS group, glucose consumption and lactate production increased after 10 weeks of HQ exposure, and the protein levels of SIRT1 and HK-2 were increased after 15 weeks of HQ exposure, while those of Glut-1, ENO-1, and LDHA were elevated. In addition, SIRT1 knockdown HQ 19 cells exhibited decreased lactate production, glucose consumption, glycolytic enzymes expression, cell growth, and tumor formation in nude mice. Our findings identify the high expression of SIRT1 as a strong oncogenic driver that positively regulates HK-2 and promotes glycolysis in HQ-accelerated malignant progression of TK6 cells. "

209,16380493,"We have recently shown that leucine culture upregulates ATP synthase beta-subunit (ATPSbeta) and increases ATP level, cytosolic Ca(2+), and glucose-induced insulin secretion in rat islets. The aim is to test whether glucokinase expression is also affected in rat islets and its role in glucose sensitization during leucine culture. Leucine culture increased glucose-induced NAD(P)H level at 1 and 2 days but not at 1 week. The half-maximal effective concentration of the glucose response curve for NAD(P)H was left-shifted from 5-7 to 2-3 mmol/l. The effect was dose dependent and rapamycin insensitive. Leucine culture did not affect glyceraldehyde effects on NAD(P)H. Leucine pretreatment for 30 min had no effects on NAD(P)H levels. Leucine culture for 2 days also increased glucose-induced cytosolic Ca(2+) elevation, ATP level, and insulin secretion. Leucine increase of glucokinase mRNA levels occurred as early as day 1 and lasted through 1 week. That of ATPSbeta did not occur until day 2 and lasted through 1 week. Leucine effects on both mRNAs were dose dependent. The upregulation of both genes was confirmed by Western blotting. Leucine culture also increased glucose-induced insulin secretion, ATP level, glucokinase, and ATPSbeta levels of type 2 diabetic human islets. In conclusion, leucine culture upregulates glucokinase, which increases NAD(P)H level, and ATPSbeta, which increases oxidation of NADH and production of ATP. The combined upregulation of both genes increases glucose-induced cytosolic Ca(2+) and insulin secretion. "

However, intervention trials can also be a suitable starting point before performing a validation study in lager epidemiological cohorts, with a great potential in personalized medicine to investigate how different patients respond to similar stimuli. In the present work, we provide a review of the literature on the application of metabolomics to investigate metabolic alterations associated with diabetes, the diabetes predisposing state of insulin resistance and the oral glucose tolerance test as a case study to demonstrate the complementarity of observational and interventional study designs.

211,29324774,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming one of the world's most common chronic liver diseases in childhood, yet no therapy is available that has been approved by the food and drug administration (FDA). Previous studies have reported that telomere and telomerase are involved the development and progression of NAFLD. This study was designed to investigate the potential beneficial effects of activated carbon N-acetylcysteine (ACNAC) microcapsules on the development of NAFLD in young rats as well as the underlying mechanism(s) involved. Three-week old male Sprague Dawley rats were given high-fat diet (HFD) with/without ACNAC treatment for 7 consecutive weeks. Liver pathologies were determined by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Oil Red O staining, as well as by changes in biochemical parameters of plasma alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels, respectively. Glucose homeostasis was evaluated by the glucose tolerance test and the liver telomere length and activity were measured by real time PCR and telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP). Western blot analysis was performed to determine the expression level of Bcl-2, Bax and Caspase-3. Our results demonstrated that ACNAC supplementation improved liver pathologies of rats that received long-term HFD feeding. ACNAC supplementation prevented HFD-induced telomere shortening and improved telomerase activity. Moreover, in comparison to HFD-fed rats, ACNAC supplementation markedly increased the expression of Bcl-2, but significantly decreased the expression of Bax and Caspase-3 in juvenile rats. Together, these results indicate that ACNAC may be a promising choice for preventing and treating NAFLD among children. "

213,30880968,"Nanoparticles can efficiently carry and deliver anticancer agents to tumor sites. Mounting evidence indicates that many types of cancer cells, including colon cancer, have a weakly acidic microenvironment and increased levels of reactive oxygen species. The construction of nano drug delivery vehicles ""activatable"" in response to the tumor microenvironment is a new antitumor therapeutic strategy. Cinnamaldehyde (CA) was designed to link directly with dextran to form a polymer through an acid cleavable acetal bond. Herein, a novel pH-sensitive drug delivery system was constructed with co-encapsulated 10-hydroxy camptothecin (HCPT). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, and release kinetics analysis of HCPT-CA-loaded nanoparticles (PCH) were conducted to investigate the physical and chemical properties. The cellular uptake signatures of the nanoparticles were observed by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Cell viability, cell scratch assay, apoptosis assay, and colony formation assay were performed to examine the potent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of the PCH. The antitumor mechanism of the treatment with PCH was evaluated by Western blotting, flow cytometry, and TEM analysis. The pharmacokinetics of PCH were examined in healthy Sprague Dawley rats within 6 hours after sublingual vein injection. We lastly examined the biodistribution and the in vivo anticancer activity of PCH using the xenograft mouse models of HCT116 cells. Both HCPT and CA were quickly released by PCH in an acidic microenvironment. PCH not only induced cancer cell death through the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species in vitro but also facilitated the drug uptake, effectively prolonged drug circulation, and increased accumulation of drug in tumor sites. More attractively, PCH exhibited excellent therapeutic performance and better in vivo systemic safety. Overall, PCH not only utilized the tumor microenvironment to control drug release, improve drug pharmacokinetics, and passively target the drug to the tumor tissue, but also exerted a synergistic anticancer effect. The acid-responsive PCH has enormous potential as a novel anticancer therapeutic strategy. "
214,33576890,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a vascular complication of diabetes mellitus that causes visual impairment and blindness. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been revealed to be involved in biological processes of several diseases including DR. We designed this study to investigate the specific role of TPTEP1 in DR. First, we mimicked diabetic conditions with high glucose (HG) stimulation of human retinal vascular endothelial cells (HRVECs) and measured TPTEP1 expression in HG-stimulated HRVECs using RT-qPCR analysis. Then, CCK-8, Transwell, and Matrigel tube formation assays as well as western blot analysis were performed to reveal the biological functions of TPTEP1 in HG-stimulated HRVECs. Subsequently, bioinformatics analysis, RNA pull down, luciferase reporter and ChIP assays as well as western blot analysis evaluated the relationship of TPTEP1, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) in HG-stimulated HRVECs. Finally, to verify the regulation of the TPTEP1/STAT3/VEGFA axis in HG-stimulated HRVECs, rescue experiments were carried out in HG-stimulated HRVECs. TPTEP1 presented a significant downregulation in HG-stimulated HRVECs. Additionally, TPTEP1 overexpression reduced viability, migration, and angiogenesis in HG-stimulated HRVECs. Moreover, TPTEP1 suppressed phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT3, and thereby downregulated VEGFA mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, TPTEP1 overexpression-mediated suppression of HG-induced dysfunction in HRVECs was countervailed by STAT3 upregulation or VEGFA upregulation. TPTEP1 alleviated HG-induced dysfunction in HRVECs via interacting with STAT3 and targeting VEGFA. "
215,33901462,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is one of the major microvascular complications of diabetes and an important cause of end-stage renal disease. Previous studies have shown that the damage to podocyte autophagy is related to the pathogenesis of DKD, and this damage is closely mediated by the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transductors and the transcription (STAT) signaling pathway. Here, the underlying molecular mechanism of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway regulating podocyte autophagy was investigated. In the present study, compared to controls, DKD mice showed glomerular hypertrophy, increased kidney weight/weight ratio, and increased urinary protein levels, as well as decreased desmin and synaptopodin expression. Meanwhile, levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, reduced glutathione, and malondialdehyde were also increased in the serum of DKD mice. Further, a lower number of autophagosomes, reduced expression of MAP1LC3 (LC3) in glomeruli, and increased expression of JAK/STAT pathway-related proteins, namely JAK1, JAK2, STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, and STAT6, were observed in DKD mice. In the in vitro experiments, we observed impaired autophagy, enhanced apoptosis, and activated JAK/STAT pathway in podocytes under high glucose conditions. Studies using ruxolitinib inhibitors have showed that suppression of the JAK/STAT pathway in podocytes subjected to high glucose could increase autophagic flux and autophagy-related protein expression. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that high glucose inhibits autophagy by activating the JAK/STAT pathway in mice and podocytes, thereby preventing the efficient removal of damaged proteins and organelles from the body to prevent apoptosis, and ultimately aggravating the progression of podocyte injury and DKD.

216,31356639,"Chromosome abnormalities induces profound alterations in gene expression, leading to various disease phenotypes. Recent studies on yeast and mammalian cells have demonstrated that aneuploidy exerts detrimental effects on organismal growth and development, regardless of the karyotype, suggesting that aneuploidy-associated stress plays an important role in disease pathogenesis. However, whether and how this effect alters cellular homeostasis and long-term features of human disease are not fully understood. Here, we aimed to investigate cellular stress responses in human trisomy syndromes, using fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Dermal fibroblasts derived from patients with trisomy 21, 18 and 13 showed a severe impairment of cell proliferation and enhanced premature senescence. These phenomena were accompanied by perturbation of protein homeostasis, leading to the accumulation of protein aggregates. We found that treatment with sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA), a chemical chaperone, decreased the protein aggregates in trisomy fibroblasts. Notably, 4-PBA treatment successfully prevented the progression of premature senescence in secondary fibroblasts derived from trisomy 21 iPSCs. Our study reveals aneuploidy-associated stress as a potential therapeutic target for human trisomies, including Down syndrome. "

218,21541722,"Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) was first recognized as an inherited lethal encephalopathy beginning in the first week of life and associated with an unusual odor in the urine of affected children. It was later confirmed as a deficiency of branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH), which is the second step in branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) breakdown. MSUD is characterized by BCAA and branched-chain keto acid (BCKA) accumulation. BCAAs are essential amino acids and powerful metabolic signals with severe consequences of both deprivation and accumulation. Treatment requires life-long dietary restriction and monitoring of BCAAs. However, despite excellent compliance, children commonly suffer metabolic decompensation during intercurrent illness resulting in life-threatening cerebral edema and dysmyelination. The mechanisms underlying brain injury have been poorly understood. Recent studies using newly developed mouse models of both classic and intermediate MSUD have yielded insight into the consequences of rapid BCAA accumulation. Additionally, these models have been used to test preliminary treatments aimed at competing with blood-brain barrier transport of BCAA using norleucine. Assessment of biochemical changes with and without treatment suggests different roles for BCAA and BCKA in the mechanism of brain injury. "
219,28951984,"In previous clinical trials, we showed that remote ischemic preconditioning (rIPC) reduced myocardial damage in children undergoing treatment for congenital heart defects and postoperative renal failure in patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery. In rabbit experiments, pre-treatment with plasma and plasma dialysate (obtained using 15-kDa cut-off dialysis membrane) from donor rabbits subjected to rIPC similarly protected against cardiac infarction. However, the protective substances containing in rIPC plasma have been unknown. In the present study, we showed that rIPC plasma exerted anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative effects on human neural stem cells under oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) that mimics brain ischemia. Additionally, we applied the sample to the liquid chromatography integrated with mass spectrometry to identify candidate key molecules in the rIPC plasma and determine its role in protecting neural stem cells from OGD-induced cell death. Thioredoxin increased significantly after rIPC compared to pre-IPC. Pretreatment with thioredoxin, the antioxidant protein, markedly protected human neural stem cells from OGD-induced cell death. The effect of thioredoxin on brain ischemia in animals should be further evaluated. However, the present study first evaluated the effect of rIPC in the ischemic cellular model. "
220,34369002,"Wireless, skin-integrated devices for continuous, clinical-quality monitoring of vital signs have the potential to greatly improve the care of patients in neonatal and pediatric intensive-care units. These same technologies can also be used in the home, across a broad spectrum of ages, from beginning to end of life. Although miniaturized forms of such devices minimize patient burden and improve compliance, they represent life-threatening choking hazards for infants. A materials strategy is presented here to address this concern. Specifically, composite materials are introduced as soft encapsulating layers and gentle adhesives that release chemical compounds designed to elicit an intense bitter taste when placed in the mouth. Reflexive reactions to this sensation strongly reduce the potential for ingestion, as a safety feature. The materials systems described involve a non-toxic bitterant (denatonium benzoate) as a dopant in an elastomeric (poly(dimethylsiloxane)) or hydrogel matrix. Experimental and computational studies of these composite materials and the kinetics of release of the bitterant define the key properties. Incorporation into various wireless skin-integrated sensors demonstrates their utility in functional systems. This simple strategy offers valuable protective capabilities, with broad practical relevance to the welfare of children monitored with wearable devices. "
221,26660171,"Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are a diverse group of pharmacological agents used in the treatment of epileptic seizures. Over the past several decades some new AEDs, including lamotrigine (LTG), levetiracetam (LVA), oxcarbazepine (OXC), topiramate (TOP), and zonisamide (ZNS), have become widely used. This chapter describes a very simple and rapid liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for simultaneous quantitation of LVA, ZNS, LTG, TOP, and MHD in human serum. The method requires a very small amount of serum (50 μL) for multiple drug measurements and has a total analysis time of 4 min that makes it well suited for routine clinical analysis of several drugs simultaneously. The imprecision (CVs) measured at various concentrations across the analytical measurement range (AMR) are less than 7% for all analytes. The AMR for each analyte is as follows: LVA (1-100 μg/mL), ZNS (0.8-80 μg/mL), TOP (0.5-50 μg/mL), and 0.6-60 μg/mL for LTG and MHD. "
222,23903242,"Many children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are treated with methylphenidate (MPH), despite limited information on later vulnerability to drug abuse. A previous study in adolescent monkeys treated with MPH for 1 year did not indicate differences in acquisition to cocaine reinforcement compared with controls. The present study extended this characterization to include MPH self-administration. Adolescent male rhesus monkeys treated previously with a sustained-release formulation of MPH (beginning at ∼30 months old) and control monkeys (n=8/group) were used. All had previous experience of self-administering cocaine under a fixed-ratio 30 schedule of reinforcement. Responding was maintained by food (1.0-g banana-flavored pellets) and MPH (saline, 0.001-0.1 mg/kg/injection) was substituted for food for at least five consecutive sessions. MPH functioned as a reinforcer in all monkeys; there were no differences between groups in MPH self-administration. These findings extend earlier research with cocaine reinforcement showing that MPH treatment in adolescent monkeys does not increase future reinforcing effects of stimulant drugs. "

225,7476301,"Apart from being a stimulator of longitudinal growth, growth hormone (GH) regulates fuel metabolism in children and adults. A halfmark is mobilization of lipids, which involves an inhibition of lipoprotein lipase activity in adipose tissue and activation of the hormone sensitive lipase. Suppression of basal glucose oxidation and resistance to insulin are other important effects. This may cause concern during GH substitution in GH-deficient adults, some of whom may present with insulin resistance due to concomitant abdominal obesity. However, there are data to suggest that the GH-induced reduction in fat mass and increase in lean body mass may offset the insulin antagonistic actions of the hormone. The nitrogen-retaining effects of GH seem to involve a direct stimulation of protein synthesis in addition to secondary effects such as generation of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), hyperinsulinemia, and promotion of lipolysis. Thus, during periods of substrate affluence, GH acts in concert with insulin and IGF-I to promote protein anabolism. Postabsorptively, GH is primarily lipolytic and thereby indirectly protein-sparing. This effect becomes further accentuated with more prolonged fasting. In that sense, GH is unique by its preservation of protein during both feast and famine. These fuel metabolic effects add merit to the principle of GH substitution in hypopituitary adults. "
226,30913535,"Obesity is a worldwide health problem with rising incidence and results in reproductive difficulties. Elevated saturated free fatty acids (FFAs) in obesity can cause insulin resistance (IR) in peripheral tissues. The high intra-follicular saturated FFAs may also account for IR in ovarian granulosa cells (GCs). In the present study, we investigated the relationship between saturated FFAs and IR in GCs by the use of palmitic acid (PA). We demonstrated that the glucose uptake in cultured GCs and lactate accumulation in the culture medium were stimulated by insulin, but the effects of insulin were attenuated by PA treatment. Besides, insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt was reduced by PA in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, PA increased phosphorylation of JNK and JNK blockage rescued the phosphorylation of Akt which was downregulated by PA. These findings highlighted the negative effect of PA on GCs metabolism and may partially account for the obesity-related reproductive disorders. "
227,25298619,"Diabetes is associated with hyperglycemia and increased thrombin production. However, it is unknown whether a combination of high glucose and thrombin can modulate the expression of NAPDH oxidase (Nox) subtypes in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Moreover, we investigated the role of a diabetes-associated microRNA (miR-146a) in a diabetic atherothrombosis model. We showed that high glucose (HG) exerted a synergistic effect with thrombin to induce a 10.69-fold increase in Nox4 mRNA level in HAECs. Increased Nox4 mRNA expression was associated with increased Nox4 protein expression and ROS production. Inflammatory cytokine kit identified that the treatment increased IL-8 and IL-6 levels. Moreover, HG/thrombin treatment caused an 11.43-fold increase of THP-1 adhesion to HAECs. In silico analysis identified the homology between miR-146a and the 3'-untranslated region of the Nox4 mRNA, and a luciferase reporter assay confirmed that the miR-146a mimic bound to this Nox4 regulatory region. Additionally, miR-146a expression was decreased to 58% of that in the control, indicating impaired feedback restraint of HG/thrombin-induced endothelial inflammation. In contrast, miR-146a mimic transfection attenuated HG/thrombin-induced upregulation of Nox4 expression, ROS generation, and inflammatory phenotypes. In conclusion, miR-146a is involved in the regulation of endothelial inflammation via modulation of Nox4 expression in a diabetic atherothrombosis model. "
228,34326208,"Emerging studies indicate that the immune system can regulate systemic metabolism. Here, we show that thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) stimulates T cells to induce selective white adipose loss, which protects against obesity, improves glucose metabolism, and mitigates nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Unexpectedly, adipose loss was not caused by alterations in food intake, absorption, or energy expenditure. Rather, it was induced by the excessive loss of lipids through the skin as sebum. TSLP and T cells regulated sebum release and sebum-associated antimicrobial peptide expression in the steady state. In human skin,  "

232,34289398,"Concomitant type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease increases the risk of heart failure. Recent studies demonstrate beneficial effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors on chronic kidney disease progression and heart failure hospitalization in patients with and without diabetes. In addition to inhibiting glucose reabsorption, SGLT2 inhibitors decrease proximal tubular sodium reabsorption, possibly leading to transient natriuresis. We review the hypothesis that SGLT2 inhibitor's natriuretic and osmotic diuretic effects mediate their cardioprotective effects. The degree to which these benefits are related to changes in sodium, independent of the kidney, is currently unknown. Aside from effects on osmotically active sodium, we explore the intriguing possibility that SGLT2 inhibitors could also modulate nonosmotic sodium storage. This alternative hypothesis is based on emerging literature that challenges the traditional 2-compartment model of sodium balance to provide support for a 3-compartment model that includes the binding of sodium to glycosaminoglycans, such as those in muscles and skin. This recent research on nonosmotic sodium storage, as well as direct cardiac effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, provides possibilities for other ways in which SGLT2 inhibitors might mitigate heart failure risk. Overall, we review the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on sodium balance and sensitivity, cardiac tissue, interstitial fluid and plasma volume, and nonosmotic sodium storage. "
233,12845555,"In this brief review I have tried to gather all relevant data that have been published, concerning the long-term effects of the statutory requirement by Austrian authorities in 1990 to augment the iodine content of table salt from 10 mg KI/kg table salt to 20 mg KI/kg. Most of the available studies have a selection bias, studying persons referred to hospital for different reasons. Only studies on school children investigate more random samples of the population. However, in spite of the fact that iodine deficiency does not seem to be eradicated completely by this measure, some tendencies have become apparent. The positive tendencies are: (1) thyroid volume in school children has shrunk in comparison to (historical) data before 1990--leading to lack of goitre in this age group; (2) the expected rise in the incidence of thyrotoxicosis was only transient and not very pronounced--indeed thyrotoxicosis seems to have become rarer now than before; (3) the phenotype of thyroid cancer has changed towards the more benign variants. Negative trends described since 1990 are (1) a small increase in the overall incidence of thyroid cancer (possibly due to better diagnostic tools), and (2) a relative rise of autoimmune thyroid disease. All these tendencies await their substantiation by a nationwide survey that is based on strong epidemiological criteria. "
234,36435289,"The incidence of adolescent mental health disorders is on the rise. Epidemiological studies suggest that poor nutrition is a significant contributor to this public health crisis, specifically through exposure to high level of dietary sugar, including fructose, during critical periods of development. Previous studies have shown that elevated fructose exposure during adolescence disrupts mental health. Despite these data, it is currently unknown how fructose exposure, specifically during infancy, may impact adolescent mental health. We developed a rat experimental protocol to investigate the effects of fructose exposure during infancy on behavioral, cognitive and metabolic endpoints in adolescence. We found that exposing rats to high fructose from birth to weaning resulted in higher circulating glucose, insulin and leptin levels in adolescence. High fructose during infancy also increased bodyweight, disrupted metabolic homeostasis in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) as indicated by decreased activity of the cellular energy sensor AMPK, and impaired attention and impulsivity in a male-specific manner. This impaired attention observed in adolescent male rats following neonatal fructose exposure was partially rescued by viral-mediated, in vivo expression of a constitutively active form of AMPK in principal neurons of the BLA. Our results suggest that exposure to high level of fructose during infancy may impact adolescent mental health in a male-specific manner and that manipulation of AMPK activity may mitigate this impact.

235,11403812,"The diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis in children is difficult in sub-Saharan Africa, because the clinical features overlap with those of other common diseases, and laboratory facilities are inadequate in many areas. We have assessed the value of non-laboratory tests and incomplete laboratory data in diagnosing childhood acute bacterial meningitis in this setting. We prospectively studied 905 children undergoing lumbar puncture at a rural district hospital in Kenya over 1 year. We related microbiological findings and cerebrospinal-fluid (CSF) laboratory measurements to tests that would typically be available at such a hospital. Acute bacterial meningitis was proven in 45 children (5.0% [95% CI 3.7-6.6]) and probable in 26 (2.9% [1.9-4.2]). 21 of the 71 cases of proven or probable acute bacterial meningitis had neither neck stiffness nor turbid CSF. In eight of 45 children with proven disease the CSF leucocyte count was less than 10x10(6)/L or leucocyte counting was not possible because of blood-staining. The presence of either a leucocyte count of 50x10(6)/L or more or a CSF/blood glucose ratio of 0.10 or less detected all but two of the 45 children with proven acute bacterial meningitis; these two samples were grossly blood-stained. The diagnosis of childhood acute bacterial meningitis is likely to be missed in a third of cases at district hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa without adequate and reliable laboratory resources. CSF culture facilities are expensive and difficult to maintain, and greater gains could be achieved with facilities for accurate leucocyte counting and glucose measurement. "

237,1736294,"Glucose is the main fuel for energy metabolism in the normal human brain. It is generally assumed that glucose transport into the brain is not rate-limiting for metabolism. Since brain glucose concentrations cannot be determined directly by radiotracer techniques, we used 13C NMR spectroscopy after infusing enriched D-[1-13C]glucose to measure brain glucose concentrations at euglycemia and at hyperglycemia (range, 4.5-12.1 mM) in six healthy children (13-16 years old). Brain glucose concentrations averaged 1.0 +/- 0.1 mumol/ml at euglycemia (4.7 +/- 0.3 mM plasma) and 1.8-2.7 mumol/ml at hyperglycemia (7.3-12.1 mM plasma). Michaelis-Menten parameters of transport were calculated to be Kt = 6.2 +/- 1.7 mM and Tmax = 1.2 +/- 0.1 mumol/g.min from the relationship between plasma and brain glucose concentrations. The brain glucose concentrations and transport constants are consistent with transport not being rate-limiting for resting brain metabolism at plasma levels greater than 3 mM. "

239,30982874,"Repeated exposure has been found to be an effective strategy to increase acceptability of foods in older children and adults, but little is known about its effectiveness in the birth to 24-mo population. This systematic review was conducted to examine the effects of repeated exposure to a single or multiple foods on acceptance of those or other foods among infants and toddlers. A search was conducted for peer-reviewed articles related to food acceptability, flavor, taste, and infants and toddlers in 12 databases (e.g., PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and CINAHL) with a date range of January 1980 to July 2017. The Nutrition Evidence Library (NEL) Bias Assessment Tool was used to assess potential bias in the included studies, and the NESR grading rubric was used to grade evidence supporting the conclusion statement. From the 10,844 references obtained, 21 studies (19 controlled trials and 2 longitudinal cohort studies) published from 1980 to 2015 were included in this review. Moderate evidence indicates that tasting a single vegetable or fruit or multiple vegetable(s) or fruit(s) 1 food per day for 8-10 or more days is likely to increase acceptability of an exposed food (indicated by an increase in intake or faster rate of feeding after comparison with before the exposure period) in infants and toddlers 4-24 mo old. The effect of repeated exposure on acceptability is likely to generalize to other foods within the same food category but not foods from a different food category. Findings are based on the effects of repeated exposure to mostly vegetables with some findings on repeated exposure to fruits. This review advances the understanding of early food experiences and the development of food acceptability. Additional research is needed using diverse foods and textures with a focus on the transition to table foods. "
240,35904451,"Genetic variation in genes regulating metabolism may be advantageous in some settings but not others. The non-failing adult heart relies heavily on fatty acids as a fuel substrate and source of ATP. In contrast, the failing heart favors glucose as a fuel source. A bootstrap analysis for genes with deviant allele frequencies in cardiomyopathy cases versus controls identified the MTCH2 gene as having unusual variation. MTCH2 encodes an outer mitochondrial membrane protein, and prior genome-wide studies associated MTCH2 variants with body mass index, consistent with its role in metabolism. We identified the referent allele of rs1064608 (p.Pro290) as being overrepresented in cardiomyopathy cases compared to controls, and linkage disequilibrium analysis associated this variant with the MTCH2 cis eQTL rs10838738 and lower MTCH2 expression. To evaluate MTCH2, we knocked down Mtch in Drosophila heart tubes which produced a dilated and poorly functioning heart tube, reduced adiposity and shortened life span. Cardiac Mtch mutants generated more lactate at baseline, and they displayed impaired oxygen consumption in the presence of glucose but not palmitate. Treatment of cardiac Mtch mutants with dichloroacetate, a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor, reduced lactate and rescued lifespan. Deletion of MTCH2 in human cells similarly impaired oxygen consumption in the presence of glucose but not fatty acids. These data support a model in which MTCH2 reduction may be favorable when fatty acids are the major fuel source, favoring lean body mass. However, in settings like heart failure, where the heart shifts toward using more glucose, reduction of MTCH2 is maladaptive. "

242,37364145,"The incidence of diabetic nephropathy (DN) is gradually increasing worldwide. Podocyte injury, such as podocyte apoptosis and loss of the slit diaphragm (SD)-specific markers are early pathogenic features of DN. The cultured mouse podocytes were separated into a high glucose-treated (HG, 30mM) group to mimic DN  The results showed that the decrease in podocyte activity; the increase in podocyte apoptosis; the decreased mRNA and protein expression of nephrin, podocin, WT-1 and MasR; and the upregulated expression of AT1R induced by HG could be reversed by Ang-(1-7). However, these effects were blocked by A779. The possible mechanisms of the Ang-(1-7)-mediated effect depended on MasR. In addition, the protective effect of Ang-(1-7) on podocyte activity was dose-dependent and most obvious at 10 µM. A779 had the greatest antagonistic action against Ang-(1-7) at a concentration of 10 μM. This study reveals that binding of Ang-(1-7) to its specific receptor MasR may counteract the effects of Ang II mediated by AT1R to significantly attenuate podocyte injury induced by high glucose. Ang-(1-7)/MasR targeting in podocytes may be a therapeutic approach to attenuate renal injury in DN. "
243,36849747,"Although the recommended preoperative cessation period for sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) changed in 2020 (from 24 h to 3-4 days preoperatively) to reduce the risk of SGLT2i-associated perioperative ketoacidosis (SAPKA), the validity of the new recommendation has not been verified. Using case reports, we assessed the new recommendation effectiveness and extrapolated precipitating factors for SAPKA. We searched electronic databases up to June 1, 2022 to assess SAPKA (blood pH < 7.3 and blood or urine ketone positivity within 30 days postoperatively in patients taking SGLT2i). We included 76 publications with 99 cases. The preoperative SGLT2i cessation duration was reported for 59 patients (59.6%). In all cases with available cessation periods, the SGLT2is were interrupted < 3 days preoperatively. No SAPKA cases with > 2-day preoperative cessation periods were found. Many case reports lack important information for estimating precipitating factors, including preoperative SGLT2i cessation period, body mass index, baseline hemoglobin A1c level, details of perioperative fluid management, and type of anesthesia. Our study suggested that preoperative SGLT2i cessation for at least 3 days could prevent SAPKA. Large prospective epidemiologic studies are needed to identify risk factors for SAPKA. "
244,15772427,"We compared kinetic indices of pulmonary surfactant metabolism in premature infants (n = 41) with respect to i) tracer ([1-(13)C1]acetate, [U-(13)C6]glucose, and [1,2,3,4-(13)C4] palmitate), ii) phospholipid (PL) pool (total PLs or disaturated PLs), or iii) instrumentation [gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or GC-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectometry (GC-C-IRMS)]. Tracer incorporation was measured in PLs extracted from serial tracheal aspirates after a 24 h tracer infusion. The fractional catabolic rate (FCR), representing the total fractional turnover from all sources of surfactant production, was independent of tracer. The fractional synthesis rate of surfactant PL from plasma palmitate was significantly higher than that from palmitate synthesized de novo from acetate, and these two sources of palmitate together accounted for only half of the total surfactant production in preterm infants. [U-(13)C6]glucose showed significant recycling of the (13)C label in intermediary metabolism, distinguishable by GC-MS but not by GC-C-IRMS, resulting in a slower apparent FCR when GC-C-IRMS was used. The extracted PL pool did not affect the surfactant metabolic indices. We suggest that FCR should be used as a primary measure of surfactant turnover kinetics and that tracers labeling both de novo synthesis (acetate and glucose) and preformed pathways (plasma palmitate) can be used to partition the fractional contribution of each pathway to total production.

245,38011656,"A study of tumour metabolic reprogramming has revealed disease biomarkers and avenues for therapeutic intervention. Metabolic reprogramming in thymoma is currently understudied and largely unknown. This study utilized metabolomics and isotope tracing with 13C-glucose to metabolically investigate thymomas, adjacent thymic tissue and benign thymic lesions. From 2017 to 2021, 20 patients with a suspected thymoma were recruited to this prospective Institutional Review Board approved clinical trial. At the time of surgery, 11 patients were infused with 13C-glucose, a stable, non-radioactive tracer which reports the flow of carbon through metabolic pathways. Samples were analysed by mass spectrometry to measure the abundance of >200 metabolites.13C enrichment was measured in patients who received 13C-glucose infusions. Histological analysis showed that 9 patients had thymomas of diverse subtypes and 11 patients had benign cysts. In our metabolomic analysis, thymomas could be distinguished from both adjacent thymus tissue and benign lesions by metabolite abundances. Metabolites in pyrimidine biosynthesis and glycerophospholipid metabolism were differentially expressed across these tissues.13C-glucose infusions revealed differential labelling patterns in thymoma compared to benign cysts and normal thymus tissue. The lactate/3PG labelling ratio, a metabolic marker in aggressive lung tumours correlated with lactate uptake, was increased in thymomas (1.579) compared to normal thymus (0.945) and benign masses (0.807) (thymic tissue versus tumour P = 0.021, tumour versus benign P = 0.013). We report metabolic biomarkers, including differential 13C labelling of metabolites from central metabolism, that distinguish thymomas from benign tissues. Altered glucose and lactate metabolism warrant further investigation and may provide novel therapeutic targets for thymoma. "

248,12697702,"Culturing rat islets in high glucose (HG) increased 1-(14)C-alpha-ketoisocaproate (KIC) oxidation compared with culturing them in low glucose. Leucine caused insulin secretion (IS) in low glucose but not in HG rat islets, whereas KIC did so in both. Pretreatment with HG for 40 min abolished leucine stimulation of IS by mouse islets and prevented the cytosolic Ca(2+) rise without inhibiting IS and Ca(2+) increments caused by KIC. When islets were pretreated without glucose and glutamine, aminooxyacetic acid (AOA) markedly decreased KIC effects. When islets were pretreated without glucose and with glutamine, AOA potentiated leucine effects but attenuated KIC effects. AOA stimulated glutamine oxidation in the presence but not the absence of +/-2-amino-2-norbornane-carboxylic acid, a nonmetabolized leucine analog. Pretreatment with HG and glutamine partially reversed AOA inhibition of KIC effects. Glucose increased intracellular ATP and GTP, whereas it decreased ADP and GDP in beta HC9 cells. Glutamate dehydrogenase activity of beta HC9 cell extracts was increased by leucine and attenuated by GTP, but it was potentiated by ADP. In conclusion, leucine and KIC stimulated beta-cells via distinct mechanisms. Glutamate dehydrogenase is the sensor of leucine, whereas transamination plays an important role in KIC stimulation of pancreatic beta-cells. "
249,36260750,"The immunosuppressive function ""licensed"" by IFN-γ is a vital attribute of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) widely used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanism and impact of metabolic reprogramming on MSC immunomodulatory plasticity remain unclear. Here, we explored the mechanism by which glucose metabolism affects the immunomodulatory reprogramming of MSCs ""licensed"" by IFN-γ. Our data showed that glucose metabolism regulates the immunosuppressive function of human umbilical cord MSCs (hUC-MSCs) challenged by IFN-γ through the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway. Furthermore, ATP facilitated the cross talk between glucose metabolism and the JAK-STAT system, which stimulates the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STATs, as well as the expression of indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase and programmed cell death-1 ligand. Moreover, ATP synergistically enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of IFN-γ-primed hUC-MSCs against acute pneumonia in mice. These results indicate a novel cross talk between the immunosuppressive function, glucose metabolism, and mitochondrial oxidation and provide a novel targeting strategy to enhance the therapeutic efficacies of hUC-MSCs.

Although the aetiology of T1DM is not completely understood, the pathogenesis of the disease is thought to involve T cell-mediated destruction of β-cells. Islet-targeting autoantibodies that target insulin, 65 kDa glutamic acid decarboxylase, insulinoma-associated protein 2 and zinc transporter 8 - all of which are proteins associated with secretory granules in β-cells - are biomarkers of T1DM-associated autoimmunity that are found months to years before symptom onset, and can be used to identify and study individuals who are at risk of developing T1DM. The type of autoantibody that appears first depends on the environmental trigger and on genetic factors. The pathogenesis of T1DM can be divided into three stages depending on the absence or presence of hyperglycaemia and hyperglycaemia-associated symptoms (such as polyuria and thirst). A cure is not available, and patients depend on lifelong insulin injections; novel approaches to insulin treatment, such as insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitoring and hybrid closed-loop systems, are in development. Although intensive glycaemic control has reduced the incidence of microvascular and macrovascular complications, the majority of patients with T1DM are still developing these complications. Major research efforts are needed to achieve early diagnosis, prevent β-cell loss and develop better treatment options to improve the quality of life and prognosis of those affected. "
253,25783006,"Actin has an ill-defined role in the trafficking of GLUT4 glucose transporter vesicles to the plasma membrane (PM). We have identified novel actin filaments defined by the tropomyosin Tpm3.1 at glucose uptake sites in white adipose tissue (WAT) and skeletal muscle. In Tpm 3.1-overexpressing mice, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was increased; while Tpm3.1-null mice they were more sensitive to the impact of high-fat diet on glucose uptake. Inhibition of Tpm3.1 function in 3T3-L1 adipocytes abrogates insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake. In WAT, the amount of filamentous actin is determined by Tpm3.1 levels and is paralleled by changes in exocyst component (sec8) and Myo1c levels. In adipocytes, Tpm3.1 localizes with MyoIIA, but not Myo1c, and it inhibits Myo1c binding to actin. We propose that Tpm3.1 determines the amount of cortical actin that can engage MyoIIA and generate contractile force, and in parallel limits the interaction of Myo1c with actin filaments. The balance between these actin filament populations may determine the efficiency of movement and/or fusion of GLUT4 vesicles with the PM. "

We examined cord blood sodium, chloride, potassium, glucose, and creatinine to derive maturity-related reference intervals. We examined associations with gestational age, delivery mode, singleton versus multiple, and prenatal maternal adverse conditions. We compared preterm cord values to term, and to adult reference ranges. There were 591 infants, 537 preterm and 54 term. Preterm cord glucose levels were steady (3.7 ± 1.1 mmol/L), while sodium, chloride, and creatinine increased over GA by 0.17, 0.14 mmol/L/week, and 1.07 µmol/L/week, respectively ( Cord blood values varied across the GA range with increases in sodium, chloride, and creatinine, while glucose remained steady.

255,28273456,"Insulin resistance is a chronic inflammatory condition accompanying obesity or high fat diets that leads to type 2 diabetes. It is hypothesized that lipids and gut bacterial compounds in particular contribute to metabolic inflammation by activating the immune system; however, the receptors detecting these ""instigators"" of inflammation remain largely undefined. Here, we show that circulating activators of NOD1, a receptor for bacterial peptidoglycan, increase with high fat feeding in mice, suggesting that NOD1 could be a critical sensor leading to metabolic inflammation. Hematopoietic depletion of NOD1 did not prevent weight gain but protected chimeric mice against diet-induced glucose and insulin intolerance. Mechanistically, while macrophage infiltration of adipose tissue persisted, notably these cells were less pro-inflammatory, had lower CXCL1 production, and consequently, lower neutrophil chemoattraction into the tissue. These findings reveal macrophage NOD1 as a cell-specific target to combat diet-induced inflammation past the step of macrophage infiltration, leading to insulin resistance. "
256,27080638,"There is growing interest in the use of the ketogenic diet (KD) to treat inherited metabolic diseases including mitochondrial disorders. However, neither the mechanism whereby the diet may be working, nor if it could benefit all patients with mitochondrial disease, is known. This study focusses on decanoic acid (C10), a component of the medium chain triglyceride KD, and a ligand for the nuclear receptor PPAR-γ known to be involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. The effects of C10 were investigated in primary fibroblasts from a cohort of patients with Leigh syndrome (LS) caused by nuclear-encoded defects of respiratory chain complex I, using mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme assays, gene expression microarray, qPCR and flow cytometry. Treatment with C10 increased citrate synthase activity, a marker of cellular mitochondrial content, in 50 % of fibroblasts obtained from individuals diagnosed with LS in a PPAR-γ-mediated manner. Gene expression analysis and qPCR studies suggested that treating cells with C10 supports fatty acid metabolism, through increasing ACADVL and CPT1 expression, whilst downregulating genes involved in glucose metabolism (PDK3, PDK4). PCK2, involved in blocking glucose metabolism, was upregulated, as was CAT, encoding catalase. Moreover, treatment with C10 also decreased oxidative stress in complex I deficient (rotenone treated) cells. However, since not all cells from subjects with LS appeared to respond to C10, prior cellular testing in vitro could be employed as a means for selecting individuals for subsequent clinical studies involving C10 preparations.

257,11788664,"The aim of these studies was to determine the metabolic adaptation to fasting and feeding during lactation. Normal lactating (L) and nonlactating (NL) women (n = 6 each) were studied using infusions of [U-13C]glucose and [2-13C]glycerol during: 1) a 24-h fast, and 2) ingestion of Sustacal (protocol 1). In addition, 8 L and 6 NL women were studied during infusion of [6,6-2H2]glucose and ingestion of a glucose meal containing [1-13C]glucose (protocol 2). Protocol 1: Glucose production rate (GPR) during fasting was 33% higher in the L women (12.5 +/- 1.0 vs. 9.4 +/- 0.5 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1); P < 0.03). Fractional gluconeogenesis (GNG), GNG rate, glucose, lactate, beta- hydroxybutyrate, FFA, insulin, and C-peptide were similar in both groups during feeding and fasting, but glycogenolysis was 50% higher in fasting L women. Protocol 2: Although GPR was slightly increased in the L group (L, 1.8 +/- 0.2 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1); NL, 1.2 +/- 0.2 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1); P < 0.04), no other differences were observed in splanchnic and systemic metabolism of ingested glucose between L and NL women. Insulin concentrations were lower in L women compared with controls (L, 15 +/- 3 microU/ml; NL, 28 +/- 6 microU/ml; P = 0.05). In conclusion, the increased glucose demands of lactation are met by increased GPR as a result of increased glycogenolysis but not GNG or by increased use of FFA. During feeding, lactating women handle oral carbohydrates normally but have increased insulin sensitivity. "
258,12815113,"We have previously demonstrated that very premature infants receiving glucose at 17 micromol/kg min plus appropriate supply of parenteral lipids (Intralipid) and amino acids (TrophAmine) maintained normoglycemia by glucose produced primarily via gluconeogenesis. The present study addressed the individual roles of parenteral lipids and amino acids in supporting gluconeogenesis. Fourteen premature infants (993 +/- 36 g 27 +/- 1 wk) (mean +/- SE) were studied for 8 h on d 5 +/- 1 of life. All infants were receiving standard TPN prior to the study. At start of study, the glucose infusion rate was decreased to approximately 17 micromol/kg min and either Intralipid (g + AA; n = 8) or TrophAmine (g + IL; n = 6) was discontinued. Data from 14 previously studied infants receiving glucose (approximately 17 micromol/kg min) + TrophAmine + Intralipid (g + AA + IL) are included for comparison. Gluconeogenesis was measured by [U-13 C]glucose, (g + AA) and (8 infants of the g + AA + IL group) or [2-13C]glycerol, (g + IL) and (6 infants of the g + AA + IL group). Infants studied by the same method were compared. Withdrawal of Intralipid resulted in decreased gluconeogenesis, 6.3 +/- 0.9 (g +AA) vs. 8.4 +/- 0.7 micromol/kg min (g + AA + IL) (p = 0.03). Withdrawal of TrophAmine affected neither total gluconeogenesis, 7.5 +/- 0.8 vs. 7.9 +/- 0.9 micromol/kg min nor gluconeogenesis from glycerol, 4.4 +/- 0.6 vs. 4.9 +/- 0.7 micromol/kg min (g+ IL and g + AA + IL groups, respectively). In conclusion, in parenterally fed very premature infants, lipids play a primary role in supporting gluconeogenesis. "
259,23446960,"Emerging evidence suggests that free glutamate may play a functional role in modulating gastroduodenal motor function. We hypothesized that supplementing monosodium glutamate (MSG) to partial enteral nutrition stimulates gastric emptying in preterm pigs. Ten-day-old preterm, parenterally fed pigs received partial enteral nutrition (25%) as milk-based formula supplemented with MSG at 0, 1.7, 3.0, and 4.3 times the basal protein-bound glutamate intake (468 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1)) from d 4 to 8 of life (n = 5-8). Whole-body respiratory calorimetry and (13)C-octanoic acid breath tests were performed on d 4, 6, and 8. Body weight gain, stomach and intestinal weights, and arterial plasma glutamate and glutamine concentrations were not different among the MSG groups. Arterial plasma glutamate concentrations were significantly higher at birth than after 8 d of partial enteral nutrition. Also at d 8, the significant portal-arterial concentration difference in plasma glutamate was substantial (∼500 μmol/L) among all treatment groups, suggesting that there was substantial net intestinal glutamate absorption in preterm pigs. MSG supplementation dose-dependently increased gastric emptying time and decreased breath (13)CO2 enrichments, (13)CO2 production, percentage of (13)CO2 recovery/h, and cumulative percentage recovery of (13)C-octanoic acid. Circulating glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) concentration was significantly increased by MSG but was not associated with an increase in intestinal mucosal growth. In contrast to our hypothesis, our results suggest that adding MSG to partial enteral nutrition slows the gastric emptying rate, which may be associated with an inhibitory effect of increased circulating GLP-2.

260,36782297,"Adaptations in lipid metabolism are essential to meet the physiological demands of pregnancy and any aberration may result in adverse outcomes for both mother and offspring. However, there is a lack of population-level studies to define the longitudinal changes of maternal circulating lipids from preconception to postpartum in relation to cardiometabolic risk factors. LC-MS/MS-based quantification of 689 lipid species was performed on 1595 plasma samples collected at three time points in a preconception and longitudinal cohort, Singapore PREconception Study of long-Term maternal and child Outcomes (S-PRESTO). We mapped maternal plasma lipidomic profiles at preconception (N = 976), 26-28 weeks' pregnancy (N = 337) and 3 months postpartum (N = 282) to study longitudinal lipid changes and their associations with cardiometabolic risk factors including pre-pregnancy body mass index, body weight changes and glycaemic traits. Around 56% of the lipids increased and 24% decreased in concentration in pregnancy before returning to the preconception concentration at postpartum, whereas around 11% of the lipids went through significant changes in pregnancy and their concentrations did not revert to the preconception concentrations. We observed a significant association of body weight changes with lipid changes across different physiological states, and lower circulating concentrations of phospholipids and sphingomyelins in pregnant mothers with higher pre-pregnancy BMI. Fasting plasma glucose and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) concentrations were lower whereas the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), 2-h post-load glucose and fasting insulin concentrations were higher in pregnancy as compared to both preconception and postpartum. Association studies of lipidomic profiles with these glycaemic traits revealed their respective lipid signatures at three physiological states. Assessment of glycaemic traits in relation to the circulating lipids at preconception with a large sample size (n = 936) provided an integrated view of the effects of hyperglycaemia on plasma lipidomic profiles. We observed a distinct relationship of lipidomic profiles with different measures, with the highest percentage of significant lipids associated with HOMA-IR (58.9%), followed by fasting insulin concentration (56.9%), 2-h post-load glucose concentration (41.8%), HbA1c (36.7%), impaired glucose tolerance status (31.6%) and fasting glucose concentration (30.8%). We describe the longitudinal landscape of maternal circulating lipids from preconception to postpartum, and a comprehensive view of trends and magnitude of pregnancy-induced changes in lipidomic profiles. We identified lipid signatures linked with cardiometabolic risk traits with potential implications both in pregnancy and postpartum life. Our findings provide insights into the metabolic adaptations and potential biomarkers of modifiable risk factors in childbearing women that may help in better assessment of cardiometabolic health, and early intervention at the preconception period.

261,34143300,"Evolution moves in mysterious ways. Excretion of waste products by glomerular filtration made perfect sense when life evolved in the ocean. Yet, the associated loss of water and solutes became a problem when life moved onto land: a serious design change was needed and this occurred in the form of ever more powerful tubules that attached to the glomerulus. By reabsorbing typically more than 99% of the glomerular filtrate, the tubules not only minimise urinary losses, but, crucially, also maintain homeostasis: tubular reabsorption and secretion are adjusted so as to maintain an overall balance, in which urine volume and composition matches intake and environmental stressors. A whole orchestra of highly specialised tubular transport proteins is involved in this process and dysfunction of one or more of these results in the so-called kidney tubulopathies, characterised by specific patterns of clinical and biochemical abnormalities. In turn, recognition of these patterns helps establish a specific diagnosis and pinpoints the defective transport pathway. In this review, we will discuss these clinical and biochemical ""fingerprints"" of tubular disorders of salt-handling and how sodium handling affects volume homeostasis but also handling of other solutes.

262,33799943,"Iodine is an essential micronutrient for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. The proper functioning of the thyroid axis is essential for the normal development of the nervous system, especially in the first trimester of gestation. The aim of the present study was to analyze the perinatal outcomes, anthropometry, and APGAR test scores of newborns and to relate them to maternal thyroid status. A total of 190 newborns participated in the study. No correlation was found between thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and maternal ioduria values in the first trimester of gestation with the weight or length of the newborn, or the APGAR score at one minute after birth. However, we found significant differences between the APGAR scores of children whose mothers had an iodine sufficiency level in the first trimester compared to the children of mothers with iodine deficiency. Similarly, the APGAR scores of children whose mothers had a TSH > 4 have significantly better APGAR scores than the children of mothers with a TSH < 4. Likewise, we found significant differences between the measurements of the newborns depending on whether their mothers smoked. The children of mothers who took iodine supplements or iodized salt obtained the highest APGAR score at one and five minutes after birth. It is essential to focus on recommending adequate consumption of iodine supplements and iodized salt prior to gestation and at least during the first trimester to achieve better fetal well-being. "

Thirty-five interviews were carried out in seven of the 24 districts in the country representing urban, rural, plantation communities and different livelihood and ethnic, gender and age groups in the year 2016. Purposive and snowball sampling techniques were used for selecting interviewees. The data was analysed by using qualitative data analysis techniques and sociological perspectives. This study reveals that the CPSLT use has integrated with the culture of several sociological and livelihood groups. Products such Thool (tobacco powder) and Maawa (dried areca-nut with flaked tobacco and some flavoured chemicals) were identified as the most popular forms of CPSLT.  Use of CPSLT has developed as a silent sub-culture specific to several social and livelihood groups. The informal CPSLT industry operating in the urban and sub-urban areas is influencing the school children and youth engaged in sports. Different groups of users express different reasons and justifications for its use. Use of CPSLT is closely integrated with the day to-day lifestyle and values of people of specific groups. and is an unseen part of life.

265,35098884,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is leading cause of deaths in DM patients. However, there are limited effective medical therapies for diabetic CVD. Vascular endothelial injury caused by DM is a critical risk factor for diabetic CVD. Previous study has indicated that Angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)) may prevent diabetic CVD, whereas it is not clear that Ang-(1-7) whether attenuates diabetic CVD through suppressing vascular endothelial injury. In this study, we found that Ang-(1-7) alleviated high glucose (HG)-induced endothelial injury in bEnd3 cells. Moreover, Ang-(1-7) ameliorated HG-induced endothelial injury through downregulating chloride channel 3 (CIC-3) via Mas receptor. Furthermore, HG-induced CIC-3 enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytokine production and reduced the level of nitric oxide (NO), while Ang-(1-7) preserved the impact of HG-induced CIC-3 on productions of ROS, cytokine and NO through inhibiting CIC-3 via Mas receptor. Summarily, the present study revealed that Ang-(1-7) alleviated HG-induced vascular endothelial injury through the inhibition of CIC-3, suggested that Ang-(1-7) may preserve diabetic CVD through suppressing HG-induced vascular endothelial injury.

266,32945367,"Stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and disability worldwide with limited clinical therapies available. The present study isolated primary astrocytes from the brains of rats and treated them with oxygen‑glucose deprivation and re‑oxygenation (OGD/R) to mimic hypoxia/reperfusion (H/R) injury in vitro to investigate stroke. It was revealed that propofol (2,6‑diisopropylphenol), an intravenous sedative and anesthetic agent, protected against oxygen/glucose‑deprivation (OGD) and induced cell injury. Furthermore, propofol exerted a protective effect by inhibiting gap junction function, which was also revealed to promote cell death in astrocytes. The present study further identified that propofol suppressed gap junction function by downregulating the protein expression levels of connexin43 (Cx43), which is one of the most essential components of gap junctions in astrocytes. In addition, when the expression levels of Cx43 were downregulated using small interfering RNA, OGD/R‑induced cell death was decreased. Conversely, cell death was enhanced when Cx43 was overexpressed, which was reversed following propofol treatment. In summary, propofol protects against OGD‑induced injury in astrocytes by decreasing the protein expression levels of Cx43 and suppressing gap junction function. The present study improved our understanding of how propofol protects astrocytes from OGD/R‑induced injury. "
267,25957423,"This study aimed to investigate the effect of vitamin D on the pathologic changes of podocyte β-catenin and P-cadherin and podocyte permeability induced by diabetic conditions. We cultured mouse podocytes under normal glucose (5 mM, control); high glucose (HG, 30 mM); advanced glycosylation end products (AGE)-added; and HG plus AGE-added conditions and treated with vitamin D. The distribution of podocyte β-catenin and P-cadherin was shown by confocal microscopy, and protein levels of β-catenin and P-cadherin by Western blotting. Podocytes were incubated with vitamin D at the concentrations of 10 nM and 50 nM for 6, 24, and 48 hours. The dextran filtration through monolayered podocytes tended to increase in AGE and HG condition compared to that in B5 at 16 hours in permeability assay, which was improved by vitamin D. In confocal imaging, the distribution of β-catenin and P-cadherin were internally concentrated by diabetic conditions, which was ameliorated by vitamin D. In Western blotting, HG and AGE decreased β-catenin protein levels at 6, 24, and 48 hours and vitamin D improved the decreased β-catenin protein levels at 6, 24, and 48 hours. Advanced glycosylation end products also decreased P-cadherin protein amount by 22.9% and 59.1% (P <.01) at 24 hours, respectively, which was improved by vitamin D. Our results suggest that HG and AGE have an influence on the redistribution of β-catenin and P-cadherin and amount of β-catenin protein of podocytes, thereby causing hyperpermeability, which can be reversed by vitamin D.

268,35324977,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with defective pancreatic β-cell adaptation in pregnancy, but the underlying mechanism remains obscure. Our previous studies demonstrated that GDM women display increased plasma adrenomedullin (ADM) levels, and non-obese GDM mice show decreased serum concentrations of insulin and the number of β-cells in pancreas islets. The aims of this study is to examine if ADM and its receptors are expressed in female mouse pancreas, and if so, whether insulin secretion is regulated by ADM in mouse β-cell line, NIT-1 cells and isolated mouse pancreatic islets. Present study shows that ADM and its receptor components CRLR, RAMPs are present in mouse pancreatic islets and co-localized with insulin. The expressions of ADM, CRLR and RAMP2 in islets from pregnant mice are reduced compared to that of non-pregnant mice. NIT-1-β cells express ADM and its receptor mRNA, and glucose dose-dependently stimulates expressions. Furthermore, ADM inhibits NIT-1-β cell growth, and this inhibition is reversed by ADM antagonist, ADM22-52. The glucose-induced insulin secretion was suppressed by ADM in NIT-1-β cells and isolated pancreatic islets from pregnant mice. These inhibitory effects are accompanied by upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress biomarker genes in NIT-1-β cells. This study unveils that reduced ADM and its receptors may play a role in β-cell adaptation during pregnancy, while increased plasma ADM in GDM may contribute to the β-cells dysfunction, and blockade of ADM may reverse β-cell insulin production.

269,12573620,"Poly-L-lysine with 40% of the epsilon -amino groups substituted with lactosyl residues facilitated the internalization of lactosylated poly-L-lysine/cDNA complexes into cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF airway epithelial cells. It was previously shown that lactosylated poly-L-lysine enhanced the transfer of cDNA into the cell nucleus, resulting in transfection. The cell entry of lactosylated poly-L-lysine/cDNA complexes, however, has not been elucidated and we hypothesized that entry of the complex was by receptor-mediated endocytosis. It is shown here that binding of the vector/cDNA complexes to the cell membrane was inhibited by lactose but not N-acetyl glucosamine. Examination by electron microscopy revealed the complexes in clathrin-coated pits. Furthermore, the complexes colocalized with transferrin during cell entry and were shown in early endosomes. These results demonstrated that lactosylated poly-L-lysine/cDNA complexes enter airway epithelial cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis utilizing lactose-binding receptors, which employ the clathrin-coated pit for internalization. Taken together with the fact that nuclear translocation also is enhanced by lactose, these results demonstrate why lactosylated poly-L-lysine is an excellent vector for transfection of airway epithelial cells. Moreover, other carbohydrates covalently linked to poly-L-lysine for targeting other specific cell types, combined with lactosyl residues, can be designed for the development of other molecular conjugates for gene transfer.

270,2847108,"We used chronic fetal glucose infusion to test the hypothesis that chronic fetal hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia inhibit the development of beta-receptor binding capacity (Bmax) in fetal lamb lung. Glucose was infused (14 +/- 4 mg/kg/h, mean +/- SD) into eight twin and four singleton fetuses from 112 days gestation until death between 118-145 days gestation. The other eight twins and eleven additional singleton fetuses served as controls. Serum glucose levels were elevated 2-fold and serum insulin levels were elevated 3-fold in the glucose-infused fetuses. In the control fetuses beta-receptor Bmax increased 2.5-fold between 130 days gestation and term. However, this increase was attenuated to 1.5-fold in the glucose infused fetuses, p less than 0.01. The 50% inhibition of Bmax was similar in both male and female fetuses, except that the Bmax fell to 30% lower levels in males, p less than 0.01. Chronic glucose infusion also resulted in an 80% reduction in lung lavage saturated phosphatidylcholine content, and an 85% reduction in tracheal fluid saturated phosphatidylcholine content, p less than 0.001. Lung lavage and tracheal fluid saturated phosphatidylcholine content correlated significantly with beta receptor Bmax (r = 0.9, r = 0.85). We conclude that chronic glucose infusion inhibits the development of beta-receptor binding in fetal lamb lung, and that this effect is greater in males than females. Such a mechanism could be a factor in the predisposition of infants of diabetic mothers to develop respiratory distress and could contribute to a male disadvantage in respiratory morbidity. "
271,29790820,"Absolute quantification of PET brain imaging requires the measurement of an arterial input function (AIF), typically obtained invasively via an arterial cannulation. We present an approach to automatically calculate an image-derived input function (IDIF) and cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (CMRGlc) from the [18F]FDG PET data using an integrated PET/MRI system. Ten healthy controls underwent test-retest dynamic [18F]FDG-PET/MRI examinations. The imaging protocol consisted of a 60-min PET list-mode acquisition together with a time-of-flight MR angiography scan for segmenting the carotid arteries and intermittent MR navigators to monitor subject movement. AIFs were collected as the reference standard. Attenuation correction was performed using a separate low-dose CT scan. Assessment of the percentage difference between area-under-the-curve of IDIF and AIF yielded values within ±5%. Similar test-retest variability was seen between AIFs (9 ± 8) % and the IDIFs (9 ± 7) %. Absolute percentage difference between CMRGlc values obtained from AIF and IDIF across all examinations and selected brain regions was 3.2% (interquartile range: (2.4-4.3) %, maximum < 10%). High test-retest intravariability was observed between CMRGlc values obtained from AIF (14%) and IDIF (17%). The proposed approach provides an IDIF, which can be effectively used in lieu of AIF. "
272,32121098,"Obesity is associated with a wide range of chronic diseases, including cancer. It has been noted that the integration of metabolic mechanisms in obese patients may predispose them to suffer from cancer incidence and its progression. Thus, a better understanding of metabolic alterations in obesity, along with the development of feasible therapeutic approaches for intervention, are theoretically relevant to the prevention and treatment of cancer malignancy. Using a syngeneic tumor model involving Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) cells and C57BL/6 mice fed with a high fat diet, obesity was found to be associated with dysregulated glucose and glutamine metabolism, inflammation, along with platelet activation and the promotion of tumor growth. Tumor-bearing lowered glucose levels while moderately increasing inflammation, platelet activation, and glutamine levels. The antiplatelet drug aspirin, mitigated tumor growth in obese mice, paralleled by a decrease in systemic glucose, insulin, inflammation, platelet activation, glutamine and tumor expression of cell proliferation, aerobic glycolysis, glutaminolysis, platelets, and leukocyte molecules. The anti- and pro-cell proliferation, aerobic glycolysis, and glutaminolysis effects of aspirin and glutamine were further demonstrated in a LLC cell study. Although there remains limitations to our experiments, glucose and glutamine metabolism are proposed targets for the anticancer effects of aspirin. "
273,28396264,"Environmental enteropathy (EE), the adverse impact of frequent and numerous enteric infections on the gut resulting in a state of persistent immune activation and altered permeability, has been proposed as a key determinant of growth failure in children in low- and middle-income populations. A theory-driven systems model to critically evaluate pathways through which enteropathogens, gut permeability, and intestinal and systemic inflammation affect child growth was conducted within the framework of the Etiology, Risk Factors and Interactions of Enteric Infections and Malnutrition and the Consequences for Child Health and Development (MAL-ED) birth cohort study that included children from eight countries. Non-diarrheal stool samples (N=22,846) from 1253 children from multiple sites were evaluated for a panel of 40 enteropathogens and fecal concentrations of myeloperoxidase, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and neopterin. Among these same children, urinary lactulose:mannitol (L:M) (N=6363) and plasma alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) (N=2797) were also measured. The temporal sampling design was used to create a directed acyclic graph of proposed mechanistic pathways between enteropathogen detection in non-diarrheal stools, biomarkers of intestinal permeability and inflammation, systemic inflammation and change in length- and weight- for age in children 0-2years of age. Children in these populations had frequent enteric infections and high levels of both intestinal and systemic inflammation. Higher burdens of enteropathogens, especially those categorized as being enteroinvasive or causing mucosal disruption, were associated with elevated biomarker concentrations of gut and systemic inflammation and, via these associations, indirectly associated with both reduced linear and ponderal growth. Evidence for the association with reduced linear growth was stronger for systemic inflammation than for gut inflammation; the opposite was true of reduced ponderal growth. Although Giardia was associated with reduced growth, the association was not mediated by any of the biomarkers evaluated. The large quantity of empirical evidence contributing to this analysis supports the conceptual model of EE. The effects of EE on growth faltering in young children were small, but multiple mechanistic pathways underlying the attribution of growth failure to asymptomatic enteric infections had statistical support in the analysis. The strongest evidence for EE was the association between enteropathogens and linear growth mediated through systemic inflammation. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. "

In previous work we showed that adolescent isolation produced increased reactivity to acute and to repeated stress in female rats, whereas lower corticosterone responses to acute stress and decreased anxiety-related behavior were noted in isolated males. These results indicate a sex specific impact on the effects of social stress in adolescence. However, little is known about whether social isolation impacts behaviors related to affect and whether it does so differently in male and female rats. The present study investigated the impact of adolescent social isolation from day 30-50 of age in male and female Sprague Dawley rats on behavior in the forced swim test at the end of adolescence and in adulthood and on behavior in the sucrose preference test in adulthood. Adult female rats that were isolated in adolescence exhibited increased climbing on the first and second day of the forced swim test and showed an increased preference for sucrose compared to adult females that were group-housed in adolescence. There were no effects in male rats. The results indicate that social isolation in adolescence produces a stable and active behavioral phenotype in adult female rats. "
275,20638985,"The novel islet-specific protein PANcreatic DERived Factor (PANDER; FAM3B) has been extensively characterized with respect to the beta-cell, and these studies suggest a potential function for PANDER in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. Little is known regarding PANDER in pancreatic -cells, which are critically involved in maintaining euglycemia. Here we present the first report elucidating the expression and regulation of PANDER within the alpha-cell. Pander mRNA and protein are detected in alpha-cells, with primary localization to a glucagon-negative granular cytosolic compartment. PANDER secretion from alpha-cells is nutritionally and hormonally regulated by l-arginine and insulin, demonstrating similarities and differences with glucagon. Signaling via the insulin receptor (IR) through the PI3K and Akt/PKB node is required for insulin-stimulated PANDER release. The separate localization of PANDER and glucagon is consistent with their differential regulation, and the effect of insulin suggests a paracrine/endocrine effect on PANDER release. This provides further insight into the potential glucose-regulatory role of PANDER. "
276,17389712,"It has been shown that maternal diabetes increases the risk for obesity, glucose intolerance, and Type 2 diabetes mellitus in the adult life of the offspring. Mechanisms for these effects on the offspring are not well understood, and little information is available to reveal the mechanisms. We studied the effect of maternal diabetes on beta-cell function in the offspring of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rat mothers (STZ-offspring). STZ-offspring did not become glucose intolerant up to 15 wk of age. At this age, however, insulin secretion was significantly impaired, as measured by in vivo and in vitro studies. Consistent with these changes, islet glucose metabolism and some important glucose metabolic enzyme activities were reduced. No significant changes were found in islet morphological analysis. These data indicate that beta-cell function is impaired in adult STZ-offspring; these changes may contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adulthood. "
277,16510212,"The ketogenic diet is an effective treatment for seizures, but the mechanism of action is unknown. It is uncertain whether the anti-epileptic effect presupposes ketosis, or whether the restriction of calories and/or carbohydrate might be sufficient. We found that a relatively brief (24 h) period of low glucose and low calorie intake significantly attenuated the severity of seizures in young Sprague-Dawley rats (50-70 gms) in whom convulsions were induced by administration of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). The blood glucose concentration was lower in animals that received less dietary glucose, but the brain glucose level did not differ from control blood [3-OH-butyrate] tended to be higher in blood, but not in brain, of animals on a low-glucose intake. The concentration in brain of glutamine increased and that of alanine declined significantly with low-glucose intake. The blood alanine level fell more than that of brain alanine, resulting in a marked increase ( approximately 50%) in the brain:blood ratio for alanine. In contrast, the brain:blood ratio for leucine declined by about 35% in the low-glucose group. When animals received [1-(13)C]glucose, a metabolic precursor of alanine, the appearance of (13)C in alanine and glutamine increased significantly relative to control. The brain:blood ratio for [(13)C]alanine exceeded 1, indicating that the alanine must have been formed in brain and not transported from blood. The elevated brain(alanine):blood(alanine) could mean that a component of the anti-epileptic effect of low carbohydrate intake is release of alanine from brain-to-blood, in the process abetting the disposal of glutamate, excess levels of which in the synaptic cleft would contribute to the development of seizures.

278,36674448,"High-fat/sucrose diet feeding in mice causes loss of corneal nerve function and impairs corneal wound healing. While changing to a diet with a low fat/sugar composition and enrichments in complex carbohydrates mitigates the reduction in nerve function, it remains to be determined if it has an effect on corneal wound healing. In this study, 6-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were fed either a normal diet or a high-fat/sucrose diet for 20 weeks. A third group (diet reversal) was placed on a high-fat/sucrose diet for 10 weeks followed by a normal diet for an additional 10 weeks. A central corneal epithelial abrasion wound was created, and wound closure was monitored. Neutrophil and platelet recruitment was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Mice fed the high-fat/sucrose diet-only had greater adiposity (p < 0.005) than normal diet-only fed mice; diet reversal markedly reduced adiposity. Following corneal abrasion, wound closure was delayed by ~6 h (p ≤ 0.01) and, at 30 h post-wounding, fewer neutrophils reached the wound center and fewer extravascular platelets were present at the limbus (p < 0.05). Diet restored normal wound closure and neutrophil and platelet influx in the injured cornea. These data suggest compositional changes to the diet may be an effective diet-based therapeutic strategy for maintaining or restoring corneal health. "
279,15384581,"Lactose is the major carbohydrate of human milk and is also the major osmotic constituent of human milk. Therefore, synthesis of lactose is the major determinant of the volume of milk produced by the lactating human mammary gland. Lactose issynthesized from free glucose and UDP-galactose. Thus, glucose transport is required not only across the plasma membrane but also across an intracellular membrane to the compartment of lactose synthesis. The latter requirement is unique to mammary epithelial cells. Historically, based primarily on subcellular fractionation studies, lactose synthesis was thought to occur in Golgi. Yet, the only known glucose transporter isoform expressed in mammary gland is GLUT1, a plasma membrane glucose transporter. We therefore comprehensively studied the possible role of GLUT1 as a glucose transporter. We tested the hypothesis that changes in the amount, activity, and subcellular targeting of GLUT1 during lactation are consistent with an important role for GLUT1 in the regulation of lactation. The experiments described here summarize our recent work in the lactating mouse mammary gland and inmouse mammary epithelial cells in culture. Theresults demonstrate that GLUT1 is targeted to an intracellular compartment. However, studies in mammary epithelial cells in culture demonstrate that this is not a Golgi compartment, but a low-density, exquisitely Brefeldin A-sensitive compartment of Golgi-related vesicles. This raises the possibility that lactose synthesis does not take place in the Golgiproper. The results strongly suggest that GLUT1 appears to be important in delivery of substrate to the site of lactose synthesis. "
280,34549728,"ER stress and activation of the unfolded protein response in the periphery as well as the central nervous system have been linked to various metabolic abnormalities. Chemically lowering protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK) activity within the hypothalamus leads to decreased food intake and body weight. However, the cell populations required in this response remain undefined. In the current study, we investigated the effects of proopiomelanocortin-specific (POMC-specific) PERK deficiency on energy balance and glucose metabolism. Male mice deficient for PERK in POMC neurons exhibited improvements in energy balance on a high-fat diet, showing decreased food intake and body weight, independent of changes in glucose and insulin tolerances. The plant-based inhibitor of PERK, celastrol, increases leptin sensitivity, resulting in decreased food intake and body weight in a murine model of diet-induced obesity (DIO). Our data extend these observations by demonstrating that celastrol-induced improvements in leptin sensitivity and energy balance were attenuated in mice with PERK deficiency in POMC neurons. Altogether, these data suggest that POMC-specific PERK deficiency in male mice confers protection against DIO, possibly providing a new therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

282,36299907,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is diabetes first diagnosed in pregnancy. GDM, together with its short- and long-term negative outcomes, is increasing in incidence all over the world. The current diagnostic method for GDM, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), is dated and has been reported as inconvenient for women as well as poorly reproducible and reliable. We aimed at assessing the acceptability, feasibility, and accuracy of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) as a diagnostic test for GDM and explore its correlation with the OGTT and risk factors for GDM. In this prospective cohort study, pregnant women due for or having completed OGTT underwent CGM for seven days, performing daily finger-prick blood glucose levels before completing an acceptability questionnaire. Data on GDM risk factors and CGM variability were analyzed and compared with OGTT results. Seventy-three women completed CGM (40 GDM, 33 normal glucose tolerances); 34 concurrently underwent OGTT. CGM was acceptable and generally well-tolerated, with skin irritation/itchiness the only adverse event (11 mild, one severe). CGM and OGTT strongly correlated for fasting glucose values ( CGM was well-tolerated, showing poorer glycaemic control in GDM, and revealing potential misdiagnosis of the OGTT when combined with GDM risk factors. Future research is needed to determine cut-off values for CGM-defined and OGTT-independent screening criteria for GDM. "
283,15888376,"Our objective was to study brain amino acid metabolism in response to ketosis. The underlying hypothesis is that ketosis is associated with a fundamental change of brain amino acid handling and that this alteration is a factor in the anti-epileptic effect of the ketogenic diet. Specifically, we hypothesize that brain converts ketone bodies to acetyl-CoA and that this results in increased flux through the citrate synthetase reaction. As a result, oxaloacetate is consumed and is less available to the aspartate aminotransferase reaction; therefore, less glutamate is converted to aspartate and relatively more glutamate becomes available to the glutamine synthetase and glutamate decarboxylase reactions. We found in a mouse model of ketosis that the concentration of forebrain aspartate was diminished but the concentration of acetyl-CoA was increased. Studies of the incorporation of 13C into glutamate and glutamine with either [1-(13)C]glucose or [2-(13)C]acetate as precursor showed that ketotic brain metabolized relatively less glucose and relatively more acetate. When the ketotic mice were administered both acetate and a nitrogen donor, such as alanine or leucine, they manifested an increased forebrain concentration of glutamine and GABA. These findings supported the hypothesis that in ketosis there is greater production of acetyl-CoA and a consequent alteration in the equilibrium of the aspartate aminotransferase reaction that results in diminished aspartate production and potentially enhanced synthesis of glutamine and GABA. "
284,9521636,"To investigate the contribution of dietary carbohydrate to glutamate and acetyl CoA synthesis, two groups of adult mice were fed a high- (HCD) or a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) in which 5% of the carbohydrate was [U-13C]-glucose. Four animals from each dietary group were killed after 1, 2 and 5 d. The tracer:tracee ratios of [13C3] and [13C6]blood glucose and of the [13C2] and [13C3] isotopomers of blood, mucosal, hepatic and muscle alanine and glutamate were used to calculate the fractional contribution of glucose to the 3-carbon, acetyl CoA and oxaloacetate pools of each tissue. In the HCD mice, glucose contributed 66, 33 and 31% of the acetyl CoA pool of muscle, liver and mucosa, respectively. The contribution of glucose to acetyl CoA was lowered by 33% (P < 0.05) and 55% (P < 0.01) in the liver and muscle of the LCD group, respectively, but was unaltered in the mucosa. Glucose made a minor contribution to glutamate synthesis via oxaloacetate in the liver (23%) and muscle (10%) of the HCD group. The fraction of hepatic and muscle glutamate synthesis derived from glucose was not affected by the diet. We conclude that glucose oxidation in liver and muscle parallels the contribution of carbohydrate to dietary energy and that glucose is not a major carbon precursor for muscle glutamate synthesis. Net glutamate synthesis in extraintestinal tissues is preserved when dietary carbohydrate is restricted. "
285,3131182,"Insulin has been proposed as an important factor in the regulation of growth and differentiation of the small intestine. In the newborn miniature pig, we induced significant physiologic increases in serum insulin and the insulin/glucagon ratio without altering serum glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate, glucagon, cortisol, T3, and T4 using glucose-based total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in one group (group G) compared with a combination of glucose and fat in another group (group G/F). Control animals were sham-operated and fed a pelleted diet (group OC). Duodenal villus surface area and mucosal height were significantly greater in group G/F compared with group G. No other differences between the TPN groups were found in small intestinal growth, mucosal protein, deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid content, and disaccharidase activities. As anticipated, group OC demonstrated increased intestinal length, weight, and villous surface area compared with the TPN groups. Ileal sucrase and jejunal and ileal maltase activities were greater in the TPN groups compared with those in group OC. Physiologic changes in serum insulin and the insulin/glucagon ratio induced by the TPN fuel mix do not appear to have altered small intestinal growth, composition, and differentiation in the healthy small intestine.

286,28426686,"The immune system is necessary for protecting against various pathogens. However, under certain circumstances, self-reactive immune cells can drive autoimmunity, like that exhibited in type 1 diabetes (T1D). CD4+ T cells are major contributors to the immunopathology in T1D, and in order to drive optimal T cell activation, third signal reactive oxygen species (ROS) must be present. However, the role ROS play in mediating this process remains to be further understood. Recently, cellular metabolic programs have been shown to dictate the function and fate of immune cells, including CD4+ T cells. During activation, CD4+ T cells must transition metabolically from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis to support proliferation and effector function. As ROS are capable of modulating cellular metabolism in other models, we sought to understand if blocking ROS also regulates CD4+ T cell activation and effector function by modulating T cell metabolism. To do so, we utilized an ROS scavenging and potent antioxidant manganese metalloporphyrin (MnP). Our results demonstrate that redox modulation during activation regulates the mTOR/AMPK axis by maintaining AMPK activation, resulting in diminished mTOR activation and reduced transition to aerobic glycolysis in diabetogenic splenocytes. These results correlated with decreased Myc and Glut1 upregulation, reduced glucose uptake, and diminished lactate production. In an adoptive transfer model of T1D, animals treated with MnP demonstrated delayed diabetes progression, concurrent with reduced CD4+ T cell activation. Our results demonstrate that ROS are required for driving and sustaining T cell activation-induced metabolic reprogramming, and further support ROS as a target to minimize aberrant immune responses in autoimmunity.

287,28054648,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a global pandemic. Currently, the drugs used to treat T2D improve hyperglycemic symptom of the disease but the underlying mechanism causing the high blood glucose levels have not been fully resolved. Recently published data showed that salt form of niclosamide improved glucose metabolism in high fat fed mice via mitochondrial uncoupling. However, based on our previous work we hypothesised that niclosamide might also improve glucose metabolism via inhibition of the glucagon signalling in liver in vivo. In this study, mice were fed either a chow or high fat diet containing two different formulations of niclosamide (niclosamide ethanolamine salt - NENS or niclosamide - Nic) for 10 weeks. We identified both forms of niclosamide significantly improved whole body glucose metabolism without altering total body weight or body composition, energy expenditure or insulin secretion or sensitivity. Our study provides evidence that inhibition of the glucagon signalling pathway contributes to the beneficial effects of niclosamide (NENS or Nic) on whole body glucose metabolism. In conclusion, our results suggest that the niclosamide could be a useful adjunctive therapeutic strategy to treat T2D, as hepatic glucose output is elevated in people with T2D and current drugs do not redress this adequately.

288,14578291,"Rapamycin (sirolimus) is a macrolide fungicide with immunosuppressant properties that is used in human islet transplantation. Little is known about the effects of rapamycin on MIN-6 cells and islets. Rapamycin had a dose-dependent, time-dependent, and glucose-independent deleterious effect on MIN-6 cell viability. At day 1, using the MTT method, 0.01 nmol/l rapamycin reduced cell viability to 83 +/- 6% of control (P < 0.05). Using the calcein AM method, at day 2, 10 nmol/l rapamycin caused a reduction in cell viability to 73 +/- 5% of control (P < 0.001). Furthermore, 10 and 100 nmol/l rapamycin caused apoptosis in MIN-6 cells as assessed by the transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay. Compared with control, there was a 3.1 +/- 0.6-fold increase (P < 0.01) in apoptosis in MIN-6 cells treated with 10 nmol/l rapamycin. A supra-therapeutic rapamycin concentration of 100 nmol/l significantly impaired glucose- and carbachol-stimulated insulin secretion in rat islets and had a deleterious effect on the viability of rat and human islets, causing apoptosis of both alpha- and beta-cells.

289,14573810,"Group B coxsackieviruses (CVBs) have a well-established association with type 1 diabetes but the mechanism of depletion of beta-cell mass following infection has not yet been defined. In this report we show that the major difference in pathogenesis between the E2 diabetogenic strain of CVB4 and the prototypic JVB strain in SJL mice is not in tropism for islet cells but in the degree of damage inflicted on the exocrine pancreas and the resulting capacity for regeneration of both acinar and islet tissue by the host. Both strains replicated to a high titre in acinar tissue up to day 3 post-infection (p.i.), while the islets of Langerhans were largely spared. However, the pancreas in the JVB-infected animals then regenerated and many small islets were seen throughout the tissue by day 10 p.i. In contrast, the acinar tissue in E2-infected mice became increasingly necrotic until all that remained by day 21 p.i. were large islets containing varying numbers of dead cells, caught up in strands of connective tissue. Surviving beta cells were found to synthesize little insulin, although islet amyloid polypeptide was detected and glucagon synthesis in alpha cells appeared normal or enhanced. Our results suggest that the key to CVB-E2-induced damage lies in the exocrine tissue and prevention of islet neogenesis rather than from direct effects on existing islets. "
290,36938582,"Previous work found poor reproducibility for measures of glycemia in individuals at risk for dysglycemia. Differences between youth and adults have not been assessed. Using youth and adults in the Restoring Insulin Secretion Study, we tested variability and classification concordance for hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c), fasting and 2-hour glucose from oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs). HbA1c and glucose on repeated samples obtained ∼6 weeks apart were compared in 66 youth (mean age 14.2 years) and 354 adults (52.7 years). Changes, coefficient of variation (CV), and concordance of diagnostic categories between the 2 visits were compared. Mean difference between the 2 visits in HbA1c was higher in youth than adults (P < .001), while fasting glucose was similar and 2-hour glucose was lower in youth (P = .051). CV was smallest for HbA1c compared to fasting and 2-hour glucose. For HbA1c, youth had higher CV (P < .001); whereas CV for 2-hour glucose was lower for youth (P = .041). Classification concordance by HbA1c was lower in youth (P = .004). Using OGTT or HbA1c for classification, intervisit variability produced discordant classification in 20% of youth and 28% of adults. Using both fasting glucose and HbA1c, intervisit variability reduced discordant classification to 16% of adults while not improving classification in youth. Poor reproducibility and lack of classification concordance highlight the limitations of one-time testing, with important implications for assessing eligibility in clinical trials. Consideration should be given to using more than a single parameter for screening and diagnosis, especially when classification category is important. "
291,27999189,"Müller cells are retinal glial cells and exhibit a fibroblast-like phenotype and ability to migrate in diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, expression of mesenchymal markers, which promote fibrosis in various organs, has not been characterized in the diabetic retina. We examined changes in the expression of these markers in Müller cells exposed to high glucose and in animal models of diabetic retinopathy. High glucose conditions increased mesenchymal maker expression and migration in Müller cells. Snail, N-cadherin, Vimentin, β-catenin, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) levels were all dramatically increased in retinas from humans with diabetic retinopathy (DR) and from DR mouse models. In addition, Snail overexpression increased the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and fibronectin, while Snail knockdown attenuated high glucose-induced increases in fibronectin and CTGF expression. These results demonstrate for the first time that mesenchymal markers are upregulated in retinas from a diabetic mouse model, and that Snail and N-cadherin levels are also increased in Müller cells exposed to high glucose. This suggests mesenchymal proteins may play a crucial role in the development of DR. "
292,28943428,"The insulin-regulated glucose transporter, GluT4, is a key molecule in peripheral insulin signaling. Although GluT4 is abundantly expressed in neurons of specific brain regions such as the hippocampus, the functional role of neuronal GluT4 is unclear. Here, we used pharmacological inhibition of GluT4-mediated glucose uptake to determine whether GluT4 mediates insulin-mediated glucose uptake in the hippocampus. Consistent with previous reports, we found that glucose utilization increased in the dorsal hippocampus of male rats during spontaneous alternation (SA), a hippocampally-mediated spatial working memory task. We previously showed that insulin signaling within the hippocampus is required for processing this task, and that administration of exogenous insulin enhances performance. At baseline levels of hippocampal insulin, inhibition of GluT4-mediated glucose uptake did not affect SA performance. However, inhibition of an upstream regulator of GluT4, Akt, did impair SA performance. Conversely, when a memory-enhancing dose of insulin was delivered to the hippocampus prior to SA-testing, inhibition of GluT4-mediated glucose transport prevented cognitive enhancement. These data suggest that baseline hippocampal cognitive processing does not require functional hippocampal GluT4, but that cognitive enhancement by supra-baseline insulin does. Consistent with these findings, we found that in neuronal cell culture, insulin increases glucose utilization in a GluT4-dependent manner. Collectively, these data demonstrate a key role for GluT4 in transducing the procognitive effects of elevated hippocampal insulin. "
293,27090298,"The enzyme FASN (fatty acid synthase) is potentially related with hypertension and metabolic dysfunction. FASN is highly expressed in the human placenta. We aimed to investigate the relationship circulating FASN has with blood pressure, maternal metabolism and newborn parameters in healthy pregnant women. Circulating FASN was assessed in 115 asymptomatic pregnant women in the second trimester of gestation along with C-peptide, fasting glucose and insulin, post-load glucose lipids, HMW-adiponectin and blood pressure (the latter was assessed in each trimester of gestation). At birth, newborns and placentas were weighed. FASN expression was also able to be assessed in 80 placentas. Higher circulating FASN was associated with lower systolic blood pressure (SBP), with a more favourable metabolic phenotype (lower fasting glucose and insulin, post load glucose, HbAc1, HOMA-IR and C-peptide), and with lower placental and birth weight (all p < 0.05 to p < 0.001). Placental FASN expression related positively to circulating FASN (p < 0.005) and negatively to placental weight (p < 0.05). Our observations suggest a physiological role of placental FASN in human pregnancy. Future studies will clarify whether circulating FASN of placental origin does actually regulate placental and fetal growth, and (thereby) has a favourable influence on the pregnant mother's insulin sensitivity and blood pressure.

294,17148009,"Prematurity and low birth weight are important determinants of neonatal morbidity and mortality. A rising trend of preterm births is caused by an increase in the birth rate of near-term infants. Near-term infants are defined as infants of 34 to 36 6/7 weeks gestation. It is dangerous to assume that the incidence of hypoglycemia in the later preterm infant is similar to the infant born at full term. Although current methods for assessing effects of hypoglycemia are imperfect, the injury to central nervous system depends on the degree of prematurity, presence of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), intrauterine compromise, genotype, blood flow, metabolic rate, and availability of other substrates. Therefore, early recognition of glucose metabolic abnormalities pertaining to late preterm infants is essential to provide appropriate and timely interventions in the newborn nursery. Although many of the investigations have targeted full-term infants, premature infants inclusive of the extremely low birth weight infants and the intrauterine growth-restricted infants, adequately powered studies restricted to only the late preterm infants are required and need future consideration.

295,14733908,"Studies in cultured cells have implicated protein tyrosine phosphatase alpha (PTPalpha) as a potential regulator of insulin signaling. The physiological role of PTPalpha in insulin action was investigated using gene-targeted mice deficient in PTPalpha. PTPalpha-null animals had normal body weights and circulating levels of glucose and insulin in random fed and fasted states. In glucose and insulin tolerance tests, their efficiency of blood glucose clearance was comparable to wild-type mice. Kinetics and extents of insulin-stimulated insulin receptor and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation were similar in wild-type and PTPalpha(-/-) liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. However, the association of IRS-1 and PI 3-K was altered in PTPalpha(-/-) liver, with increased insulin-independent and reduced insulin-stimulated association compared to wild-type samples. This did not affect activation of the downstream signaling effector Akt. Our data indicate that PTPalpha is not a negative regulator of insulin signaling and does not perform an essential role in mediating the physiological action of insulin. "
296,11677209,"Previous studies indicate that amino acids and glucose are the major oxidative substrates for intestinal energy generation. We hypothesized that low protein feeding would lower the contribution of amino acids to energy metabolism, thereby increasing the contribution of glucose. Piglets, implanted with portal, arterial, and duodenal catheters and a portal flow probe, were fed isocaloric diets of either a high protein (0.9 g/[kg/h] protein, 1.8 g/[kg/h] carbohydrate, and 0.4 g/[kg/h] lipid) or a low protein (0.4 g/[kg/h] protein, 2.2 g/[kg/h] carbohydrate, and 0.5 g/[kg/h] lipid) content. They received enteral or intravenous infusions of [1-13C]leucine (n = 17), [U-13C]glucose (n = 15), or enteral [U-13C]glutamate (n = 8). CO2 production by the splanchnic bed was not affected by the diet. The oxidation of leucine, glutamate, and glucose accounted for 82% of the total CO2 production in high protein-fed pigs. Visceral amino acid oxidation was substantially suppressed during a low protein intake. Although glucose oxidation increased to 50% of the total visceral CO2 production during a low protein diet, this increase did not compensate entirely for the fall in amino acid oxidation. Although low protein feeding increases the contribution of enteral glucose oxidation to total CO2 production, this adaptation is insufficient. To compensate for the fall in amino acid oxidation, other substrates become increasingly important to intestinal energy generation. "
297,1381681,"A technique for in situ vascular eye perfusion (VEP) in the guinea-pig has been developed for measurements of the blood-ocular transport kinetics of substrates under controlled conditions of arterial inflow. The blood-aqueous and blood-vitreous barriers remained intact to the vascular space marker [3H]dextran (MW 70 kDa) with the perfusion pressure maintained between 80 and 100 mmHg. Several 3H-, 14C- or 35S-labeled amino acids, and 3H- or 14C-labeled sucrose (extracellular space marker) were used to validate the VEP model for transport kinetic studies. Multiple time-point graphic analysis was used to estimate the compartmental unidirectional blood-ocular transport constants, K(in), within the 20 min period of the VEP experiment. Blood-to-aqueous humor K(in) values for [3H]serine, [14C]N-methyl-alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (MeAIB) and [3H] or ]14C]sucrose were 3.57 +/- 0.38, 1.21 +/- 0.13 and 1.13 +/- 0.17 microliters min-1 g-1, respectively. The respective blood-to-lens K(in) values for labeled serine, MeAIB and sucrose were 1.71 +/- 0.19, 0.09 +/- 0.03 and 0.03 +/- 0.002 microliters min-1 g-1. The uptake of newly secreted amino acids from the aqueous humor in the lens followed the order: [35S]methionine greater than [3H]serine greater than or equal to [35S]cysteine greater than or equal to [3H]alanine greater than [14C]cycloleucine greater than or equal to [14C]MeAIB greater than or equal to [3H] or [14C]sucrose.

298,22975064,"Ghrelin is the only known circulating orexigenic hormone that increases food intake and promotes adiposity, and these physiological functions of ghrelin are mediated through its receptor growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R). Ghrelin/GHS-R signaling plays a crucial role in energy homeostasis. Old GHS-R null mice exhibit a healthy phenotype-lean and insulin sensitive. Interestingly, the GHS-R null mice have increased energy expenditure, yet exhibit no difference in food intake or locomotor activity compared to wild-type mice. We have found that GHS-R is expressed in brown adipose tissue (BAT) of old mice. Ablation of GHS-R attenuates age-associated decline in thermogenesis, exhibiting a higher core body temperature. Indeed, the BAT of old GHS-R null mice reveals enhanced thermogenic capacity, which is consistent with the gene expression profile of increases in glucose/lipid uptake, lipogenesis, and lipolysis in BAT. The data collectively suggest that ghrelin/GHS-R signaling has important roles in thermogenesis. The recent discovery that BAT also regulates energy homeostasis in adult humans makes the BAT a new antiobesity target. Understanding the roles and molecular mechanisms of ghrelin/GHS-R in thermogenesis is of great significance. GHS-R antagonists might be a novel means of combating obesity by shifting adiposity balance from obesogenesis to thermogenesis. "
299,20872231,"A small 12-kb haplotype upstream of the AKT1 gene has been found to be associated with insulin resistance phenotypes. We sought to define the functional consequences of the three component polymorphic loci (rs1130214, rs10141867, rs33925946) on AKT1 and the upstream ZBTB42 gene. 5' RACE analysis of AKT1 transcripts in human skeletal muscle biopsies showed the predominant promoter to be 2.5 kb upstream of exon 2, and distinct from those promoters previously reported in rat. We then studied the effect of each of the three haplotype polymorphisms in transcriptional reporter assays in muscle, bone, and fat cell culture models, and found that each modulated enhancer and repressor activity are in a cell-specific and differentiation-specific manner. Our results in promoter assays are consistent with the human phenotype data; we found an anabolic effect on muscle and bone with increased mRNA expression of AKT1, and catabolic effect on fat with decreased expression. To test the hypothesis that rs10141867 affects transcription levels of the novel zinc finger protein ZBTB42 in vivo, we developed the allele-specific expression assay using Taqman technology to test for allelic differences within heterozygotes. The allele containing the derived polymorphism (haplotype H2) showed a 1.75-fold increase in expression in human skeletal muscle. Our data show a particularly complex effect of the component polymorphisms of a single haplotype on cells and tissues, suggesting that the coordination of different tissue-specific effects may have driven selection for the H2 haplotype. In light of the recent abundance of SNP association studies, our approach can serve as a method for exploring the biological function of polymorphisms that show significant genotype/phenotype associations.

300,10709809,"Positron emission tomography (PET) is a relatively noninvasive neuroimaging method by means of which a large variety of human brain functions can be assessed. Localized neurochemical abnormalities detected by PET were found in patients with partial epilepsy and suggested the use of this modality for localizing epileptogenic regions of the brain. The clinical usefulness of PET is determined by its sensitivity and specificity for identifying epileptogenic areas as defined by ictal surface and intracranial EEG recordings. The findings obtained from comparative EEG and glucose PET data are reviewed with special emphasis on patients undergoing presurgical evaluation because of medically intractable temporal and extratemporal lobe epilepsy. The utility of glucose PET studies for identifying regions of seizure onset is presented, and the limited specificity of glucose metabolic abnormalities for the detection of various EEG patterns in clinical epilepsy is discussed. The authors review the available intracranial EEG and PET comparisons using [11C]flumazenil (FMZ) PET, a tracer for the assessment of tau-amino-butyric acid/benzodiazepine receptor function. They also summarize their experience with [11C]flumazenil PET in identifying cortical regions that show various ictal and interictal cortical EEG abnormalities in patients with extratemporal seizure origin. Finally, the authors demonstrate that further development of new PET tracers, such as alpha-[11C]methyl-L-tryptophan, is feasible and clinically useful and may increase the number of patients in whom PET studies can replace invasive EEG monitoring.

301,9486170,"Infant pigs (8.5 kg) were fasted for 16 h and infused for 6 h with [U-13C]glucose. The fractional abundances of all 13C mass isotopomers of plasma glucose, lactate, and pyruvate and of plasma, hepatic, and very low density lipoprotein apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) alanine, glutamate, and aspartate were measured. The ratios of [13C3]aspartate. [13C3]glutamate, and [13C3]alanine in apoB-100 were used to estimate the positional equilibrium of [13C3]oxaloacetate, the fractional contribution of pyruvate carboxylase to the hepatic oxaloacetate flux, and the activity of hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase. The values were compared with those based on glucose labeling and previously published equations. The two methods [Katz and Lee method (J. Katz, P.A. Wals., and W.-N. P. Lee. J. Biol. Chem. 264: 12994-13001, 1989) and apoB method] gave similar estimates of the positional equilibrium of [13C3]oxaloacetate (0.59, Katz and Lee method; 0.61, apoB method) but slightly different estimates of the contribution of pyruvate carboxylase to the oxaloacetate flux (0.36, Katz and Lee; 0.31 apoB). Gluconeogenesis apparently contributed between 71 (Katz and Lee method) and 80% (apoB method) of the glucose entry rate (25 mumol.kg-1.min-1), and pyruvate dehydrogenase contributed 20% of the hepatic acetyl-CoA. We conclude that the labeling of aspartate in apoB-100 provides a good estimate of the isotopomer distribution in hepatic oxaloacetate but may underestimate the absolute isotopic enrichment by 50%. "
302,8777660,"The potential of sucrose to reduce the pain response in a group of healthy premature infants was investigated. Fifteen infants of 32-34 weeks postmenstrual age were tested in a blind crossover manner on two separate occasions no more than two days apart. Either 1 ml of 25% sucrose solution or sterile water was syringed into the baby's mouth 2 minutes before routine heel lancing. Response to the painful stimuli was measured by duration of cry and by facial expression (pain score). There was a significant reduction in the duration of first cry, the percentage of time spent crying in the 5 minutes after heel prick, and the pain score in the sucrose treated group. It is concluded that sucrose has analgesic effects in healthy premature infants. "
303,36346619,"To assess the diurnal patterns of postprandial glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, 19 subjects with type 2 diabetes (8 women; 60 ± 11 years; BMI 32 ± 5 kg/m2) and 19 anthropometrically matched subjects with no diabetes (ND; 11 women; 53 ± 12 years; BMI 29 ± 5 kg/m2) were studied during breakfast (B), lunch (L), and dinner (D) with identical mixed meals (75 g carbohydrates) on 3 consecutive days in a randomized Latin square design. Three stable isotopes of glucose were ustilized to estimate meal fluxes, and mathematical models were used in estimating indices of insulin action and β-cell function. Postmeal glucose excursions were higher at D versus B and at D versus L in type 2 diabetes (P < 0.05), while in ND they were higher at D versus B (P = 0.025) and at L versus B (P = 0.04). The insulin area under the curve was highest at B compared with L and D in type 2 diabetes, while no differences were observed in ND. Disposition index (DI) was higher at B than at L (P < 0.01) and at D (P < 0.001) in ND subjects, whereas DI was low with unchanging pattern across B-L-D in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, between-meal differences in β-cell responsivity to glucose (F) and insulin sensitivity (SI) were concurrent with changes in the DI within groups. Fasting and postmeal glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations, along with estimates of endogenous glucose production (EGP), Rd, SI, F, hepatic extraction of insulin, insulin secretion rate, extracted insulin, and DI, were altered in type 2 diabetes compared with ND (P < 0.011 for all). The data show a diurnal pattern of postprandial glucose tolerance in overweight otherwise glucose-tolerant ND individuals that differs from overweight individuals with type 2 diabetes. The results not only provide valuable insight into management strategies for better glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes, but also improved understanding of daytime glucose metabolism in overweight individuals without impaired glucose tolerance or overt diabetes.

304,3054267,"Thyroid volume was examined by ultrasonography in 207 boys and 220 girls aged 15-16 years from East Slovakia and it was found that 49.3% of the boys and 52.3% of the girls had thyroids between 10 and 15 ml. These thyroid volumes resemble those found in school children from areas of mild iodine deficiency (e.g. FRG) and are twice as large as those reported from Sweden, where iodine intake is sufficient. The findings were compared to these reported by others in 1949-53 before the introduction of iodine prophylaxis. It may be concluded that 40 years of goiter prophylaxis with iodized salt, though resulting in urinary excretion of approximately 100 micrograms/24 hr (as found by others in 1984), abolished large and medium size goiters in adolescents and decreased a prevalence of goiter grade I to about 25 percent, but appeared still to be insufficient to prevent goiter grade I completely.

305,24807789,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that are involved in numerous biological processes, including obesity and insulin resistance. miR-26b is an obesity-related intronic miRNA located in the intron of the carboxy‑terminal domain, RNA polymerase II, polypeptide A, small phosphatase 1 gene. miR-26b is abundantly expressed in mice and mature human adipocytes, and is associated with the expression of adipokines. In the present study, the effects of energy-source materials and hormones associated with obesity, on miR-26b expression were investigated. It was demonstrated that free fatty acids (FFAs), glucose, glucocorticoids and growth hormone (GH) downregulate the expression of miR-26b in human adipocytes. The results indicate that the expression of miR-26b is affected by a variety of factors that are correlated with obesity and insulin sensitivity. Therefore, miR-26b may be an important mediator in the development of obesity‑associated insulin resistance. "
306,1283663,"The efficacy and safety of malto-dextrin/glycine-based oral rehydration solution (ORS) when compared with the glucose-based oral rehydration solution (WHO) was evaluated in a randomized double-blind clinical trial. Thirty-one subjects and 31 controls were studied. The mean values of the ORS intake, stool output, duration of diarrhoea, urine output, weight gain and serum electrolytes were comparable in both the study and the control groups (p > 0.05). It was found that the malto-dextrin/glycine ORS offered no therapeutic advantage over the standard glucose ORS (WHO). In view of the accidental preponderance of children of significantly lower nutritional status among the control group (p < 0.05), it is likely that the efficacy of malto-dextrin/glycine ORS might actually be less than that of the glucose ORS.

307,30788055,"Taste perception is influenced by both nutritional factors and psychological factors. This study was undertaken to measure the 4 basic taste perceptions, nutrient intake, and mental health, and to examine the factors that affect insensitive taste perception in young Japanese women. Young women in their late teens and twenties were enrolled as subjects. Taste perception was measured by applying the filter-paper disc method over areas of the chorda tympani nerve. Nutritional status was evaluated using brief, self-administered diet history questionnaires. The index of nutritional status was based on the 2015 Japanese dietary reference intakes. Mental health was assessed using the Japanese translation of the Profile of Mood States short version. This study was approved by the ethical committee at Osaka University. The normal taste perception group (four basic tastes [sweet, salty, sour, and bitter] identified as normal taste perception) comprised 55.4% of the subjects, while the abnormal taste perception group (more than 1 abnormal taste perception was perceived, regardless of flavor) comprised 44.6% of the subjects. There were no significant differences in nutrient intake (except manganese) and mental health between the normal and abnormal taste perception groups. Subjects who took 5 mg to less than 7.1 mg zinc per day were at significantly decreased risk of insensitive taste perception compared to subjects who consumed less than 5 mg zinc per day [Regression coefficient 0.831, 95% confidence interval 0.694-0.996]. The present results suggest that insensitive taste perception could be associated with zinc deficiency in young women in their late teens and twenties. "
308,31616973,"Voluntary salt iodization at 50 mg/kg salt ensures adequate iodine nutrition in Swedish school-aged children, but iodine status in pregnant women is uncertain. We conducted a cross-sectional national study of 743 pregnant women, at median gestational age of 23 weeks (IQR 9, 38), recruited from maternal health care centers. We measured: urinary iodine concentration (UIC) and urinary creatinine concentration in spot urine samples; thyroglobulin (Tg), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and total thyroxine (tT4) on dried blood spots (DBS); and thyreoperoxidase antibodies in serum samples. Data on dietary supplement use were obtained, and women were classified as supplement users (consuming multivitamins containing ≥ 150 µg iodine/day) and non-supplement users (no supplements or < 150 µg iodine/day from supplements). Overall median UIC [bootstrapped 95% confidence interval (CI)] was 101 µg/L (95, 108; n = 737): 149 µg/L (132, 164) in supplement users (n = 253) and 85 µg/L (79, 92) in non-supplement users (n = 440) (p < 0.001). Overall geometric mean DBS-Tg (95% CI) was 22.1 μg/L (20.8, 23.5; n = 675) and the prevalence of elevated DBS-Tg was 19%. DBS-Tg was lower in supplement users (n = 229) than in non-supplement users (n = 405) (19.1 vs 24.4 μg/L, p < 0.001). DBS-TSH, DBS-tT4, and S-TPOab positivity did not differ between the two groups. Pregnant women in Sweden have inadequate iodine nutrition. Women not taking iodine supplements containing ≥ 150 µg iodine/day are affected by mild iodine deficiency and are at higher risk for increased thyroid activity, while maintaining euthyroidism. Iodine intake should be improved in women both before and after conception by promotion of iodized salt instead of non-iodized salt. We urge regular monitoring of iodine status in the general Swedish population, as well as in risk groups. "
309,28931411,"Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder with a higher mortality than that of the general population. Most of the deaths are due to cardiovascular causes and are related to metabolic risks. This risk is due not only to antipsychotics but also to inherent factors of the disorder. Studies in the West have shown topiramate to be effective in schizophrenia to reduce weight gain and for symptomatic control. Whether this is effective for South Asians is not known. It is important because South Asians have a higher risk of metabolic syndrome. We aim to conduct a double-blind, randomized controlled trial comparing topiramate add-on therapy with treatment as usual with antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia in an outpatient setting in Sri Lanka. Ninety patients with schizophrenia presenting to the Colombo North Teaching Hospital will be randomized to intervention and control groups equally using permuted block randomization. Patients with comorbid metabolic disorders and taking prescribed weight-controlling medications will be excluded. The intervention group will be prescribed topiramate in addition to their antipsychotics in a predefined dosing regimen targeting a dose of 100 mg per day. The control subjects are to receive a placebo. As the primary outcome, anthropometric measurements including weight, waist circumference, skinfold thickness, and body mass index will be recorded at baseline and monthly during the study period of 3 months. The secondary outcome is the change in symptoms according to the clinician-administered Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Assessment of capacity will be performed and informed consent obtained from all subjects. Ethics approval has been obtained from the ethical review committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya, and the trial has been registered in the Sri Lanka Clinical Trials Registry. In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, we will attempt to assess the effectiveness of topiramate as an add-on therapy compared with treatment as usual for weight control in patients with schizophrenia. To our knowledge, this is the first such study in South Asia, where metabolic risks are found to be higher than in the West and could have unique ethnic factors related to weight gain in schizophrenia.

310,37582096,"Whether food source or energy mediates the effect of fructose-containing sugars on blood pressure (BP) is unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of different food sources of fructose-containing sugars at different levels of energy control on BP. We searched MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library through June 2021 for controlled trials ≥7-days. We prespecified 4 trial designs: substitution (energy matched substitution of sugars); addition (excess energy from sugars added); subtraction (excess energy from sugars subtracted); and ad libitum (energy from sugars freely replaced). Outcomes were systolic and diastolic BP. Independent reviewers extracted data. GRADE assessed the certainty of evidence. We included 93 reports (147 trial comparisons, N = 5,213) assessing 12 different food sources across 4 energy control levels in adults with and without hypertension or at risk for hypertension. Total fructose-containing sugars had no effect in substitution, subtraction, or ad libitum trials but decreased systolic and diastolic BP in addition trials (P<0.05). There was evidence of interaction/influence by food source: fruit and 100% fruit juice decreased and mixed sources (with sugar-sweetened beverages [SSBs]) increased BP in addition trials and the removal of SSBs (linear dose response gradient) and mixed sources (with SSBs) decreased BP in subtraction trials. The certainty of evidence was generally moderate. Food source and energy control appear to mediate the effect of fructose-containing sugars on BP. The evidence provides a good indication that fruit and 100% fruit juice at low doses (up to or less than the public health threshold of ~10% E) lead to small, but important reductions in BP, while the addition of excess energy of mixed sources (with SSBs) at high doses (up to 23%) leads to moderate increases and their removal or the removal of SSBs alone (up to ~20% E) leads to small, but important decreases in BP in adults with and without hypertension or at risk for hypertension.

Metabolomic data capture the effects of food intake after digestion and metabolism, thus accounting for individual differences in these processes. To identify metabolomic biomarkers of avocado intake and to examine their associations with glycemia. Baseline data from 6224 multi-ethnic older adults (62% female) included self-reported avocado intake, fasting glucose and insulin, and untargeted plasma proton nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomic features (metabolomic data were available for a randomly selected subset; N = 3438). Subsequently, incident type 2 diabetes (T2D) was assessed over an ∼18 y follow-up period. A metabolome-wide association study of avocado consumption status (consumer compared with nonconsumer) was conducted, and the relationship of these features with glycemia via cross-sectional associations with fasting insulin and glucose and longitudinal associations with incident T2D was examined. Three highly-correlated spectral features were associated with avocado intake at metabolome-wide significance levels (P < 5.3 ∗ 10 Highly significant associations between glycemia and avocado-related metabolomic features, which serve as biomarkers of the physiological impact of dietary intake after digestion and absorption, compared to modest relationships between glycemia and avocado consumption, highlights the importance of considering individual differences in metabolism when considering diet-health relationships.

313,16487498,"Children with diabetes onset before 5 years of age have reduced neurocognitive function. This problem has been attributed to hypoglycemia, a complication of insulin therapy. The eye, kidney, and nerve complications of diabetes (hyperglycemia) have been reduced by intensified insulin therapy which is associated with a 3-fold increase in severe hypoglycemia and therefore is not recommended for children less than 13 years of age. Since hyperglycemia is much more common than intermittent hypoglycemia during early childhood diabetes, it is important to determine if hyperglycemia affects brain growth and development. Rats were exposed to 4 weeks of either continuous hyperglycemia (diabetes) or intermittent (3 h, 3 times/week) hypoglycemia from 4 to 8 weeks of age. The brains of these animals were compared to those of similarly aged normal control animals. The cell number was increased, and the cell size reduced in the cortex of diabetic animals as assessed by DNA/wet weight of brain and protein/DNA content. Reduced amounts of protein, fatty acids, and cholesterol/microgram DNA also indicate smaller cells with reduced myelin content in the cortex of the diabetic animals. Histologic evaluation of these brains confirmed the biochemical findings. These observations require further confirmation and evaluation but indicate that continuous hyperglycemia may be more damaging than intermittent hypoglycemia to the developing brain. This is an important consideration for the management of diabetes mellitus in young children. "

This study aimed to review 20 years' experience in the management of Taiwanese children with CHI. Between 1990 and 2010, children diagnosed with CHI and followed up at the Pediatric Endocrine Clinic of the National Taiwan University Hospital were enrolled. Their medical records were thoroughly reviewed. In total, 13 patients (8 boys and 5 girls) were enrolled, including six patients with onset of hypoglycemia within 1 month of age and seven patients at 4.0 ± 2.1 months of age. The birth weight standard deviation scores of these two age groups were 4.6 ± 1.8 and 1.4 ± 1.3 standard deviation score, respectively (p < 0.01). Initial intravenous glucose infusion at rates of 22.9 ± 5.3 mg/kg/min and 13.4 ± 5.6 mg/kg/min, respectively, were mandatory to maintain euglycemia in these two groups (p < 0.05). All received pancreatectomy after failure of initial medical treatment. Twelve patients were followed up for a period of 2.5-19.8 years. Eight of them remained euglycemic without any medication and three patients developed diabetes mellitus. Seven of the nine patients who underwent intelligence evaluation had normal mental outcomes. Mental retardation of two patients was too severe to be evaluated. All four patients with mental retardation had a delay in the maintenance of euglycemia, and three of them also had seizure disorder. The age at onset of hypoglycemia reflects the severity of CHI. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are important for favorable mental outcomes. "
316,37992186,"Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been extensively studied for potential beneficial roles in glucose homeostasis and risk of diabetes; however, most of this research has focused on butyrate, acetate, and propionate. The effect on metabolism of branched SCFAs (BSCFAs; isobutyrate, isovalerate, and methylbutyrate) is largely unknown. In a cohort of 219 non-Hispanic White participants and 126 African American participants, we examined the association of BSCFA with dysglycemia (prediabetes and diabetes) and oral glucose tolerance test-based measures of glucose and insulin homeostasis, as well as with demographic, anthropometric, lifestyle, and lipid traits, and other SCFAs. We observed a bimodal distribution of BSCFAs, with 25 individuals having high levels (H-BSCFA group) and 320 individuals having lower levels (L-BSCFA group). The prevalence of dysglycemia was lower in the H-BSCFA group compared with the L-BSCFA group (16% vs. 49%; P = 0.0014). This association remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, race, BMI, and levels of other SCFAs. Consistent with the lower rate of dysglycemia, fasting and postprandial glucose levels were lower and the disposition index was higher in the H-BSCFA group. Additional findings in H-BSCFA versus L-BSCFA included lower fasting and postprandial C-peptide levels and lower insulin clearance without differences in insulin levels, insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, or other variables examined, including diet and physical activity. As one of the first human studies associating higher BSCFA levels with lower odds of dysglycemia and improved glucose homeostasis, this study sets the stage for further investigation of BSCFA as a novel target for prevention or treatment of diabetes.

317,38488442,"Insufficient vessel maintenance adversely impacts patients in terms of tissue reperfusion following stroke or myocardial infarction, as well as during wound healing. Angiogenesis impairment is a feature typical of metabolic disorders acting at the cardiovascular level, such as diabetes. Therapeutic angiogenesis regulation offers promising clinical implications, and natural compounds as pro-angiogenic nutraceuticals hold valuable applications in regenerative medicine. By using cultured endothelial cells from human umbilical veins (HUVEC) we studied functional and molecular responses following exposure to erucin, a natural isothiocyanate derived from Brassicaceae plants and extracted from the seeds of rocket. Erucin (at nanomolar concentrations) promotes cell migration and tube formation, similar to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), through mobilizing paxillin at endothelial edges. At the molecular level, erucin induces signaling pathways typical of angiogenesis activation, namely Ras, PI3K/AKT, and ERK1/2, leading to VEGF expression and triggering its autocrine production, as pharmacological inhibition of soluble VEGF and VEGFR2 dampens endothelial functions. Furthermore, erucin, alone and together with VEGF, preserves endothelial angiogenic functions under pathological conditions, such as those induced in HUVEC by high glucose (HG) exposure. Erucin emerges as a compelling candidate for therapeutic revascularization applications, showcasing promising prospects for natural compounds in regenerative medicine, particularly in addressing angiogenesis-related disorders.

The control group was treated with conventional therapy, and the treatment group was treated with lactose-free/low-lactose milk powder on the basis of conventional therapy. The results of the meta-analysis showed that the clinical efficacy of the treatment group was significantly better than that of the control group [odds ratio=6.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.94-9.18, P<0.00001], the course of disease in the treatment group was shorter than that in the control group (mean difference=-1.45, 95% CI: -1.76 to -1.13, P<0.0001). The antidiarrhea time of the treatment group was shorter than that of the control group, and the difference between the 2 groups was statistically significant (mean difference=-1.41, 95% CI: -1.67 to -1.15, P<0.0001). Low/lactose-free milk powder can improve clinical efficacy and shorten the course of treatment in infants with lactose intolerance, which can be demonstrated by further large-scale clinical studies.

319,37935884,"Fetal growth restriction (FGR) increases risk for development of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Using a mouse model of FGR, we tested whether metabolic outcomes were exacerbated by high-fat diet challenge or associated with fecal microbial taxa. FGR was induced by maternal calorie restriction from gestation day 9 to 19. Control and FGR offspring were weaned to control (CON) or 45% fat diet (HFD). At age 16 weeks, offspring underwent intraperitoneal glucose tolerance testing, quantitative MRI body composition assessment, and energy balance studies. Total microbial DNA was used for amplification of the V4 variable region of the 16 S rRNA gene. Multivariable associations between groups and genera abundance were assessed using MaAsLin2. Adult male FGR mice fed HFD gained weight faster and had impaired glucose tolerance compared to control HFD males, without differences among females. Irrespective of weaning diet, adult FGR males had depletion of Akkermansia, a mucin-residing genus known to be associated with weight gain and glucose handling. FGR females had diminished Bifidobacterium. Metabolic changes in FGR offspring were associated with persistent gut microbial changes. FGR results in persistent gut microbial dysbiosis that may be a therapeutic target to improve metabolic outcomes. Fetal growth restriction increases risk for metabolic syndrome later in life, especially if followed by rapid postnatal weight gain. We report that a high fat diet impacts weight and glucose handling in a mouse model of fetal growth restriction in a sexually dimorphic manner. Adult growth-restricted offspring had persistent changes in fecal microbial taxa known to be associated with weight, glucose homeostasis, and bile acid metabolism, particularly Akkermansia, Bilophilia and Bifidobacteria. The gut microbiome may represent a therapeutic target to improve long-term metabolic outcomes related to fetal growth restriction. "
320,17947353,"The recent dramatic increase in fructose consumption is tightly correlated with an equally dramatic surge in the incidence of type 2 diabetes and obesity in children, but little is known about dietary fructose metabolism and absorption in neonates. The expression of the rat intestinal fructose transporter GLUT5 [Slc2A5, a member of the glucose transporter family (GLUT)] can be specifically induced by its substrate fructose, but only after weaning begins at 14 d of age. In suckling rats younger than 14 d old, dietary fructose cannot enhance GLUT5 expression. The aim of this study was to identify the mechanisms allowing fructose to stimulate GLUT5 during weaning. After intestines were perfused with fructose or glucose (control), using microarray hybridization we showed that of 5K genes analyzed in 10-d-old pups, only 13 were fructose responsive. Previous work found approximately 50 fructose-responsive genes in 20-d-old pups. To identify fructose-responsive genes whose expression also changed with age, intestines of 10- and 20-d-old littermate pups perfused with fructose were compared by microarray. Intestines of 10- and 20-d-old pups perfused with glucose were used to segregate age- but not fructose-responsive genes. About 28 genes were up- and 22 down-regulated in 20- relative to 10-d-old pups, under conditions of fructose perfusion, and many were found, by cluster analysis, to be regulated by corticosterone. When dexamethasone was injected into suckling pups before fructose perfusion, the expression of GLUT5 but not that of the sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 1 and of GLUT2, as well as the uptake of fructose but not of glucose increased dramatically. Thus, dexamethasone, which allows dietary fructose to precociously stimulate intestinal fructose absorption, can mimic the effect of age and modify developmental timing mechanisms regulating GLUT5. "
321,37238732,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, and eventual death. Research from the past few decades has appreciated that ALS is not only a disease of the motor neurons but also a disease that involves systemic metabolic dysfunction. This review will examine the foundational research of understanding metabolic dysfunction in ALS and provide an overview of past and current studies in ALS patients and animal models, spanning from full systems to various metabolic organs. While ALS-affected muscle tissue exhibits elevated energy demand and a fuel preference switch from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation, adipose tissue in ALS undergoes increased lipolysis. Dysfunctions in the liver and pancreas contribute to impaired glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion. The central nervous system (CNS) displays abnormal glucose regulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and increased oxidative stress. Importantly, the hypothalamus, a brain region that controls whole-body metabolism, undergoes atrophy associated with pathological aggregates of TDP-43. This review will also cover past and present treatment options that target metabolic dysfunction in ALS and provide insights into the future of metabolism research in ALS. "
322,26607702,"Consumption of food and drinks containing high fructose (HF), which is associated with hypertension, is increasing steeply. Moreover, increased salt intake significantly increases hypertension risk. We examined whether maternal HF and postnatal high salt (HS) intake had synergistic effects on blood pressure (BP) elevation in adult offspring and determined the underlying mechanisms. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats received regular chow or chow supplemented with 60% fructose during the entire pregnancy and lactation periods. Half of the male offspring received 1% NaCl in drinking water from weaning to 3 months of age. Male offspring were assigned to 4 groups (control, HF, HS, and HF + HS) and were sacrificed at 12 weeks of age. Offspring in HF and HS groups developed hypertension, indicating that HF and HS synergistically increased BP. Postnatal HS intake increased Ace expression and decreased Agtr1b and Mas1 expression in the kidneys. Renal mRNA levels of Ace and Agtr1a were significantly higher in HF + HS group than in control group. Renal levels of Na-K-2Cl cotransporter, type 3 sodium hydrogen exchanger, and Na(+)/Cl(-) cotransporter were higher in HS and HF + HS groups than in control group. Postnatal HS intake exacerbated prenatal HF-induced programmed hypertension. HF and HS induced programmed hypertension by differentially inducing renin-angiotensin system and sodium transporters in the kidneys. Better understanding of the effect of the relationship between HF and HS on hypertension development will help prevent hypertension in mothers and children exposed to HF and HS. "
323,23385373,"To discuss trends in the use of osmotic therapy. Use of osmotic therapy has evolved from bolus administration of mannitol to routine use of hypertonic saline as a bolus as well as in continuous infusions to creating a sustained hyperosmolar state.In a survey of neurointensivists 55% favored hypertonic saline over mannitol. Retrospective studies suggest better intracranial pressure (ICP) control with hypertonic saline. Whereas a prospective study in adults with head injury compared alternating doses of mannitol and hypertonic saline and found no difference in change in ICP control or outcome, two meta-analyses, which did not include this study, favored hypertonic saline for ICP control (although the absolute difference of 2 mmHg is of little clinical value) with no difference in outcome.Hypertonic saline has also been administered by infusions to creating a sustained stable hyperosmolar state. Two studies, using historical controls, suggested benefit of hypertonic saline infusions. In a prospective, randomized study, in children with severe head injury Lactated Ringer's solution was compared to hypertonic saline. Although ICP control was similar, the hypertonic saline group required fewer other interventions. The existing data do not support favoring boluses of hypertonic saline over mannitol in terms of ICP control, let alone outcome. The rationale for continuous infusions to create a sustained hyperosmolar state is open to discussion and use of this approach should be curtailed pending further research. "
324,21990079,"To assess iodine supply and follow thyroid epidemiology for ten years after an iodine increase from 10 to 25 mg of potassium iodide per kilogram of salt in 1999. In 2002 and 2003, we determined the thyroid size by palpation and ultrasound and measured urinary iodine concentration (UIC) in 676 schoolchildren from 34 schools throughout Slovenia. From 1999 to 2009, we followed the incidence of diffuse and nodular goiter, thyroid autonomy, Graves' disease, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis among adults in the stable catchment area of the University Medical Centre Ljubljana with 1000000 inhabitants. RESULTS.:In children, only 1% had a goiter grade 2 (visible and palpable thyroid gland), median thyroid volume was 5.8 mL, and median UIC was 148 μg/L. In adults, the incidence of diffuse goiter and thyroid autonomy decreased significantly (2009 vs 1999, rate ratio [RR], 0.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.21 and RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62-0.86, respectively), with a lower incidence in younger participants in 2009 (P<0.001). The incidence of multinodular goiter and solitary nodule increased (2009 vs 1999, RR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.35-1.79 and RR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.49-1.99, respectively). No long-term changes were observed for Graves' disease (2009 vs 1999, RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.81-1.13), while the incidence of Hashimoto's thyroiditis increased strongly (2009 vs 1999, RR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.64-2.12). The change from mildly deficient to sufficient iodine supply was associated with a marked change in the incidence of thyroid epidemiology - a significant decline in the incidence of diffuse goiter and thyroid autonomy and a marked increase in the incidence of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

325,36161709,"The high prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) is a challenging clinical problem. Researches on extracellular vesicles from urine-derived stem cells (USC-EVs) have shown that they have significant therapeutic effects in a variety of diseases by injection including ED. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is especially useful for delivering bioactive molecules. This study investigated the effects and related mechanisms of local administration of human USC-EVs combined with HA (USC-EVs-HA) on a rat model of DM2ED. UCSs were extracted from human urine samples and identified for preparation of the corresponding USC-EVs. The effects of high glucose and USC-EVs on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were assessed in vitro using a CCK-8 assay to determine cell proliferation and pick the most appropriate concentration for subsequent experiments. Scratch and tube formation assays were performed to assess the function of HUVECs. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect the expression of genes such as B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX), and superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD2). HA, USC-EVs, and USC-EVs-HA were prepared at concentrations and then administered topically to DM2ED rats multiple times. Intracavernous pressure and mean arterial pressure were measured to assess erectile function in rats. Masson, Tunel, Immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analysis were performed to assess the fibrosis and endothelial function in corpus cavernosum, respectively. Compared with the control group, the proliferation, migration ability, and tube-forming ability of HUVECs decreased in high glucose environment, while USC-EVs could optimize the function of HUVECs, reverse the expression of apoptotic genes, and enhance the antioxidant capacity. USC-EVs-HA showed improvement in ED compared to the HA and USC-EVs groups, and the 10-dose group was better than the 5-dose group. Histologically, the USC-EVs-HA group significantly improved apoptosis, angiogenesis, and smooth muscle regeneration in the corpus cavernosum compared to the HA group. The topical application of USC-EVs-HA in the treatment of DM2ED rats has been proved effective. The potential mechanism might to promote the proliferation of endothelial cells and smooth muscle in the corpus cavernosum, which leads to the remodeling of erectile function. And multiple dosing at intervals may make the effect more pronounced. "

Previously, increased acute food intake following the chemical reduction of hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ATP levels was prevented by common hepatic branch vagotomy (HBV). However, possible offsite actions of the chemical compounds confound the precise role of liver energy metabolism. Herein, we used a hepatocyte PGC1a heterozygous (LPGC1a) mouse model, with associated reductions in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and respiratory capacity, to assess the role of liver energy metabolism in systemic energy homeostasis.

327,30846352,"Regular carbohydrate intake to avoid hypoglycemia is the mainstay of dietary treatment in glycogen storage disease type I (GSDI). The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of dietary treatment and glycemic control in a cohort of GSDI patients, in relation to the presence of typical long-term complications. Data of 25 patients (22 GSD subtype Ia and 3 GSDIb, median age 20y) from the Swiss hepatic glycogen storage disease registry was analyzed cross-sectionally. Frequency and type of hypoglycemia symptoms were assessed prospectively using a structured questionnaire. Diagnostic continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was performed as part of usual clinical care to assess glycemic control in 14 patients, usually once per year with a mean duration of 6.2 ± 1.1 consecutive days per patient per measurement. Although maintenance of euglycemia is the primary goal of dietary treatment, few patients (n = 3, 13%) performed capillary blood glucose measurements regularly. Symptoms possibly associated with hypoglycemia were present in 13 patients (57%), but CGM revealed periods of low glucose (<4 mmol/l) in all patients, irrespective of the presence of symptoms. GSDIa patients with liver adenomas (n = 9, 41%) showed a higher frequency and area under the curve (AUC) of low blood glucose than patients without adenomas (frequency 2.7 ± 0.8 vs. 1.5 ± 0.7 per day, AUC 0.11 ± 0.08 vs. 0.03 ± 0.02 mmol/l/d; p < 0.05). Similarly, the presence of microalbuminuria was also associated with the frequency of low blood glucose. Z-Scores of bone density correlated negatively with lactate levels. The quality of glucose control is related to the presence of typical long-term complications in GSDI. Many patients experience episodes of asymptomatic low blood glucose. Regular assessment of glucose control is an essential element to evaluate the quality of treatment, and increasing the frequency of glucose self-monitoring remains an important goal of patient education and motivation. CGM devices may support patients to optimize dietary therapy in everyday life. "
328,37847560,"In youths with obesity, the gut hormone potentiation of insulin secretion - the incretin effect - is blunted. We explored the longitudinal impact of the incretin effect during pubertal transition on β cell function and insulin sensitivity. Youths with obesity and 2-hour glucose level ≥ 120 mg/dL underwent a 3-hour oral glucose-tolerance test (OGTT) and an isoglycemic i.v. glucose infusion to quantify the incretin effect. After 2 years, 30 of 39 participants had a repeated OGTT and were stratified into 3 tertiles according to the baseline incretin effect. The high-incretin effect group demonstrated a longitudinal increase in β cell function (disposition index, minimal model [DIMM]), with greater insulin sensitivity at follow-up and stable insulin secretion (φtotal). A lower incretin effect at baseline was associated with higher 1-hour and 2-hour glucose level at follow-up. The high-incretin effect group displayed a greater increase of GLP-17-36 than the moderate- and low-incretin group at baseline, while such a difference did not persist after 2 years. Glucagon suppression was reduced at follow-up in those with low-baseline incretin in respect to the high-incretin group. The incretin effect during pubertal transition affected the longitudinal trajectory of β cell function and weight in youths with obesity. "
329,31107259,"To review recent evidence for the role of carbohydrates in the promotion of de novo lipogenesis and lipoprotein secretion from the intestine. The consumption of diets rich in carbohydrates have been shown to promote elevations in circulating lipids. In particular, the consumption of monosaccharides, such as glucose and fructose, have been shown to induce increases in intestinal de novo lipogenesis, as well as be used as a substrate for the synthesis of triglycerides and lipoprotein export in the form of chylomicrons. Recently, various systematic reviews have analyzed the relative contribution of dietary fructose to intestinal lipogenesis. Although, there remains controversy within the literature, the body of evidence supports lipogenic effects of high fructose diets. In addition, alterations in markers of de novo lipogenesis within the jejunum of patients with insulin resistance may explain the alterations in their postprandial lipid profile. Recent evidence supports the contribution of dietary carbohydrates to intestinal lipogenesis and lipoprotein secretion; however, further research is required to fully understand the mechanisms underlying this complex process.

330,2787902,"Diarrhea caused by enteropathogenic bacteria is a leading cause of childhood mortality world-wide, particularly in less developed regions. Breast-feeding has been advocated to protect infants and children from infectious illnesses. We examined the antibacterial activity of human whey in vitro against multiple strains of the following species of enteropathogenic bacteria, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Shigella sonnei and Vibrio cholerae, all isolated from humans with diarrheal illness. In vitro human whey inhibited the growth of most but not all of the enteropathogenic strains tested. The test strains multiplied in both bacterial growth medium and commercial infant-feeding formula controls, with the exception of the Campylobacter strains, which were markedly inhibited in formula. These results confirm and extend previous observations that human whey contains components capable of inhibiting enteropathogenic bacteria and which may be associated with the protective effects of breast feeding. The precise mechanisms of these inhibitory effects merit further study. "

332,17551002,"Skeletal muscle protein synthesis is elevated in neonates in part due to an enhanced response to the rise in insulin and amino acids after eating. In vitro studies suggest that glucose plays a role in protein synthesis regulation. To determine whether glucose, independently of insulin and amino acids, is involved in the postprandial rise in skeletal muscle protein synthesis, pancreatic-substrate clamps were performed in neonatal pigs. Insulin secretion was inhibited with somatostatin and insulin was infused to reproduce fasting or fed levels, while glucose and amino acids were clamped at fasting or fed levels. Fractional protein synthesis rates and translational control mechanisms were examined. Raising glucose alone increased protein synthesis in fast-twitch glycolytic muscles but not in other tissues. The response in muscle was associated with increased phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB) and enhanced formation of the active eIF4E.eIF4G complex but no change in phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), 4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1), ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K1), or eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2). Raising glucose, insulin, and amino acids increased protein synthesis in most tissues. The response in muscle was associated with phosphorylation of PKB, mTOR, S6K1, and 4E-BP1 and enhanced eIF4E.eIF4G formation. The results suggest that the postprandial rise in glucose, independently of insulin and amino acids, stimulates protein synthesis in neonates, and this response is specific to fast-twitch glycolytic muscle and occurs by AMPK- and mTOR-independent pathways.

333,26698301,"Growth arrest and DNA-damage inducible protein 45 beta (Gadd45b) is serving as a neuronal activity sensor. Brain ischemia induces the expression of Gadd45b, which stimulates recovery after stroke and may play a protective role in cerebral ischemia. However, little is known of the molecular mechanisms of how Gadd45b expression regulated and the down-stream targets in brain ischemia. Here, using an oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) model, we identified Huwe1/Mule/ARF-BP1, a HECT domain containing ubiquitin ligase, involved in the control of Gadd45b protein level. In this study, we also investigated the role of Huwe1-Gadd45b mediated pathway in BDNF methylation. We found that the depletion of Huwe1 by lentivirus shRNA mediated interference significantly increased the expression of Gadd45b and BDNF at 24 h after OGD. Moreover, treatment with Cycloheximide (CHX) inhibited endogenous expression of Gadd45b, and promoted expression of Gadd45b after co-treated with lentivirus shRNA-Huwe1. Inhibition of Gadd45b by lentivirus shRNA decreased the expression levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (p-CREB) pathway, while inhibition of Huwe1 increased the expression levels of BDNF and p-CREB. Moreover, shRNA-Huwe1 treatment decreased the methylation level of the fifth CpG islands (123 bp apart from BDNF IXa), while shRNA-Gadd45b treatment increased the methylation level of the forth CpG islands (105 bp apart from BDNF IXa). These findings suggested that Huwe1 involved in the regulation of Gadd45b expression under OGD/R, providing a novel route for neurons following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. It also indicated that the methylation of BDNF IXa was affected by Gadd45b as well as Huwe1 in the OGD/R model. "
334,39203718,"Puerarin is an isoflavone compound isolated from the roots of a leguminous plant, the wild kudzu. Various functional activities of this compound in multiple diseases have been reported. However, the effect and mechanism of puerarin in improving blood pressure remain non-elucidated. The current study was designed to assess the preventive effects of puerarin on the onset and progression of hypertension and to verify the hypothesis that puerarin alleviates blood pressure by inhibiting the ROS/TLR4/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of salt-induced prehypertensive rats. Male Dahl salt-sensitive rats were fed low NaCl salt (3% in drinking water) for the control (NS) group or 8% (HS) to induce prehypertension. Each batch was divided into two group and treated by bilateral PVN microinjection with either artificial cerebrospinal fluid or puerarin through a micro-osmotic pump for 6 weeks. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) was recorded, and samples were collected and analyzed. We concluded that puerarin significantly prevented the elevation of blood pressure and effectively alleviated the increase in heart rate caused by high salt. Norepinephrine (NE) in the plasma of salt-induced prehypertensive rats also decreased upon puerarin chronic infusion. Additionally, analysis of the PVN sample revealed that puerarin pretreatment decreased the positive cells and gene level of TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4), NLRP3, Caspase-1 p10, NOX2, MyD88, NOX4, and proinflammatory cytokines in the PVN. Puerarin pretreatment also decreased NF-κBp65 activity, inhibited oxidative stress, and alleviated inflammatory responses in the PVN. We conclude that puerarin alleviated blood pressure via inhibition of the ROS/TLR4/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway in the PVN, suggesting the therapeutic potential of puerarin in the prevention of hypertension.

335,37890205,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a serious complication of pregnancy that is characterized by high blood sugar levels that occur due to insulin resistance and dysfunction in glucose metabolism during pregnancy. It usually develops in the second or third trimester of pregnancy and affects about 7 % of all pregnancies worldwide. In this experimental study, we scrutinized the GDM protective effect of soy isolate protein against streptozotocin (STZ) induced GDM in rats and explore the underlying mechanism. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used in this experimental study. A 55 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) was administered to induce diabetes in female rats, followed by oral administration of soy isolate protein for 18 days. Body weight, glucose levels, and insulin were measured at different time intervals (0, 9, and 18 days). Lipid profiles, antioxidant levels, inflammatory cytokines, apoptosis parameters, and mRNA expression were also assessed. Pancreatic and liver tissues were collected for histopathological examination during the experimental study. Soy isolate protein significantly (P < 0.001) reduced the glucose level and enhanced the insulin level and body weight. Soy isolate protein remarkably decreased the placental weight and increased the fetal weight. Soy isolate protein significantly (P < 0.001) decreased the HbA1c, hepatic glycogen, serum C-peptide and increased the level of free fatty acid. Soy isolate protein significantly (P < 0.001) altered the level of lipid, antioxidant and inflammatory cytokines. Soy isolate protein significantly (P < 0.001) improved the level of adiponectin, visfatin and suppressed the level of leptin and ICAM-1. Soy isolate protein significantly (P < 0.001) altered the mRNA expression and also restored the alteration of histopathology. Based on the result, soy isolate protein exhibited the GDM protective effect against the STZ induced GDM in rats via alteration of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. "
336,18640390,"High fructose consumption is associated with the development of fatty liver and dyslipidemia with poorly understood mechanisms. We used a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-based proteomics approach to define the molecular events that link high fructose consumption to fatty liver in hamsters. Hamsters fed high-fructose diet for 8 weeks, as opposed to regular-chow-fed controls, developed hyperinsulinemia and hyperlipidemia. High-fructose-fed hamsters exhibited fat accumulation in liver. Hamsters were killed, and liver tissues were subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-based proteomics. This approach identified a number of proteins whose expression levels were altered by >2-fold in response to high fructose feeding. These proteins fall into 5 different categories including (1) functions in fatty acid metabolism such as fatty acid binding protein and carbamoyl-phosphate synthase; (2) proteins in cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism such as apolipoprotein A-1 and protein disulfide isomerase; (3) molecular chaperones such as GroEL, peroxiredoxin 2, and heat shock protein 70, whose functions are important for protein folding and antioxidation; (4) enzymes in fructose catabolism such as fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and glycerol kinase; and (5) proteins with housekeeping functions such as albumin. These data provide insight into the molecular basis linking fructose-induced metabolic shift to the development of metabolic syndrome characterized by hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia. "
337,18043507,"Lactogenic hormones cause intracellular targeting of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) for transport of glucose to the site of lactose synthesis in mammary glands. Our aim was to study the intracellular trafficking mechanisms involved in GLUT1 targeting and recycling in CIT3 mouse mammary epithelial cells. Fusion proteins of GLUT1 and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were expressed in CIT3 cells maintained in growth medium (GM), or exposed to secretion medium (SM), containing prolactin. Agents acting on Golgi and related subcellular compartments and on GLUT1 and GLUT4 targeting in muscle and fat cells were studied. Wortmannin and staurosporine effects on internalization of GLUT1 were not specific, supporting a basal constitutive GLUT1 membrane-recycling pathway between an intracellular pool and the cell surface in CIT3 cells, which targets most GLUT1 to the plasma membrane in GM. Upon exposure to prolactin in SM, GLUT1 was specifically targeted intracellularly to a brefeldin A-sensitive compartment. Arrest of endosomal acidification by bafilomycin A1 disrupted this prolactin-induced GLUT1 intracellular trafficking with central coalescence of GLUT1-EGFP signal, suggesting that it is via endosomal pathways. This machinery offers another level of regulation of lactose synthesis by altering GLUT1 targeting within minutes to hours. "
338,16249448,"Pancreatic-derived factor (PANDER) is an islet-specific cytokine present in both pancreatic alpha- and beta-cells, which, in vitro, induces beta-cell apoptosis of primary islet and cell lines. In this study, we investigated whether PANDER is secreted by pancreatic alpha- and beta-cells and whether PANDER secretion is regulated by glucose and other insulin secretagogues. In mouse-derived insulin-secreting beta-TC3 cells, PANDER secretion in the presence of stimulatory concentrations of glucose was 2.8 +/- 0.4-fold higher (P < 0.05) than without glucose. Insulin secretion was similarly increased by glucose in the same cells. The total concentration of secreted PANDER in the medium was approximately 6-10 ng/ml (0.3-0.5 nmol/l) after a 24-h culture with glucose. L-Glucose failed to stimulate PANDER secretion in beta-TC3 cells. KCl stimulated PANDER secretion 2.1 +/- 0.1-fold compared with control without glucose. An L-type Ca2+ channel inhibitor, nifedipine, completely blocked both glucose- or KCl-induced insulin and PANDER secretion. In rat-derived INS-1 cells, glucose (20 mmol/l) stimulated PANDER secretion 4.4 +/- 0.9-fold, while leucine plus glutamine stimulated 4.4 +/- 0.7-fold compared with control without glucose. In mouse islets overexpressing PANDER, glucose (20 mmol/l) stimulated PANDER secretion 3.2 +/- 0.5-fold (P < 0.05) compared with basal (3 mmol/l glucose). PANDER was also secreted by alpha-TC3 cells but was not stimulated by glucose. Mutations of cysteine 229 or of cysteines 91 and 229 to serine, which may form one disulfide bond, and truncation of the COOH-terminus or NH2-terminus of PANDER all resulted in failure of PANDER secretion, even though these mutant or truncated PANDERs were highly expressed within the cells. In conclusion, we found that 1) PANDER is secreted from both pancreatic alpha- and beta-cells, 2) glucose stimulates PANDER secretion dose dependently in beta-cell lines and primary islets but not in alpha-cells, 3) PANDER is likely cosecreted with insulin via the same regulatory mechanisms, and 4) structure and conformation is vital for PANDER secretion.

339,12612213,"We have previously demonstrated that very premature infants receiving total parenteral nutrition maintain normoglycemia primarily by glucose produced via gluconeogenesis and that the lipid emulsion is most important in supporting gluconeogenesis. It is, however, not clear whether this is a result of the glycerol or the fatty acid constituent. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of intravenous supplemental glycerol alone on glucose production and gluconeogenesis. Twenty infants (birth weight, 1014 +/- 32 g; gestational age, 27 +/- 1 wk) were studied on d 4 +/- 1 (mean +/- SE). All infants received glucose at 17 micromol/kg x min for 9 h (after an initial study hour with 33 micromol/kg x min). Eight infants received no additional substrate during the study, and 12 infants received supplemental glycerol at 5 (n = 6) or 10 micromol/kg x min (n = 6) over the last 5 h of study. In infants receiving glucose alone, between period 1 (study hours 4-5) and period 2 (study hours 9-10), rates of glucose production ([U-13C]glucose) decreased from 12.9 +/- 1.2 to 7.4 +/- 0.9 micromol/kg x min (p < 0.01). This was the result of decreased glycogenolysis but no change in gluconeogenesis ([U-13C]glucose mass isotopomer distribution analysis) (5.1 +/- 0.6 versus 5.7 +/- 0.4 micromol/kg x min) (ns). Glycerol infusion at 5 and 10 micromol/kg x min, respectively, maintained glucose production (despite comparable decrease in glycogenolysis) by increasing gluconeogenesis from 4.3 +/- 0.2 to 6.3 +/- 0.5 (p < 0.03), and 6.0 +/- 0.7 to 8.8 +/- 0.8 micromol/kg/min (p < 0.01). In very premature infants, parenteral glycerol enhances gluconeogenesis and attenuates time dependent decrease in glucose production. "
340,8289679,"The ability of glucagon to stimulate hepatic glucose production (HGP) was studied in clinically stable cirrhotic patients (n = 8) who had, based on long-term follow-up evaluation, relatively good liver function (Child-Pugh A) and whose dietary intake and physical characteristics were comparable to those of healthy control subjects (n = 8). Plasma glucagon concentration was slightly but not significantly increased in cirrhotic patients versus control subjects in the basal state (190 +/- 41 v 126 +/- 24 pg/mL, P = NS) and during a continuous 180-minute glucagon infusion at 3 ng/kg/min (349 +/- 56 v 243 +/- 37, P = NS). The increment in plasma glucagon level (+164 +/- 57 v +127 +/- 35, P = NS) also was slightly greater in the cirrhotic group. HGP (measured with [6-3H]-glucose) in the basal state was similar in cirrhotic and control subjects (1.79 +/- 0.09 v 1.94 +/- 0.15 mg/kg/min, P = NS). In cirrhotic patients, stimulation of HGP by glucagon was blunted during the first 15 to 30 minutes of the infusion period (representing glucagon's predominant effect on glycogenolysis; 0.23 +/- 0.20 v 1.06 +/- 0.19 mg/kg/min, P < .05), but it was not different from that in control subjects during the remaining course of the experiment (30 to 180 minutes). Basal plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations did not change from baseline during the glucagon infusion in cirrhotics, whereas they increased slightly but not significantly in controls. These data demonstrate that even in the early stages of cirrhosis, the liver is resistant to the stimulatory effect of glucagon on hepatic glycogenolysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) "
341,27624090,"Cells in homeostasis metabolize glucose mainly through the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, while activated cells switch their basal metabolism to aerobic glycolysis. In this study, we examined whether metabolic reprogramming toward aerobic glycolysis is important for the host response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Through transcriptional and metabolite analysis we show that Mtb induces a switch in host cellular metabolism toward aerobic glycolysis in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The metabolic switch is TLR2 dependent but NOD2 independent, and is mediated in part through activation of the AKT-mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway. We show that pharmacological inhibition of the AKT/mTOR pathway inhibits cellular responses to Mtb both in vitro in human PBMCs, and in vivo in a model of murine tuberculosis. Our findings reveal a novel regulatory layer of host responses to Mtb that will aid understanding of host susceptibility to Mtb, and which may be exploited for host-directed therapy. "
342,37651270,"Obese PCOS mice display metabolic and endocrine disorders that manifest as abnormal metabolism of glucose and dysfunctions in the reproductive system. This study demonstrates that emodin alleviates most of these conditions possibly via the HMGB1/TLR4/NF-kB pathway. PCOS is a reproductive disorder with an unclear etiology. It affects 5-10% of women worldwide and is largely associated with impaired glucose metabolism and obesity. HMGB1 is a nuclear protein associated with impaired glucose metabolism and PCOS. We sought to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of emodin on glucose metabolism and ovarian functions in PCOS mice via the HMGB1 molecular pathway. A high-fat diet (HFD) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)- induced PCOS mouse model comprising four experimental groups was established: control, PCOS, PCOS plus emodin, and PCOS plus vehicle groups. Emodin administration attenuated obesity, elevated fasting glucose levels, impaired glucose tolerance, and insulin resistance, and improved the polycystic ovarian morphology of PCOS mice. Additionally, it lowered elevated serum HMGB1, LH, and testosterone levels in PCOS mice. Elevated ovarian protein and mRNA levels of HMGB1 and TLR4 in PCOS mice were also lowered following emodin treatment. Furthermore, emodin lowered high NF-ĸB/65 protein levels in the ovaries of PCOS mice. Immunohistochemical staining of the ovaries revealed strong HMGB1, TLR4, and AR expressions in PCOS mice, which were lowered by emodin treatment. Moreover, emodin significantly increased GLUT4, IRS2, and INSR levels that were lowered by PCOS. Overall, our study showed that emodin alleviated the impaired glucose metabolism and improved ovarian function in PCOS mice, possibly via the HMGB1/TLR4/NF-ĸB signaling pathway. Thus, emodin could be considered a potential therapeutic agent in the management of PCOS. "
343,29656591,"Autophagy has been regarded as a promising therapeutic target for spinal cord injury (SCI). Erythropoietin (EPO) has been demonstrated to exhibit neuroprotective effects in the central nervous system (CNS); however, the molecular mechanisms of its protection against SCI remain unknown. This study aims to investigate whether the neuroprotective effects of EPO on SCI are mediated by autophagy via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathways. Functional assessment and Nissl staining were used to investigate the effects of EPO on SCI. Expressions of proteins were detected by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Treatment with EPO significantly reduced the loss of motor neurons and improved the functional recovery following SCI. Erythropoietin significantly enhanced the SCI-induced autophagy through activating AMPK and inactivating mTOR signaling. The inhibitor of AMPK, compound C, could block the EPO-induced autophagy and beneficial action on SCI, whereas the activator of AMPK, metformin, could mimic the effects of EPO. In the in vitro studies, EPO enhanced the hypoxia-induced autophagy in an AMPK-dependent manner. The AMPK-dependent induction of autophagy contributes to the neuroprotection of EPO on SCI. "

Here we profile metabolic changes conferred by SARS-CoV-2 infection in kidney epithelial cells and lung air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures, and show that SARS-CoV-2 infection increases glucose carbon entry into the TCA cycle via increased pyruvate carboxylase expression. SARS-CoV-2 also reduces oxidative glutamine metabolism while maintaining reductive carboxylation. Consistent with these changes, SARS-CoV-2 infection increases the activity of mTORC1 in cell lines and lung ALI cultures. Lastly, we show evidence of mTORC1 activation in COVID-19 patient lung tissue, and that mTORC1 inhibitors reduce viral replication in kidney epithelial cells and lung ALI cultures. Our results suggest that targeting mTORC1 may be a feasible treatment strategy for COVID-19 patients, although further studies are required to determine the mechanism of inhibition and potential efficacy in patients.

345,37967247,"Elevated rates of gluconeogenesis are an early pathogenic feature of youth-onset type 2 diabetes (Y-T2D), but targeted first-line therapies are suboptimal, especially in African American (AA) youth. We evaluated glucose-lowering mechanisms of metformin and liraglutide by measuring rates of gluconeogenesis and β-cell function after therapy in AA Y-T2D. In this parallel randomized clinical trial, 22 youth with Y-T2D-age 15.3 ± 2.1 years (mean ± SD), 68% female, body mass index (BMI) 40.1 ± 7.9 kg/m2, duration of diagnosis 1.8 ± 1.3 years-were randomized to metformin alone (Met) or metformin + liraglutide (Lira) (Met + Lira) and evaluated before and after 12 weeks. Stable isotope tracers were used to measure gluconeogenesis [2H2O] and glucose production [6,6-2H2]glucose after an overnight fast and during a continuous meal. β-cell function (sigma) and whole-body insulin sensitivity (mSI) were assessed during a frequently sampled 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test. At baseline, gluconeogenesis, glucose production, and fasting and 2-hour glucose were comparable in both groups, though Met + Lira had higher hemoglobin A1C. Met + Lira had a greater decrease from baseline in fasting glucose (-2.0 ± 1.3 vs -0.6 ± 0.9 mmol/L, P = .008) and a greater increase in sigma (0.72 ± 0.68 vs -0.05 ± 0.71, P = .03). The change in fractional gluconeogenesis was similar between groups (Met + Lira: -0.36 ± 9.4 vs Met: 0.04 ± 12.3%, P = .9), and there were no changes in prandial gluconeogenesis or mSI. Increased glucose clearance in both groups was related to sigma (r = 0.63, P = .003) but not gluconeogenesis or mSI. Among Y-T2D, metformin with or without liraglutide improved glycemia but did not suppress high rates of gluconeogenesis. Novel therapies that will enhance β-cell function and target the elevated rates of gluconeogenesis in Y-T2D are needed. "
346,36088537,"We used next-generation metabolic screening to identify new biomarkers for improved diagnosis and pathophysiological understanding of glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1DS), comparing metabolic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profiles from 12 patients to those of 116 controls. This confirmed decreased CSF glucose and lactate levels in patients with GLUT1DS and increased glutamine at group level. We identified three novel biomarkers significantly decreased in patients, namely gluconic + galactonic acid, xylose-α1-3-glucose, and xylose-α1-3-xylose-α1-3-glucose, of which the latter two have not previously been identified in body fluids. CSF concentrations of gluconic + galactonic acid may be reduced as these metabolites could serve as alternative substrates for the pentose phosphate pathway. Xylose-α1-3-glucose and xylose-α1-3-xylose-α1-3-glucose may originate from glycosylated proteins; their decreased levels are hypothetically the consequence of insufficient glucose, one of two substrates for O-glucosylation. Since many proteins are O-glucosylated, this deficiency may affect cellular processes and thus contribute to GLUT1DS pathophysiology. The novel CSF biomarkers have the potential to improve the biochemical diagnosis of GLUT1DS. Our findings imply that brain glucose deficiency in GLUT1DS may cause disruptions at the cellular level that go beyond energy metabolism, underlining the importance of developing treatment strategies that directly target cerebral glucose uptake.

347,29257202,"MicroRNA (miR) has been reported to be associated with ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) and cell apoptosis. Suppression of cell apoptosis may reduce the irreversible damage induced by reperfusion. The aims of the current study were to explore the cytoprotective effects of miR-146 against oxygen-glucose deprivation/recovery (OGD/R)-induced injury in H9c2 rat myocardial cells, as well as the underlying mechanisms. Following stimulation with OGD/R, the cells were transfected with miR-146 mimics or negative controls. The levels of miR-146 were analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Thereafter, cell viability and cell apoptosis were analyzed by MTT assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay, respectively. In addition, the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were determined by ELISA and the levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein (Bax), Bcl-2 and phosphorylated (p)-nuclear factor (NF)-κB were measured by western blotting. The results demonstrated that overexpression of miR-146 significantly increased cell viability and decreased apoptosis (P<0.05). It was observed that overexpression of miR-146 statistically reduced the levels of Bax, TNF-α and p-NF-κB but markedly upregulated the levels of Bcl-2 (P<0.05). These results indicate that overexpression of miR-146 may protect against OGD/R-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Overexpression of miR-146 may alleviate the irreversible injury associated with reperfusion and the effects may be achieved by inhibiting the NF-κB/TNF-α signaling pathway. "
348,15489222,"Our goal was to investigate whether leucine culture affects beta-cell glucose sensing. One-day culture of rat islets with 10 mM leucine had no effect on glucose-induced insulin secretion. One-week leucine culture decreased the threshold for glucose-induced insulin secretion and increased maximal insulin secretion at 30 mM glucose. Glucose-induced cytosolic free Ca(2+) was increased at 1 week but not at 1 day of leucine culture. Without glucose, ATP content was not different with or without leucine culture for 1 week. With 20 mM glucose, ATP content was higher by 1.5-fold in islets cultured for 1 week with leucine than those without leucine. Microarray experiments indicated that culture of RINm5F cells with leucine increased expression of ATP synthase beta subunit 3.2-fold, which was confirmed by real time reverse transcription-PCR analysis (3.0- +/- 0.4-fold) in rat islets at 1 week but not after 1 day with leucine culture. Down-regulation of ATP synthase beta subunit by siRNA decreased INS1 cell ATP content and insulin secretion with 20 mM glucose. Overexpression of ATP synthase beta subunit in INS1 cell increased insulin secretion in the presence of 5 and 20 mM glucose. In conclusion, one-week leucine culture of rat islets up-regulated ATP synthase and increased ATP content, which resulted in elevated [Ca(2+)] levels and more insulin exocytosis by glucose. Depletion of ATP synthase beta subunit with siRNA produced opposite effects. These data reveal the fuel-sensing role of mitochondrial ATP synthase in the control of ATP production from glucose and the control of glucose-induced insulin secretion. "

In this study, we tested whether soluble A beta (sA beta) can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). An in vivo vascular brain perfusion model and capillary depletion technique in guinea-pigs were used to determine cerebral capillary sequestration and blood-brain transport of a synthetic peptide identical with residues 1-40 (SP-40) of A beta. A saturable, specific binding of SP-40 has been demonstrated at the luminal side of the BBB, with the Kd of 25 +/- 2 nM, and Bmax of 188 +/- 11 fmol/min/g of isolated microvessels. A specific transcellular BBB transport of SP-40 into brain parenchyma exhibited the Km of 49 +/- 10 nM, and Vmax of 111 +/- 19 fmol/min/g of capillary depleted brain. We concluded that the BBB has the capability to control the cerebrovascular sequestration and blood-to-brain transport of circulating sA beta. Hence, sA beta can contribute to both cerebrovascular and parenchymal amyloid formation. "
351,35963433,"Cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor-like effector C (CIDEC) expression in adipose tissue positively correlates with insulin sensitivity in obese humans. Further, E186X, a single-nucleotide CIDEC variant is associated with lipodystrophy, hypertriglyceridemia, and insulin resistance. To establish the unknown mechanistic link between CIDEC and maintenance of systemic glucose homeostasis, we generated transgenic mouse models expressing CIDEC (Ad-CIDECtg) and CIDEC E186X variant (Ad-CIDECmut) transgene specifically in the adipose tissue. We found that Ad-CIDECtg but not Ad-CIDECmut mice were protected against high-fat diet-induced glucose intolerance. Furthermore, we revealed the role of CIDEC in lipid metabolism using transcriptomics and lipidomics. Serum triglycerides, cholesterol, and low-density lipoproteins were lower in high-fat diet-fed Ad-CIDECtg mice compared to their littermate controls. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that CIDEC regulates the enzymatic activity of adipose triglyceride lipase via interacting with its activator, CGI-58, to reduce free fatty acid release and lipotoxicity. In addition, we confirmed that CIDEC is indeed a vital regulator of lipolysis in adipose tissue of obese humans, and treatment with recombinant CIDEC decreased triglyceride breakdown in visceral human adipose tissue. Our study unravels a central pathway whereby adipocyte-specific CIDEC plays a pivotal role in regulating adipose lipid metabolism and whole-body glucose homeostasis. In summary, our findings identify human CIDEC as a potential 'drug' or a 'druggable' target to reverse obesity-induced lipotoxicity and glucose intolerance. "

353,38649684,"Estrogen receptor α (ERα) plays a crucial role in regulating glucose and energy homeostasis during type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here we find a ligand-independent effect of ERα on the regulation of glucose homeostasis. Deficiency of ERα in the liver impairs glucose homeostasis in male, female, and ovariectomized (OVX) female mice. Mechanistic studies reveal that ERα promotes hepatic insulin sensitivity by suppressing ubiquitination-induced IRS1 degradation. The ERα 1-280 domain mediates the ligand-independent effect of ERα on insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, we identify a peptide based on ERα 1-280 domain and find that ERα-derived peptide increases IRS1 stability and enhances insulin sensitivity. Importantly, administration of ERα-derived peptide into obese mice significantly improves glucose homeostasis and serum lipid profiles. These findings pave the way for the therapeutic intervention of T2DM by targeting the ligand-independent effect of ERα and indicate that ERα-derived peptide is a potential insulin sensitizer for the treatment of T2DM.

354,34755487,"The metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that increase an individual's risk of developing diseases. Being physically active throughout life is known to reduce the prevalence and onset of some aspects of the metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that an individual's gut microbiome composition has a large influence on several aspects of the metabolic syndrome. However, the mechanism(s) by which physical activity may improve metabolic health are not well understood. We sought to determine if endurance exercise is sufficient to prevent or ameliorate the development of the metabolic syndrome and its associated diseases. We also analyzed the impact of physical activity under metabolic syndrome progression upon the gut microbiome composition. Utilizing whole-body low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) knockout mice on a ""Western Diet,"" we show that long-term exercise acts favorably upon glucose tolerance, adiposity, and liver lipids. Exercise increased mitochondrial abundance in skeletal muscle but did not reduce liver fibrosis, aortic lesion area, or plasma lipids. Lastly, we observed several changes in gut bacteria and their novel associations with metabolic parameters of clinical importance. Altogether, our results indicate that exercise can ameliorate some aspects of the metabolic syndrome progression and alter the gut microbiome composition. "
355,28234964,"Recurrent hypoglycemia can occur as a major complication of insulin replacement therapy, limiting the long-term health benefits of intense glycemic control in type 1 and advanced type 2 diabetic patients. It impairs the normal counter-regulatory hormonal and behavioral responses to glucose deprivation, a phenomenon known as hypoglycemia associated autonomic failure (HAAF). The molecular mechanisms leading to defective counter-regulation are not completely understood. We hypothesized that both neuronal (excessive cholinergic signaling between the splanchnic nerve fibers and the adrenal medulla) and humoral factors contribute to the impaired epinephrine production and release in HAAF. To gain further insight into the molecular mechanism(s) mediating the blunted epinephrine responses following recurrent hypoglycemia, we utilized a global gene expression profiling approach. We characterized the transcriptomes during recurrent (defective counter-regulation model) and acute hypoglycemia (normal counter-regulation group) in the adrenal medulla of normal Sprague-Dawley rats. Based on comparison analysis of differentially expressed genes, a set of unique genes that are activated only at specific time points after recurrent hypoglycemia were revealed. A complementary bioinformatics analysis of the functional category, pathway, and integrated network indicated activation of the unfolded protein response. Furthermore, at least three additional pathways/interaction networks altered in the adrenal medulla following recurrent hypoglycemia were identified, which may contribute to the impaired epinephrine secretion in HAAF: greatly increased neuropeptide signaling (proenkephalin, neuropeptide Y, galanin); altered ion homeostasis (Na+, K+, Ca2+) and downregulation of genes involved in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of secretory vesicles. Given the pleiotropic effects of the unfolded protein response in different organs, involved in maintaining glucose homeostasis, these findings uncover broader general mechanisms that arise following recurrent hypoglycemia which may afford clinicians an opportunity to modulate the magnitude of HAAF syndrome.

356,27965450,"Fungi in the genus Pneumocystis live in the lungs of mammals, where they can cause a fatal pneumonia (PCP [Pneumocystis pneumonia]) in hosts with compromised immune systems. The absence of a continuous in vitro culture system for any species of Pneumocystis has led to limited understanding of these fungi, especially for the discovery of new therapies. We recently reported that Pneumocystis carinii, Pneumocystis murina, and most significantly, Pneumocystis jirovecii lack both enzymes necessary for myo-inositol biosynthesis but contain genes with homologies to fungal myo-inositol transporters. Since myo-inositol is essential for eukaryotic viability, the primary transporter, ITR1, was functionally and structurally characterized in P. carinii The predicted structure of P. carinii ITR1 (PcITR1) contained 12 transmembrane alpha-helices with intracellular C and N termini, consistent with other inositol transporters. The apparent K myo-Inositol is a sugarlike nutrient that is essential for life in most organisms. Humans and microbes alike can obtain it by making it, which involves only 2 enzymes, by taking it from the environment by a transport process, or by recycling it from other cellular constituents. Inspection of the genomes of the pathogenic fungi of the genus Pneumocystis showed that these pneumonia-causing parasites could not make myo-inositol, as they lacked the 2 enzymes. Instead, we found evidence of inositol transporters, which would import the sugar from the lungs where the fungi reside. In the present report, we characterized the transport of myo-inositol in the fungus and found that the transporter was highly selective for myo-inositol and did not transport any other molecules. The transport was distinct from that in mammalian cells, and since mammals can both make and transport myo-inositol, while Pneumocystis fungi must transport it, this process offers a potential new drug target.

357,23357280,"We previously showed that knockdown of the anaplerotic enzyme pyruvate carboxylase in the INS-1 832/13 insulinoma cell line inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin release and glucose carbon incorporation into lipids. We now show that knockdown of fatty acid synthase (FAS) mRNA and protein also inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin release in this cell line. Levels of numerous phospholipids, cholesterol esters, diacylglycerol, triglycerides and individual fatty acids with C14-C24 side chains were acutely lowered about 20% in glucose-stimulated pyruvate carboxylase knockdown cells over a time course that coincides with insulin secretion. In FAS knockdown cells glucose carbon incorporation into lipids and the levels of the subclasses of phospholipids and cholesterol ester species were lower by 20-30% without inhibition of glucose oxidation. These studies suggest that rapid lipid modification is essential for normal glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. "

360,28364489,"To examine the influence of maternal sleep quality and nocturnal sleep duration on risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in a multiethnic Asian population. A cohort of 686 women (376 Chinese, 186 Malay, and 124 Indian) with a singleton pregnancy attended a clinic visit at 26-28 weeks of gestation as part of the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes mother-offspring cohort study. Self-reported sleep quality and sleep duration were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). GDM was diagnosed based on a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test administered after an overnight fast (1999 WHO criteria). Multiple logistic regression was used to model separately the associations of poor sleep quality (PSQI score > 5) and short nocturnal sleep duration (<6 h) with GDM, adjusting for age, ethnicity, maternal education, body mass index, previous history of GDM, and anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory score). In the cohort 296 women (43.1%) had poor sleep quality and 77 women (11.2%) were categorized as short sleepers; 131 women (19.1%) were diagnosed with GDM. Poor sleep quality and short nocturnal sleep duration were independently associated with increased risk of GDM (poor sleep, adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11 to 2.76; short sleep, adjusted OR = 1.96, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.66). During pregnancy, Asian women with poor sleep quality or short nocturnal sleep duration exhibited abnormal glucose regulation. Treating sleep problems and improving sleep behavior in pregnancy could potentially reduce the risk and burden of GDM. "
361,35786777,"Although previous research has shown the benefit of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for hepatic glycogen storage diseases (GSDs), current lack of prospectively collected CGM metrics and glycemic targets for CGM-derived outcomes in the hepatic GSD population limits its use. To assess CGM metrics for glycemic variation and glycemic control in adult patients with GSDIa as compared to matched healthy volunteers. Prospective CGM data were collected during the ENGLUPRO GSDIa trial (NCT04311307) in which a Dexcom G6 device was used. Ten adult patients with GSDIa and 10 age-, sex- and body mass index-matched healthy volunteers were enrolled. Capillary blood glucose was concurrently measured during 2 standardized 2-hour time intervals. Descriptive [eg, glycemic variability (GV), time below range, time in range (TIR), time above range (TAR)] and advanced (ie, first- and second-order derivatives, Fourier analysis) CGM outcomes were calculated. For each descriptive CGM outcome measure, 95% CIs were computed in patients with GSDIa and healthy volunteers, respectively. CGM overestimation was higher under preprandial and level 1 hypoglycemia (ie, capillary glucose values ≥ 3.0 mmol/L and < 3.9 mmol/L) conditions. GV and TAR were higher while TIR was lower in patients with GSDIa compared to healthy volunteers (P < 0.05). Three patients with GSDIa showed descriptive CGM outcomes outside the calculated 95% CI in GSDIa patients. Advanced CGM analysis revealed a distinct pattern (ie, first- and second-order derivatives and glucose curve amplitude) in each of these 3 patients within the patients group. This is the first study to prospectively compare CGM outcomes between adult patients with GSDIa and matched healthy volunteers. The generation of a set of CGM metrics will provide guidance in using and interpreting CGM data in GSDIa and will be useful for the definition of glycemic targets for CGM in patients with GSDIa. Future studies should investigate the prognostic value of CGM outcomes and their major determinants in patients with GSDIa. "
362,31895757,"The aim of this study was to compare the effect of intensive therapy [consisting of high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (HDC/ASCT)] and conventional standard-dose chemotherapy (CDC) on brain FDG uptake, as an indicator of glucose metabolism, in multiple myeloma patients. Twenty-four patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were included. Sixteen patients received HDC/ASCT, including bortezomib-based induction therapy, and eight patients received CDC. F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/computed tomography (CT) was performed 1 and 3 hours following tracer administration before and after the treatment. The manual segmentation of supratentorial and cerebellum of each patient was performed by two independent observers. The data were expressed as global mean standardized uptake values (GSUVmean). Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare changes from before to after treatment. A significant decrease in the GSUVmean of supratentorial brain and cerebellum was observed after treatment in the patients who received HDC/ASCT (1 hour scans: 7.03 ± 1.18 vs. 6.56 ± 0.94; P = 0.03 and 7.01 ± 1.08 vs. 6.34 ± 0.93; P = 0.01, respectively).

363,37874683,"Wound healing is a complex, highly regulated process and is substantially disrupted by diabetes. We show here that human wound healing induces specific epigenetic changes that are exacerbated by diabetes in an animal model. We identified epigenetic changes and gene expression alterations that significantly reduce reepithelialization of skin and mucosal wounds in an in vivo model of diabetes, which were dramatically rescued in vivo by blocking these changes. We demonstrate that high glucose altered FOXO1-matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) promoter interactions through increased demethylation and reduced methylation of DNA at FOXO1 binding sites and also by promoting permissive histone-3 methylation. Mechanistically, high glucose promotes interaction between FOXO1 and RNA polymerase-II (Pol-II) to produce high expression of MMP9 that limits keratinocyte migration. The negative impact of diabetes on reepithelialization in vivo was blocked by specific DNA demethylase inhibitors in vivo and by blocking permissive histone-3 methylation, which rescues FOXO1-impaired keratinocyte migration. These studies point to novel treatment strategies for delayed wound healing in individuals with diabetes. They also indicate that FOXO1 activity can be altered by diabetes through epigenetic changes that may explain other diabetic complications linked to changes in diabetes-altered FOXO1-DNA interactions. FOXO1 expression in keratinocytes is needed for normal wound healing. In contrast, FOXO1 expression interferes with the closure of diabetic wounds. Using matrix metallopeptidase 9 as a model system, we found that high glucose significantly increased FOXO1-matrix metallopeptidase 9 interactions via increased DNA demethylation, reduced DNA methylation, and increased permissive histone-3 methylation in vitro. Inhibitors of DNA demethylation and permissive histone-3 methylation improved the migration of keratinocytes exposed to high glucose in vitro and the closure of diabetic skin and mucosal wounds in vivo. Inhibition of epigenetic enzymes that alter FOXO1-induced gene expression dramatically improves diabetic healing and may apply to other conditions where FOXO1 has a detrimental role in diabetic complications.

364,25342306,"This work aimed to evaluate the metabolic and atherogenic effects of long-term antiepileptic drugs in a group of Egyptian epileptic patients. Sixty-nine epileptic patients on antiepileptic drug monotherapy for at least 2 years and 34 control subjects were recruited in this study. Patients were divided into 5 subgroups according to antiepileptic drugs used (valproate, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, topiramate, and levetiracetam). Fasting lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), lipoprotein(a), homocysteine, free thyroxine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and common carotid artery intima-media thickness were measured for all subjects. Significant higher mean values of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein / high-density lipoprotein ratio, lipoprotein(a), homocysteine, significantly lower mean value of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and significantly larger diameter of common carotid artery intima-media thickness were observed in each drug-treated group versus control group. Our study supports that long-term monotherapy treatment with valproate, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and topiramate had altered markers of vascular risk that might enhance atherosclerosis, whereas levetiracetam exerted minimal effect.

365,37140984,"Elevation of glucagon levels and increase in α cell proliferation is associated with states of hyperglycemia in diabetes. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing glucagon secretion could have major implications for understanding abnormal responses to hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes and provide novel avenues for diabetes management. Using mice with inducible induction of Rheb1 in α cells (αRhebTg mice), we showed that short-term activation of mTORC1 signaling is sufficient to induce hyperglucagonemia through increased glucagon secretion. Hyperglucagonemia in αRhebTg mice was also associated with an increase in α cell size and mass expansion. This model allowed us to identify the effects of chronic and short-term hyperglucagonemia on glucose homeostasis by regulating glucagon signaling in the liver. Short-term hyperglucagonemia impaired glucose tolerance, which was reversible over time. Liver glucagon resistance in αRhebTg mice was associated with reduced expression of the glucagon receptor and genes involved in gluconeogenesis, amino acid metabolism, and urea production. However, only genes regulating gluconeogenesis returned to baseline upon improvement of glycemia. Overall, these studies demonstrate that hyperglucagonemia exerts a biphasic response on glucose metabolism: Short-term hyperglucagonemia lead to glucose intolerance, whereas chronic exposure to glucagon reduced hepatic glucagon action and improved glucose tolerance.

366,33883682,"The mammalian heart switches its main metabolic substrate from glucose to fatty acids shortly after birth. This metabolic switch coincides with the loss of regenerative capacity in the heart. However, it is unknown whether glucose metabolism regulates heart regeneration. Here, we report that glucose metabolism is a determinant of regenerative capacity in the neonatal mammalian heart. Cardiac-specific overexpression of Glut1, the embryonic form of constitutively active glucose transporter, resulted in an increase in glucose uptake and concomitant accumulation of glycogen storage in postnatal heart. Upon cryoinjury, Glut1 transgenic hearts showed higher regenerative capacity with less fibrosis than non-transgenic control hearts. Interestingly, flow cytometry analysis revealed two distinct populations of ventricular cardiomyocytes: Tnnt2-high and Tnnt2-low cardiomyocytes, the latter of which showed significantly higher mitotic activity in response to high intracellular glucose in Glut1 transgenic hearts. Metabolic profiling shows that Glut1-transgenic hearts have a significant increase in the glucose metabolites including nucleotides upon injury. Inhibition of the nucleotide biosynthesis abrogated the regenerative advantage of high intra-cardiomyocyte glucose level, suggesting that the glucose enhances the cardiomyocyte regeneration through the supply of nucleotides. Our data suggest that the increase in glucose metabolism promotes cardiac regeneration in neonatal mouse heart. "
367,36786253,"Iron chelation therapy (ICT) is the gold standard for treating patients with iron overload, though its long-term effects are still under evaluation. According to current recommendations regarding  transfusion-dependent  (TD)  β-thalassemia major (β-TM) patients, their serum ferritin (SF) levels should be maintained below 1,000 ng/mL and ICT should be discontinued when the levels are <500 ng/mL in two successive tests. Alternatively, the dose of chelator could be considerably reduced to maintain a balance between iron input and output of  frequent transfusions. Due to the paucity of information on long-term effects of ICT  in β-TM with low SF levels on glucose homeostasis, the International Network of Clinicians for Endocrinopathies in Thalassemia and Adolescence Medicine (ICET-A) promoted a retrospective and an ongoing prospective observational study with the primary aim to address the long-term effects of ICT on glucose tolerance and metabolism (β-cell function and peripheral insulin sensitivity) in adult β-TM patients with persistent SF level below 800 ng/mL. 11 β-TM patients (mean age: 35.5 ± 5.5 years; SF range: 345-777 ng/mL) with normal glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT) for a median of 5.3(1.1-8.3) years. Abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT) was observed in 7 patients (63.6%) at first observation and ) persisted in 6 patients (54.5%) at last observation. None of them developed diabetes mellitus. AGT was reversed in two patients. One patient with NGT developed early glucose intolerance (1-h PG ≥155 and 2-h PG <140 mg/dL). Three out of  5 patients with isolated impaired glucose tolerance presented a variation of  ATG. Stabilization of low indices for β-cell function and insulin sensitivity/resistance was observed.

369,26481663,"Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) is well known for its role in gluconeogenesis. However, PEPCK is also a key regulator of TCA cycle flux. The TCA cycle integrates glucose, amino acid, and lipid metabolism depending on cellular needs. In addition, biosynthetic pathways crucial to tumor growth require the TCA cycle for the processing of glucose and glutamine derived carbons. We show here an unexpected role for PEPCK in promoting cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo by increasing glucose and glutamine utilization toward anabolic metabolism. Unexpectedly, PEPCK also increased the synthesis of ribose from non-carbohydrate sources, such as glutamine, a phenomenon not previously described. Finally, we show that the effects of PEPCK on glucose metabolism and cell proliferation are in part mediated via activation of mTORC1. Taken together, these data demonstrate a role for PEPCK that links metabolic flux and anabolic pathways to cancer cell proliferation. "
370,27321482,"Neuroimaging studies of depression considered as a stress-related disorder have shown uncoupling in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (rCMRglc). We hypothesised that the mismatch change of rCBF and rCMRglc could be a stress-related phenomenon. We exposed male rats to 15-min period of forced swim (FS), followed by the measurement of rCBF using N-isopropyl-4-[123I] iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP) and rCMRglc using 2-deoxy-2-[18F] fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG). The uptake rate of 18F-FDG in the FS group showed a significant decrease in the prefrontal cortex (0.86±0.20%ID/g, p<0.01) and thalamus (0.77±0.17%ID/g, p<0.05) and tended to be lower in the hippocampus (0.58±0.13%ID/g) and cerebellum (0.59±0.13%ID/g) without overt alteration in the uptake rate of 123I-IMP. The FS stress can cause mismatch change of rCBF and rCMRglc, which reflect a stress-related phenomenon. "
371,30270124,"From an organismal perspective, cancer cell populations can be considered analogous to parasites that compete with the host for essential systemic resources such as glucose. Here, we employed leukemia models and human leukemia samples to document a form of adaptive homeostasis, where malignant cells alter systemic physiology through impairment of both host insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion to provide tumors with increased glucose. Mechanistically, tumor cells induce high-level production of IGFBP1 from adipose tissue to mediate insulin sensitivity. Further, leukemia-induced gut dysbiosis, serotonin loss, and incretin inactivation combine to suppress insulin secretion. Importantly, attenuated disease progression and prolonged survival are achieved through disruption of the leukemia-induced adaptive homeostasis. Our studies provide a paradigm for systemic management of leukemic disease. "

373,26596695,"I is essential for thyroid hormone synthesis and neurological development. Various changes occur in thyroid hormone metabolism during pregnancy and I requirements increase significantly. The purpose of this study was to investigate I status among pregnant women in Trabzon, formerly a severely I-deficient area but shown to have become I sufficient following mandatory iodisation of table salt based on monitoring studies among school-age children (SAC) in the area. A total of 864 healthy pregnant women with a median age of 28 (25th-75th percentile 17-47) years participated in the study. None of them were using I-containing supplement. All of them were screened for use of iodised salt, obstetric history, thyroid function tests and urinary I concentrations (UIC), and thyroid ultrasonography was performed. Median UIC was 102 (25th-75th percentile=62-143) μg/l. Median UIC of the patients according to trimesters were 122 µg/l at the 1st, 97 µg/l at the 2nd and 87 µg/l at the 3rd trimester. UIC in the 1st trimester was higher compared with the 2nd and 3rd trimesters (P<0·017). Nodules were present in 17·7% of women (n 153). The rate of iodised salt usage among pregnant women was 90·7%. Our study demonstrates that, although the I status among SAC has been rectified, I deficiency (ID) is still prevalent among pregnant women. Current knowledge is in favour of I supplementation in this group. Until the effects of maternal I supplementation in mild ID have been clarified by large-scale prospective controlled trials, pregnant women living in borderline defficient and I-sufficient areas, such as Trabzon city, should receive 100-200 µg/d of I-containing supplements in addition to iodised salt.

374,32599520,"Beyond nutrition effect, quercetin is applied as a complement or an alternative for promoting human health and treating diseases. However, its complicated neuroprotective mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. This study provides evidence of an alternative target for quercetin, and sheds light on the mechanisms of its neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in Sprague-Dawley rats. Oral pretreatment using quercetin has alleviated cerebral I/R-induced neurological deficits, brain infarction, blood-brain barrier disruption, oxidative stress, TNF-α and IL-1β mRNA expression, along with apoptotic caspase 3 activity. The neuroprotective, anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects of quercetin were replicated in rat hippocampal slice cultures and neuron/glia cultures which suffered from oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGDR). Biochemical studies revealed a reduction of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt phosphorylation, along with an increase in protein tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphatase activity in cerebral I/R rat cortical tissues and OGDR hippocampal slice and neuron/glia cultures. Quercetin alleviated the changes in ERK/Akt phosphorylation and protein phosphatase activities. Inhibition of ERK or Akt alone was enough to cause apoptotic cell death and cytotoxicity in hippocampal slice cultures and neuron/glia cultures, while activators of ERK or Akt alleviated OGDR-induced cytotoxicity. Taken together, our results demonstrate that quercetin alleviated the increment of protein tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphatase activity, along with the reduction of ERK and Akt phosphorylation, which may play pivotal roles in the expansion of brain injury after cerebral I/R.

375,31412252,"Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a malignancy arising across multiple anatomical sites, is responsible for significant cancer mortality due to insufficient therapeutic options. Here, we identify exceptional glucose reliance among SCCs dictated by hyperactive GLUT1-mediated glucose influx. Mechanistically, squamous lineage transcription factors p63 and SOX2 transactivate the intronic enhancer cluster of SLC2A1. Elevated glucose influx fuels generation of NADPH and GSH, thereby heightening the anti-oxidative capacity in SCC tumors. Systemic glucose restriction by ketogenic diet and inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption with SGLT2 inhibitor precipitate intratumoral oxidative stress and tumor growth inhibition. Furthermore, reduction of blood glucose lowers blood insulin levels, which suppresses PI3K/AKT signaling in SCC cells. Clinically, we demonstrate a robust correlation between blood glucose concentration and worse survival among SCC patients. Collectively, this study identifies the exceptional glucose reliance of SCC and suggests its candidacy as a highly vulnerable cancer type to be targeted by systemic glucose restriction. "
376,38270104,"The repair of diabetic wounds remains challenging, primarily due to the high-glucose-derived immune inhibition which often leads to the excessive inflammatory response, impaired angiogenesis, and heightened susceptibility to infection. However, the means to reduce the immunosuppression and regulate the conversion of M2 phenotype macrophages under a high-glucose microenvironment using advanced biomaterials for diabetic wounds are not yet fully understood. Herein, we report two-dimensional carbide (MXene)-M2 macrophage exosome (Exo) nanohybrids (FM-Exo) for promoting diabetic wound repair by overcoming the high-glucose-derived immune inhibition. FM-Exo showed the sustained release of M2 macrophage-derived exosomes (M2-Exo) up to 7 days and exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. In the high-glucose microenvironment, relative to the single Exo, FM-Exo could significantly induce the optimized M2a/M2c polarization ratio of macrophages by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, promoting the proliferation, migration of fibroblasts, and angiogenic ability of endothelial cells. In the diabetic full-thickness wound model, FM-Exo effectively regulated the polarization status of macrophages and promoted their transition to the M2 phenotype, thereby inhibiting inflammation, promoting angiogenesis through VEGF secretion, and improving proper collagen deposition. As a result, the healing process was accelerated, leading to a better healing outcome with reduced scarring. Therefore, this study introduced a promising approach to address diabetic wounds by developing bioactive nanomaterials to regulate immune inhibition in a high-glucose environment. "
377,37298384,"Research indicates that adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) may develop both metabolic syndrome (MetS) and oxidative stress. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that MetS could potentially affect antioxidant defense parameters. The study recruited adolescents aged 10-17 who had been diagnosed with T1DM, and divided them into two groups: ""MetS+"" (n = 22), who had been diagnosed with MetS, and ""MetS-"" (n = 81), who did not have metabolic syndrome. A control group consisting of 60 healthy peers without T1DM was included for comparison. The study examined cardiovascular parameters, such as complete lipid profile and estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR), as well as markers of antioxidant defense. The results revealed a statistically significant difference between the MetS+ and the MetS- group in terms of total antioxidant status (TAS) (1.186 mmol/L vs. 1.330 mmol/L), and oxidative stress index (OSI) levels (0.666 vs. 0.533). Furthermore, multivariate correspondence analysis identified individuals with HbA1c < 8%; eGDR > 8 mg/kg/min, using either flash or continuous glucose monitoring systems, as MetS- patients.

378,36283454,"Loss of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) has been found to slow the progression of diabetes and diabetic angiopathy. In our study, we found bidirectional regulation of PARP-1 in high glucose induced endothelial injury, which promoting repair at the early stage of injury and inhibiting repair at the late stage of injury. To further investigate the mechanism of PARP-1 regulation, we first examined the expression of PARP-1 in aortic tissues and cultured cells at early, middle, and late stages of injury, PARP-1 expression was significantly greater than that of control group. Overexpression of PARP-1 in HUVECs significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells 12 h after high glucose injury, while reducing the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS)/malondialdehyde (MDA)/inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), increasing the level of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS); however, when the injury extended to 3 days, the number of apoptosis in HUVECs overexpressing PARP-1 was significantly higher than that in the injury group, and the level of ROS/MDA/iNOS was significantly higher, while the secretion of eNOS was significantly lower. Similarly, PARP-1 inhibitors aggravate early damage and inhibit late damage. We found that PARP-1 promoted the activation of P53 and P53R2 in endothelial cells after 12 h of injury, and PARP-1 promoted the activation of P53 and caspas3 in endothelial cells after 3 days of injury. Therefore, we suggest that PARP-1 plays a dual regulatory role in promoting repair or aggravating injury. "
379,22595886,"A decrease in the expression of Islet-1 (Isl-1), an islet transcription factor, has been reported in several physiological settings of reduced β-cell function. Here, we investigate whether an increased level of Isl-1 in islet cells can enhance β-cell function and/or mass. We demonstrate that transgenic mice with Isl-1 overexpression display improved glucose tolerance and enhanced insulin secretion without significant changes in β cell mass. From our microarray study, we identify approximately 135 differentially expressed genes in the islets of Isl-1 overexpressing mice that have been implicated to function in numerous biological processes including protein trafficking, metabolism and differentiation. Using real-time PCR we have confirmed upregulation of Caps2, Sec14l4, Slc2a10, P2rx7, Afamin, and Neurogenin 3 that may in part mediate the observed improved insulin secretion in Isl-1 overexpressing mice. These findings show for the first time that Isl-1 is a key factor in regulating adult β cell function in vivo, and suggest that Isl-1 elevation could be beneficial to improve glucose homeostasis. "
380,9821422,"We sought to ascertain whether the timing of feeding initiation affected the development of intestinal lactase activity and whether there are clinical ramifications of lower lactase activity. Preterm infants (26 to 30 weeks' gestation; n = 135) were randomly assigned to begin enteral feedings at either 4 (early group) or 15 days of age (standard group). At 10, 28, and 50 days of age lactase activity was determined by measuring the urinary ratio of lactulose/lactose after the 2 sugars were administered. Lactase activity increased significantly over time. Infants in the early group had greater lactase activity at 10 days of age (by 100%) and 28 days of age (by 60%) than the standard group. At 10 days of age lactase activity was greater in milk- versus formula-fed infants. The time required to achieve full enteral feedings, the number of abnormal abdominal x-ray examinations, and the total number of abdominal x-ray examinations were inversely related to lactase activity. Early feeding increases intestinal lactase activity in preterm infants. Lactase activity is a marker of intestinal maturity and may influence clinical outcomes. Whether the effects of milk on lactase activity were due to the greater concentration of lactose in human milk compared with that in formula must be determined. "
381,9488257,"Transmucosal passage of bacteria across the intestine, the essential and prerequisite step for bacterial translocation, cannot be effectively studied using in vivo models of translocation. We have adapted the Ussing chamber into a fresh, sterile organ culture system that can facilitate the study of bacterial-epithelial interactions. Intestinal membranes were mounted in the Ussing chamber and perfused with a solution rich in putative mucosal micronutrients. The transmembrane potential difference was constantly monitored as a marker of intestinal integrity. Transmucosal passage of various bacteria across the normal intestinal epithelium was quantitated, and the mucosal membrane was examined by light and transmission electron microscopy. The addition of potassium cyanide to the mucosal perfusate resulted in an irreversible loss of potential difference. Oxygen deprivation also led to a precipitous drop in potential difference, but it was reversible with prompt reoxygenation. In contrast, intestinal membranes perfused with a solution consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 20 mM glutamine maintained their potential difference for a sustained period (>180 min). Both the viability and structural integrity of the ileal intestinal membrane were maintained in culture ex vivo using this perfusate. Qualitative differences were observed in the mechanism of transmucosal passage of mild to moderately virulent bacteria such as Escherichia coli C-25 and Proteus mirabilis M-13, which pass through the intestinal epithelium without causing overt damage to the mucosa, and more virulent organisms such as Salmonella typhimurium, which cause extensive mucosal damage by light and transmission electron microscopy. The Ussing system should provide a useful model of intact organ culture for the study of the mechanisms of bacterial translocation and the pathogenesis of enteric infections. "
382,8240303,"The myo-inositol transport system in confluent fetal-bovine aortic endothelial cells was characterized after 7-10 days in subculture, at which time the myo-inositol levels and rates of myo-[2-3H]-inositol uptake and incorporation into phospholipid had reached steady state. Kinetic analysis indicated that the uptake occurred by both a high-affinity transport system with an apparent Kt of 31 microM and Vmax. of 45 pmol/min per mg of protein, and a non-saturable low-affinity system. Uptake was competitively inhibited by phlorhizin, with a Ki of 50 microM; phloretin was a non-competitive inhibitor, with half-maximal inhibition between 0.2 and 0.5 mM. Glucose was a weak competitive inhibitor, with a Ki of 37 mM; galactose failed to inhibit uptake. A weak dependence on Na+ for the initial rate of uptake was observed at 11 microM myo-inositol. When fetal-bovine-serum (FBS)-supplemented medium, which contained 225 microM myo-inositol, was used, the cells contained about 200 nmol of myo-inositol/mg of DNA. With adult-bovine-serum (ABS)-supplemented medium, which contained 13 microM myo-inositol, the cells contained about 110 nmol/mg of DNA. Transport of 11 microM myo-[2-3]inositol was 18 and 125 pmol/min per mg of DNA for cells grown in FBS and ABS respectively. Kinetic analysis showed that for the cells grown in FBS the Vmax. of the high-affinity system was decreased by 64%, whereas the Kt remained essentially unchanged. Increased cell myo-inositol levels were not associated with an increased rate of phosphatidylinositol synthesis. After prolonged exposure of fetal endothelial cells to a myo-inositol concentration which approximated to a high fetal as opposed to a low adult blood level, cell myo-inositol levels doubled and high-affinity transport underwent down-regulation.

383,33188191,"Hypothalamic neurons including proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-producing neurons regulate body weights. The non-motile primary cilium is a critical sensory organelle on the cell surface. An association between ciliary defects and obesity has been suggested, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we show that inhibition of ciliogenesis in POMC-expressing developing hypothalamic neurons, by depleting ciliogenic genes IFT88 and KIF3A, leads to adulthood obesity in mice. In contrast, adult-onset ciliary dysgenesis in POMC neurons causes no significant change in adiposity. In developing POMC neurons, abnormal cilia formation disrupts axonal projections through impaired lysosomal protein degradation. Notably, maternal nutrition and postnatal leptin surge have a profound impact on ciliogenesis in the hypothalamus of neonatal mice; through these effects they critically modulate the organization of hypothalamic feeding circuits. Our findings reveal a mechanism of early life programming of adult adiposity, which is mediated by primary cilia in developing hypothalamic neurons. "
384,29168081,"Hyperglycemia is a highly dangerous factor to various diseases, even resulting in death of people. Inflammation plays a key role in this process. The aim of this study was to explore the role of malignant fibrous histiocytoma amplified sequence 1 (MFHAS1) in high-glucose induced inflammation. Our research showed that high glucose stimulated the expression of MFHAS1, and overexpression of MFHAS1 can attenuate high-glucose induced inflammation in endothelial cells by decreasing the secretion of cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-1α (IL-1α), adhesion molecule intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL-1). Furthermore, we found that MFHAS1 promoted the phosphorylation of Akt and the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Our results indicated that MFHAS1 deadened high-glucose induced inflammation by activating AKT/HO-1 pathway, suggesting that MFHAS1 may act as a new therapeutic target of diabetes mellitus. "
385,16997836,"FoxO1 plays an important role in mediating the effect of insulin on hepatic metabolism. Increased FoxO1 activity is associated with reduced ability of insulin to regulate hepatic glucose production. However, the underlying mechanism and physiology remain unknown. We studied the effect of FoxO1 on the ability of insulin to regulate hepatic metabolism in normal vs. insulin-resistant liver under fed and fasting conditions. FoxO1 gain of function, as a result of adenovirus-mediated or transgenic expression, augmented hepatic gluconeogenesis, accompanied by decreased glycogen content and increased fat deposition in liver. Mice with excessive FoxO1 activity exhibited impaired glucose tolerance. Conversely, FoxO1 loss of function, caused by hepatic production of its dominant-negative variant, suppressed hepatic gluconeogenesis, resulting in enhanced glucose disposal and improved insulin sensitivity in db/db mice. FoxO1 expression becomes deregulated, culminating in increased nuclear localization and accounting for its increased transcription activity in livers of both high fat-induced obese mice and diabetic db/db mice. Increased FoxO1 activity resulted in up-regulation of hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1beta, fatty acid synthase, and acetyl CoA carboxylase expression, accounting for increased hepatic fat infiltration. These data indicate that hepatic FoxO1 deregulation impairs the ability of insulin to regulate hepatic metabolism, contributing to the development of hepatic steatosis and abnormal metabolism in diabetes.

386,16010523,"Obesity is a global problem with high risks of cardiovascular diseases, stroke and type 2 diabetes. It is well known that maternal obesity affects offspring by inducing malformation, functional abnormalities in many organs and cells, and by increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, little is known about abnormalities induced by maternal obesity in pancreatic beta cells of offspring. We used mouse mothers with the Agouti yellow modification on a C57BL/6 background as a maternal model of normoglycaemic obesity, and produced Agouti-negative offspring. Half of the offspring were fed a high-fat diet. Offspring glucose tolerance was tested at different ages, and animals were killed at 50 weeks of age for islet function analysis. Maternal obesity impaired glucose tolerance in female offspring fed a high-fat diet, and significantly reduced insulin secretion at 50 weeks of age in female offspring that had been fed a normal diet and high-fat diet. Insulin secretion and glucose potentiation from these islets were significantly reduced. Islet protein, DNA and insulin contents were increased while glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and transketolase activities were reduced in female offspring. Our results indicate that maternal obesity has a long-term effect on the beta cells of female, but not of male, offspring, and leads to increased risk of gestational diabetes and type 2 diabetes in the offspring's later lives.

387,9921812,"The lung is particularly susceptible to reperfusion injury, both experimentally and clinically after transplantation. The extracellular-type preservation solution Celsior, which has been predominantly studied in cardiac preservation, has components designed to prevent cell swelling, free radical injury, energy depletion, and calcium overload. Using an isolated blood-perfused rat lung model, we investigated whether Celsior would decrease preservation injury and improve lung function after cold ischemic storage and reperfusion compared to Euro-Collins (EC) and University of Wisconsin (UW) solutions. Lewis rat lungs were isolated, flushed with the respective cold preservation solution, and then stored at 4 degrees C for 6 or 12 hr. After ischemic storage, the lung block was suspended from a force transducer, ventilated with 100% O2, and reperfused for 90 min with fresh blood via a cannula in the pulmonary artery. Lung compliance, alveolar-arterial oxygen difference, and outflow oxygen tension were all measured. The capillary filtration coefficient (Kf), a sensitive measure of changes in microvascular permeability, was determined. For 6 hr of cold storage, lungs stored in Celsior had lower Kf values than those stored in EC, indicating decreased microvascular permeability. No other significant differences were noted between Celsior and EC or UW. For 12 hr of cold storage, Celsior provided increased oxygenation, decreased alveolar-arterial O2 differences, increased compliance, and decreased Kf values as compared to both EC and UW. Celsior provides better lung preservation than EC or UW as demonstrated by increased oxygenation, decreased capillary permeability, and improved lung compliance, particularly at 12-hr storage times. These results are highly relevant, inasmuch as EC and UW are the most common clinically used lung preservation solutions. Further studies of Celsior in experimental and clinical lung transplantation, as well as in other solid organs, are indicated. "
388,8979302,"The regulation of gluconeogenesis by low birth weight infants remains poorly delineated. To investigate this, 15 5-d-old infants (26-31-wk gestational age, 795-1485-g body weight), were infused i.v. for 4 h with uniformly labeled [U-13C]glucose (5 mg/kg/min) as the sole source of glucose. Intralipid (3 mg/kg/ min) was provided, but no amino acids were given. Blood samples were taken immediately before and after 4 h of tracer infusion. The isotopic enrichments of plasma glucose and alanine were measured by selected ion monitoring gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Glucose production rates were calculated from the isotopic dilution of plasma [U-13C]glucose and the glucose infusion rate. Gluconeogenesis was estimated from the relative isotopic enrichments of [M + 3]- and [M + 6]-glucose, using the isotopic enrichment of plasma [U-13C]alanine, to define the isotopic dilution of the 3-carbon pool, and previously published equations to calculate the isotopic dilution of hepatic oxaloacetate. Glucose production (15 +/- 9 mumol/kg/min) was negatively related to body weight (r = -0.67; p < 0.05) and the ratio of the isotopic enrichments of [13C3]alanine:[13C6]glucose (0.27 +/- 0.07) was positively related to body weight (r = 0.74; p < 0.025). Both relationships were exponential. Gluconeogenesis (via pyruvate) accounted for 72 +/- 28% of glucose production, and gluconeogenesis per unit body weight was negatively and exponentially (r = -0.82; p < 0.005) related to body weight. These results demonstrate that neonates whose birth weights are less than 1200 g have a particularly high glucose production rate secondary to enhanced gluconeogenesis. We speculate that these results reflect a high weight-specific glucose demand that is met by up-regulation of gluconeogenesis. "
389,36562995,"Data from transgenic rodent models suggest that glucagon acts as an insulin secretagogue by signaling through the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) present on β-cells. However, its net contribution to physiologic insulin secretion in humans is unknown. To address this question, we studied individuals without diabetes in two separate experiments. Each subject was studied on two occasions in random order. In the first experiment, during a hyperglycemic clamp, glucagon was infused at 0.4 ng/kg/min, increasing by 0.2 ng/kg/min every hour for 5 h. On one day, exendin-9,39 (300 pmol/kg/min) was infused to block GLP-1R, while on the other, saline was infused. The insulin secretion rate (ISR) was calculated by nonparametric deconvolution from plasma concentrations of C-peptide. Endogenous glucose production and glucose disappearance were measured using the tracer-dilution technique. Glucagon concentrations, by design, did not differ between study days. Integrated ISR was lower during exendin-9,39 infusion (213 ± 26 vs. 191 ± 22 nmol/5 h, saline vs. exendin-9,39, respectively; P = 0.02). In the separate experiment, exendin-9,39 infusion, compared with saline infusion, also decreased the β-cell secretory response to a 1-mg glucagon bolus. These data show that, in humans without diabetes, glucagon partially stimulates the β-cell through GLP-1R. "
390,23324123,"The forkhead box O (FoxO) subfamily has four members, namely FoxO1, FoxO3, FoxO4, and FoxO6. Unlike the other three members of the FoxO family, FoxO6 has garnered considerably less attention because of earlier reports that FoxO6 expression was limited to the brain. Recent data indicate that FoxO6 is produced in the liver of both rodents and humans. Hepatic FoxO6 activity, which remains at low basal levels in fed states, is markedly induced in fasted mice. FoxO6 activity becomes abnormally higher in the liver of mice with dietary obesity or type 2 diabetes (T2D). Genetically engineered mice with elevated FoxO6 activity in the liver exhibit prediabetes, culminating in the development of glucose intolerance, fasting hyperglycemia, and hyperinsulinemia. Conversely, inhibition of FoxO6 activity in the insulin-resistant liver results in a reduction in fasting hyperglycemia, contributing to the amelioration of hyperinsulinemia in T2D mice. These new data suggest that FoxO6 is an important regulator of hepatic glucose metabolism in response to insulin or physiological cues. Insulin inhibits FoxO6 activity by promoting its phosphorylation and disabling its activity in the nucleus without altering its subcellular distribution via a mechanism that is distinct from other members of the FoxO subfamily. In this article, we comprehensively review the role of FoxO6 in glucose metabolism in health and disease. We also address whether FoxO6 dysregulation is a contributing factor for the pathogenesis of fasting hyperglycemia and discuss whether FoxO6 is a potential therapeutic target for improving fasting hyperglycemia in T2D.

To assess the effectiveness, feasibility, and parental acceptance of a simple combination pain reduction intervention for infants receiving multiple immunization injections. Randomized, controlled, clinical trial. Academic hospital-based primary care center. Infants receiving their 2-month immunizations, consisting of 4 injections (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine, inactivated poliovirus vaccine, Haemophilus influenzae b conjugate and hepatitis B vaccine [Comvax], and heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [Prevnar]). Subjects were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group for administration of 4 injections. The intervention group received sucrose and oral tactile stimulation (with a pacifier or a bottle) and were held by their parents during immunization. The control group did not receive these interventions (standard practice). Blinded assessment of audiotaped crying, heart rate, parent preference for future use of the injection technique, and nurse-rated ease of vaccine administration. One hundred sixteen infants (mean +/- SD age, 9.5 +/- 2.0 weeks) participated. The median (25th-75th percentile range) first cry duration was 19.0 (5.8-62.8) seconds for the intervention group compared with 57.5 (31.0-81.5) seconds for the control group (P =.002). Parents of the intervention group reported a stronger preference for future use of the injection procedure. For intervention vs control, the median (25th-75th percentile) parent preference visual analog scale score was 97.0 (82.0-100.0) vs 44.0 (5.0-77.2) (P<.001) (100 indicates definitely prefer). Nurse-rated ease of vaccine administration was equivalent for both treatment groups. Combining sucrose, oral tactile stimulation, and parental holding was associated with significantly reduced crying in infants receiving multiple immunization injections. Parents stated a strong preference for future use of this method, and nurses found the intervention injection technique easy to apply. "
392,12011058,"The human mitochondrial 12 S rRNA A1555G mutation has been found to be associated with aminoglycoside-induced and non-syndromic deafness. However, putative nuclear modifier gene(s) have been proposed to regulate the phenotypic expression of this mutation. In yeast, the mutant alleles of MTO1, encoding a mitochondrial protein, manifest respiratory-deficient phenotype only when coupled with the mitochondrial 15 S rRNA P(R)454 mutation corresponding to human A1555G mutation. This suggests that the MTO1-like modifier gene may influence the phenotypic expression of human A1555G mutation. Here we report the identification of full-length cDNA and elucidation of genomic organization of the human MTO1 homolog. Human Mto1 is an evolutionarily conserved protein that implicates a role in the mitochondrial tRNA modification. Functional conservation of this protein is supported by the observation that isolated human MTO1 cDNA can complement the respiratory deficient phenotype of yeast mto1 cells carrying P(R)454 mutation. MTO1 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, but with a markedly elevated expression in tissues of high metabolic rates including cochlea. These observations suggest that human MTO1 is a structural and functional homolog of yeast MTO1. Thus, it may play an important role in the pathogenesis of deafness-associated A1555G mutation in 12 S rRNA gene or mutations in tRNA genes. "
393,38259490,"Neutrophils are the most abundant innate immune cells. Multiple mechanisms allow them to engage a wide range of metabolic pathways for biosynthesis and bioenergetics for mediating biological processes such as development in the bone marrow and antimicrobial activity such as ROS production and NET formation, inflammation and tissue repair. We first discuss recent work on neutrophil development and functions and the metabolic processes to regulate granulopoiesis, neutrophil migration and trafficking as well as effector functions. We then discuss metabolic syndromes with impaired neutrophil functions that are influenced by genetic and environmental factors of nutrient availability and usage. Here, we particularly focus on the role of specific macronutrients, such as glucose, fatty acids, and protein, as well as micronutrients such as vitamin B3, in regulating neutrophil biology and how this regulation impacts host health. A special section of this review primarily discusses that the ways nutrient deficiencies could impact neutrophil biology and increase infection susceptibility. We emphasize biochemical approaches to explore neutrophil metabolism in relation to development and functions. Lastly, we discuss opportunities and challenges to neutrophil-centered therapeutic approaches in immune-driven diseases and highlight unanswered questions to guide future discoveries. "
394,38117454,"The loss of epidermal melanocytes is a distinguishing feature of vitiligo (VIT), a prevalent and long-lasting skin ailment. While various hypotheses exist to explain the cause of VIT, the precise mechanisms leading to this disease remain unclear. Zinc finger MIZ-type containing 1 (ZMIZ1) has a strong link with the development and occurrence of VIT. However, the exact role of ZMIZ1 and its underlying mechanisms in VIT are not well understood. Our study aims to illustrate that targeting ZMIZ1 is an effective therapeutic and prophylactic strategy for treating VIT. We obtained the RNA expression profile of VIT samples using RNA-seq and determined the locations and expression of ZMIZ1 in these samples via immunochemistry. Glucose uptake was analyzed through immunofluorescence and glucose uptake assay. We evaluated mRNA levels using qPCR and used plasmids transfection to knock down ZMIZ1 in PIG1 and PIG3V cell lines. The activation of the mTOR/AKT/GSK-3β signalling pathway was assessed using Western blotting analysis. We found that ZMIZ1 expression was decreased in VIT samples. Decreased ZMIZ1 expression inhibits the proliferation, migration, and invasion of melanocytes in vitro. Moreover, we revealed that decreased ZMIZ1 could also inhibit the glucose uptake of melanocytes in vitro. Decreased ZMIZ1 expression inhibits the activation of the mTOR/AKT/GSK-3β pathway and the expression of melanin synthesis-related proteins in melanocytes. Finally, we demonstrated that decreased ZMIZ1 may inhibit the cell viability of melanocytes and the synthesis of melanin by mTOR/AKT/GSK-3β-mediated oxidative stress in vitro. In conclusion, our study suggests that decreased ZMIZ1 suppresses melanogenesis in vitiligo by regulating the mTOR/AKT/GSK-3β-mediated glucose uptake in vitro, making ZMIZ1 an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of VIT.

395,37751301,"BACKGROUNDProglucagon can be processed to glucagon-like peptide1 (GLP-1) within the islet, but its contribution to islet function in humans remains unknown. We sought to understand whether pancreatic GLP-1 alters islet function in humans and whether this is affected by type 2 diabetes.METHODSWe therefore studied individuals with and without type 2 diabetes on two occasions in random order. On one occasion, exendin 9-39, a competitive antagonist of the GLP-1 Receptor (GLP1R), was infused, while on the other, saline was infused. The tracer dilution technique ([3-3H] glucose) was used to measure glucose turnover during fasting and during a hyperglycemic clamp.RESULTSExendin 9-39 increased fasting glucose concentrations; fasting islet hormone concentrations were unchanged, but inappropriate for the higher fasting glucose observed. In people with type 2 diabetes, fasting glucagon concentrations were markedly elevated and persisted despite hyperglycemia. This impaired suppression of endogenous glucose production by hyperglycemia.CONCLUSIONThese data show that GLP1R blockade impairs islet function, implying that intra-islet GLP1R activation alters islet responses to glucose and does so to a greater degree in people with type 2 diabetes.TRIAL REGISTRATIONThis study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04466618.FUNDINGThe study was primarily funded by NIH NIDDK DK126206.

397,31241809,"Stress exposure is known to trigger and exacerbate functional dyspepsia (FD) symptoms. Increased gastric sensitivity to food-related stimuli is widely observed in FD patients and is associated with stress and psychological disorders. The mechanisms underlying the hypersensitivity are not clear. Gastric vagal afferents (GVAs) play an important role in sensing meal-related mechanical stimulation to modulate gastrointestinal function and food intake. This study aimed to determine whether GVAs display hypersensitivity after chronic stress, and whether its interaction with leptin was altered by stress. Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to unpredictable chronic mild stress or no stress (control) for 8 weeks. The metabolic rate, gastric emptying rate, and anxiety- and depression-like behaviors were determined. GVA mechanosensitivity, and its modulation by leptin, was determined using an in vitro single fiber recording technique. QRT-PCR was used to establish the levels of leptin and leptin receptor mRNA in the stomach and nodose ganglion, respectively. The stressed mice had lower body weight and food intake, and increased anxiety-like behavior compared to the control mice. The mechanosensitivity of mucosal and tension-sensitive GVAs was higher in the stressed mice. Leptin potentiated mucosal GVA mechanosensitivity in control but not stressed mice. The expression of leptin mRNA in the gastric mucosa was lower in the stressed mice. In conclusion, chronic stress enhances GVA mechanosensitivity, which may contribute to the gastric hypersensitivity in FD. In addition, the modulatory effect of leptin on GVA signaling is lost after chronic stress exposure. "
398,29610518,"Insulin receptor (IR) plays a key role in the control of glucose homeostasis; however, the regulation of its cellular expression remains poorly understood. Here we show that the amount of biologically active IR is regulated by the cleavage of its ectodomain, by the β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), in a glucose concentration-dependent manner. In vivo studies demonstrate that BACE1 regulates the amount of IR and insulin signaling in the liver. During diabetes, BACE1-dependent cleavage of IR is increased and the amount of IR in the liver is reduced, whereas infusion of a BACE1 inhibitor partially restores liver IR. We suggest the potential use of BACE1 inhibitors to enhance insulin signaling during diabetes. Additionally, we show that plasma levels of cleaved IR reflect IR isoform A expression levels in liver tumors, which prompts us to propose that the measurement of circulating cleaved IR may assist hepatic cancer detection and management.

399,25981061,"Milking frequency is known to affect milk production and lactation persistence in dairy cows. Despite this, the mechanisms underlying this effect are only partially understood. Previous work in dairy cows examining increases in milk yield due to increased milking frequency have identified changes in apoptosis and expression of genes regulating cytokine signaling. In addition, changes in mitochondrial biogenesis and function have been suggested to play a role during the lactation cycle in regulating milk production. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that, when maintained over an entire lactation, extreme differences in milking frequency would be reflected in differences in apoptosis, mammary mitochondrial number, and the mammary expression of genes known to inhibit cytokine signaling. Primiparous Holstein cows (n=6) were assigned to the study 40d before parturition after which 1 udder half was milked once daily (1×) and the other 4 times daily (4×) Mammary biopsies were collected at 15, 60, 120, and 230d of lactation. Average milk yield from the 4× side was 3 times higher than from the 1× side. Analysis of milk composition revealed that protein, lactose, and solids-not-fat percentages were lower in 1× than 4× udder halves. Mammary cell apoptosis was not affected by milking frequency. Mammary cell mitochondrial number, as estimated by succinate dehydrogenase staining, was higher in early lactation, decreasing as days in milk increased, and with increased milking frequency. Although mammary expression of α-lactalbumin (LALBA) and β-casein (CSN2) was significantly increased in 4× glands, the expression of suppressors of cytokine signaling were similar between 1×- and 4×-milked halves. These results support the conclusion that changes in milk production in response to extreme differences in milking frequency may be related to alterations in mitochondrial number and lactose synthesis, but not apoptosis.

400,23838818,"Six enzyme activities are needed to digest starch to absorbable free glucose; 2 luminal α-amylases (AMY) and 4 mucosal maltase-glucoamylase (MGAM) and sucrase-isomaltase (SI) subunit activities are involved in the digestion. The AMY activities break down starch to soluble oligomeric dextrins; mucosal MGAM and SI can either directly digest starch to glucose or convert the post-α-amylolytic dextrins to glucose. We hypothesized that MGAM, with higher maltase than SI, drives digestion on ad limitum intakes and SI, with lower activity but more abundant amount, constrains ad libitum starch digestion. Mgam null and wild-type (WT) mice were fed with starch diets ad libitum and ad limitum. Fractional glucogenesis (fGG) derived from starch was measured and fractional gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis were calculated. Carbohydrates in small intestine were determined. After ad libitum meals, null and WT had similar increases of blood glucose concentration. At low intakes, null mice had less (f)GG (P = 0.02) than WT mice, demonstrating the role of Mgam activity in ad limitum feeding; null mice did not reduce fGG responses to ad libitum intakes demonstrating the dominant role of SI activity during full feeding. Although fGG was rising after feeding, fractional gluconeogenesis fell, especially for null mice. The fGNG (endogenous glucogenesis) in null mice complemented the fGG (exogenous glucogenesis) to conserve prandial blood glucose concentrations. The hypotheses that Mgam contributes a high-efficiency activity on ad limitum intakes and SI dominates on ad libitum starch digestion were confirmed. "
401,10699488,"The role of hepatic serine and glycine transport in the regulation of the biosynthesis of serine by the fetal liver has not been studied. The goal of this study was to characterize serine and glycine transport and utilization at physiologic concentrations in primary cultures of fetal ovine hepatocytes. Primary culture of hepatocytes from mid gestation ( approximately 90 days) and term ( approximately 135 days) fetal sheep were studied after overnight serum free culture. At both gestational ages, the initial rate for sodium dependent 300 microM serine transport (1697+/-131 pmoles/min/mg protein at mid, 1765+/-544 at term) was fourfold greater than sodium dependent 300 microM glycine transport (309+/-54 at mid, 579+/-252 at term). At physiologic concentrations (300 microM), 69+/-7% of serine and 49+/-8% of glycine transport was sodium dependent. At term, sodium dependent serine transport has a V(max) of 1751+/-348 pmoles/min/mg protein and a K(m) of 159+/-111 microM. Sodium independent serine transport has a V(max) of 904+/-185 and a K(m) of 416+/-188 microM. Sodium dependent glycine transport has a V(max) of 410+/-69 and a K(m) of 2290+/-895 microM while sodium independent glycine transport exhibits non-saturable kinetics. Glycine (300 microM) sodium dependent transport was not inhibited by methyl-AIB while sodium dependent 300 microM serine transport was inhibited (31%). n-Ethylmaleimide inhibited sodium dependent serine and glycine transport by 36+/-9% and 37+/-2% respectively in term hepatocytes. Cysteine inhibited sodium dependent serine transport by 37%. Sodium independent glycine transport at 300 microM was higher in low glucose (1.1 mM) medium (881+/-76 pmoles/min/mg protein) compared to high glucose (5.5 mM) medium (510+/-60 P=0.004). There were no significant differences in serine or glycine incorporation into RNA, DNA, glycogen or lipid and protein. The predominance of serine transport over glycine at physiologic concentrations suggests that inward cellular amino acid transport of serine and glycine is not likely to be a regulatory mechanism that would favor serine biosynthesis in fetal ovine hepatocytes.

402,10480601,"The beta-cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans are the targets of autoreactive T-cells and are destroyed in type 1 diabetes. Macrophage-derived interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) is important in eliciting beta-cell dysfunction and initiating beta-cell damage in response to microenvironmental changes within islets. In particular, IL-1beta can impair glucose-stimulated insulin production in beta-cells in vitro and can sensitize them to Fas (CD95)/FasL-triggered apoptosis. In this report, we have examined the ability to block the detrimental effects of IL-1beta by genetically modifying islets by adenoviral gene transfer to express the IL-1 receptor antagonist protein. We demonstrate that adenoviral gene delivery of the cDNA encoding the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (IL-1Ra) to cultured islets results in protection of human islets in vitro against IL-1beta-induced nitric oxide formation, impairment in glucose-stimulated insulin production, and Fas-triggered apoptosis activation. Our results further support the hypothesis that IL-1beta antagonism in in situ may prevent intra-islet proinsulitic inflammatory events and may allow for an in vivo gene therapy strategy to prevent insulitis and the consequent pathogenesis of diabetes.

403,8661197,"The conversion of D-[U-13C]glucose to proline (Pro), aspartate (Asp), and cysteine (Cys) is limited in premature neonates, implying that these amino acids (AA) are conditionally essential. This study was performed to determine whether these findings resulted from an insufficient precursor dose or intracellular compartmentation of newly synthesized amino acids, rather than inadequate synthesis. In the first phase of this study, seven total parenteral nutrition-fed, premature neonates received IV D-[U-13C]glucose at 5 mg/kg/min for 4 hr. In the second phase, a separate cohort of eight patients received an identical infusion. Blood was obtained before and at the end of the infusion. Isotopic enrichments of the free plasma AA and glucose were measured using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in both studies. In phase 2, the isotopic enrichments of the AA bound to the hepatically synthesized proteins, fibrinogen and VLDL-apolipoprotein B-100 (apo B-100), were measured. In phase 1, despite a glucose precursor enrichment greater than 66%, Pro, Asp, and Cys remained the least enriched of all amino acids studied (P < 0.05). Asp, but not Pro, demonstrated very high enrichments in apo B-100 (P < 0.001), reflecting distinct intracellular compartmentation. We conclude that the limited conversion Of D-[U-13C]glucose to Pro, Asp, and Cys did not result from low precursor glucose enrichment and that there is evidence of Asp compartmentation (intracellular) in premature neonates. However, the low Pro enrichment in the free plasma AA pool and the absence of intracellular Pro compartmentation suggest that Pro may be a conditionally essential AA for premature neonates. "
404,35240684,"Youth with obesity and abnormal glucose tolerance have an increased risk for atherosclerosis but the relative contributions of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia to dyslipidemia and the development of subclinical atherosclerosis are unknown. This work aims to determine the association between insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and carotid intimal thickness (cIMT) in adolescents with normal and abnormal glucose tolerance. An observational cohort study in 155 youth: 44 obese insulin sensitive (OIS; fasting insulin ≤ 20 µM/mL, body mass index [BMI] ≥ 95th percentile), 35 obese insulin resistant (OIR; fasting insulin > 20 µM/mL, BMI ≥ 95th percentile), 34 obese abnormal glucose tolerant (AGT; BMI ≥ 95th percentile), and 42 Lean (BMI 5th-85th percentile). Lipids, lipoprotein particle size and concentration (-P), insulin sensitivity (SI an intravenous glucose test), and CMIT were compared using linear models adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, biological sex, and Tanner stage. Lipid/lipoprotein profile and CMIT were reevaluated in a subset after 2 years. Compared to OIS and Lean, OIR and AGT had elevated triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) but similar total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Among OIS, OIR, AGT, lower SI was associated with atherogenic lipids (higher triglycerides, LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and lower HDL-C) and lipoproteins (higher total LDL-P and small HDL-P, and lower large HDL-P). There was a steeper decline in the association of SI with HDL-C and large HDL-P in AGT compared with OIR and OIS. cIMT was comparable across groups and inversely correlated with SI, with no change after 2 years. Among youth with obesity, insulin resistance was associated with an atherogenic lipoprotein/lipid profile and cIMT, regardless of glucose tolerance status. Insulin resistance in AGT youth was associated with a shift to smaller HDL-P compared to normoglycemic youth with obesity. Alterations in HDL-P metabolism may be early adverse manifestations of hyperglycemia in youth with obesity. "
405,11169069,"Quantitative testing of liver function (QTLF) may allow a prognostic assessment of patients with various liver diseases. However, there are insufficient data about patients with liver cirrhosis due to hepatitis C. 86 consecutive patients (58 males, 28 females, age: 48.3 +/- 11.7 years) with chronic hepatitis C (HCV RNA pos.) underwent sonographically guided liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of cirrhosis. QTLF included aminopyrine breath test (microsomal liver function), galactose elimination capacity (cytosolic liver function), sorbitol clearance (liver plasma flow) and indocyanine green clearance (liver perfusion). Values were correlated with the Child-Pugh classification. 55% of the patients (n=47) had cirrhosis of Child-Pugh grade A, 28% of grade B (n=24) and 17% of grade C (n=15). QTLF showed a steady decrease from Child-Pugh grade A to grade B and to grade C. Contrary to markedly reduced tests of metabolic liver function in Child-Pugh grade patients, surrogate tests of hepatic perfusion were at the lower normal limit. All QTLF were significantly reduced in Child-Pugh grade B and C patients compared to healthy controls. Differences between the three Child grades were significant. In patients with cirrhosis due to hepatitis C, QTLF correlated inversely with Child-Pugh grades. Since in cirrhosis of grade A, surrogate tests of hepatic perfusion remained at the lower normal limit, whereas those of metabolic function were decreased, QTLF may be a tool to predict prognosis or complications in early cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C.

406,25157149,"The high energetic costs of human brain development have been hypothesized to explain distinctive human traits, including exceptionally slow and protracted preadult growth. Although widely assumed to constrain life-history evolution, the metabolic requirements of the growing human brain are unknown. We combined previously collected PET and MRI data to calculate the human brain's glucose use from birth to adulthood, which we compare with body growth rate. We evaluate the strength of brain-body metabolic trade-offs using the ratios of brain glucose uptake to the body's resting metabolic rate (RMR) and daily energy requirements (DER) expressed in glucose-gram equivalents (glucosermr% and glucoseder%). We find that glucosermr% and glucoseder% do not peak at birth (52.5% and 59.8% of RMR, or 35.4% and 38.7% of DER, for males and females, respectively), when relative brain size is largest, but rather in childhood (66.3% and 65.0% of RMR and 43.3% and 43.8% of DER). Body-weight growth (dw/dt) and both glucosermr% and glucoseder% are strongly, inversely related: soon after birth, increases in brain glucose demand are accompanied by proportionate decreases in dw/dt. Ages of peak brain glucose demand and lowest dw/dt co-occur and subsequent developmental declines in brain metabolism are matched by proportionate increases in dw/dt until puberty. The finding that human brain glucose demands peak during childhood, and evidence that brain metabolism and body growth rate covary inversely across development, support the hypothesis that the high costs of human brain development require compensatory slowing of body growth rate.

407,28627684,"The present study was performed to investigate the effect of Huaiqihuang (HQH) on hyperglycemia (HG)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in MPC5 podocytes. The effects of HQH and HG on cell viability were assessed using an MTT assay. mRNA and protein expression levels were evaluated using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. Cell apoptosis was assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling, whereas reactive oxygen species production and alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential were assessed using flow cytometry. DNA damage was evaluated using a comet assay. The results demonstrated that treatment of podocytes with HQH markedly suppressed the HG‑induced generation of reactive oxygen species. HQH also significantly improved mitochondrial membrane potential in podocytes exposed to HG. When the podocytes were treated with HG, Ca2+ levels were significantly increased, compared with those in the control group, whereas treatment of the podocytes with HQH significantly reversed the HG‑induced upregulation of Ca2+ secretion. Treatment of the podocytes with HQH significantly reversed the HG‑induced upregulation of glucose‑related protein 78 (GRP78) and C/EBP‑homologous protein, which were used as indicators of ER stress. Furthermore, GRP78 loss‑of‑function attenuated HG‑induced podocyte dysfunction, including cell apoptosis and DNA damage. In conclusion, beneficial effects of HQH on HG‑induced MPC5 podocyte dysfunction were observed, and occurred through the suppression of mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress. "
408,35195254,"In Drosophila, changes to dietary protein elicit different body size responses between the sexes. Whether these differential body size effects extend to other macronutrients remains unclear. Here, we show that lowering dietary sugar (0S diet) enhanced body size in male and female larvae. Despite an equivalent phenotypic effect between the sexes, we detected sex-specific changes to signalling pathways, transcription and whole-body glycogen and protein. In males, the low-sugar diet augmented insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling pathway (IIS) activity by increasing insulin sensitivity, where increased IIS was required for male metabolic and body size responses in 0S. In females reared on low sugar, IIS activity and insulin sensitivity were unaffected, and IIS function did not fully account for metabolic and body size responses. Instead, we identified a female-biased requirement for the Target of rapamycin pathway in regulating metabolic and body size responses. Together, our data suggest the mechanisms underlying the low-sugar-induced increase in body size are not fully shared between the sexes, highlighting the importance of including males and females in larval studies even when similar phenotypic outcomes are observed.

409,33145960,"The differentiation of human stem cells into insulin secreting beta-like cells holds great promise to treat diabetes. Current protocols drive stem cells through stages of directed differentiation and maturation and produce cells that secrete insulin in response to glucose. Further refinements are now needed to faithfully phenocopy the responses of normal beta cells. A critical factor in normal beta cell behavior is the islet microenvironment which plays a central role in beta cell survival, proliferation, gene expression and secretion. One important influence on native cell responses is the capillary basement membrane. In adult islets, each beta cell makes a point of contact with basement membrane protein secreted by vascular endothelial cells resulting in structural and functional polarization. Interaction with basement membrane proteins triggers local activation of focal adhesions, cell orientation, and targeting of insulin secretion. This study aims to identifying the role of basement membrane proteins on the structure and function of human embryonic stem cell and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived beta cells. Here, we show that differentiated human stem cells-derived spheroids do contain basement membrane proteins as a diffuse web-like structure. However, the beta-like cells within the spheroid do not polarize in response to this basement membrane. We demonstrate that 2D culture of the differentiated beta cells on to basement membrane proteins enforces cell polarity and favorably alters glucose dependent insulin secretion. "
410,10409141,"Fully fed piglets (28 days old, 7-8 kg) bearing portal, arterial, and gastric catheters and a portal flow probe were infused with enteral [U-(13)C]glutamate (n = 4), enteral [U-(13)C]glucose (n = 4), intravenous [U-(13)C]glucose (n = 4), or intravenous [U-(13)C]glutamine (n = 3). A total of 94% of the enteral [U-(13)C]glutamate but only 6% of the enteral [U- (13)C]glucose was utilized in first pass by the portal-drained viscera (PDV). The PDV extracted 6.5% of the arterial flux of [U-(13)C]glucose and 20.4% of the arterial flux of [U-(13)C]glutamine. The production of (13)CO(2) (percentage of dose) by the PDV from enteral glucose (3%), arterial glucose (27%), enteral glutamate (52%), and arterial glutamine (70%) varied widely. The substrates contributed 15% (enteral glucose), 19% (arterial glutamine), 29% (arterial glucose), and 36% (enteral glutamate) of the total production of CO(2) by the PDV. Enteral glucose accounted for 18% of the portal alanine and 31% of the portal lactate carbon outflow. We conclude that, in vivo, three-fourths of the energy needs of the PDV are satisfied by the oxidation of glucose, glutamate, and glutamine, and that dietary glutamate is the most important single contributor to mucosal oxidative energy generation.

411,28682459,"The medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) ketogenic diet contains both octanoic (C8) and decanoic (C10) acids. The diet is an effective treatment for pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Although the exact mechanism for its efficacy is not known, it is emerging that C10, but not C8, interacts with targets that can explain antiseizure effects, for example, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (eliciting mitochondrial biogenesis and increased antioxidant status) and the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor. For such effects to occur, significant concentrations of C10 are likely to be required in the brain. To investigate how this might occur, we measured the β-oxidation rate of  Both fatty acids were catabolized, as judged by  It is concluded that, because CPT1 is poorly expressed in the brain, C10 is relatively spared from β-oxidation and can accumulate. This is further facilitated by the presence of C8 in the MCT ketogenic diet, which has a sparing effect upon C10 β-oxidation. "
412,32873793,"Cancer cells are usually characterized by hyperactive glucose metabolism, which can often lead to glucose scarcity; thus, alternative pathways to rewire cancer metabolism are required. Here, we demonstrated that GLUT3 was highly expressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) and negatively linked to CRC patient outcomes, whereas GLUT1 was not associated with CRC prognosis. Under glucose-limiting conditions, GLUT3 expedited CRC cell growth by accelerating glucose input and fuelling nucleotide synthesis. Notably, GLUT3 had a greater impact on cell growth than GLUT1 under glucose-limiting stress. Mechanistically, low-glucose stress dramatically upregulated GLUT3 via the AMPK/CREB1 pathway. Furthermore, high GLUT3 expression remarkably increased the sensitivity of CRC cells to treatment with vitamin C and vitamin C-containing regimens. Together, the results of this study highlight the importance of the AMPK/CREB1/GLUT3 pathway for CRC cells to withstand glucose-limiting stress and underscore the therapeutic potential of vitamin C in CRC with high GLUT3 expression.

413,37935033,"Partial leptin reduction can induce significant weight loss, while weight loss contributes to partial leptin reduction. The cause-and-effect relationship between leptin reduction and weight loss remains to be further elucidated. Here, we show that FGF21 and the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist liraglutide rapidly induced a reduction in leptin. This leptin reduction contributed to the beneficial effects of GLP-1R agonism in metabolic health, as transgenically maintaining leptin levels during treatment partially curtailed the beneficial effects seen with these agonists. Moreover, a higher degree of leptin reduction during treatment, induced by including a leptin neutralizing antibody with either FGF21 or liraglutide, synergistically induced greater weight loss and better glucose tolerance in diet-induced obese mice. Furthermore, upon cessation of either liraglutide or FGF21 treatment, the expected immediate weight regain was observed, associated with a rapid increase in circulating leptin levels. Prevention of this leptin surge with leptin neutralizing antibodies slowed down weight gain and preserved better glucose tolerance. Mechanistically, a significant reduction in leptin induced a higher degree of leptin sensitivity in hypothalamic neurons. Our observations support a model that postulates that a reduction of leptin levels is a necessary prerequisite for substantial weight loss, and partial leptin reduction is a viable strategy to treat obesity and its associated insulin resistance.

414,26487680,"Despite extensive efforts to understand the monogenic contributions to perturbed glucose homeostasis, the complexity of genetic events that fractionally contribute to the spectrum of this pathology remain poorly understood. Proper maintenance of glucose homeostasis is the central feature of a constellation of comorbidities that define the metabolic syndrome. The ability of the liver to balance carbohydrate uptake and release during the feeding-to-fasting transition is essential to the regulation of peripheral glucose availability. The liver coordinates the expression of gene programs that control glucose absorption, storage, and secretion. Herein, we demonstrate that Steroid Receptor Coactivator 2 (SRC-2) orchestrates a hierarchy of nutritionally responsive transcriptional complexes to precisely modulate plasma glucose availability. Using DNA pull-down technology coupled with mass spectrometry, we have identified SRC-2 as an indispensable integrator of transcriptional complexes that control the rate-limiting steps of hepatic glucose release and accretion. Collectively, these findings position SRC-2 as a major regulator of polygenic inputs to metabolic gene regulation and perhaps identify a previously unappreciated model that helps to explain the clinical spectrum of glucose dysregulation.

415,29931151,"Severe burns represent a unique form of trauma in terms of the magnitude and persistence of the stress response they incur. Given advances in acute burn care in the last quarter of a century and the resultant reduction in mortality rates, even for those with massive burns, greater emphasis is now placed on understanding the metabolic stress response to severe burn trauma in order to devise strategies that promote recovery and reduce morbidity. Derangements in metabolism including protein and lipid redistribution and altered glucose handling are hallmarks of the pathophysiological response to burn trauma. In this review article, we aim to distill and discuss the c urrent literature concerning the effect of burn trauma on lipid and glucose metabolism. Furthermore, we will discuss the implications of altered lipid metabolism with regards to insulin sensitivity and glucose control, while discussing the utility of agents and strategies aimed at restoring normal lipid and glucose metabolism in burned patients.

417,16889517,"Transplantation of autologous skin grafts and tissue engineered skin replacements for the treatment of burns, trauma, and ulcerative wounds has been shown to restore a protective barrier to infection and fluid loss, reduce heat loss, provide mechanical strength, diminish pain, and dampen the hypermetabolic stress response to thermal injury. Patencies of these grafts depend mainly on the high viability and sustained function of the enmeshed keratinocytes. With growing demand in tissue replacement therapies, development of successful and economical preservation techniques for skin grafts and replacements becomes essential. In this regard, if attained, desiccated state storage offers an economical solution to availability, storage, and transportation problems. Recent studies indicate that carbohydrates are very efficient in stabilizing mammalian cells against various types of stresses, including those associated with cryopreservation and desiccation. In this study we introduce the use of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (3-OMG), a nonmetabolizable glucose derivative, as a new means of providing protection for keratinocytes undergoing desiccation. We show that with decreasing water contents, viability of the cells decreases; however, at the same water content the immediate post-rehydration viability and long-term survival of the cells exposed to 3-OMG are much higher than those of controls.

418,7674911,"Studies have shown that obese patients have a lower tissue response to insulin than lean individuals, suggesting that obesity promotes the development of insulin resistance. The mechanisms linking obesity and insulin resistance are not known. Obese patients have decreased glucose oxidation and increased lipid oxidation compared with lean individuals, and are hyperinsulinemic, which may result in downregulation of insulin receptors. Studies in healthy subjects have shown that increased plasma levels of nonesterified free fatty acids resulted in a decrease in peripheral insulin-induced glucose uptake. Obese patients have increased plasma levels of nonesterified free fatty acids, which may be involved in the development of insulin resistance. Patients with central obesity have a greater degree of peripheral insulin resistance and higher plasma insulin levels than patients with lower body obesity. Patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) who become obese have a further reduction in insulin sensitivity. Studies in Pima Indians have shown that adiposity is the most important predictor for NIDDM in children with at least one parent who have diabetes.

Animals were exposed to conventional fractionation (200 +/- 4 cGy/day, 5 days/week; total dose, 4000 cGy). Metabolic experiments were made 2 to 3 weeks after completion of the radiation exposure. In comparison with control and sham-irradiated animals, cerebral metabolic activity was diffusely decreased after irradiation. Statistically significant decreases in metabolic activity were observed in 13 of 27 brain regions studied. In general, the brain areas with the highest basal metabolic rates showed the greatest percentage of decrease in glucose utilization. The concept that radiation suppresses glucose utilization before any morphological change takes place in the cell structures was the basis of this study. Metabolic alterations after irradiation may explain the syndrome of early delayed deterioration observed in humans after whole-brain radiotherapy. These studies have applications to observations made with the [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose method in conjunction with positron emission tomographic scans in patients receiving radiation therapy for intracranial malignancies. The data reported here also have potential clinical implications for the evaluation of a risk/benefit ratio for radiotherapy in patients with benign neurosurgical diseases or children undergoing prophylactic treatment of the central nervous system.

420,12482383,"In order to successfully cryopreserve oocytes using low concentrations of intracellular sugars, it is important to characterize their osmotic response in the presence of these intracellular sugars. In the present study, murine (B6D2F1) oocytes were microinjected with 0.8M glucose, trehalose or stachyose solutions to achieve an intracellular concentration equivalent to 0.1M, and then exposed to hypertonic solutions of increasing strength by supplementing an isotonic solution with 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 M of trehalose. Analysis of volumetric response of microinjected oocytes showed that the oocytes behaved as ideal osmometers in the presence of intracellular sugars and satisfied the Boyle van't Hoff relationship. Extrapolation of the osmotically inactive fraction (V macro b) from the Boyle van't Hoff relationship yielded values of 0.188+/-0.028, 0.212+/-0.042, 0.197+/-0.044, and 0.211+/-0.042 for control, glucose, trehalose and stachyose-injected oocytes, respectively. The present data revealing osmometric behavior of mouse oocytes in the presence of different intracellular sugars are important for the optimization of cryopreservation protocols using sugars. "
421,22901483,"The aim of this work was to study, using Wood's model, the lactation curve in Italian Heavy Draft horse (IHDH) mares, both for milk yield and composition. Interest in mare's milk has grown for use in human nutrition, as a substitute for human and cow milk for premature newborns and allergic children. For this study, 7 IHDH mares were used. Milk yield was evaluated from d 15 to 180 postpartum (every 15 d). Wood's lactation model was used to describe milk yield, fat, protein, and lactose lactation curves in the first 180 d in milk (DIM), with a prediction to 210 DIM. Mean values recorded across the considered lactation period for milk yield and constituents were 16.11 kg of milk/d, 11.38 g of fat/kg, 15.54 g of protein/kg, and 69.72 g of lactose/kg. The lactation curve showed a peak at 69 DIM, with a persistence index of 6.26. Fat (g/kg) and protein (g/kg) lactation curves decreased during the lactation period; instead, the lactose (g/kg) curve increased from the first to the last DIM. The coefficient of determination values indicated a good model fit by Wood's model application to IHDH mare lactation. The research showed good aptitude of a heavy horse breed, such as IHDH, for milk production. "
422,10960508,"Most studies of insulin sensitivity in puberty have been cross-sectional and have not been able to longitudinally address changes that might occur. In addition, these studies were unable to separate out glucose's ability to stimulate its own disposal (glucose effectiveness, S(G)) from insulin sensitivity (S(I)) or to separate the hepatic and peripheral effects of insulin. To address these problems, we used the frequently sampled i.v. glucose tolerance test with [6,6]D2 glucose to study S(G)* and S(I)* in 24 children (Tanner stage 1-3) at 6-mo intervals over an 18-mo period. Mean overnight GH and fasting GH binding protein (GHBP), IGF-1, and leptin levels were also measured. S(G)* did not differ between the sexes or Tanner stages. S(I)* did not differ between Tanner stages for either sex and was higher in boys than in girls. Hepatic insulin resistance did not differ between sexes or Tanner stages. S(G)* was not related to any of the other variables measured. S(I)* was negatively related to BMI, GHBP, IGF1, and leptin. These results demonstrate that insulin sensitivity is greater in prepubertal and early pubertal boys than in girls and is primarily determined by body mass effects. "
423,38330703,"Childhood malnutrition is a major global health problem with long-term sequelae, including non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Mechanisms are unknown but may involve metabolic programming, resulting from ""short-term"" solutions to optimise survival by compromising non-priority organs. As key players in lipid metabolism, desaturases have been shown to be predictive of NCDs. We hypothesised that the association between specific desaturase activities and NCD risk determinants (including body composition, serum glucose, insulin levels, and blood pressure) are influenced by childhood post-malnutrition weight gain. 278 Afro-Caribbean adults with well-documented clinical history of severe malnutrition in childhood were studied. Extensive metabolic analyses including body composition (DXA), fasting serum glucose and lipidomics (n = 101), and fasting serum insulin (n = 83) were performed in malnutrition survivors and matched community controls (n = 90). Established lipid ratios were used as proxies of desaturase activities: CE 16:1/CE 16:0 for stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1), LysoPC 20:4/20:3 for fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1), and LysoPC 20:3/18:2 for FADS2. Compared to community controls, adult malnutrition survivors (mean ± SD) age 28.3 ± 7.8 and BMI 23.6 ± 5.2 had higher SCD1 and FADS1 activity, (B ± SE) 0.07 ± 0.02 and 0.7 ± 0.08, respectively, but lower FADS2 activities (B ± SE) -0.05 ± 0.01, adjusted for sex and age (p < 0.0005). SCD1 was positively associated with adult BMI and body fat percentage, and negatively associated with lean mass and height. Stratification based on weight gain during nutritional rehabilitation among malnutrition survivors might signal the potential associations between weight gain during that critical period, desaturase activities, and some of adult metabolic parameters, with the lowest tertiles (slowest catch-up weight gain) performing more similarly to controls. In adult survivors of early-life severe acute malnutrition, desaturase activity is associated with markers of NCD risk, especially adiposity. These associations seem to be strengthened by faster weight gain during nutritional rehabilitation. "
424,36207479,"Perioperative risk factors, including the choice of anesthetics, may influence ovarian cancer recurrence after surgery. Inhalational anesthetic sevoflurane and intravenous agent propofol might affect cancer cell metabolism and signaling, which, in turn, may influence the malignancy of ovarian cancer cells. The different effects between sevoflurane and propofol on ovarian cancer cell biology and underlying mechanisms were studied. Cultured ovarian cancer cells were exposed to 2.5% sevoflurane, 4 μg/mL propofol, or sham condition as the control for 2 h followed by 24-h recovery.

425,26152763,"Severe malnutrition is a leading cause of global childhood mortality, and infection and hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia are commonly present. The etiology behind the changes in glucose homeostasis is poorly understood. Here, we generated an animal model of severe malnutrition with and without low-grade inflammation to investigate the effects on glucose homeostasis. Immediately after weaning, rats were fed diets containing 5 [low-protein diet (LP)] or 20% protein [control diet (CTRL)], with or without repeated low-dose intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 2 mg/kg), to mimic inflammation resulting from infections. After 4 wk on the diets, hyperglycemic clamps or euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps were performed with infusion of [U-(13)C6]glucose and [2-(13)C]glycerol to assess insulin secretion, action, and hepatic glucose metabolism. In separate studies, pancreatic islets were isolated for further analyses of insulin secretion and islet morphometry. Glucose clearance was reduced significantly by LP feeding alone (16%) and by LP feeding with LPS administration (43.8%) compared with control during the hyperglycemic clamps. This was associated with a strongly reduced insulin secretion in LP-fed rats in vivo as well as ex vivo in islets but signficantly enhanced whole body insulin sensitivity. Gluconeogenesis rates were unaffected by LP feeding, but glycogenolysis was higher after LP feeding. A protein-deficient diet in young rats leads to a susceptibility to low-dose endotoxin-induced impairment in glucose clearance with a decrease in the islet insulin secretory pathway. A protein-deficient diet is associated with enhanced peripheral insulin sensitivity but impaired insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glycogenolysis. "
426,29767700,"Hypothyroidism due to iodine deficiency can impair physical development, most visibly in the marked stunting of myxedematous cretinism caused by severe in utero iodine deficiency. Whether iodine repletion improves growth in noncretinous children is uncertain. Therefore, the aim of our systematic review was to assess the effects of iodine fortification or supplementation on prenatal and postnatal growth outcomes in noncretinous children. Following Cochrane methods and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) reporting guidelines, we searched 10 databases including 2 Chinese databases (latest search February 2017). We included randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials (RCTs; non-RCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, and interrupted time-series studies in pregnant women and children (≤18 y), which compared the effects of iodine (any form, dose, regimen) to placebo, noniodized salt, or no intervention on prenatal and postnatal growth outcomes. We calculated mean differences with 95% CIs, performed random-effects meta-analyses, and assessed the quality of evidence with the use of GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). We included 18 studies (13 RCTs, 4 non-RCTs, 1 CBA) (n = 5729). Iodine supplementation of severely iodine-deficient pregnant women increased mean birthweight [mean difference (MD): 200 g; 95% CI: 183, 217 g; n = 635; 2 non-RCTs] compared to controls, but the quality of this evidence was assessed as very low. Iodine repletion across the other groups showed no effects on primary growth outcomes (quality of evidence mostly low and very low). Meta-analyses showed a positive effect in moderate-to-mildly iodine-deficient schoolchildren on insulin-like growth factor-1 (MD: 38.48 ng/mL; 95% CI: 6.19, 70.76 ng/mL; n = 498; 2 RCTs, low-quality evidence) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (MD: 0.46 μg/mL; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.66 μg/mL; n = 498; 2 RCTs, low-quality evidence). In conclusion, we identified few well-designed trials examining the effects of iodine repletion on growth. We are uncertain whether prenatal iodine repletion increases infant growth. Postnatal iodine repletion may improve growth factors but has no clear effects on somatic growth. Our systematic review was registered with PROSPERO as CRD42014012940. "
427,30912250,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several genetic variants affecting gestational glucose metabolism. However, information regarding their known associations with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk remains scarce. This study examined the associations of 12 gestational glucose metabolism-related variants with GDM risk in a Chinese population (964 GDM cases, 1021 controls). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by logistic regression analysis. Rs10830963 in melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B) was found to be associated with an increased risk of GDM, after adjusting for age, prepregnancy body mass index, parity, abnormal pregnancy history, and family history of diabetes (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.05-1.36; P = 0.007). Compared with women with a family history of diabetes, there was a significant association of rs7936247 with GDM risk among pregnant women without a family history of diabetes (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.04-1.38; P = 0.014; P The findings of this study suggest that rs10830963 and rs7936247 may be markers for susceptibility to GDM in a Chinese population.

428,38705260,"Topiramate (TPM) is an antiepileptic drug used for treating epilepsy in children, and migraine in teenagers. In this context, preclinical studies with adult female rats observed reproductive system abnormalities following treatment with TPM. Additionally, exposure to endocrine disruptors during developmental plasticity periods, such as childhood and adolescence, may influence characteristics in the adult individual. This study evaluated whether treatment with TPM during developmental periods influences the reproductive system of female rats either immediately or in adult life. Female Wistar rats were treated with TPM (41 mg/Kg/day) by oral gavage from postnatal day (PND) 16-28, or PND 28-50, which correspond to childhood and adolescence, respectively, and euthanized either 24 h after the final administration or during adulthood. Treatment with TPM during adolescence induced short-term increase in uterus and ovary weights and reduction in endometrial stroma thickness. Adult animals treated during adolescence displayed reduced primordial ovarian follicles' numbers, and increased primary and pre-antral ovarian follicles' numbers. Treatment during childhood induced no short or long-term differences. These results indicate TPM treatment during adolescence is capable of inducing short and long-term alterations on the reproductive system of female Wistar rats. "
429,10689636,"Persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI) is the most common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infants. The current standard treatment is subtotal pancreatectomy (Px). However, the long-term outcome following surgery needs further attention. We analyzed 10 children (7 M, 3 F) with PHHI who underwent partial (65-80%) and subtotal (81-95%) Px. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 9.4 yr (mean = 4.2 yr). We divided them into 2 groups based upon the age at onset of hypoglycemia: early (< 1 mo) and late (> or = 1 mo). The seven patients in the early-onset group underwent 85-95% Px between ages of 18 d and 3 mo. Three of them initially treated by 85-90% Px had persistent hypoglycemia postoperatively. Two out of three required a 2nd operation with 95% Px for controlling hypoglycemia, though both still had persistent hypoglycemia and required medication to control blood glucose. The remaining four had 95% Px and had maintained euglycemia postoperatively. One patient developed diabetes 6 yr after surgery. Six of seven patients had delayed development and subnormal IQ. Three patients of the late-onset group (3 mo, 6 mo and 4 yr) underwent partial Px (80%, 65% and 65%, respectively) and maintained euglycemia postoperatively. Despite 65% Px, one developed diabetes 3 yr after surgery. These results suggest that children with early-onset hypoglycemia have more severe hyperinsulinism than those with late-onset hypoglycemia. The former require 95% Px for maintaining euglycemia, but long-term complications with diabetes may be common. In contrast, the latter require lower percentage Px which may reduce the incidence of diabetes in the future. "
430,22805599,"The stimulants methylphenidate and amphetamine are used to treat children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder over important developmental periods, prompting concerns regarding possible long-term health impact. This study assessed the effects of such a regimen in male, peri-adolescent rhesus monkeys on a variety of cognitive/behavioral, physiological, and in vivo neurochemical imaging parameters. Twice daily (0900 and 1200 hours), for a total of 18 months, juvenile male monkeys (8 per group) consumed either an unadulterated orange-flavored solution, a methylphenidate solution, or a dl-amphetamine mixture. Doses were titrated to reach blood/plasma levels comparable to therapeutic levels in children. [¹¹C]MPH and [¹¹C]raclopride dynamic PET scans were performed to image dopamine transporter and D₂-like receptors, respectively. Binding potential (BP(ND)), an index of tracer-specific binding, and amphetamine-induced changes in BP(ND) of [¹¹C]raclopride were estimated by kinetic modeling. There were no consistent differences among groups on the vast majority of measures, including cognitive (psychomotor speed, timing, inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility), general activity, physiological (body weight, head circumference, crown-to-rump length), and neurochemical (ie, developmental changes in dopamine transporter, dopamine D₂ receptor density, and amphetamine-stimulated dopamine release were as expected). Cytogenetic studies indicated that neither drug was a clastogen in rhesus monkeys. Thus, methylphenidate and amphetamine at therapeutic blood/plasma levels during peri-adolescence in non-human primates have little effect on physiological or behavioral/cognitive development. "
431,31927066,"Murine studies showed that disruption of circadian clock rhythmicity could lead to cancer and metabolic syndrome. Time-restricted feeding can reset the disrupted clock rhythm, protect against cancer and metabolic syndrome. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that intermittent fasting for several consecutive days without calorie restriction in humans would induce an anticarcinogenic proteome and the key regulatory proteins of glucose and lipid metabolism. Fourteen healthy subjects fasted from dawn to sunset for over 14 h daily. Fasting duration was 30 consecutive days. Serum samples were collected before 30-day intermittent fasting, at the end of 4th week during 30-day intermittent fasting, and one week after 30-day intermittent fasting. An untargeted serum proteomic profiling was performed using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Our results showed that 30-day intermittent fasting was associated with an anticancer serum proteomic signature, upregulated key regulatory proteins of glucose and lipid metabolism, circadian clock, DNA repair, cytoskeleton remodeling, immune system, and cognitive function, and resulted in a serum proteome protective against cancer, metabolic syndrome, inflammation, Alzheimer's disease, and several neuropsychiatric disorders. These findings suggest that fasting from dawn to sunset for 30 consecutive days can be preventive and adjunct therapy in cancer, metabolic syndrome, and several cognitive and neuropsychiatric diseases. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study has important clinical implications. Our results showed that intermittent fasting from dawn to sunset for over 14 h daily for 30 consecutive days was associated with an anticancer serum proteomic signature and upregulated key regulatory proteins of glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin signaling, circadian clock, DNA repair, cytoskeleton remodeling, immune system, and cognitive function, and resulted in a serum proteome protective against cancer, obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, inflammation, Alzheimer's disease, and several neuropsychiatric disorders. Importantly, these findings occurred in the absence of any calorie restriction and significant weight loss. These findings suggest that intermittent fasting from dawn to sunset can be a preventive and adjunct therapy in cancer, metabolic syndrome and Alzheimer's disease and several neuropsychiatric diseases.

432,28331628,"Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) refer to diseases that are caused by insufficient iodine intake, and the best strategy to prevent IDD is the addition of iodine to dietary salt. Because iodine deficiency is a common cause of goiter, the prevalence as effectively controlled after the implementation of universal salt iodization (USI) in China. However, there is substantial controversy as to whether the incidence of thyroid disorders is related to iodized salt intake. Therefore, we aimed to clarify whether the risk of goiter can be promoted by USI. A longitudinal continuous study based on the national monitoring results of IDD in China was performed for 3 consecutive years. We recorded the following indicators of IDD from 31 provinces: goiter number, two degrees of goiter (the degree of goiter severity) and cretinism (three endemic diseases), iodized salt intake, median urinary iodine concentration (UIC), soil iodine content and coverage rates of iodized salt. One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and linear regression analyses examined the differences between the three groups and correlations, respectively. Data were collected from the Chinese national IDD surveillance data in 2011-2013, and the background values of Chinese soil elements were published in 1990. A reference male's daily intake of maximum iodine was 378.9 μg, 379.2 μg and 366.9 μg in 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively. No statistical association between daily iodized salt intake and the three endemic diseases was observed in 2011-2013 ( There was no significant association between iodized salt intake and the three endemic diseases, suggesting that the current nutrition level of iodized salt did not cause the high goiter prevalence.

434,26059250,"Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a condition that may be marked by abdominal pain, bloating, fullness, indigestion, belching, constipation and/or diarrhea. IBS symptoms can result from malabsorption of fructose. Fructose is a monosaccharide found naturally in small quantities in fruits and some vegetables, and in much larger quantities in industrially manufactured sweets with added sugars (e.g. sucrose and high fructose corn syrup). Fructose malabsorption leads to osmotic diarrhea as well as gas and bloating due to fermentation in the colon. A low-fructose diet has been found to improve IBS symptoms in some patients. This paper discusses the prevalence of fructose malabsorption and considers fructose ingestion as a possible cause of--and fructose restriction as a possible dietary treatment for--IBS. "

436,19691661,Ischemic-type biliary lesions (ITBL) account for a major part of patients' morbidity and mortality after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). The exact origin of this type of biliary complication remains unknown. This study retrospectively evaluated 1843 patients. Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis were excluded from this study. The diagnosis of ITBL was established only when all other causes of destruction of the biliary tree were ruled out. Donor age (P = 0.028) and cold ischemic time (CIT) (P = 0.002) were found to be significant risk factors for the development of ITBL. Organs that were perfused with University of Wisconsin (UW) solution developed ITBL significantly more often than Histidine-Tryptophan-Ketoglutarate (HTK)-perfused organs (P = 0.036). The same applied to organs harvested externally and shipped to our center versus those that were procured locally by our harvest teams (P < 0.001). Pressure perfusion via the hepatic artery significantly reduced the risk of ITBL (P = 0.001). The only recipient factor that showed a significant influence was Child-Pugh score status C (P = 0.021). Immunologic factors had no significant impact on ITBL. The clinical consequences of this study for our institution have been the strict limitation of CIT to <10 h and the exclusive use of HTK solution. We further advocate that all organ procurement teams perform pressure perfusion on harvested organs. 
437,34460091,"Many functional activities of endometrium epithelium are energy consuming which are very important for maintaining intrauterine environment needed by early embryonic development and establishment of implantation window. Glucose is a main energy supplier and one of the main components of intrauterine fluid. Obviously, glucose transports in endometrium epithelium involve in for these activities but their functions have not been elucidated. In this research, we observed a spatiotemporal pattern of sodium glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) expression in the mouse endometrium. We also determined that progesterone can promote the expression of SGLT1 in the mouse endometrial epithelium in response to the action of oestrogen. Treatment with the SGLT1 inhibitor phlorizin or small interfering RNA specific for SGLT1 (SGLT1-siRNA) altered glucose uptake in primary cultured endometrial epithelial cells, which exhibited reduced ATP levels and AMPK activation. The injection of phlorizin or SGLT1-siRNA into one uterine horn of each mouse on day 2 of pregnancy led to an increased glucose concentration in the uterine fluid and decreased number of harvested normal blastocysts and decreased expression of integrin αVβ3 in endometrial epithelium and increased expression of mucin 1 and lactoferrin in endometrial epithelium and the uterine homogenates exhibited activated AMPK, a decreased ATP level on day 4, and a decreased number of implantation sites on day 5. In embryo transfer experiments, pre-treatment of the uterine horn with phlorizin or SGLT1-siRNA during the implantation window led to a decreased embryo implantation rate on day 5 of pregnancy, even when embryos from normal donor mice were used. In conclusion, SGLT1, which participates in glucose transport in the mouse endometrial epithelium, inhibition and/or reduced expression of SGLT1 affects early embryo development by altering the glucose concentration in the uterine fluid. Inhibition and/or reduced expression of SGLT1 also affects embryo implantation by influencing energy metabolism in epithelial cells, which consequently influences implantation-related functional activities.

438,27226540,"Hypertriglyceridemia results from increased production and decreased clearance of triglyceride-rich very low-density lipoproteins, a pathological condition that accounts for heightened risk of ischemic vascular diseases in obesity and type 2 diabetes. Despite its intimate association with insulin resistance, whether hypertriglyceridemia constitutes an independent risk for beta cell dysfunction in diabetes is unknown. Answering this fundamental question is stymied by the fact that hypertriglyceridemia is intertwined with hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in obese and diabetic subjects. To circumvent this limitation, we took advantage of apolipoprotein C3 (ApoC3)-transgenic mice, a model with genetic predisposition to hypertriglyceridemia. We showed that ApoC3-transgenic mice, as opposed to age/sex-matched wild-type littermates, develop hypertriglyceridemia with concomitant elevations in plasma cholesterol and non-esterified fatty acid levels. Anti-insulin and anti-glucagon dual immunohistochemistry in combination with morphometric analysis revealed that ApoC3-transgenic and wild-type littermates had similar beta cell and alpha cell masses as well as islet size and architecture. These effects correlated with similar amplitudes of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and similar degrees of postprandial glucose excursion in ApoC3-transgenic versus wild-type littermates. Oil Red O histology did not visualize lipid infiltration into islets, correlating with the lack of ectopic triglyceride and cholesterol depositions in the pancreata of ApoC3-transgenic versus wild-type littermates. ApoC3-transgenic mice, despite persistent hypertriglyceridemia, maintained euglycemia under both fed and fasting conditions without manifestation of insulin resistance and fasting hyperinsulinemia. Thus, hypertriglyceridemia per se is not an independent risk factor for beta cell dysfunction in ApoC3 transgenic mice. "
439,7706963,"Methods of iodine fortification were tested among women of child bearing ages in four villages of Khon Kaen province, an endemic area of goiter in northeast Thailand, Ban Wang Pa Dum, Ban Pa Klauy and Ban Non Chart received iodine fortified in fish sauce, salt and drinking water respectively, whereas, Ban Non Sa-aad served as a control village. Urine iodine concentrations were investigated before supplement and after three and six months of the experimental period. Three months after supplement, urine iodine levels of villagers from Ban Non Chart and Ban Non Sa-aad were higher than those of Ban Wang Pa Dum and Ban Pa Klauy. Six months later, subjects from Ban Wang Pa Dum and Ban Pa Klauy who had received fortified fish sauce and iodinated salt respectively had significantly higher urine iodine concentrations than those of the other two villages. The result implied that fortified fish sauce and iodinated salt were well accepted by the villagers. However, fortified fish sauce might be the best and most feasible method because villagers use fish sauce more constantly in cooking and salting dishes. "
440,28763258,"Diabetes results from an inadequate mass of functional β cells, due to either β cell loss caused by autoimmune destruction (type I diabetes) or β cell failure in response to insulin resistance (type II diabetes). Elucidating the mechanisms that regulate β cell mass may be key to developing new techniques that foster β cell regeneration as a cellular therapy to treat diabetes. While previous studies concluded that cyclin D2 is required for postnatal β cell self-renewal in mice, it is not clear if cyclin D2 is sufficient to drive β cell self-renewal. Using transgenic mice that overexpress cyclin D2 specifically in β cells, we show that cyclin D2 overexpression increases β cell self-renewal post-weaning and results in increased β cell mass. β cells that overexpress cyclin D2 are responsive to glucose stimulation, suggesting they are functionally mature. β cells that overexpress cyclin D2 demonstrate an enhanced regenerative capacity after injury induced by streptozotocin toxicity. To understand if cyclin D2 overexpression is sufficient to drive β cell self-renewal, we generated a novel mouse model where cyclin D2 is only expressed in β cells of cyclin D2 "
441,24726364,"Inflammatory activation of myeloid cells is accompanied by increased glycolysis, which is required for the surge in cytokine production. Although in vitro studies suggest that increased macrophage glucose metabolism is sufficient for cytokine induction, the proinflammatory effects of increased myeloid cell glucose flux in vivo and the impact on atherosclerosis, a major complication of diabetes, are unknown. We therefore tested the hypothesis that increased glucose uptake in myeloid cells stimulates cytokine production and atherosclerosis. Overexpression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 in myeloid cells caused increased glycolysis and flux through the pentose phosphate pathway but did not induce cytokines. Moreover, myeloid-cell-specific overexpression of GLUT1 in LDL receptor-deficient mice was ineffective in promoting atherosclerosis. Thus, increased glucose flux is insufficient for inflammatory myeloid cell activation and atherogenesis. If glucose promotes atherosclerosis by increasing cellular glucose flux, myeloid cells do not appear to be the key targets. "
442,18439432,"We hypothesized that contrasting leucine with its non-metabolizable analog 2-aminobicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH) might provide new information about metabolic pathways involved in insulin secretion. Both compounds stimulate insulin secretion by allosterically activating glutamate dehydrogenase, which enhances glutamate metabolism. However, we found that leucine was a stronger secretagogue in rat pancreatic islets and INS-1 cells. This suggested that leucine's metabolism contributed to its insulinotropism. Indeed, we found that leucine increased acetoacetate and was metabolized to CO(2) in pancreatic islets and increased short chain acyl-CoAs (SC-CoAs) in INS-1 cells. We then used the leucine-BCH difference to study the hypothesis that acyl groups derived from secretagogue carbon can be transferred as acetoacetate, in addition to citrate, from mitochondria to the cytosol where they can be converted to SC-CoAs. Since BCH cannot form sufficient acetoacetate from glutamate, transport of any glutamate-derived acyl groups to the cytosol in BCH-stimulated cells must proceed mainly via citrate. In ATP citrate lyase-deficient INS-1 cells, which are unable to convert citrate into cytosolic acetyl-CoA, insulin release by BCH was decreased and adding beta-hydroxybutyrate or alpha-ketoisocaproate, which increases mitochondrial acetoacetate, normalized BCH-induced insulin release. This strengthens the concept that acetoacetate-transferred acyl carbon can be converted to cytosolic SC-CoAs to stimulate insulin secretion. "
443,38744310,"Abnormal glucose metabolism may be involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. The present study identifies that highly expressed H19 leads to increased aerobic glycolysis and histone lactylation levels in endometriosis. Previous studies from our group and others have shown increased IncRNA H19 expression in both the eutopic endometrium and the ectopic endometriosis tissue during endometriosis. In this study, we use immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and protein quantification to determine that levels of aerobic glycolysis and histone lactylation are increased in endometriosis tissues. In human endometrial stromal cells, we found that high H19 expression resulted in abnormal glucose metabolism by examining the levels of glucose, lactate, and ATP and measuring protein levels of enzymes that participate in glycolysis. At the same time, immunofluorescence and western blotting demonstrated increased histone lactylation in H19 overexpressing cells. Altering aerobic glycolysis and histone lactylation levels through the addition of sodium lactate and 2-deoxy-d-glucose demonstrated that increased aerobic glycolysis and histone lactylation levels resulted in enhanced cell proliferation and cell migration, contributing to endometriosis. To validate these findings in vivo, we constructed an endometriosis mouse model, demonstrating similar changes in endometriosis tissues in vivo. Both aerobic glycolysis and histone lactylation levels were elevated in endometriotic lesions. Taken together, these data demonstrate elevated expression levels of H19 in endometriosis patients promote abnormal glucose metabolism and elevated histone lactylation levels in vivo, enhancing cell proliferation and migration and promoting the progression of endometriosis. Our study provides a functional link between H19 expression and histone lactylation and glucose metabolism in endometriosis, providing new insights into disease mechanisms that could result in novel therapeutic approaches.

445,24990862,"The gut-brain axis plays a key role in the control of energy balance and glucose homeostasis. In response to luminal stimulation of macronutrients and microbiota-derived metabolites (secondary bile acids and short chain fatty acids), glucagon-like peptides (GLP-1 and -2) are cosecreted from endocrine L cells in the gut and coreleased from preproglucagonergic neurons in the brain stem. Glucagon-like peptides are proposed as key mediators for bariatric surgery-improved glycemic control and energy balance. Little is known about the GLP-2 receptor (Glp2r)-mediated physiological roles in the control of food intake and glucose homeostasis, yet Glp1r has been studied extensively. This review will highlight the physiological relevance of the central nervous system (CNS) Glp2r in the control of energy balance and glucose homeostasis and focuses on cellular mechanisms underlying the CNS Glp2r-mediated neural circuitry and intracellular PI3K signaling pathway. New evidence (obtained from Glp2r tissue-specific KO mice) indicates that the Glp2r in POMC neurons is essential for suppressing feeding behavior, gastrointestinal motility, and hepatic glucose production. Mice with Glp2r deletion selectively in POMC neurons exhibit hyperphagic behavior, accelerated gastric emptying, glucose intolerance, and hepatic insulin resistance. GLP-2 differentially modulates postsynaptic membrane excitability of hypothalamic POMC neurons in Glp2r- and PI3K-dependent manners. GLP-2 activates the PI3K-Akt-FoxO1 signaling pathway in POMC neurons by Glp2r-p85α interaction. Intracerebroventricular GLP-2 augments glucose tolerance, suppresses glucose production, and enhances insulin sensitivity, which require PI3K (p110α) activation in POMC neurons. Thus, the CNS Glp2r plays a physiological role in the control of food intake and glucose homeostasis. This review will also discuss key questions for future studies. "
446,36112169,"People with isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG) have normal beta cell function. We hypothesised that an increased glucose threshold for beta cell secretion explains IFG. We used graded glucose infusion to examine the relationship of insulin secretion rate (ISR) and glucagon secretion rate (GSR) with rising glucose. We studied 39 non-diabetic individuals (53 ± 2 years, BMI 30 ± 1 kg/m The relationship of ISR with glucose was linear and the threshold for insulin secretion in isolated IFG did not differ from that in people with normal fasting glucose and normal glucose tolerance. GSR exhibited a single-exponential relationship with glucose that could be characterised by G These data show that, in non-diabetic humans, alpha cell dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of IFG independently of defects in insulin secretion. We also describe a new index that quantifies the suppression of glucagon secretion by glucose. "
447,29339473,"Laron syndrome (LS), or primary growth hormone (GH) insensitivity, is the best-characterized entity among the congenital insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) deficiencies. Life-long exposure to minute endogenous IGF1 levels is linked to low stature as well as a number of endocrine and metabolic abnormalities. While elevated IGF1 is correlated with increased cancer incidence, epidemiological studies revealed that patients with LS do not develop tumors. The mechanisms associated with cancer protection in LS are yet to be discovered. Recent genomic analyses identified a series of metabolic genes that are overrepresented in patients with LS. Given the augmented expression of these genes in a low IGF1 milieu, we hypothesized that they may constitute targets for IGF1 action. Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) plays a critical role in cellular redox control by thioredoxin. TXNIP serves as a glucose and oxidative stress sensor, being commonly silenced by genetic or epigenetic events in cancer cells. Consistent with its enhanced expression in LS, we provide evidence that  "
448,28727166,"It is a long-standing enigma how glycogen storage disease (GSD) type I patients retain a limited capacity for endogenous glucose production despite the loss of glucose-6-phosphatase activity. Insight into the source of residual endogenous glucose production is of clinical importance given the risk of sudden death in these patients, but so far contradictory mechanisms have been proposed. We investigated glucose-6-phosphatase-independent endogenous glucose production in hepatocytes isolated from a liver-specific GSD Ia mouse model (L-G6pc Our data indicate that hepatocytes contribute to residual glucose production in GSD Ia. We show that α-glucosidase activity, i.e. glycogen debranching and/or lysosomal glycogen breakdown, contributes to residual glucose production by GSD Ia hepatocytes. A strong reduction in hepatic GCK flux in L-G6pc-/- mice furthermore limits the phosphorylation of free glucose synthesized by G6pc-deficient hepatocytes, allowing the release of glucose into the circulation. The almost complete abrogation of GCK flux in G6pc-deficient liver also explains the contradictory reports on residual glucose production in GSD Ia patients. (Hepatology 2017;66:2042-2054). "
449,16102856,"Pancreatic derived factor (PANDER) is a recently identified cytokine-like protein that is dominantly expressed in the islets of Langerhans of the pancreas. To investigate the mechanism of tissue-specific regulation of PANDER, we identified and characterized the promoter region. The transcriptional start site was identified 520 bp upstream of the translational start codon by 5'-RLM-RACE. Computer algorithms identified several islet-associated and glucose-responsive binding motifs that included A and E boxes, hepatocyte nuclear factors 1 and 4, Oct-1, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and 5. Reporter gene analysis revealed cell type-specific PANDER promoter expression in islet and liver-derived cell lines. Levels of PANDER mRNA were directly concordant to the observed cell type-specific PANDER promoter gene expression. The minimal element was mapped to the 5'-UTR and located between +200 and +491 relative to the transcriptional start site and imparted maximal gene expression. In addition, several putative glucose-responsive binding sites were further functionally characterized to reveal critical regulatory elements of PANDER. The PANDER promoter was demonstrated to be glucose-responsive in a dose-dependent manner in murine insulinoma beta-TC3 cells and primary murine islets, but unresponsive in glucagon-secreting alpha-TC3 cells. Our findings revealed that the 5'-UTR of PANDER contains the minimal element for gene expression and imparts both tissue-specificity and glucose-responsiveness. The regulation of PANDER gene expression mimics that of insulin and suggests a potential biological function of PANDER involved in metabolic homeostasis. "
450,29635338,"Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is an important energy provider for cardiac work and changes in cardiac substrate preference are associated with different heart diseases. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B (CPT1B) is thought to perform the rate limiting enzyme step in FAO and is inhibited by malonyl-CoA. The role of CPT1B in cardiac metabolism has been addressed by inhibiting or decreasing CPT1B protein or after modulation of tissue malonyl-CoA metabolism. We assessed the role of CPT1B malonyl-CoA sensitivity in cardiac metabolism. We generated and characterized a knock in mouse model expressing the CPT1BE3A mutant enzyme, which has reduced sensitivity to malonyl-CoA. In isolated perfused hearts, FAO was 1.9-fold higher in Cpt1bE3A/E3A hearts compared with Cpt1bWT/WT hearts. Metabolomic, proteomic and transcriptomic analysis showed increased levels of malonylcarnitine, decreased concentration of CPT1B protein and a small but coordinated downregulation of the mRNA expression of genes involved in FAO in Cpt1bE3A/E3A hearts, all of which aim to limit FAO. In vivo assessment of cardiac function revealed only minor changes, cardiac hypertrophy was absent and histological analysis did not reveal fibrosis. Malonyl-CoA-dependent inhibition of CPT1B plays a crucial role in regulating FAO rate in the heart. Chronic elevation of FAO has a relatively subtle impact on cardiac function at least under baseline conditions. "

452,38802412,"GDM, as a metabolic disease during pregnancy, regulates GLUT3 translocation by AMPK, thereby affecting glucose uptake in trophoblasts. It provides a new research idea and therapeutic target for alleviating intrauterine hyperglycemia in GDM. STZ was used to construct GDM mice, inject AICAR into pregnant mice, and observe fetal and placental weight; flow cytometry was employed for the detection of glucose uptake by primary trophoblast cells; immunofluorescence was applied to detect the localization of GLUT3 and AMPK in placental tissue; Cocofal microscope was used to detect the localization of GLUT3 in trophoblast cells;qRT-PCR and Western blot experiments were carried out to detect the expression levels of GLUT3 and AMPK in placental tissue; CO-IP was utilized to detect the interaction of GLUT3 and AMPK. Compared with the normal pregnancy group, the weight of the fetus and placenta of GDM mice increased (P < 0.001), and the ability of trophoblasts to take up glucose decreased (P < 0.001). In addition, AMPK activity in trophoblasts and membrane localization of GLUT3 in GDM mice were down-regulated compared with normal pregnant mice (P < 0.05). There is an interaction between GLUT3 and AMPK. Activating AMPK in trophoblasts can up-regulate the expression of GLUT3 membrane protein in trophoblasts of mice (P < 0.05) and increase the glucose uptake of trophoblasts (P < 0.05). We speculate that inhibition of AMPK activity in GDM mice results in aberrant localization of GLUT3, which in turn attenuates glucose uptake by placental trophoblast cells. AICAR activates AMPK to increase the membrane localization of GLUT3 and improve the glucose uptake capacity of trophoblasts. "
453,38524636,"Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a grouping of monogenic disorders. It is characterized by dominantly inherited, non-insulin-dependent diabetes. MODY is relatively rare, encompassing up to 3.5% in those diagnosed under 30 years of age. Specific types are most commonly treated with sulfonylurea, particularly those identified as HNF4A-MODY and HNF1A-MODY. HNF1B-MODY is another type that is most frequently managed with insulin therapy but lacks a defined precision treatment. We present an 18-year-old, non-obese female patient diagnosed with HNF1B-MODY. She displays complete gene deletion, a renal cyst, and hypomagnesemia. Her treatment plan includes both long- and short-acting insulin, though she frequently encountered hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Semaglutide, a GLP-1RA, was administered weekly over 4 months. The patient's glucose level was continuously tracked using Dexcom's Continuous Glucose Monitoring system. The data suggested a notable improvement in her condition: time-in-range (TIR) increased from 70% to 88%, with some days achieving 100%, and the frequency of hypoglycemic episodes, indicated by time-below-range values, fell from 5% to 1%. The time-above-range values also dropped from 25% to 10%, and her HbA1c levels declined from 7% to 5.6%. During the semaglutide therapy, we were able to discontinue her insulin treatment.

455,38194365,"Mechanisms underlying limitations in glucose supply that restrict fetal growth are not well established. IGF-1 is an important regulator of fetal growth and IGF-1 bioavailability is markedly inhibited by IGFBP-1 especially when the binding protein is hyperphosphorylated. We hypothesized that the AMPK-mTORC1 pathway increases IGFBP-1 phosphorylation in response to glucose deprivation. Glucose deprivation in HepG2 cells activated AMPK and TSC2, inhibited mTORC1 and increased IGFBP-1 secretion and site-specific phosphorylation. Glucose deprivation also decreased IGF-1 bioavailability and IGF-dependent activation of IGF-1R. AICAR (an AMPK activator) activated TSC2, inhibited mTORC1, and increased IGFBP-1 secretion/phosphorylation. Further, siRNA silencing of either AMPK or TSC2 prevented mTORC1 inhibition and IGFBP-1 secretion and phosphorylation in glucose deprivation. Our data suggest that the increase in IGFBP-1 phosphorylation in response to glucose deprivation is mediated by the activation of AMPK/TSC2 and inhibition of mTORC1, providing a possible mechanistic link between glucose deprivation and restricted fetal growth.

456,32333610,"A growing body of evidence demonstrates obesity-induced insulin resistance is associated with the development of metabolic diseases. This study was designed to investigate ethyl acetate fraction of Chinese olive fruit extract (CO-EtOAc)-mediated attenuation of obesity and hyperglycemia in a mouse model. About 60% HFD-fed mice were treated intragastrically with CO-EtOAc for last 6 weeks, and body weight, blood biochemical parameters as well as hepatic inflammation response were investigated. Our results showed that CO-EtOAc treatment significantly reduced the formation of hepatic lipid droplets, body weight gain, blood glucose, and improved serum biochemical parameters in HFD-induced obese and insulin resistant mice. We further explored the molecular mechanism underlying the blood glucose modulating effect of CO-EtOAc using L6 myotubes model. We conclude that CO-EtOAc effectively increases the glycogen content and glucose uptake by stimulating the membrane translocation of glucose transporter 4. In addition, CO-EtOAc depolarizes the mitochondrial membrane and decreases the mitochondrial oxygen consumption, which may result in AMPK activation and the consequent mitochondrial fission. This study shows that CO-EtOAc prevents the development of obesity in mice fed with HFD and is also capable of stimulating glucose uptake. The possible mechanism might be due to the effects of CO-EtOAc on activation of AMPK and promotion of mitochondrial fission. "

459,27238637,"During insulin-resistant states such as type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), insulin fails to suppress hepatic glucose production (HGP) yet promotes lipid synthesis. This metabolic state has been termed ""selective insulin resistance"" to indicate a defect in one arm of the insulin-signaling cascade, potentially downstream of Akt. Here we demonstrate that Akt-dependent activation of mTORC1 and inhibition of Foxo1 are required and sufficient for de novo lipogenesis, suggesting that hepatic insulin signaling is likely to be intact in insulin-resistant states. Moreover, cell-nonautonomous suppression of HGP by insulin depends on a reduction of adipocyte lipolysis and serum FFAs but is independent of vagal efferents or glucagon signaling. These data are consistent with a model in which, during T2DM, intact liver insulin signaling drives enhanced lipogenesis while excess circulating FFAs become a dominant inducer of nonsuppressible HGP.

460,26358367,"The minipig can serve as a good pharmacological model for human subjects. However, the long-term pathogenesis of high-calorie diet-induced metabolic syndromes, including NASH, has not been well described in minipigs. We examined the development of metabolic syndromes in Bama minipigs that were fed a high-fat, high-sucrose diet (HFHSD) for 23 months, by using histology and serum biochemistry and by profiling the gene expression patterns in the livers of HFHSD pigs compared to controls. The pathology findings revealed microvesicular steatosis, iron overload, arachidonic acid synthesis, lipid peroxidation, reduced antioxidant capacity, increased cellular damage, and inflammation in the liver. RNA-seq analysis revealed that 164 genes were differentially expressed between the livers of the HFHSD and control groups. The pathogenesis of early-stage NASH was characterized by hyperinsulinemia and by de novo synthesis of fatty acids and nascent triglycerides, which were deposited as lipid droplets in hepatocytes. Hyperinsulinemia shifted the energy supply from glucose to ketone bodies, and the high ketone body concentration induced the overexpression of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1). The iron overload, CYP2E1 and alcohol dehydrogenase 4 overexpression promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which resulted in arachidonic and linoleic acid peroxidation and, in turn, led to malondialdehyde production and a cellular response to ROS-mediated DNA damage.

Individual associations between sPTB, self-reported ethnic ancestry, vaginal microbiota, metabolome, and innate immune response are known but not fully understood, and knowledge has yet to impact clinical practice. Here, we used multi-data type integration and composite statistical models to gain insight into sPTB risk by exploring the cervicovaginal environment of an ethnically heterogenous pregnant population (n = 346 women; n = 60 sPTB < 37 weeks' gestation, including n = 27 sPTB < 34 weeks). Analysis of cervicovaginal samples (10-15+6 weeks) identified potentially novel interactions between risk of sPTB and microbiota, metabolite, and maternal host defense molecules. Statistical modeling identified a composite of metabolites (leucine, tyrosine, aspartate, lactate, betaine, acetate, and Ca2+) associated with risk of sPTB < 37 weeks (AUC 0.752). A combination of glucose, aspartate, Ca2+, Lactobacillus crispatus, and L. acidophilus relative abundance identified risk of early sPTB < 34 weeks (AUC 0.758), improved by stratification by ethnicity (AUC 0.835). Increased relative abundance of L. acidophilus appeared protective against sPTB < 34 weeks. By using cervicovaginal fluid samples, we demonstrate the potential of multi-data type integration for developing composite models toward understanding the contribution of the vaginal environment to risk of sPTB.

465,32725819,"Several oncogenic pathways plus local microenvironmental conditions, such as hypoxia, converge on the regulation of cancer cells metabolism. The major metabolic alteration consists of a shift from oxidative phosphorylation as the major glucose consumer to aerobic glycolysis, although most of cancer cells utilize both pathways to a greater or lesser extent. Aerobic glycolysis, together with the directly related metabolic pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway, or gluconeogenesis are currently considered as therapeutic targets in cancer research. Melatonin has been reported to present numerous antitumor effects, which result in a reduced cell growth. This is achieved with both low and high concentrations with no relevant side effects. Indeed, high concentrations of this indolamine reduce proliferation of cancer types resistant to low concentrations and induce cell death in some types of tumors. Previous work suggest that regulation of glucose metabolism and other related pathways play an important role in the antitumoral effects of high concentration of melatonin. In the present review, we analyze recent work on the regulation by such concentrations of this indolamine on aerobic glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the pentose phosphate pathways of cancer cells.

466,24998913,"Histone acetylation plays important roles in gene regulation, DNA replication, and the response to DNA damage, and it is frequently deregulated in tumors. We postulated that tumor cell histone acetylation levels are determined in part by changes in acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) availability mediated by oncogenic metabolic reprogramming. Here, we demonstrate that acetyl-CoA is dynamically regulated by glucose availability in cancer cells and that the ratio of acetyl-CoA:coenzyme A within the nucleus modulates global histone acetylation levels. In vivo, expression of oncogenic Kras or Akt stimulates histone acetylation changes that precede tumor development. Furthermore, we show that Akt's effects on histone acetylation are mediated through the metabolic enzyme ATP-citrate lyase and that pAkt(Ser473) levels correlate significantly with histone acetylation marks in human gliomas and prostate tumors. The data implicate acetyl-CoA metabolism as a key determinant of histone acetylation levels in cancer cells. "
467,26826652,"Oncogenic activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is known to play an important role to promote glucose metabolism in cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanism through which the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway promotes glucose utilisation in cancer cells is still not well understood. It has recently been shown that the oncogenic activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling in lung adenocarcinoma is important in promoting the localisation of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) at the plasma membrane. We thus hypothesised that the effect of constitutive activation of the PI3K/AKT signalling on glucose metabolism is mediated by thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), a known regulator of the GLUT1 plasma membrane localisation. Consistent with previous studies, inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway decreased cellular glucose uptake. Furthermore, inhibition of PI3K/Akt signalling in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines using clinically used tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) resulted in a decrease in GLUT1 membrane localisation. We also observed that inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway in various cell lines, including NSCLC cells, resulted in an increase in TXNIP expression. Importantly, knockdown of TXNIP using siRNA in the NSCLC cells promoted GLUT1 to be localised at the plasma membrane and reversed the effect of PI3K/Akt inhibitors. Together, our results suggest that the oncogenic activation of PI3K/Akt signalling promotes cellular glucose uptake, at least in part, through the regulation of TXNIP expression. This mechanism may contribute to the Warburg effect in cancer cells. "
468,37699387,"Caspases are cysteine-aspartic proteases that were initially discovered to play a role in apoptosis. However, caspase 8, in particular, also has additional nonapoptotic roles, such as in inflammation. Adipocyte cell death and inflammation are hypothesized to be initiating pathogenic factors in type 2 diabetes. Here, we examined the pleiotropic role of caspase 8 in adipocytes and obesity-associated insulin resistance. Caspase 8 expression was increased in adipocytes from mice and humans with obesity and insulin resistance. Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with caspase 8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK decreased both death receptor-mediated signaling and targets of nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B (NF-κB) signaling. We generated novel adipose tissue and adipocyte-specific caspase 8 knockout mice (aP2Casp8-/- and adipoqCasp8-/-). Both males and females had improved glucose tolerance in the setting of high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. Knockout mice also gained less weight on HFD, with decreased adiposity, adipocyte size, and hepatic steatosis. These mice had decreased adipose tissue inflammation and decreased activation of canonical and noncanonical NF-κB signaling. Furthermore, they demonstrated increased energy expenditure, core body temperature, and UCP1 expression. Adipocyte-specific activation of Ikbkb or housing mice at thermoneutrality attenuated improvements in glucose tolerance. These data demonstrate an important role for caspase 8 in mediating adipocyte cell death and inflammation to regulate glucose and energy homeostasis. Caspase 8 is increased in adipocytes from mice and humans with obesity and insulin resistance. Knockdown of caspase 8 in adipocytes protects mice from glucose intolerance and weight gain on a high-fat diet. Knockdown of caspase 8 decreases Fas signaling, as well as canonical and noncanonical nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B (NF-κB) signaling in adipose tissue. Improved glucose tolerance occurs via reduced activation of NF-κB signaling and via induction of UCP1 in adipocytes. "

470,32350546,"Stimulation of monocytes with microbial and non-microbial products, including oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), induces a protracted pro-inflammatory, atherogenic phenotype sustained by metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming via a process called trained immunity. We investigated the intracellular metabolic mechanisms driving oxLDL-induced trained immunity in human primary monocytes and observed concomitant upregulation of glycolytic activity and oxygen consumption. In two separate cohorts of healthy volunteers, we assessed the impact of genetic variation in glycolytic genes on the training capacity of monocytes and found that variants mapped to glycolytic enzymes PFKFB3 and PFKP influenced trained immunity by oxLDL. Subsequent functional validation with inhibitors of glycolytic metabolism revealed dose-dependent inhibition of trained immunity in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo administration of the glucose metabolism modulator metformin abrogated the ability for human monocytes to mount a trained response to oxLDL. These findings underscore the importance of cellular metabolism for oxLDL-induced trained immunity and highlight potential immunomodulatory strategies for clinical management of atherosclerosis. KEY MESSAGES: Brief stimulation of monocytes to oxLDL induces a prolonged inflammatory phenotype. This is due to upregulation of glycolytic metabolism. Genetic variation in glycolytic genes modulates oxLDL-induced trained immunity. Pharmacological inhibition of glycolysis prevents trained immunity. "

To address the physiological function of TFEB in skeletal muscle, we have used muscle-specific gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Here, we show that TFEB controls metabolic flexibility in muscle during exercise and that this action is independent of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator1α (PGC1α). Indeed, TFEB translocates into the myonuclei during physical activity and regulates glucose uptake and glycogen content by controlling expression of glucose transporters, glycolytic enzymes, and pathways related to glucose homeostasis. In addition, TFEB induces the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation. This coordinated action optimizes mitochondrial substrate utilization, thus enhancing ATP production and exercise capacity. These findings identify TFEB as a critical mediator of the beneficial effects of exercise on metabolism. "
473,30930170,"The basis for region-specific neuronal toxicity in Huntington disease is unknown. Here, we show that region-specific neuronal vulnerability is a substrate-driven response in astrocytes. Glucose is low in HdhQ(150/150) animals, and astrocytes in each brain region adapt by metabolically reprogramming their mitochondria to use endogenous, non-glycolytic metabolites as an alternative fuel. Each region is characterized by distinct metabolic pools, and astrocytes adapt accordingly. The vulnerable striatum is enriched in fatty acids, and mitochondria reprogram by oxidizing them as an energy source but at the cost of escalating reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced damage. The cerebellum is replete with amino acids, which are precursors for glucose regeneration through the pentose phosphate shunt or gluconeogenesis pathways. ROS is not elevated, and this region sustains little damage. While mhtt expression imposes disease stress throughout the brain, sensitivity or resistance arises from an adaptive stress response, which is inherently region specific. Metabolic reprogramming may have relevance to other diseases. "

To determine the effect of fructose on markers of NAFLD, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled feeding trials. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library (through 3 September 2013). We included relevant trials that involved a follow-up of ≥ 7 days. Two reviewers independently extracted relevant data. Data were pooled by the generic inverse variance method using random effects models and expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) for intrahepatocellular lipids (IHCL) and mean difference (MD) for alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Inter-study heterogeneity was assessed (Cochran Q statistic) and quantified (I(2) statistic). Eligibility criteria were met by eight reports containing 13 trials in 260 healthy participants: seven isocaloric trials, in which fructose was exchanged isocalorically for other carbohydrates, and six hypercaloric trials, in which the diet was supplemented with excess energy (+21-35% energy) from high-dose fructose (+104-220 g/day). Although there was no effect of fructose in isocaloric trials, fructose in hypercaloric trials increased both IHCL (SMD=0.45 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.18, 0.72)) and ALT (MD=4.94 U/l (95% CI: 0.03, 9.85)). Few trials were available for inclusion, most of which were small, short (≤ 4 weeks), and of poor quality. Isocaloric exchange of fructose for other carbohydrates does not induce NAFLD changes in healthy participants. Fructose providing excess energy at extreme doses, however, does raise IHCL and ALT, an effect that may be more attributable to excess energy than fructose. Larger, longer and higher-quality trials of the effect of fructose on histopathological NAFLD changes are required. "
475,27467537,"Donation after circulatory death (DCD) is current clinical practice to increase the donor pool. Deleterious effects on renal graft function are described for hypothermic preservation. Therefore, current research focuses on investigating alternative preservation techniques, such as normothermic perfusion. We compared continuous pressure-controlled normothermic ex vivo kidney perfusion (NEVKP) with static cold storage (SCS) in a porcine model of DCD autotransplantation. After 30 minutes of warm ischemia, right kidneys were removed from 30-kg Yorkshire pigs and preserved with 8-hour NEVKP or in 4°C histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution (SCS), followed by kidney autotransplantation. Throughout NEVKP, electrolytes and pH values were maintained. Intrarenal resistance decreased over the course of perfusion (0 hour, 1.6 ± 0.51 mm per minute vs 7 hours, 0.34 ± 0.05 mm Hg/mL per minute, P = 0.005). Perfusate lactate concentration also decreased (0 hour, 10.5 ± 0.8 vs 7 hours, 1.4 ± 0.3 mmol/L, P < 0.001). Cellular injury markers lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase were persistently low (lactate dehydrogenase < 100 U/L, below analyzer range; aspartate aminotransferase 0 hour, 15.6 ± 9.3 U/L vs 7 hours, 24.8 ± 14.6 U/L, P = 0.298). After autotransplantation, renal grafts preserved with NEVKP demonstrated lower serum creatinine on days 1 to 7 (P < 0.05) and lower peak values (NEVKP, 5.5 ± 1.7 mg/dL vs SCS, 11.1 ± 2.1 mg/dL, P = 0.002). The creatinine clearance on day 4 was increased in NEVKP-preserved kidneys (NEVKP, 39 ± 6.4 vs SCS, 18 ± 10.6 mL/min; P = 0.012). Serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin at day 3 was lower in the NEVKP group (1267 ± 372 vs 2697 ± 1145 ng/mL, P = 0.029). Continuous pressure-controlled NEVKP improves renal function in DCD kidney transplantation. Normothermic ex vivo kidney perfusion might help to decrease posttransplant delayed graft function rates and to increase the donor pool. "
476,30541568,"Lifestyle factors conferring increased diabetes risk are associated with elevated basal insulin levels (hyperinsulinaemia). The latter predicts later obesity in children and adolescents.A causal role of hyperinsulinaemia for adipose tissue growth is probable because pharmacological reduction of insulin secretion lowers body weight in people who are obese. Genetic inactivation of insulin gene alleles in mice also lowers their systemic insulin levels and prevents or ameliorates high-fat diet-induced obesity. Hyperinsulinaemia causes weight gain because of a physiological property of insulin. Insulin levels that are on the high side of normal, or which are slightly elevated, are sufficient to suppress lipolysis and promote lipogenesis in adipocytes. The effect of insulin on glucose transport or hepatic glucose production requires six or two times higher hormone levels, respectively.It seems justified to suggest a lifestyle that avoids high insulin levels in order to limit anabolic fat tissue activity.

477,21193974,"To study the Status of Iodine Content of Salt in four regions of India. At each of the four centers (Vadodara, Dibrugarh, Jodhpur, New Delhi), High Schools were selected randomly from list of schools obtained from district education office and more than 700 salt samples were selected from each center. A total of 3,010 salt samples were collected from students of High Schools (consumed at their households), selected randomly from four centers and iodine content of salt by Standard Iodometric Titration Method (IT) was estimated. Analysis revealed that majority of salt sample collected at 4 centers were of powdered variety of salt. Analysis of iodine content in salt by IT method revealed that high proportion of school children (51.6%) consumed salt having inadequate iodine content (salt samples with less than 15 ppm of iodine) in Jodhpur district followed by Vadodara (19.8%), New Delhi (8.5%) and least in Dibrugarh (1.2%). The percentage of consumption of adequately iodized salt was highest in Dibrugarh (98.8%) among the four regions of India. Status of iodine content is varying from state to state i.e. highest at Dibrugarh and lowest at Jodhpur. This indicates that consumption of iodized salt in Jodhpur is low and needs more attention. Government may adopt different strategies in different states. There is a strong need of iodization of salt in addition to creating awareness among rural inhabitants for consumption of iodized salt especially in Jodhpur District. More attention is required for monitoring quality of iodized salt available in the community. "
478,16006109,"Low status of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCP) and essential fatty acids (EFA) in the fetus is associated with less favorable neonatal neurological condition. A 'relative', rather than 'absolute' EFA deficiency might explain this finding. A relative EFA deficiency may derive from impaired maternal glucose homeostasis. We measured fatty acids in umbilical vessels of infants born to 7 mothers with (gestational) diabetes mellitus and of 258 infants born to healthy mothers. Umbilical veins of infants of diabetic mothers had higher omega7 and omega9 fatty acids and DHA deficiency index and lower 20:4omega6 and EFA index. Their umbilical arteries had higher omega7 and omega9 fatty acids, and lower 20:4omega6, LCP and EFA index. We conclude that children born to mothers with poor glucose homeostasis have lower EFA and LCP status, which is consistent with a 'relative deficiency' deriving from augmented de novo fatty acid synthesis from the abundant glucose.

479,34547140,"Androgen excess is one of the most common endocrine disorders of reproductive-aged women, affecting up to 20% of this population. Women with elevated androgens often exhibit hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. The mechanisms of how elevated androgens affect metabolic function are not clear. Hyperandrogenemia in a dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-treated female mouse model induces whole body insulin resistance possibly through activation of the hepatic androgen receptor (AR). We investigated the role of hepatocyte AR in hyperandrogenemia-induced metabolic dysfunction by using several approaches to delete hepatic AR via animal-, cell-, and clinical-based methodologies. We conditionally disrupted hepatocyte AR in female mice developmentally (LivARKO) or acutely by tail vein injection of an adeno-associated virus with a liver-specific promoter for Cre expression in AR "
480,24642375,"Alt a 1 is a protein found in Alternaria alternata spores related to virulence and pathogenicity and considered to be responsible for chronic asthma in children. We found that spores of Alternaria inoculated on the outer surface of kiwifruits did not develop hyphae. Nevertheless, the expression of Alt a 1 gene was upregulated, and the protein was detected in the pulp where it co-localized with kiwi PR5. Pull-down assays demonstrated experimentally that the two proteins interact in such a way that Alt a 1 inhibits the enzymatic activity of PR5. These results are relevant not only for plant defense, but also for human health as patients with chronic asthma could suffer from an allergic reaction when they eat fruit contaminated with Alternaria.

481,24289822,"Pharmacotherapy of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is mainly restricted to insulin treatment. Insulin analogues have replaced human insulin sometimes without reason. A broader approach is needed. Insulin and insulin analogues, but also other available hormone therapies and drugs, based on literature in PubMed are included in this study. At diagnosis, T1D patients should, when resources allow, participate in clinical trials aiming at preservation of beta cell function, for example, with combination therapies involving auto-antigen/s. In very young children insulin pump is recommended, when enough resources for ALL patients; in older patients pump or multiple insulin therapy is recommended. Human insulin still has a place, with insulin analogues on special indications. Patients with pronounced insulin resistance might need Metformin, and Glitazones need more studies. Incretins, for example, GLP-1 may be of interest in patients with residual C-peptide. Amylin will probably be restricted to highly motivated patients. IGF-1 also requires more studies. C-peptide may be a hormone, probably part of future treatment. Glucosoxidase inhibitors might be considered in obese patients. Whether drugs increasing glucosuria will be of clinical value in T1D remains to be shown. In summary, insulin replacement is not enough for several patients. A broader pharmacotherapy is needed, at onset, and later when metabolic control needs improvement. "
482,10983756,"Positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18 FDG) is used for the noninvasive monitoring and grading of primary brain tumors. Here the FDG uptake is positively correlated with the malignant extent of the lesion and thereby negatively correlated with patient survival. Little is known about the FDG PET features of primary brain tumors in children, such as mixed neuronal-glial tumors. The authors describe a 13-year-old boy who had partial complex seizures since early childhood caused by a brain tumor in the left temporal lobe. Magnetic resonance and computed tomographic examinations yielded uncharacteristic results: mixed density, marked calcifications, little contrast enhancement, a nearly absent mass effect, and no edema. The FDG PET scan revealed a large hypermetabolic tumor, with a tumor: contralateral gray matter FDG uptake ratio of 1.45. In contrast to this intense hypermetabolism, the pathologic analysis after gross total resection revealed a low-grade ganglioglioma (WHO grade 1), which is usually associated with an excellent prognosis. Mixed neuronal-glial tumors such as gangliogliomas must be considered in making differential diagnoses by judging hypermetabolic FDG PET scans in young patients with brain tumors in the presence of uncharacteristic imaging features.

483,9158663,"The bactericidal activity of neutrophils depends primarily on free oxygen radicals released by the activation of NADPH oxidase when neutrophils are stimulated by microorganisms. Severe glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is associated with decreased NADPH production. Increased susceptibility to recurrent bacterial infections in children with severe neutrophil G6PD deficiency as a consequence of decreased NADPH production has been reported earlier. In this study, the in vitro activity of neutrophils from normal and G6PD-deficient individuals was assessed by measuring the [14C]CO2 released via the hexose monophosphate shunt from radiolabeled [1-14C]-glucose and the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) dye reduction test. Our results show that the G6PD activity of neutrophils from 48 individuals, identified as severely erythrocyte (RBC) G6PD deficient (< 2 U/10(12) RBC) was 23% of the enzyme activity of neutrophils from 53 individuals with normal RBC G6PD levels (98.8 U/10(12) RBC). However, the results of functional assays of neutrophils as measured by hexose monophosphate shunt and the NBT test were comparable in G6PD-deficient and normal individuals, suggesting that a reduced activity of G6PD to as low as 23% of normal does not affect neutrophil function.

484,37011646,"The risk of type 2 diabetes among women with glucose intolerance during pregnancy that does not meet gestational diabetes criteria requires further investigation. We aimed to explore the associations between various degrees of gestational glucose intolerance and the risk of type 2 diabetes in young adulthood. For this population-based cohort study, the national Israeli conscription database was linked to Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), the second-largest state-mandated health provider in Israel. We included 177 241 women who underwent a pre-recruitment evaluation at adolescence (age 16-20 years), 1 year before mandatory military service, and later underwent, from Jan 1, 2001, to Dec 31, 2019, two-step gestational diabetes screening with a 50 g glucose challenge test (GCT) based on a threshold of 140 mg/dL (7·8 mmol/L), followed as needed by a 100 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Abnormal OGTT values were defined according to the Carpenter-Coustan thresholds: 95 mg/dL (5·3 mmol/L) or higher in the fasting state; 180 mg/dL (10·0 mmol/L) or higher at 1 h; 155 mg/dL (8·6 mmol/L) or higher at 2 h; and 140 mg/dL (7·8 mmol/L) or higher at 3 h. The primary outcome was incident type 2 diabetes in the MHS diabetes registry. Cox proportional hazards models were applied to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs for incident type 2 diabetes. During a cumulative follow-up of 1 882 647 person-years, and with a median follow-up of 10·8 (IQR 5·2-16·4) years, 1262 women were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Crude incidence rates of type 2 diabetes were 2·6 (95% CI 2·4-2·9) per 10 000 person-years in women with gestational normoglycaemia, 8·9 (7·4-10·6) per 10 000 person-years in women with an abnormal GCT and normal OGTT, 26·1 (22·4-30·1) per 10 000 person-years in women with one abnormal OGTT value (in the fasting state or 1 h, 2 h, or 3 h post-challenge), and 71·9 (66·0-78·3) per 10 000 person-years in women with gestational diabetes. After adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, adolescent BMI, and age at gestational screening, the risk of type 2 diabetes was higher, compared to the gestational normoglycaemia group, in women with an abnormal GCT and normal OGTT (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 3·39 [95% CI 2·77-4·16]; p<0·0001), in women with one abnormal OGTT value (9·11 [7·64-10·86]; p<0·0001), and in women with gestational diabetes (24·84 [21·78-28·34]; p<0·0001). The risk of type 2 diabetes was modestly increased in women with isolated elevated fasting glucose (adjusted HR 11·81 [95% CI 8·58-16·25]; p<0·0001), and in women with gestational diabetes and an abnormal fasting glucose (38·02 [32·41-44·61]; p<0·0001). Gestational glucose intolerance, including conditions not meeting gestational diabetes criteria of the two-step strategy, confers a high risk of type 2 diabetes in young adulthood. These conditions should be recognised as risk factors for type 2 diabetes, especially among women with abnormal fasting glucose concentrations during pregnancy. None. "
485,38715043,"Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a crucial complication of long-term chronic diabetes that can lead to myocardial hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, and heart failure. There is increasing evidence that DCM is associated with pyroptosis, a form of inflammation-related programmed cell death. Growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) is a member of the transforming growth factor β superfamily, which regulates oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell survival to mitigate myocardial hypertrophy, myocardial infarction, and vascular injury. However, the role of GDF11 in regulating pyroptosis in DCM remains to be elucidated. This research aims to investigate the role of GDF11 in regulating pyroptosis in DCM and the related mechanism. Mice were injected with streptozotocin (STZ) to induce a diabetes model. H9c2 cardiomyocytes were cultured in high glucose (50 mM) to establish an in vitro model of diabetes. C57BL/6J mice were preinjected with adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) intravenously via the tail vein to specifically overexpress myocardial GDF11. GDF11 attenuated pyroptosis in H9c2 cardiomyocytes after high-glucose treatment. In diabetic mice, GDF11 alleviated cardiomyocyte pyroptosis, reduced myocardial fibrosis, and improved cardiac function. Mechanistically, GDF11 inhibited pyroptosis by preventing inflammasome activation. GDF11 achieved this by specifically binding to apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) and preventing the assembly and activation of the inflammasome. Additionally, the expression of GDF11 during pyroptosis was regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). These findings demonstrate that GDF11 can treat diabetic cardiomyopathy by alleviating pyroptosis and reveal the role of the PPARα-GDF11-ASC pathway in DCM, providing ideas for new strategies for cardioprotection.

486,12014995,"Disaccharide Intolerance Type I (Mendelian Interance in Man database: *222900) is a rare inborn error of metabolism resulting from mutation in sucrase-isomaltase (Enzyme Catalyzed 3.2.1.48). Usually, infants with SI deficiency come to attention because of chronic diarrhea and nutritional evidence of malabsorption. We describe an atypical presentation of this disorder in a 10-month-old infant. In addition to chronic diarrhea, the child displayed severe and chronic hypercalcemia, the evaluation of which was negative. An apparently coincidental right orbital hemangioma was detected. Following identification of the SI deficiency, an appropriately sucrose-restricted, but normal calcium diet regimen was instituted which led to cessation of diarrhea, substantial weight gain, and resolution of hypercalcemia. This case illustrates that, similar to congenital lactase deficiency (Mendelian Interance in Man database: *223000, Alactasia, Hereditary Disaccharide Intolerance Type II), hypercalcemia may complicate neonatal Sucrase-Isomaltase deficiency. Hypercalcemia in the presence of chronic diarrhea should suggest disaccharide intolerance in young infants. "

The objective of this study was to investigate the characteristics, behavior, and perceptions related to hookah smoking among the hookah smokers in Mumbai. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 200 randomly selected young adults between the age group of 15-35 years in Mumbai who visited different dental clinics. The questionnaire was distributed as Google Forms online in the month of November and December 2019 and those who submitted completed responses were included in the study. Only 114 participants returned with the completed forms in the time period of 2 months. The results showed that the majority of participants were between 20 and 24 age, comprising 58% who were having the habit of hookah smoking. Among which 24% females, 76% males had history of hookah habit. Eight percent of males started smoking hookah from very young age. Males (29.89%) shared one hookah pot with four members. Forty percent of the participants stated that they are interested to smoke again because of hookah flavor. Easy availability of newer forms of smoking at online markets could play a role in promoting the use of hookah among youngsters. Most products are being sold without any warnings, and there is no means to control the selling of the products to minors. Educational intervention is urgently needed to create awareness among youth about the harmful effects of hookah smoking."
488,28633160,"Nowadays, self-management of diabetes is more and more often based on continuous and flash glucose monitoring systems. In addition to measuring current glucose levels, both systems provide blood glucose levels from the past few hours in the form of a graph, as well as an indication of glucose trends via arrows. This information adds a new dimension to the self-management of diabetes, and should result in the modification of diabetes therapy. The paper presents proposals for modifications of treatment decisions based on glucose trends in patients with type 1 diabetes. By considering glucose trends, it is hoped that glycemic variability and numbers of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia episodes will be reduced.

490,28689661,"While maintaining the integrity of the genome and sustaining bioenergetics are both fundamental functions of the cell, potential crosstalk between metabolic and DNA repair pathways is poorly understood. Since histone acetylation plays important roles in DNA repair and is sensitive to the availability of acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), we investigated a role for metabolic regulation of histone acetylation during the DNA damage response. In this study, we report that nuclear ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) is phosphorylated at S455 downstream of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and AKT following DNA damage. ACLY facilitates histone acetylation at double-strand break (DSB) sites, impairing 53BP1 localization and enabling BRCA1 recruitment and DNA repair by homologous recombination. ACLY phosphorylation and nuclear localization are necessary for its role in promoting BRCA1 recruitment. Upon PARP inhibition, ACLY silencing promotes genomic instability and cell death. Thus, the spatial and temporal control of acetyl-CoA production by ACLY participates in the mechanism of DNA repair pathway choice. "

492,38513648,"Pancreatic β cells actively respond to glucose fluctuations through regulating insulin processing and secretion. However, how this process is elaborately tuned in circumstance of variable microenvironments as well as β cell-intrinsic states and whether its dysfunction links to metabolic diseases remain largely elusive. Here, we show that the cytosolic pH (pHc) in β cells is increased upon glucose challenge, which can be sensed by Smad5 via its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Lesion of Smad5 in β cells results in hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance due to insulin processing and secretion deficiency. The role of Smad5 in regulating insulin processing and secretion attributes to its non-canonical function by regulating V-ATPase activity for granule acidification. Genetic mutation of Smad5 or administration of alkaline water to mirror cytosolic alkalization ameliorated glucose intolerance in high-fat diet (HFD)-treated mice. Collectively, our findings suggest that pHc is a direct nexus in linking environmental cues with insulin processing and secretion in β cells. "
493,29315230,"Widespread consumption of high-fructose and high-fat diets relates to the global epidemic of hypertension.

496,36603341,"Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) plays a pivotal role in regulation of blood glucose homeostasis and is an emerging therapeutic target in diabetes and its complications. Celastrol, a pentacyclic triterpene extracted from the roots of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F, can reduce insulin resistance and improve diabetic complications. This study aimed to untangle the mechanism of celastrol in ameliorating type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and evaluate its potential benefits as an anti-diabetic agent. db/db mice was used to evaluate the hypoglycemic effect of celastrol in vivo; Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and 2-NBDG assay were used to detect the effect of celastrol on insulin secretion and glucose uptake in cells; Western blotting, quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and immunohistological staining were used to examine effect of celastrol on the expression of TXNIP and the carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP). Molecular docking, cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), drug affinity responsive targets stability assay (DARTS) and mass spectrometry were used to test the direct binding between celastrol and ChREBP. Loss- and gain-of-function studies further confirmed the role of ChREBP and TXNIP in celastrol-mediated amelioration of T2DM. Celastrol treatment significantly reduced blood glucose level, body weight and food intake, and improved glucose tolerance in db/db mice. Moreover, celastrol promoted insulin secretion and improved glucose homeostasis. Mechanistically, celastrol directly bound to ChREBP, a primary transcriptional factor upregulating TXNIP expression. By binding to ChREBP, celastrol inhibited its nuclear translocation and promoted its proteasomal degradation, thereby repressing TXNIP transcription and ultimately ameliorating T2DM through breaking the vicious cycle of hyperglycemia deterioration and TXNIP overexpression. Celastrol ameliorates T2DM through targeting ChREBP-TXNIP aix. Our study identified ChREBP as a new direct molecular target of celastrol and revealed a novel mechanism for celastrol-mediated amelioration of T2DM, which provides experimental evidence for its possible use in the treatment of T2DM and new insight into diabetes drug development for targeting TXNIP.

497,19057529,"Given the increase in the incidence of insulin resistance, obesity, and type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents, it would be of paramount importance to assess quantitative indices of insulin secretion and action during a physiological perturbation, such as a meal or an oral glucose-tolerance test (OGTT). A minimal model method is proposed to measure quantitative indices of insulin secretion and action in adolescents from an oral test. A 7 h, 21-sample OGTT was performed in 11 adolescents. The C-peptide minimal model was identified on C-peptide and glucose data to quantify indices of beta-cell function: static phi(s) and dynamic phi(d) responsivity to glucose from which total responsivity phi was also measured. The glucose minimal model was identified on glucose and insulin data to estimate insulin sensitivity, S(I), which was compared to a reference measure, S(I)(ref), provided by a tracer method. Disposition indices, which adjust insulin secretion for insulin action, were then calculated. Indices of beta-cell function were phi(s) = 51.35 +/- 8.89 x 10(-9)min(-1), phi(d) = 1,392 +/- 258 x 10(-9), and phi = 82.09 +/- 17.70 x 10(-9)min(-1). Insulin sensitivity was S(I) = 14.19 +/- 2.73 x 10(-4), not significantly different from S(I)(ref) = 14.96 +/- 3.04 x 10(-4) dl/kg.min per microU/ml, and well correlated: r = 0.98, P < 0.0001, thus indicating that S(I) can be accurately measured from an oral test. Disposition indices were DI(s) = 1,040 +/- 201 x 10(-14) dl/kg/min(2) per pmol/l, DI(d) = 33,178 +/- 10,720 x 10(-14) dl/kg/min per pmol/l, DI = 1,844 +/- 522 x 10(-14) dl/kg/min(2) per pmol/l. Virtually the same minimal model assessment was obtained with a reduced 3 h, 9-sample protocol. OGTT interpreted with C-peptide and glucose minimal model has the potential to provide novel insight regarding the regulation of glucose metabolism in adolescents, and to evaluate the effect of obesity and interventions such as diet and exercise.

Changes to p66Shc expression in mouse blastocysts were measured using quantitative RT-PCR, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence followed by confocal microscopy. Changes to oxidative phosphorylation metabolism were measured by total ATP content and superoxide production. Statistical analyses were performed on a minimum of three experimental replicates using Students' t-test or one-way ANOVA. P66Shc is basally expressed during in vivo mouse preimplantation development. Within in vivo blastocysts, p66Shc is primarily localized to the cell periphery of the trophectoderm. Blastocysts cultured under atmospheric oxygen levels have significantly increased p66Shc mRNA transcript and protein abundances compared to in vivo controls (P < 0.05). However, the ratio of phosphorylated serine 36 (S36) p66Shc to total p66Shc decreased in culture regardless of O2 atmosphere used, supporting a shift in the mitochondrial fraction of p66Shc. Total p66Shc localized to the cell periphery of the blastocyst trophectoderm and phosphorylated S36 p66Shc displayed nuclear and cytoplasmic immunoreactivity, suggesting distinct compartmentalization of phosphorylated S36 p66Shc and the remaining p66Shc fraction. Glucose concentration in the culture medium did not significantly change p66Shc mRNA or protein abundance or its localization. Blastocysts cultured under low or high oxygen conditions exhibited significantly decreased cellular ATP and increased superoxide production compared to in vivo derived embryos (P < 0.05). This study associates embryonic p66Shc expression levels with metabolic abnormalities but does not directly implicate p66Shc in metabolic changes. Additionally, we used one formulation of embryo culture medium that differs from that used in other mouse model studies and from clinical media used to support human blastocyst development. Our findings may, therefore, be limited to this media, or may be a species-specific phenomenon. This is the first study to show distinct immunolocalization of p66Shc to the trophectoderm of mouse blastocysts and that its levels are abnormally increased in embryos exposed to culture conditions. Changes in p66Shc expression and/or localization could possibly serve as a molecular marker of embryo viability for clinical applications. The outcomes provide insight into the potential metabolic role of p66Shc. Metabolic anomalies are induced even under the current optimal culture conditions, which could negatively impact trophectoderm and placental development. Not applicable.

501,23832090,"Tumors have a greater reliance on anaerobic glycolysis for energy production than normal tissues. We developed a noninvasive method for imaging glucose uptake in vivo that is based on magnetic resonance imaging and allows the uptake of unlabeled glucose to be measured through the chemical exchange of protons between hydroxyl groups and water. This method differs from existing molecular imaging methods because it permits detection of the delivery and uptake of a metabolically active compound in physiological quantities. We show that our technique, named glucose chemical exchange saturation transfer (glucoCEST), is sensitive to tumor glucose accumulation in colorectal tumor models and can distinguish tumor types with differing metabolic characteristics and pathophysiologies. The results of this study suggest that glucoCEST has potential as a useful and cost-effective method for characterizing disease and assessing response to therapy in the clinic. "
502,37960277,"Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare inherited disease characterized by sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) deficiency and, thus, a lack of bile acid synthesis with a marked accumulation of 7α-hydroxylated bile acid precursors. In addition to their renowned lipid-emulgating role, bile acids have been shown to stimulate secretion of the glucose-lowering and satiety-promoting gut hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). In this paper, we examined postprandial bile acid, glucose, insulin, GLP-1 and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) plasma profiles in patients with CTX and matched healthy controls. Seven patients and seven age, gender and body mass index matched controls were included and subjected to a 4 h mixed meal test with regular blood sampling. CTX patients withdrew from chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and statin therapy three weeks prior to the test. Postprandial levels of total bile acids were significantly lower in CTX patients and consisted of residual CDCA with low amounts of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). The postprandial plasma glucose peak concentration occurred later in CTX patients compared to controls, and patients' insulin levels remained elevated for a longer time. Postprandial GLP-1 levels were slightly higher in CTX subjects whereas postprandial FGF19 levels were lower in CTX subjects. This novel characterization of CTX patients reveals very low circulating bile acid levels and FGF19 levels, aberrant postprandial glucose and insulin profiles, and elevated postprandial GLP-1 responses.

Diet-induced dyslipidemia in a rhesus model better approximates the pathophysiology of human metabolic syndrome (MetS) than rodent models. Here, we investigated relationships between metabolic parameters and hypertriglyceridemia in rhesus macaques consuming a high-fructose diet (n = 59) and determined the effects of FO supplementation or RNA interference (RNAi) on plasma ApoC3 and triglyceride (TG) concentrations. Fructose supplementation increased body weight, fasting insulin, leptin, TGs, and large VLDL particles and reduced adiponectin concentrations (all  "
504,37758863,"Preterm survivors have increased risk for impaired cardiometabolic health. We assessed glucose regulation and cardiometabolic biomarkers in adult very low birth weight (VLBW, <1500 g) survivors, using siblings as controls. VLBW-participants were matched with term-born, same-sex siblings. At mean age 29.2 years (SD 3.9), 74 VLBW-adults and 70 siblings underwent a 2-h 75 g oral glucose tolerance test and blood tests for assessment of cardiometabolic biomarkers. Of participants, 23 (31%) VLBW and 11 (16%) sibling-controls met World Health Organization criteria for impaired glucose regulation (OR adjusted for age and sex 2.5, 95% CI: 1.1 to 5.8). Adjusting for age and sex, VLBW-participants showed 9.2% higher 2-h glucose (95% CI: 0.4% to 18.8%) than their siblings. Also, fasting (13.4%, -0.3% to 29.0%) and 2-h free fatty acids (15.6%, -2.4% to 36.9%) were higher in VLBW-participants. These differences were statistically significant only after further adjusting for confounders. No statistically significant differences were found regarding other measured biomarkers, including insulin resistance, atherogenic lipid profiles or liver tests. VLBW-adults showed more impaired fatty acid metabolism and glucose regulation. Differences in cardiometabolic biomarkers were smaller than in previous non-sibling studies. This may partly be explained by shared familial, genetic, or environmental factors. At young adult age, odds for impaired glucose regulation were 3.4-fold in those born at very low birth weight, compared to same-sex term-born siblings. Taking into consideration possible unmeasured, shared familial confounders, we compared cardiometabolic markers in adults born preterm at very low birth weight with term-born siblings. Prematurity increased risk for impaired glucose regulation, unrelated to current participant characteristics, including body mass index. In contrast to previous studies, differences in insulin resistance were not apparent, suggesting that insulin resistance may partially be explained by factors shared between siblings. Also, common cardiometabolic biomarkers were similar within sibling pairs. "
505,37488285,"Melatonin is involved in the regulation of various biological functions. Here, we explored a novel molecular mechanism by which the melatonin-induced sestrin2 (SESN2)-small heterodimer partner (SHP) signaling pathway protects against fasting- and diabetes-mediated hepatic glucose metabolism. Various key gene expression analyses were performed and multiple metabolic changes were assessed in liver specimens and primary hepatocytes of mice and human participants. The expression of the hepatic cereblon (CRBN) and b-cell translocation gene 2 (BTG2) genes was significantly increased in fasting mice, diabetic mice, and patients with diabetes. Overexpression of Crbn and Btg2 increased hepatic gluconeogenesis by enhancing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-responsive element-binding protein H (CREBH), whereas this phenomenon was prominently ablated in Crbn null mice and Btg2-silenced mice. Interestingly, melatonin-induced SESN2 and SHP markedly reduced hepatic glucose metabolism in diabetic mice and primary hepatocytes, and this protective effect of melatonin was strikingly reversed by silencing Sesn2 and Shp. Finally, the melatonin-induced SESN2-SHP signaling pathway inhibited CRBN- and BTG2-mediated hepatic gluconeogenic gene transcription via the competition of BTG2 and the interaction of CREBH. Mitigation of the CRBN-BTG2-CREBH axis by the melatonin-SESN2-SHP signaling network may provide a novel therapeutic strategy to treat metabolic dysfunction due to diabetes. "
506,25138607,"Epigenomic regulation of the transcriptome by DNA methylation and posttranscriptional gene silencing by miRNAs are potential environmental modulators of skeletal muscle plasticity to chronic exercise in healthy and diseased populations. We utilized transcriptome networks to connect exercise-induced differential methylation and miRNA with functional skeletal muscle plasticity. Biopsies of the vastus lateralis were collected from middle-aged Polynesian men and women with morbid obesity (44 kg/m(2) ± 10) and Type 2 diabetes before and following 16 wk of resistance (n = 9) or endurance training (n = 8). Longitudinal transcriptome, methylome, and microRNA (miRNA) responses were obtained via microarray, filtered by novel effect-size based false discovery rate probe selection preceding bioinformatic interrogation. Metabolic and microvascular transcriptome topology dominated the network landscape following endurance exercise. Lipid and glucose metabolism modules were connected to: microRNA (miR)-29a; promoter region hypomethylation of nuclear receptor factor (NRF1) and fatty acid transporter (SLC27A4), and hypermethylation of fatty acid synthase, and to exon hypomethylation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase and Ser/Thr protein kinase. Directional change in the endurance networks was validated by lower intramyocellular lipid, increased capillarity, GLUT4, hexokinase, and mitochondrial enzyme activity and proteome. Resistance training also lowered lipid and increased enzyme activity and caused GLUT4 promoter hypomethylation; however, training was inconsequential to GLUT4, capillarity, and metabolic transcriptome. miR-195 connected to negative regulation of vascular development. To conclude, integrated molecular network modelling revealed differential DNA methylation and miRNA expression changes occur in skeletal muscle in response to chronic exercise training that are most pronounced with endurance training and topographically associated with functional metabolic and microvascular plasticity relevant to diabetes rehabilitation.

507,24760259,"Vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and neonatal vitamin D deficiency. We conducted a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of low-dose (LD) versus high-dose (HD) vitamin D supplementation to investigate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on glucose metabolism during pregnancy. Women with plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels <32 ng/mL before 20 weeks' gestation were randomized to oral vitamin D3 at 5,000 IU daily (HD) (n = 89) or the recommended pregnancy dose of 400 IU daily (LD) (n = 90) until delivery. The primary end point was maternal glucose levels on oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 26-28 weeks' gestation. Secondary end points included neonatal 25OHD, obstetric and other neonatal outcomes, and maternal homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance. Analysis was by intention to treat. There was no difference in maternal glucose levels on OGTT. Twelve LD women (13%) developed GDM versus seven (8%) HD women (P = 0.25). Neonatal cord 25OHD was higher in HD offspring (46 ± 11 vs. 29 ± 12 ng/mL, P < 0.001), and deficiency was more common in LD offspring (24 vs. 10%, P = 0.06). Post hoc analysis in LD women showed an inverse relationship between pretreatment 25OHD and both fasting and 2-h blood glucose level on OGTT (both P < 0.001). Baseline 25OHD remained an independent predictor after multiple regression analysis. HD vitamin D supplementation commencing at a mean of 14 weeks' gestation does not improve glucose levels in pregnancy. However, in women with baseline levels <32 ng/mL, 5,000 IU per day was well tolerated and highly effective at preventing neonatal vitamin D deficiency. "
508,26948869,"The high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein has a central role in immunological antitumour defense. Here we show that natural killer cell-derived HMGB1 directly eliminates cancer cells by triggering metabolic cell death. HMGB1 allosterically inhibits the tetrameric pyruvate kinase isoform M2, thus blocking glucose-driven aerobic respiration. This results in a rapid metabolic shift forcing cells to rely solely on glycolysis for the maintenance of energy production. Cancer cells can acquire resistance to HMGB1 by increasing glycolysis using the dimeric form of PKM2, and employing glutaminolysis. Consistently, we observe an increase in the expression of a key enzyme of glutaminolysis, malic enzyme 1, in advanced colon cancer. Moreover, pharmaceutical inhibition of glutaminolysis sensitizes tumour cells to HMGB1 providing a basis for a therapeutic strategy for treating cancer. "
509,15868558,"Cysteine is an amino acid necessary for the synthesis of all proteins, the antioxidant glutathione, and the neuromodulator taurine. Whether cysteine is an essential amino acid for premature neonates remains controversial. Using a [13C6]glucose precursor in very-low-birth weight (VLBW) premature neonates, we measured the 13C content of cysteine in hepatically derived apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 and in the plasma to determine whether cysteine synthesis occurs and to relate minimum synthetic capacity to neonatal maturity. Twelve VLBW premature neonates (birth weight, 907 +/- 274 [SD] g; gestational age, 26.8 +/- 2.4 weeks) were studied on day of life 7.8 +/- 4.2 while on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for 5.6 +/- 4.5 days. A 4-hour intravenous infusion of [13C6]glucose was administered. Blood samples were obtained immediately before and at the end of the infusion. Isotopic enrichment of cysteine was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Analysis of variance, Student's t test, and linear regression were used for comparisons. The 13C isotope ratio of apo B-100-derived cysteine after the [13C6]glucose infusion was significantly higher than baseline (18.57 +/- 0.38 [SEM] vs 17.54 +/- 0.25 mol%, P < .05). The 13C isotope ratio of plasma cysteine was also significantly higher than baseline (17.36 +/- 0.25 vs 16.91 +/- 0.16 mol%, P < .05). When expressed as a product/precursor ratio, the mole percent above baseline of [13C]apo B-100 cysteine/[13C6]glucose correlated with birth weight (r = 0.74, P < .01). Very low-birth weight neonates are capable of cysteine synthesis as evidenced by incorporation of 13C label into hepatically derived apo B-100 cysteine and plasma cysteine from a glucose precursor. The minimum capacity for intrahepatic cysteine synthesis appears to be directly proportional to the maturity of the neonate and may impact the capabilities of VLBW neonates to counteract oxidative stresses such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and necrotizing enterocolitis.

510,10893316,"Somatotropin (ST) administration enhances protein deposition and elicits profound metabolic responses, including hyperinsulinemia. To determine whether the anabolic effect of ST is due to hyperinsulinemia, pair-fed weight-matched growing swine were treated with porcine ST (150 microg x kg body wt(-1) x day(-1)) or diluent for 7 days (n = 6/group, approximately 20 kg). Then pancreatic glucose-amino acid clamps were performed after an overnight fast. The objective was to reproduce the insulin levels of 1) fasted control and ST pigs (basal insulin, 5 microU/ml), 2) fed control pigs (low insulin, 20 microU/ml), and 3) fed ST pigs (high insulin, 50 microU/ml). Amino acid and glucose disposal rates were determined from the infusion rates necessary to maintain preclamp blood levels of these substrates. Whole body nonoxidative leucine disposal (NOLD), leucine appearance (R(a)), and leucine oxidation were determined with primed, continuous infusions of [(13)C]leucine and [(14)C]bicarbonate. ST treatment was associated with higher NOLD and protein balance and lower leucine oxidation and amino acid and glucose disposals. Insulin lowered R(a) and increased leucine oxidation, protein balance, and amino acid and glucose disposals. These effects of insulin were suppressed by ST treatment; however, the protein balance remained higher in ST pigs. The results show that ST treatment inhibits insulin's effects on protein metabolism and indicate that the stimulation of protein deposition by ST treatment is not mediated by insulin. Comparison of the protein metabolic responses to ST treatment during the basal fasting period with those in the fully fed state from a previous study suggests that the mechanism by which ST treatment enhances protein deposition is influenced by feeding status.

511,37578842,"Bromodomain-containing protein 7 (BRD7) has emerged as a player in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. Hepatic BRD7 levels are decreased in obese mice, and the reinstatement of hepatic BRD7 in obese mice has been shown to establish euglycemia and improve glucose homeostasis. Of note, the upregulation of hepatic BRD7 levels activates the AKT cascade in response to insulin without enhancing the sensitivity of the insulin receptor (InsR)-insulin receptor substrate (IRS) axis. In this report, we provide evidence for the existence of an alternative insulin signaling pathway that operates independently of IRS proteins and demonstrate the involvement of BRD7 in this pathway. To investigate the involvement of BRD7 as a downstream component of InsR, we utilized liver-specific InsR knockout mice. Additionally, we employed liver-specific IRS1/2 knockout mice to examine the requirement of IRS1/2 for the action of BRD7. Our investigation of glucose metabolism parameters and insulin signaling unveiled the significance of InsR activation in mediating BRD7's effect on glucose homeostasis in the liver. Moreover, we identified an interaction between BRD7 and InsR. Notably, our findings indicate that IRS1/2 is not necessary for BRD7's regulation of glucose metabolism, particularly in the context of obesity. The upregulation of hepatic BRD7 significantly reduces blood glucose levels and restores glucose homeostasis in high-fat diet-challenged liver-specific IRS1/2 knockout mice. These findings highlight the presence of an alternative insulin signaling pathway that operates independently of IRS1/2 and offer novel insights into the mechanisms of a previously unknown insulin signaling in obesity.

512,37361537,"Insulin resistance (IR) is closely related to the decline or deficiency of testosterone in males. Triglyceride glucose-body mass (TyG-BMI) is considered to be a novel indicator of IR. We conducted this analysis to investigate the association between TyG-BMI and male testosterone, and to explore whether its ability to predict testosterone deficiency is superior to HOMA-IR and TyG. This was a cross-sectional study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2011-2016). The TyG-BMI index was calculated from serum triglyceride, fasting plasma glucose and BMI. The association of TyG-BMI with male testosterone was estimated by weighted multivariable regression. We included 3394 participants for the final analysis. After adjusting for confounders, TyG-BMI was found to show an independent negative association with testosterone (β=-1.12, 95%CI: -1.50, -0.75, P<0.0001). Multivariate-adjusted beta also showed testosterone levels were significantly lower in the two highest TyG-BMI group (Q3, Q4) compared to the lowest group (Q1). Similar results were seen in all of the subgroup populations by stratified analysis (all P-interaction >0.05). Furthermore, ROC curve analysis indicated that the area under the curve of TyG-BMI index (0.73, 95% CI: 0.71, 0.75) was larger than that of HOMA-IR index (0.71, 95% CI: 0.69, 0.73) and TyG index (0.66, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.68). Our result suggested a negative association between TyG-BMI index and testosterone in adult males. The predictability of the TyG-BMI index for testosterone deficiency is better than that of HOMA-IR index and TyG index. "
513,36291127,"The growth hormone (GH)-insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) signaling pathway plays a major role in orchestrating cellular interactions, metabolism, growth and aging. Studies from worms to mice showed that downregulated activity of the GH/IGF1 pathway could be beneficial for the extension of lifespan. Laron syndrome (LS) is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder caused by molecular defects of the GH receptor (GHR) gene, leading to congenital IGF1 deficiency. Life-long exposure to minute endogenous IGF1 levels in LS is associated with low stature as well as other endocrine and metabolic deficits. Epidemiological surveys reported that patients with LS have a reduced risk of developing cancer. Studies conducted on LS-derived lymphoblastoid cells led to the identification of a novel link between IGF1 and thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), a multifunctional mitochondrial protein. TXNIP is highly expressed in LS patients and plays a critical role in cellular redox regulation by thioredoxin. Given that IGF1 affects the levels of TXNIP under various stress conditions, including high glucose and oxidative stress, we hypothesized that the IGF1-TXNIP axis plays an essential role in helping maintain a physiological balance in cellular homeostasis. In this study, we show that TXNIP is vital for the cell fate choice when cells are challenged by various stress signals. Furthermore, prolonged IGF1 treatment leads to the establishment of a premature senescence phenotype characterized by a unique senescence network signature. Combined IGF1/TXNIP-induced premature senescence can be associated with a typical secretory inflammatory phenotype that is mediated by STAT3/IL-1A signaling. Finally, these mechanistic insights might help with the understanding of basic aspects of IGF1-related pathologies in the clinical setting. "
514,36048516,"High-fat diet (HFD) consumption is known to be associated with ovulatory disorders among women of reproductive age. Previous studies in animal models suggest that HFD-induced microglia activation contributes to hypothalamic inflammation. This causes the dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis, leading to subfertility. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a novel class of lipid-soluble antidiabetic drugs that target primarily the early proximal tubules in kidney. Recent evidence revealed an additional expression site of SGLT2 in the central nervous system (CNS), indicating a promising role of SGLT2 inhibitors in the CNS. In type 2 diabetes patients and rodent models, SGLT2 inhibitors exhibit neuroprotective properties through reduction of oxidative stress, alleviation of cerebral atherosclerosis and suppression of microglia-induced neuroinflammation. Furthermore, clinical observations in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors ameliorated patient anthropometric parameters, body composition and insulin resistance. Therefore, it is of importance to explore the central mechanism of SGLT2 inhibitors in the recovery of reproductive function in patients with PCOS and obesity. Here, we review the hypothalamic inflammatory mechanisms of HFD-induced microglial activation, with a focus on the clinical utility and possible mechanism of SGLT2 inhibitors in promoting reproductive fitness.

515,19587708,"The presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) presents the most critical challenge in therapeutic development for mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) IIIB, a lysosomal storage disease with severe neurological manifestation, because of alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NaGlu) deficiency. Earlier, we showed a global central nervous system (CNS) transduction in mice by mannitol-facilitated entry of intravenous (IV)-delivered recombinant adeno-associated viral serotype 2 (rAAV2) vector. In this study, we optimized the approach and showed that the maximal transduction in the CNS occurred when the rAAV2 vector was IV injected at 8 min after mannitol administration, and was approximately 10-fold more efficient than IV delivery of the vector at 5 or 10 min after mannitol infusion. Using this optimal (8 min) regimen, a single IV infusion of rAAV2-CMV-hNaGlu vector is therapeutically beneficial for treating the CNS disease of MPS IIIB in adult mice, with significantly extended survival, improved behavioral performance, and reduction of brain lysosomal storage pathology. The therapeutic benefit correlated with maximal delivery to the CNS, but not peripheral tissues. This milestone data shows the first effective gene delivery across the BBB to treat CNS disease. The critical timing of vector delivery and mannitol infusion highlights the important contribution of this pretreatment to successful intervention, and the long history of safe use of mannitol in patients bodes well for its application in CNS gene therapy.

516,16272563,"The insulin receptor substrate 2 (Irs2) branch of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-signaling cascade prevents diabetes in mice because it promotes beta cell replication, function, and survival, especially during metabolic stress. Because exendin-4 (Ex4), a long acting glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, has similar effects upon beta cells in rodents and humans, we investigated whether Irs2 signaling was required for Ex4 action in isolated beta cells and in Irs2(-/-) mice. Ex4 increased cAMP levels in human islets and Min6 cells, which promoted Irs2 expression and stimulated Akt phosphorylation. In wild type mice Ex4 administered continuously for 28 days increased beta cell mass 2-fold. By contrast, Ex4 failed to arrest the progressive beta cell loss in Irs2(-/-) mice, which culminated in fatal diabetes; however, Ex4 delayed the progression of diabetes by 3 weeks by promoting insulin secretion from the remaining islets. We conclude that some short term therapeutic effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists can be independent of Irs2, but its long term effects upon beta cell growth and survival are mediated by the Irs2 branch of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling cascade.

517,15507531,"Islet beta-cell proliferation is a very important component of beta-cell adaptation to insulin resistance and prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, we know little about the mechanisms of beta-cell proliferation. We now investigate the relationship between pyruvate carboxylase (PC) pathway activity and islet cell proliferation 5 days after 60% pancreatectomy (Px). Islet cell number, protein, and DNA content, indicators of beta-cell proliferation, were increased two- to threefold 5 days after Px. PC and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activities increased only approximately 1.3-fold; however, islet pyruvate content and malate release from isolated islet mitochondria were approximately threefold increased in Px islets. The latter is an indicator of pyruvate-malate cycle activity, indicating that most of the increased pyruvate was converted to oxaloacetate (OAA) through the PC pathway. The contents of OAA and malate, intermediates of the pyruvate-malate cycle, were also increased threefold. PDH and citrate content were only slightly increased. Importantly, the changes in cell proliferation parameters, glucose utilization, and oxidation and malate release were partially blocked by in vivo treatment with the PC inhibitor phenylacetic acid. Our results suggest that enhanced PC pathway in Px islets may have an important role in islet cell proliferation. "
518,30212527,"Antenatal overexposure to glucocorticoids causes fetal intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and adult metabolic disorders. 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD) 1 and 2 are key enzymes for glucocorticoid metabolism, however, the detailed effects of antenatal overexposure to glucocorticoids on placental 11β-HSD1 and 2 expression and adult metabolic disorders remain obscure. Here, we report that, in placenta 11β-HSD1 is diffusely localized, whereas 11β-HSD2 is specifically expressed in labyrinthine layer. Exposure of pregnant dams to betamethasone significantly increases the expression of placental 11β-HSD2 but not 11β-HSD1, and decreases the weights of fetuses but not placentas. Antenatal exposure to betamethasone leads to either significant weight loss in the offspring younger than 10-week-old, or weight gain in those older than 14-week-old. Furthermore, antenatal exposure to betamethasone results in coexistence of various metabolic disorders in adult offspring, including hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, low insulin secretory capacity and hyperlipidemia. The present study demonstrates that exposure of pregnant dams to betamethasone induces the expression of placental 11β-HSD2 but not 11β-HSD1, leads to fetal IUGR and causes adult metabolic disorders, providing evidence for fetal origins of adult diseases and the potential role of placental 11β-HSD2 in them.

519,10853708,"Activin A is a dimeric glycoprotein showing a high sequence homology with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and playing autocrine/paracrine actions in reproductive tissues. However, since the synthesis of activin is ubiquitous it may have a role in regulating cell growth and differentiation in several tissues. Previous studies showed that activin A is expressed by insulin-positive B cells of human pancreatic islets, and women with gestational diabetes have higher serum activin A levels than healthy pregnant women at the same gestational age. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of activin A on insulin secretion from cultured human pancreatic islets. With this purpose human pancreatic islets were incubated with varying concentrations of activin A (0.1 to 10.0 nM). In absence of glucose, activin A did not modify insulin secretion at the different concentrations used. In absence of activin A, 8.3 mM and 16.7 mM glucose significantly increased insulin secretion, with a dose-dependent pattern. In presence of a non stimulatory concentration of glucose (3.3 mM), activin A significantly increased insulin secretion starting from low concentration (0.1 nM). Furthermore, the addition of activin A to 8.3 mM and 16.7 mM glucose induced an additional effect of the dose-dependent glucose-mediated insulin secretion (p<0.001). The present data could support a role for activin A in human endocrine pancreas in modulating insulin response to different glucose concentrations. "
520,25368121,"The emergence of bone as an endocrine regulator has prompted a re-evaluation of the role of bone mineralization factors in the development of metabolic disease. Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-1 (NPP1) controls bone mineralization through the generation of pyrophosphate, and levels of NPP1 are elevated both in dermal fibroblast cultures and muscle of individuals with insulin resistance. We investigated the metabolic phenotype associated with impaired bone metabolism in mice lacking the gene that encodes NPP1 (Enpp1(-/-) mice). Enpp1(-/-) mice exhibited mildly improved glucose homeostasis on a normal diet but showed a pronounced resistance to obesity and insulin resistance in response to chronic high-fat feeding. Enpp1(-/-) mice had increased levels of the insulin-sensitizing bone-derived hormone osteocalcin but unchanged insulin signalling within osteoblasts. A fuller understanding of the pathways of NPP1 could inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating insulin resistance. "
521,16717184,"In animals, liver and white adipose are the main sites for the de novo fatty acid synthesis. Deletion of fatty acid synthase or acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) 1 in mice resulted in embryonic lethality, indicating that the de novo fatty acid synthesis is essential for embryonic development. To understand the importance of de novo fatty acid synthesis and the role of ACC1-produced malonyl-CoA in adult mouse tissues, we generated liver-specific ACC1 knockout (LACC1KO) mice. LACC1KO mice have no obvious health problem under normal feeding conditions. Total ACC activity and malonyl-CoA levels were approximately 70-75% lower in liver of LACC1KO mice compared with that of the WT mice. In addition, the livers of LACC1KO mice accumulated 40-70% less triglycerides. Unexpectedly, when fed fat-free diet for 10 days, there was significant up-regulation of PPARgamma and several enzymes in the lipogenic pathway in the liver of LACC1KO mice compared with the WT mice. Despite the significant up-regulation of the lipogenic enzymes, including a >2-fold increase in fatty acid synthase mRNA, protein, and activity, there was significant decrease in the de novo fatty acid synthesis and triglyceride accumulation in the liver. However, there were no significant changes in blood glucose and fasting ketone body levels. Hence, reducing cytosolic malonyl-CoA and, therefore, the de novo fatty acid synthesis in the liver, does not affect fatty acid oxidation and glucose homeostasis under lipogenic conditions. "

Therefore, in this study it was tested whether high glucose directly modulates NO synthesis by rat mesangial cells in vitro by measuring the accumulation of nitrite, the stable metabolite of NO, in the incubation media. Raising the external glucose concentration to 33.3 mM for 24 to 72 h reduced nitrite levels in cell supernatants in a time-dependent manner to a nadir of 14 +/- 3% of the amount in normal glucose media (5.6 mM) (P < 0.01). The decline in NO synthesis in high glucose media was paralleled by decreased cyclic guanosine monophosphate generation; however, there was no alteration in rat mesangial cell expression of inducible NO synthase protein. The suppressive effect of high glucose on NO production by mesangial cells was not modified by inhibition of protein kinase C (H-7), the addition of antioxidants (vitamin E or superoxide dismutase), or a pan-specific anti-transforming growth factor-beta antibody. An elevated ambient glucose caused a time-dependent reduction in mesangial cell L-arginine content. Addition of L-arginine (10 to 20 mM) to external media partially reversed the inhibitory effect of high glucose on mesangial cell NO production in a dose-dependent manner. The highest dose of L-arginine (20 mM) increased mesangial cell L-arginine content to comparable levels in normal and high glucose media. These results indicate that high glucose causes depletion of L-arginine in mesangial cells and compromises NO synthesis. Limitation in the metabolic precursor and other, as yet unidentified, factors act to reduce NO production by mesangial cells in the presence of an elevated ambient glucose level, a change that may play a role in the development of diabetic glomerulosclerosis.

523,37539597,"Hypogonadism and abnormalities of glucose homeostasis, resulting from iron-induced pituitary and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction respectively, are the most frequently reported endocrine abnormalities in patients with ß-thalassemia major (β-TM), also identified as transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT). The aim of the present retrospective study was to evaluate the long-term effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on glucose metabolism and insulin secretion/sensitivity during 3-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in adolescent and young β-TM women with acquired hypogonadototropic -hypogonadism (AHH).Twelve hypogonadal β-TM females with AHH on HRT were followed for 8.26 ± 1.49 years. At baseline, 10 patients (83.3%) had normal OGTT, 1 patient presented with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 1 patient had an isolated PG level of 165 mg/dL at 1-h during OGTT (H-NGT). At last evaluation, 7 patients (58.4 %) had normal OGTT, while 5 patients (41.6%) had abnormal OGTT. Reduced insulin sensitivity and impaired first-phase insulin secretion were also documented. Three of 4 β-TM patients on treatment with estradiol hemihydrate MX 50 patches plus oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), associated with a very effective iron chelation therapy, maintained normal glucose tolerance from baseline to last evaluation. Significant adverse events due to HRT or additional endocrine complications were not documented in any cases during the follow-up. Deterioration of glycemia (dysglycemia) occurred in 45.4% (5/11) of thalassemic females on long-term HRT. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the validity of our preliminary observations. "
524,36285573,"During Ramadan, traditional Egyptian Iftar meals have large amounts of high-glycemic index carbohydrate and fat. The efficacy of different bolus regimens on optimizing post prandial glucose (PPG) excursion following this Iftar meal was assessed. A randomized controlled trial evaluating 4-h PPG measured by continuous glucose-monitoring was conducted. A total of 25 youth with T1DM using insulin pumps were given the same Iftar meal (fat [45 g], protein [28 g], CHO [95 g]) on seven consecutive days. Insulin to carbohydrate ratio (ICR) was individualized, and all boluses were given upfront 20 min before Iftar. Participants were randomized to receive a standard bolus and six different split boluses delivered over 4 h in the following splits: dual wave (DW) 50/50; DW 50/50 with 20% increment (120% ICR); DW60/40; DW 60/40 with 20% increment; DW 70/30 and DW 70/30 with 20% increment. Standard bolus and split 70/30 with 20% increment resulted in significantly lower early glucose excursions (120 min) with mean excursions of less than 40 mg/dL (2.2 mmol/L) compared to other conditions (p < 0.01). The split 70/30 with 20% increment significantly optimized late PPG excursion (240 min) in comparison to standard bolus (p < 0.01), as well as resulting in a significantly lower post meal glucose area under the curve compared with all other conditions (p < 0.01), with no late hypoglycemia. To achieve physiologic PPG profile in traditional Iftar meal, a DW bolus with 20% increment given 20 min preprandial as split bolus 70/30 over 4 h, optimized both early and delayed PPG excursions. "

There is a robust body of evidence supporting the health benefits of sodium reduction. Sodium intake in South Korea is high, with about half the population consuming  In 2012, South Korea implemented its National Plan to Reduce Sodium Intake, with a goal of reducing population sodium consumption by 20%, to 3900 mg/day, by 2020. The plan included five key components: (1) a consumer awareness campaign designed to change food consumption behaviours; (2) increased availability of low-sodium foods at schools and worksites; (3) increased availability of low-sodium meals in restaurants; (4) voluntary reformulation of processed foods to lower sodium content; and (5) development of low-sodium recipes for food prepared at home. Monitoring and evaluation included tracking sodium intake and sources of dietary sodium using the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. By 2014, South Korea had reduced dietary sodium consumption among adults by 23.7% compared to a survey conducted in 2010 prior to implementation of a nationwide salt reduction campaign that used this comprehensive, multipronged approach. The reductions in sodium intake were accompanied by reductions in population blood pressure and hypertension prevalence. Although causal associations between the sodium reduction programme and reduced sodium intake cannot be made, the declines occurred with the introduction of the programme. Multicomponent interventions have great potential to reduce population sodium intake. Lessons learnt from South Korea could be applied to other countries and are likely very relevant to other Asian countries with similar food sources and consumption profiles. "
527,24496312,"Mammary gland (MG) de novo lipogenesis contributes significantly to milk fat in animals but little is known in humans. To test the hypothesis that the incorporation of (13)C carbons from [U-(13)C]glucose into fatty acids (FA) and glycerol in triglycerides (TG) will be greater: 1) in milk than plasma TG, 2) during a high-carbohydrate (H-CHO) diet than high-fat (H-FAT) diet, and 3) during feeding than fasting. Seven healthy, lactating women were studied on two isocaloric, isonitrogenous diets. On one occasion, subjects received diets containing H-FAT or H-CHO diet for 1 wk. Incorporation of (13)C from infused [U-(13)C]glucose into FA and glycerol was measured using GC-MS and gene expression in RNA isolated from milk fat globule using microarrays. Incorporation of (13)C2 into milk FA increased with increased FA chain length from C2:0 to C12:0 but progressively declined in C14:0 and C16:0 and was not detected in FA>C16. During feeding, regardless of diets, enrichment of (13)C2 in milk FA and (13)C3 in milk glycerol were ∼ 3- and ∼ 7-fold higher compared with plasma FA and glycerol, respectively. Following an overnight fast during H-CHO and H-FAT diets, 25 and 6%, respectively, of medium-chain FA (MCFA, C6-C12) in milk were derived from glucose but increased to 75 and 25% with feeding. Expression of genes involved in FA or glycerol synthesis was unchanged regardless of diet or fast/fed conditions. The human MG is capable of de novo lipogenesis of primarily MCFA and glycerol, which is influenced by the macronutrient composition of the maternal diet. "

529,36083198,"Ketogenic diets (KDs) are a popular tool used for weight management. Studies in mice have demonstrated that KDs reduce food intake, increase energy expenditure and cause weight loss. These studies were completed at room temperature, a condition below the animal's thermal neutral zone which induces thermal stress. As energy intake and expenditure are sensitive to environmental temperature it is not clear if a KD would exert the same beneficial effects under thermal neutral conditions. Adherence to restrictive diets is poor and consequently it is important to examine the effects, and underlying mechanisms, of cycling from a ketogenic to an obesogenic diet. The purpose of the current study was to determine if housing temperature impacted the effects of a KD in obese mice and to determine if the mechanisms driving KD-induced weight loss reverse when mice are switched to an obesogenic high fat diet. We demonstrate that KD-induced reductions in food intake, increases in energy expenditure, weight loss and improvements in glucose homeostasis are not dependent upon housing temperature. KD-induced weight loss seems to be largely explained by reductions in caloric intake while cycling mice back to an obesogenic diet following a period of KD feeding leads to hyperphagia-induced weight gain. Collectively, our results suggest that prior findings with mice fed a KD at room temperature are likely not an artifact of how mice were housed and that initial changes in weight when transitioning from an obesogenic to a ketogenic diet or back are largely dependent on food intake. KEY POINTS: Ketogenic diets reduce food intake, increase energy expenditure and cause weight loss in rodents Prior preclinical studies have been completed at room temperature, a condition which induces thermal stress and limits clinical translatability Here it is demonstrated that ketogenic diet-induced reductions in food intake, increases in energy expenditure, weight loss and improvements in glucose homeostasis are similar in mice housed at room temperature or thermal neutrality Ketogenic diet-induced reductions in food intake appear to explain a large degree of weight loss. Similarly, switching mice from a ketogenic to an obesogenic diet leads to hyperphagia-mediated weight gain. "

531,35583077,"In the last couple of decades, biomarkers have been on the rise for diagnostic and predictive value. There has been a rush to identify new markers using new technologies and drug repurposing approaches. SMARCB1 acronym arises from the SWI/SNF (SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable)-related Matrix-associated Actin-dependent Regulator of Chromatin subfamily B member 1 (SMARCB1). It is a molecule, whose role is associated with the sucrose metabolism. SMARCB1 is also called INI1 (Integrase Interactor 1). The molecule was discovered in the mid-1990s. Its role as a loss-of-function marker for malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT) of renal and extrarenal origin has enormously expanded the spectrum of involved neoplasms since that time. Several tumors have been characterized by genetic aberrations in the SMARCB1 gene. They include reduction in expression, loss of expression, and mosaic expression. Most of the tumors are sarcomas, but a variegated group of tumors with mixed phenotypes has also been delineated. It is well known that the outcome of patients harboring genetic aberrations in the SMARCB1 gene has been poor. Guo et al. reported that reduced SMARCB1 expression occurred in 70% of osteosarcomas. Their data significantly correlated with poor neoadjuvant response. These authors emphasize a shorter progression-free and overall survival of the patients demonstrating an altered expression of this gene. Interestingly, mRNA in silico analysis established that SMARCB1 expression correlates with the response to chemotherapy of osteosarcoma patients, but there was no reliable correlation between SMARCB1 expression level and metastasis, response to neoadjuvant therapy, overall survival, and progression-free survival. The study involved a tissue microarray (TMA) on bone tumors that may limit the full evaluation of the gene expression. Nevertheless, Guo et al.'s study is remarkable. It expands the list of the tumors harboring an altered SMARCB1 gene expression and suggests that this marker should be investigated in every pathology workup for potential predictive value. On the other side, much work needs to be done if we hope that we strive to provide additional therapeutic strategies for osteosarcoma patients with altered SMARCB1 gene expression. "
532,25330719,"Understanding the metabolites that are altered by donor red blood cell (RBC) storage and irradiation may provide insight into the metabolic pathways disrupted by the RBC storage lesion. Patterns of metabolites, representing more than 11,000 distinct mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) features, were compared between gamma-irradiated and nonirradiated CPDA-1-split RBCs from six human donors over 35 days of storage using multilevel sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (msPLSDA), hierarchical clustering, pathway enrichment analysis, and network analysis. In msPLSDA analysis, RBC units stored 7 days or fewer (irradiated or nonirradiated) showed similar metabolomic profiles. By contrast, donor RBCs stored 10 days or more demonstrated distinct clustering as a function of storage time and irradiation. Irradiation shifted metabolic features to those seen in older units. Hierarchical clustering analysis identified at least two clusters of metabolites that differentiated between RBC units based on storage time and irradiation exposure, confirming results of the msPLSDA analysis. Pathway enrichment analysis, used to map the discriminatory biochemical features to specific metabolic pathways, identified four pathways significantly affected by irradiation and/or storage including arachidonic acid (p = 3.3 × 10(-33)) and linoleic acid (p = 1.61 × 10(-11)) metabolism. RBC storage under blood bank conditions produces numerous metabolic alterations. Gamma irradiation accentuates these differences as the age of blood increases, indicating that at the biochemical level irradiation accelerates metabolic aging of stored RBCs. Metabolites involved in the cellular membrane are prominently affected and may be useful biomarkers of the RBC storage lesion. "
533,37727604,"Sodium is essential for human health, however the prevalence of various diseases is associated with excessive sodium intake, particularly cardiovascular disorders. However, in most countries, salt intake is much higher than the World Health Organization recommends. Several studies in recent years have revealed that high salt intake is associated with diabetes in the general population, but the association is uncertain in people who do not have hypertension. In this study, we aimed to find out whether high sodium intake increases the risk of diabetes in this particular population. Data were extracted from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; 2009-2018). Participants included adults aged over 20 years old who have undergone the diabetes questionnaire, and the hypertension population was excluded. In order to adjust the confounders, multivariate analysis models were built. Finally, subgroup analysis were conducted to investigate the association between sodium intake and diabetes separately. In the present study, 7,907 participants are included (3,920 female and 3,987 male), and 512 (6.48%) individuals reported diabetes. The median sodium intake of the participants was 3,341 mg/d (IQR: 2498, 4,364 mg/d). A linear association between sodium intake and the prevalence of diabetes was found ( Our results suggest that higher sodium intake is associated with an increased risk of diabetes in the population without hypertension, and for every 1,000 mg sodium intake increment, the risk of diabetes increased by 1.20-fold. To sum up, we have provided the clue to the etiology of diabetes and further prospective research is needed to contribute recommendations for the primary prevention of diabetes in the US. "
534,34815277,"Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of antihyperglycaemic agents that promote urinary glucose excretion in the renal proximal tubule and have cardio-protective and renal-protective properties. However, there are several safety concerns related to increased risks of hypoglycaemic, urinary tract infections and ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a potentially fatal complication that often presents as euglycaemic ketoacidosis during SGLT2 inhibitor treatment. Furthermore, invasive treatment and related surgical stress may increase the risk of ketogenesis. Therefore, this study aims to clarify the incidence of SGLT2 inhibitor-associated postoperative ketoacidosis (SAPKA) among patients who are receiving SGLT2 inhibitors and undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia. This multicentre, prospective, observational study will recruit 750 adult Japanese patients with diabetes who are receiving SGLT2 inhibitors and undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia. Urine samples will be collected on postoperative days 0, 1, 2 and 3. Blood gas analysis will be performed when urine ketone positivity is detected. The incidence of postoperative ketoacidosis will be identified based on urine ketone positivity and a blood pH of ≤7.3. The study will also collect data to identify risk factors for SAPKA. The study protocol has been approved by the ethics committee of Kyorin University (approval number: 785, 26 October 2020) and local ethical approval will be required at each participating centre.

Numerous therapeutic strategies have been developed to improve and prevent the adverse cardiovascular events, including nutritional approaches. This systematic review and meta-analysis summarized the evidence on orange juice consumption on CVD risk factors. Four databases were searched up to September 2020. Ten randomized controlled trials were included in the final analysis. Pooled results demonstrated a significant effect of orange juice on glucose (WMD: -2.92 mg/dl, 95% CI: -5.327, -0.530, p = 0.017), insulin (WMD: -1.229 μU/ml, 95% CI: -2.083, -0.374, p = 0.005), HOMA-IR (WMD: -0.464, 95% CI: -0.747, -0.181, p = 0.001), total cholesterol (WMD: -9.84 mg/dl, 95% CI: -15.43, -4.24, p = 0.001), LDL-C (WMD: -9.14 mg/dl, 95% CI: -15.79, -2.49, p = 0.007), and CRP (WMD: -0.467 mg/l, 95% CI: -0.815, -0.120, p = 0.008) compared to control group. However, the effect of orange juice on body composition factors and other CVD risk factors was not significant compared to control group. These lowering effects of glucose, HOMA-IR, total cholesterol, and LDL-C were robust in subgroups with orange juice consumption ≥500 ml/day. This meta-analysis suggests that orange juice may be beneficial in improving several CVD risk factors. "
537,31766048,"BACKGROUND Metrnl is a novel identified adipomyokine which might have therapeutic potential for metabolic and inﬂammatory diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus. We aimed to explore the associations of circulating Metrnl level with ß-cell function and insulin resistance (IR) and further explore the possible correlation between Metrnl and another adipomyokine named irisin in patients diagnosed type 2 diabetes. MATERIAL AND METHODS Our study recruited 59 participants with type 2 diabetes and 30 normal glucose tolerance (NGT) participants. We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure serum levels of Metrnl and irisin. The associations of Metrnl level with indexes of ß-cell function and IR and irisin level were analyzed by multiple linear regression analysis or spearman correlation analysis. RESULTS Compared with NGT participants, serum Metrnl level was elevated in participants with type 2 diabetes: 210.30 pg/mL (range 105.94-323.91 pg/mL) versus 132.02 pg/mL (range 104.93-195.92 pg/mL). Metrnl level did not show significant correlation with ß-cell function-related indicators, but positively correlated with HOMA2-IR and negatively correlated with HOMA2-%S after controlling multiple covariates in participants with type 2 diabetes. Metrnl level was also not associated with obesity-related indicators (body mass index, waist circumference, body fat percentage, and visceral adipose tissue area) in the type 2 diabetes group. In addition, the correlation between Metrnl and irisin level was also not present (r=-0.159, P=0.229) in type 2 diabetes group. CONCLUSIONS Serum Metrnl level was associated with IR, but not with ß-cell function in participants with diagnosed type 2 diabetes. "
538,11408270,"Sustained upregulation of inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase in the liver after endotoxin [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] challenge may result in hepatocellular injury. We hypothesized that administration of a NO scavenger, NOX, may attenuate LPS-induced hepatocellular injury. Sprague-Dawley rats received NOX or saline via subcutaneous osmotic pumps, followed 18 h later by LPS challenge. Hepatocellular injury was assessed using biochemical assays, light, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Interleukin (IL)-6 mRNA was measured by RT-PCR. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha protein expression was determined by immunohistochemistry. NOX significantly reduced serum levels of ornithine carbamoyltransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. TNF-alpha and IL-6 expression were increased in the livers of saline-treated but not NOX-treated rats. Although there was no difference between groups by light microscopy, TEM revealed obliteration of the space of Disse in saline-treated but not in NOX-treated animals. Electron paramagnetic resonance showed the characteristic mononitrosyl complex in NOX-treated rats. We conclude that NOX reduces hepatocellular injury after endotoxemia. NOX may be useful in the management of hepatic dysfunction secondary to sepsis or other diseases associated with excessive NO production. "
539,11319835,"Glucose is a precursor of lactose, the major carbohydrate and osmotic constituent of human milk, which is synthesized in the Golgi. The GLUT1 glucose transporter is the only glucose transporter isoform expressed in the mammary gland. The hypothesis that lactogenic hormones induce GLUT1 and cause its localization to the Golgi of mammary epithelial cells was tested in CIT(3)mouse mammary epithelial cells. Treatment with prolactin and hydrocortisone caused a 15-fold induction of GLUT1 by Western blotting, but 2-deoxyglucose uptake decreased. Subcellular fractionation and density gradient centrifugation demonstrated enrichment of Golgi fractions with GLUT1. Lactogenic hormones enhanced GLUT1 glycosylation, but did not determine whether GLUT1 was targeted to plasma membrane or to Golgi. Confocal microscopy revealed that lactogenic hormones alter GLUT1 targeting from a plasma membrane pattern to a predominant perinuclear distribution with punctate scattering through the cytoplasm. GLUT1 is targeted to a compartment which is more sensitive to Brefeldin A than the compartments in which GM130 and beta-COP reside. Targeting of GLUT1 to endosomes was specifically excluded. We conclude that prolactin and hydrocortisone induce GLUT1, enhance GLUT1 glycosylation, and cause glycosylation-independent targeting of GLUT1 to Brefeldin A-sensitive vesicles which may represent a subcompartment of cis-Golgi. These results demonstrate a hormonally-regulated targeting mechanism for GLUT1 and are consistent with an important role for GLUT1 in the provision of substrate for lactose synthesis. "
540,7967479,"To determine whether patients with GSD-1 need nocturnal glucose therapy after completing physical growth and development, studies were performed on two consecutive nights. On the first night uncooked cornstarch (UCS) was given at the calculated glucose production rate at 21:00 h and 02:00 h. On the second night UCS was given at 21:00 h but omitted at 02:00 h. Six GSD-1 patients, aged 17.2-20.9 years, previously treated with continuous glucose therapy were studied. Measurements were made of plasma glucose (PG), serum insulin, growth hormone, cortisol, plasma glucagon (n = 4), and blood lactate at 30-60-min intervals. Serum uric acid, cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured at 21:00 h and 07:00 h, and serum FFA at 21:00 h, 02:00 h and 07:00 h on the first night and immediately before treatment for hypoglycaemia on the second night. For five hours after UCS at 21:00 h, mean PG, serum insulin and blood lactate concentrations were similar on the two nights. With UCS at 02:00 h, mean PG concentrations were > or = 4.1 mmol/L from 02:00 to 07:00 h. Without UCS at 02:00 h, in all subjects PG concentrations fell to < 2.5 mmol/L after 6.5-8.5 h and mean blood lactate concentration increased to 7.4 +/- 3.0 mmol/L. Young adults with GSD-1 developed hypoglycaemia and hyperlactataemia after a relatively brief period without exogenous glucose and, therefore, need to continue nocturnal glucose therapy to prevent fasting hypoglycaemia.

In this study, we have used (1) H and (13) C NMR spectroscopy after injection of [1-(13) C]glucose and [1,2-(13) C]acetate to examine neuronal and astrocytic metabolism in the early reperfusion phase after unilateral HI brain injury in 7-day-old rat pups, exploring the effects of HI on mitochondrial function and the potential protective effects of melatonin on brain metabolism. One hour after hypoxia-ischemia, astrocytic metabolism was recovered and glycolysis was normalized, whereas mitochondrial metabolism in neurons was clearly impaired. Pyruvate carboxylation was also lower in both hemispheres after HI. The transfer of glutamate from neurons to astrocytes was higher whereas the transfer of glutamine from astrocytes to neurons was lower 1 h after HI in the contralateral hemisphere. Neuronal metabolism was equally affected in pups treated with melatonin (10 mg/kg) immediately after HI as in vehicle treated pups indicating that the given dose of melatonin was not capable of protecting the neuronal mitochondria in this early phase after HI brain injury. However, any beneficial effects of melatonin might have been masked by modulatory effects of the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide on cerebral metabolism. Neuronal and astrocytic metabolism was examined by (13) C and (1) H NMR spectroscopy in the early reperfusion phase after unilateral hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and melatonin treatment in neonatal rats. One hour after hypoxia-ischemia astrocytic mitochondrial metabolism had recovered and glycolysis was normalized, whereas mitochondrial metabolism in neurons was impaired. Melatonin treatment did not show a protective effect on neuronal metabolism. "
542,19654284,"Little is known about how lactating women accommodate for their increased glucose demands during fasting to avoid maternal hypoglycemia. The objective of this study was to determine whether lactating women conserve plasma glucose by reducing maternal glucose utilization by increasing utilization of FFA and ketone bodies and/or increasing gluconeogenesis and mammary gland hexoneogenesis. Six healthy exclusively breastfeeding women and six nonlactating controls were studied during 42 h of fasting and 6 h of refeeding. Glucose and protein kinetic parameters were measured using stable isotopes and GCMS and energy expenditure and substrate oxidation using indirect calorimetry. After 42 h of fasting, milk production decreased by 16% but remained within normal range. Glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations decreased with the duration of fasting in both groups but were lower (P < 0.05) in lactating women. Glucagon, FFA, and beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations increased with fasting time (P < 0.001) and were higher (P < 0.0001) in lactating women during both fasting and refeeding. During 42 h of fasting, gluconeogenesis was higher in lactating women compared with nonlactating controls (7.7 +/- 0.4 vs. 6.5 +/- 0.2 micromol kg(-1) min(-1), P < 0.05), whereas glycogenolysis was suppressed to similar values (0.4 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.9 +/- 0.2 micromol kg(-1) min(-1), respectively). Mammary hexoneogenesis did not increase with the duration of fasting. Carbohydrate oxidation was lower and fat and protein oxidations higher (P < 0.05) in lactating women. In summary, lactating women are at risk for hypoglycemia if fasting is extended beyond 30 h. The extra glucose demands of extended fasting during lactation appear to be compensated by increasing gluconeogenesis associated with ketosis, decreasing carbohydrate oxidation, and increasing protein and FFA oxidations.

In this clinical trial study, 60 infants admitted to the neonatal ward of Amirkola Hospital were randomly divided into four groups of 15 patients. In the first group, the infants were swaddled before blood sampling. In the second group, sucrose was administered to infants. In the third group, the neonates were swaddled and given sucrose simultaneously, and in the fourth group (control), blood sampling was performed routinely. PIPP pain scale and demographic questionnaire were used to collect the data. Data analysis was performed using SPSS23. The results showed a significant difference between the mean pain intensity in neonates in the sucrose-swaddle group (4.53 ± 1.30) and the sucrose (7.73 ± 2.73), swaddle (9.86 ± 33.33), and control (12.13 ± 2.06) groups during blood sampling (P < 0.001). Besides, after blood sampling, there was a significant difference between the mean pain intensity in neonates in the sucrose-swaddle group (4.33 ± 1.23) and the sucrose (8.13 ± 2.66), swaddle (7.73 ± 2.78), and control (10.00. ± 1.96) groups (P < 0.001). The present study showed that pain severity during and after venous blood sampling was lower in the swaddle-sucrose group than in other groups. Therefore, it is recommended that the combined method of swaddle-sucrose be used in infants as a better pain reliever when intravenous blood sampling is performed. "
544,19737610,"The use of the club drugs 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and 5-methoxy-n,n-diisopropyltryptamine (Foxy) is of growing concern, especially as many of the effects, particularly during development, are unknown. The effects of these drugs upon homeostasis may be important since both are known to stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The purpose of this experiment was to examine alterations in rats in corticosterone and glucose following an acute exposure to these drugs at different stages of development: preweaning, juvenile, and adulthood. Both MDMA and Foxy increased corticosterone levels significantly at all ages examined, while glucose was elevated at all stages except at the juvenile time point (postnatal day 28). For both measures, there were no differences between the sexes with either drug. The data indicate that an acute exposure to these drugs alters CORT and glucose levels, raising the possibility that these changes may have effects on behavioral and cognitive function, as we and others have previously demonstrated.

545,12137681,"Iodine deficiency is the main cause for potentially preventable mental retardation in childhood, as well as causing goitre and hypothyroidism in people of all ages. It is still prevalent in large parts of the world. To assess the effects of iodised salt in comparison with other forms of iodine supplementation or placebo in the prevention of iodine deficiency disorders. We searched the Cochrane Library, Medline, the Register of Chinese trials developed by the Chinese Cochrane Centre, and the Chinese Med Database. We performed handsearching of a number of journals (Chinese Journal of Control of Endemic Diseases, Chinese Journal of Epidemiology, Chinese Journal of Preventive Medicine, and Studies of Trace Elements and Health up to February 2001), and searched reference lists, databases of ongoing trials and the Internet. Date of latest search: November 2001. We included prospective controlled studies of iodised salt versus other forms of iodine supplementation or placebo in people living in areas of iodine deficiency. Studies reported mainly goitre rates and urinary iodine excretion as outcome measures. The initial data selection and quality assessment of trials was done independently by two reviewers. Subsequently, after the scope of the review was slightly widened from including only randomised controlled trials to including non-randomised prospective comparative studies, a third reviewer repeated the trials selection and quality assessment. As the studies identified were not sufficiently similar and not of sufficient quality, we did not do a meta-analysis but summarised the data in a narrative format. We found six prospective controlled trials relating to our question. Four of these were described as randomised controlled trials, one was a prospective controlled trial that did not specify allocation to comparison groups, and one was a repeated cross-sectional study comparing different interventions. Comparison interventions included non-iodised salt, iodised water, iodised oil, and salt iodisation with potassium iodide versus potassium iodate. Numbers of participants in the trials ranged from 35 to 334; over 20,000 people were included in the cross-sectional study. Three studies were in children only, two investigated both groups of children and adults and one investigated pregnant women. There was a tendency towards goitre reduction with iodised salt, although this was not significant in all studies. There was also an improved iodine status in most studies (except in small children in one of the studies), although urinary iodine excretion did not always reach the levels recommended by the WHO. None of the studies observed any adverse effects of iodised salt. The results suggest that iodised salt is an effective means of improving iodine status. No conclusions can be made about improvements in other, more patient-oriented outcomes, such as physical and mental development in children and mortality. None of the studies specifically investigated development of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism, which can be easily overlooked if just assessed on the basis of symptoms. High quality controlled studies investigating relevant long term outcome measures are needed to address questions of dosage and best means of iodine supplementation in different population groups and settings.

546,26018655,"To measure the iodine status and iodine intake of New Zealand adults 18-64 years of age following mandatory fortification of bread with iodine. A cross-sectional survey of NZ adults living in Dunedin and Wellington during February-November 2012. Three hundred and one men and women aged 18-64 years randomly selected from the New Zealand Electoral Roll completed a 24-h urine collection, a demographic and iodine-specific food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and had height and weight measured. Urine collections were analysed for iodine and reported as median urinary iodine concentration (UIC) µg/L and median urinary iodine excretion (UIE) µg/day. The FFQ was used to estimate iodine intake with and without discretionary iodised salt use. The median UIC for all adults was 73 µg/L, indicative of mild iodine deficiency. The mean urinary volume was 2.0 L. As an estimate of iodine intake, the median UIE was 127 µg/day. Estimated iodine intake, using the FFQ which included discretionary iodised salt use, was 132 µg/day. Iodine intakes were associated with UIC (P = 0.040) and UIE (P = 0.003), but not with bread iodine intake and iodised salt use. Using the WHO/UNICEF/ICCIDD target for iodine sufficiency (a UIC of >100 µg/L) based on school-aged children with a mean urinary volume of 1.0 L, the iodine status of NZ adults does not reach adequate levels (73 µg/L). A more realistic parameter in a population with a higher urinary volume excretion (2.0 L) is the UIE. A median UIE of 127 µg/day suggests that the iodine status of NZ adults is now likely to be adequate. "
547,1636624,"Using a random crossover design, we examined the effects of glyburide for 4 wk on glucose, insulin, lipid, and lipoprotein metabolism in 10 men with non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM) receiving dietary fish-oil concentrates containing omega 3 (n-3) fatty acids (8 g/d). Compared with glyburide alone, fasting plasma glucose concentrations increased with fish oil. Although glyburide with fish oil decreased fasting glucose concentrations, they did not return to baseline. Basal insulin concentrations were unaltered by fish oil without or with glyburide; however, postprandial insulin concentrations were decreased by fish oil. Although total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were unchanged, very-low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations decreased and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol rose and apolipoprotein B concentrations trended higher. Thus, glyburide only partially rectified the impaired fuel homeostasis associated with fish-oil supplements in patients with NIDDM. Therefore, we do not recommend intake of fish oil concentrates containing n-3 fatty acids in patients with NIDDM. "
548,31050747,"A critical role for host-microbe interactions and establishment of vaccine responses has been postulated. Human milk oligosaccharides, of which 2'-fucosyllactose (2'FL) is the most prevalent, are known to alter host-associated microbial communities and play a critical role in the immunologic development of breastfed infants. Dietary supplementation with a combination of 2'FL and prebiotic short-chain (sc) galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) and long-chain (lc) fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) was employed to examine human milk oligosaccharide effects on immune responsiveness, within a murine influenza vaccination model. Female mice (6 wk old, C57Bl/6JOlaHsd) were fed either control diet (CON) or scGOS/lcFOS/2'FL-containing diet (GF2F) for 45 d. After starting dietary intervention (day 14), mice received a primary influenza vaccination (day 0) followed by a booster vaccination (day 21), after which ear challenges were conducted to measure vaccine-specific delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH). Serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels, fecal and cecal microbial community structure, short-chain fatty acids, host intestinal gene expression and cellular responses in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) were also measured. Relative to CON, mice fed the GF2F diet had increased influenza vaccine-specific DTH responses (79.3%; P < 0.01), higher levels of both IgG1 (3.2-fold; P < 0.05) and IgG2a (1.2-fold; P < 0.05) in serum, and greater percentages of activated B cells (0.3%; P < 0.05), regulatory T cells (1.64%; P < 0.05), and T-helper 1 cells (2.2%; P < 0.05) in their MLNs. GF2F-fed mice had elevated cecal butyric (P < 0.05) and propionic (P < 0.05) acid levels relative to CON, which correlated to DTH responses (R2 = 0.22; P = 0.05 and R2 = 0.39; P < 0.01, respectively). Specific fecal microbial taxa altered in GF2F diet fed mice relative to CON were significantly correlated with the DTH response and IgG2a level increases. Dietary GF2F improved influenza vaccine-specific T-helper 1 responses and B cell activation in MLNs and enhanced systemic IgG1 and IgG2a concentrations in mice. These immunologic changes are correlated with microbial community structure and metabolites. "
549,28899857,"Pediatric obesity and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are on the rise in industrialized countries, yet our ability to mechanistically examine this relationship is limited by the lack of a suitable higher animal models. Here, we examined the effects of high-fat, high-fructose corn syrup, high-cholesterol Western-style diet (WD)-induced obesity on NASH and cecal microbiota dysbiosis in juvenile Ossabaw swine. Juvenile female Ossabaw swine (5 wk old) were fed WD (43.0% fat; 17.8% high-fructose corn syrup; 2% cholesterol) or low-fat diet (CON/lean; 10.5% fat) for 16 wk ( n = 6 each) or 36 wk ( n = 4 each). WD-fed pigs developed obesity, dyslipidemia, and systemic insulin resistance compared with CON pigs. In addition, obese WD-fed pigs developed severe NASH, with hepatic steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, inflammatory cell infiltration, and fibrosis after 16 wk, with further exacerbation of histological inflammation and fibrosis after 36 wk of WD feeding. WD feeding also resulted in robust cecal microbiota changes including increased relative abundances of families and genera in Proteobacteria ( P < 0.05) (i.e., Enterobacteriaceae, Succinivibrionaceae, and Succinivibrio) and LPS-containing Desulfovibrionaceae and Desulfovibrio and a greater ( P < 0.05) predicted microbial metabolic function for LPS biosynthesis, LPS biosynthesis proteins, and peptidoglycan synthesis compared with CON-fed pigs. Overall, juvenile Ossabaw swine fed a high-fat, high-fructose, high-cholesterol diet develop obesity and severe microbiota dysbiosis with a proinflammatory signature and a NASH phenotype directly relevant to the pediatric/adolescent and young adult population.

550,15464299,"It has been reported that the area of decreased glucose metabolism in the FDG-PET of prelingually deaf children correlates significantly with speech performance after cochlear implantation. In this study, we undertook to confirm changes of glucose metabolism in the cerebral cortex using an animal model with age-matching groups to completely exclude the influence of age differences between the deaf and normal-hearing groups. The cochlea was ablated bilaterally at a postnatal 10-14 days in the deaf groups; 3-4 deaf and normal rats were included at each time point at 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks and 7 months after ablation. After injecting 2-deoxyglucose intraperitoneally, digitalized autoradiographic images were obtained, and analyzed by using two different methods; 3-dimensional voxel-wise statistical analysis and conventional 2-dimensional densitometry. The hypometabolic area analyzed using 3-dimensional analysis and the differences of optical density between normal and deaf as determined by densitometry were widest and most prominent between 4 and 8 weeks after ablation. Differences were not significant before 2 weeks or after 7 months after ablation. This result shows that the hypometabolic area becomes prominent after a critical period and it decreases as the duration of deafness increases. We believe that cross-modal plasticity may be the mechanism of changes in glucose metabolism and that this result reinforced the usefulness of evaluating hypometabolic area using FDG-PET in deaf children.

551,37914684,"Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is involved in mammalian reproduction via binding to FSH receptor (FSHR). However, several studies have found that FSH and FSHR play important roles in extragonadal tissue. Here, we identified the expression of FSHR in human and mouse pancreatic islet β-cells. Blocking FSH signaling by Fshr knock-out led to impaired glucose tolerance owing to decreased insulin secretion, while high FSH levels caused insufficient insulin secretion as well. In vitro, we found that FSH orchestrated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in a bell curve manner. Mechanistically, FSH primarily activates Gαs via FSHR, promoting the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) and calcium pathways to stimulate GSIS, whereas high FSH levels could activate Gαi to inhibit the cAMP/PKA pathway and the amplified effect on GSIS. Our results reveal the role of FSH in regulating pancreatic islet insulin secretion and provide avenues for future clinical investigation and therapeutic strategies for postmenopausal diabetes. "

553,36181065,"The aim of the study was to observe the association between follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels and serum lipid profiles in postmenopausal women. A total of 411 healthy postmenopausal women with a mean age of 55 years (range 45-65 years) were enrolled in this study. Data on age, time of last menstrual period, past medical history, use of medications, and smoking status were collected, and body weight, height, and blood pressure were measured. Blood samples were collected to measure the serum concentrations of FSH, luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), glucose, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) using routine methods. FSH levels were negatively associated with LDL-C, even after adjustment for age, LH, E2, BMI, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (OR = 0.185, 95% CI = 0.051-0.669). Although FSH may also be negatively associated with dyslipidemia (P = .06 for trend) and hypercholesterolemia (P = .079 for trend), but no statistical significance was found after adjusting for confounding factors, particularly BMI. All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files. The results indicated that lower FSH levels might increase the odds of dyslipidemia, especially the risk of LDL-C elevation, which is an important factor that increases the risk of CVD in postmenopausal women.

554,38776924,"A significant variation in chromatin accessibility is an epigenetic feature of leukemia. The cause of this variation in leukemia, however, remains elusive. Here, we identify SMARCA5, a core ATPase of the imitation switch (ISWI) chromatin remodeling complex, as being responsible for aberrant chromatin accessibility in leukemia cells. We find that SMARCA5 is required to maintain aberrant chromatin accessibility for leukemogenesis and then promotes transcriptional activation of AKR1B1, an aldo/keto reductase, by recruiting transcription co-activator DDX5 and transcription factor SP1. Higher levels of AKR1B1 are associated with a poor prognosis in leukemia patients and promote leukemogenesis by reprogramming fructose metabolism. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of AKR1B1 has been shown to have significant therapeutic effects in leukemia mice and leukemia patient cells. Thus, our findings link the aberrant chromatin state mediated by SMARCA5 to AKR1B1-mediated endogenous fructose metabolism reprogramming and shed light on the essential role of AKR1B1 in leukemogenesis, which may provide therapeutic strategies for leukemia.

Both global and hepatic deletions of Sam68 significantly reduce blood glucose levels and the glucagon-induced expression of gluconeogenic genes. Protein, but not mRNA, levels of CRTC2, a crucial transcriptional regulator of gluconeogenesis, are >50% lower in Sam68-deficient hepatocytes than in wild-type hepatocytes.

556,26701795,"The immature intestinal mucosa responds excessively to inflammatory insult, but human milk protects infants from intestinal inflammation. The ability of galactosyllactoses [galactosyloligosaccharides (GOS)], newly found in human milk oligosaccharides (HMOS), to suppress inflammation was not known. The objective was to test whether GOS can directly attenuate inflammation and to explore the components of immune signaling modulated by GOS. Galactosyllactose composition was measured in sequential human milk samples from days 1 through 21 of lactation and in random colostrum samples from 38 mothers. Immature [human normal fetal intestinal epithelial cell (H4)] and mature [human metastatic colonic epithelial cell (T84) and human normal colon mucosal epithelial cell (NCM-460)] enterocyte cell lines were treated with the pro-inflammatory molecules tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) or interleukin-1β (IL-1β) or infected with Salmonella or Listeria. The inflammatory response was measured as induction of IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), or macrophage inflammatory protein-3α (MIP-3α) protein by ELISA and mRNA by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The ability of HMOS or synthetic GOS to attenuate this inflammation was tested in vitro and in immature human intestinal tissue ex vivo. The 3 galactosyllactoses (3'-GL, 4-GL, and 6'-GL) expressed in colostrum rapidly declined over early lactation (P < 0.05). In H4 cells, HMOS attenuated TNF-α- and IL-1β-induced expression of IL-8, MIP-3α, and MCP-1 to 48-51% and pathogen-induced IL-8 and MCP-1 to 26-30% of positive controls (P < 0.001). GOS reduced TNF-α- and IL-1β-induced inflammatory responses to 25-26% and pathogen-induced IL-8 and MCP-1 to 36-39% of positive controls (P < 0.001). GOS and HMOS mitigated nuclear translocation of nuclear transcription factor κB (NF-κB) p65. HMOS quenched the inflammatory response to Salmonella infection by immature human intestinal tissue ex vivo to 26% and by GOS to 50% of infected controls (P < 0.01). Galactosyllactose attenuated NF-κB inflammatory signaling in human intestinal epithelial cells and in human immature intestine. Thus, galactosyllactoses are strong physiologic anti-inflammatory agents in human colostrum and early milk, contributing to innate immune modulation. The potential clinical utility of galactosyllactose warrants investigation. "

558,36291640,"Intrathecal delivery of Nusinersen-an antisense oligonucleotide that promotes survival motor neuron (SMN) protein induction-is an approved therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Here, we employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to longitudinally characterize the unknown metabolic effects of Nusinersen in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of SMA patients across disease severity. Modulation of amino acid metabolism is a common denominator of biochemical changes induced by Nusinersen, with distinct downstream metabolic effects according to disease severity. In severe SMA1 patients, Nusinersen stimulates energy-related glucose metabolism. In intermediate SMA2 patients, Nusinersen effects are also related to energy homeostasis but involve ketone body and fatty acid biosynthesis. In milder SMA3 patients, Nusinersen mainly modulates amino acid metabolism. Moreover, Nusinersen modifies the CSF metabolome of a more severe clinical group towards the profile of untreated SMA patients with milder disease. These findings reveal disease severity-specific neurometabolic signatures of Nusinersen treatment, suggesting a selective modulation of peripheral organ metabolism by this CNS-directed therapy in severe SMA patients.

559,28003083,"Gitelman syndrome (GS) is a rare, salt-losing tubulopathy characterized by hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria. The disease is recessively inherited, caused by inactivating mutations in the SLC12A3 gene that encodes the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC). GS is usually detected during adolescence or adulthood, either fortuitously or in association with mild or nonspecific symptoms or both. The disease is characterized by high phenotypic variability and a significant reduction in the quality of life, and it may be associated with severe manifestations. GS is usually managed by a liberal salt intake together with oral magnesium and potassium supplements. A general problem in rare diseases is the lack of high quality evidence to inform diagnosis, prognosis, and management. We report here on the current state of knowledge related to the diagnostic evaluation, follow-up, management, and treatment of GS; identify knowledge gaps; and propose a research agenda to substantiate a number of issues related to GS. This expert consensus statement aims to establish an initial framework to enable clinical auditing and thus improve quality control of care. "
560,28541143,"Unintentional mothball ingestions may cause serious toxicity in small children. Camphor, naphthalene, and paradichlorobenzene mothballs are difficult to distinguish without packaging. Symptoms and management differ based on the ingested compound. Previous studies have used a variety of antiquated, impractical and potentially dangerous techniques to identify the mothballs. The goal of this study is to discover a simplified identification technique using materials readily available in an emergency department. Mothballs made of naphthalene and paradichlorobenzene along with camphor tablets were tested. Each material was tested both intact and after being fragmented to simulate a partially ingested mothball. Each of these six sample types were then immersed in 40 ml each of 11 fluids: water, 0.45% NaCl, 0.9% NaCl, lactated Ringer's, 5% dextrose in water, 5% dextrose in 0.9% NaCl, 50% dextrose in water, 8.4% NaHCO All evaluators agreed in their description of 62/66 (94%) of the samples, with all four disagreements being on sinking and dissolving versus sinking only. A two-fluid algorithm utilizing 50% dextrose and water was sufficient to distinguish the sample types. Camphor will float in water while both paradichlorobenzene and naphthalene will sink. In 50% dextrose, both naphthalene and camphor will float while paradichlorobenzene will sink. Mothball materials can be distinguished by immersion in water and 50% dextrose. Limitations of this study include using camphor tablets as a substitute for mothballs given lack of availability. "

562,33652060,"Neuropeptide Y affects several physiological functions, notably appetite regulation. We analysed the association between four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the NPY gene (rs5574, rs16147, rs16139, rs17149106) and measures of obesity, dietary intake, physical activity, blood pressure, glucose and lipid metabolism from adolescence to young adulthood. The sample included both birth cohorts of the Estonian Children Personality Behaviour and Health Study at ages 15 (n = 1075 with available complete data), 18 (n = 913) and 25 (n = 926) years. Linear mixed-effects regression models were used for longitudinal association between NPY SNP-s and variables of interest. Associations at ages 15, 18 and 25 were analysed by ANOVA. Rs5574 CC-homozygotes had a greater increase per year in waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and a smaller decrease in daily energy intake and carbohydrate intake from age 15-25 years; fasting glucose and cholesterol were higher in rs5574 CC-homozygotes. Rs16147 TT-homozygotes had higher body weight and a greater increase in sum of 5 skinfolds, waist circumference, WHR and waist-to-height ratio; however, they had lower carbohydrate intake throughout the observation period. Rs16147 TT-homozygotes and both rs16139 and rs17149106 heterozygotes had higher triglyceride levels. All NPY SNP-s were associated with blood pressure: rs5574 TT-and rs16147 CC-homozygotes had a smaller increase in diastolic blood pressure, while rs16139 and rs17149106 heterozygous had lower blood pressure throughout the study. Variants of the NPY gene were associated with measures of obesity, dietary intake, glucose and lipid metabolism and blood pressure from adolescence to young adulthood. "
563,33359667,"Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD-Ia), deficient in glucose-6-phosphatase-α (G6PC), is characterized by impaired glucose homeostasis and a hallmark of fasting hypoglycemia. We have developed a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector-mediated gene therapy for GSD-Ia that is currently in a phase I/II clinical trial. While therapeutic expression of the episomal rAAV-G6PC clinical vector is stable in mice, the long-term durability of expression in humans is currently being established. Here we evaluated CRISPR/Cas9-based in vivo genome editing technology to correct a prevalent pathogenic human variant, G6PC-p.R83C. We have generated a homozygous G6pc-R83C mouse strain and shown that the G6pc-R83C mice manifest impaired glucose homeostasis and frequent hypoglycemic seizures, mimicking the pathophysiology of GSD-Ia patients. We then used a CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing system to treat newborn G6pc-R83C mice and showed that the treated mice grew normally to age 16 weeks without hypoglycemia seizures. The treated G6pc-R83C mice, expressing ≥ 3% of normal hepatic G6Pase-α activity, maintained glucose homeostasis, displayed normalized blood metabolites, and could sustain 24 h of fasting. Taken together, we have developed a second-generation therapy in which in vivo correction of a pathogenic G6PC-p.R83C variant in its native genetic locus could lead to potentially permanent, durable, long-term correction of the GSD-Ia phenotype.

564,27002150,"Metformin is the most commonly prescribed oral anti-diabetic agent worldwide. Surprisingly, about 35% of diabetic patients either lack or have a delayed response to metformin treatment, and many patients become less responsive to metformin over time. It remains unknown how metformin resistance or insensitivity occurs. Recently, we found that therapeutic metformin concentrations suppressed glucose production in primary hepatocytes through AMPK; activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway negatively regulates AMPK activity by phosphorylating AMPKα subunit at Ser-485, which in turn reduces AMPK activity. In this study, we find that metformin failed to suppress glucose production in primary hepatocytes with constitutively activated PKA and did not improve hyperglycemia in mice with hyperglucagonemia. Expression of the AMPKα1(S485A) mutant, which is unable to be phosphorylated by PKA, increased both AMPKα activation and the suppression of glucose production in primary hepatocytes treated with metformin. Intriguingly, salicylate/aspirin prevents the phosphorylation of AMPKα at Ser-485, blocks cAMP-PKA negative regulation of AMPK, and improves metformin resistance. We propose that aspirin/salicylate may augment metformin's hepatic action to suppress glucose production. "
565,35508667,"Ectopic ceramide accumulation in insulin-responsive tissues contributes to the development of obesity and impairs insulin sensitivity. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of serine palmitoyl transferase (SPT), the first enzyme essential for ceramide biosynthesis using myriocin in rodents reduces body weight and improves insulin sensitivity and associated metabolic indices. Myriocin was originally extracted from fruiting bodies of the fungus Isaria sinclairii and has been found abundant in a number of closely related fungal species such as the Cordyceps. Myriocin is not approved for human use but extracts from Cordyceps are routinely consumed as part of traditional Chinese medication for the treatment of numerous diseases including diabetes. Herein, we screened commercially available extracts of Cordyceps currently being consumed by humans, to identify Cordyceps containing myriocin and test the efficacy of Cordyceps extract containing myriocin in obese mice to improve energy and glucose homeostasis. We demonstrate that commercially available Cordyceps contain variable amounts of myriocin and treatment of mice with a human equivalent dose of Cordyceps extract containing myriocin, reduces ceramide accrual, increases energy expenditure, prevents diet-induced obesity, improves glucose homeostasis and resolves hepatic steatosis. Mechanistically, these beneficial effects were due to increased adipose tissue browning/beiging, improved brown adipose tissue function and hepatic insulin sensitivity as well as alterations in the abundance of gut microbes such as Clostridium and Bilophila. Collectively, our data provide proof-of-principle that myriocin containing Cordyceps extract inhibit ceramide biosynthesis and attenuate metabolic impairments associated with obesity.

569,29025734,"Dietary copper-fructose interactions contribute to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Gut microbiota play critical roles in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of different dietary doses of copper and their interactions with high fructose on gut microbiome. Male weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were fed diets with adequate copper (6 ppm CuA), marginal copper (1.5 ppm CuM) (low copper), or supplemented copper (20 ppm CuS) (high copper) for 4 wk. Deionized water or deionized water containing 30% fructose (wt/vol) was given ad libitum. Copper status, liver enzymes, gut barrier function, and gut microbiome were evaluated. Both low- and high-copper diets led to liver injury in high-fructose-fed rats, and this was associated with gut barrier dysfunction, as shown by the markedly decreased tight junction proteins and increased gut permeability. 16S rDNA sequencing analysis revealed distinct alterations of the gut microbiome associated with dietary low- and high-copper/high-fructose feeding. The common features of the alterations of the gut microbiome were the increased abundance of Firmicutes and the depletion of Akkermansia. However, they differed mainly within the phylum Firmicutes. Our data demonstrated that a complex interplay among host, microbes, and dietary copper-fructose interaction regulates gut microbial metabolic activity, which may contribute to the development of liver injury and hepatic steatosis. The distinct alterations of gut microbial activity, which were associated with the different dietary doses of copper and fructose, imply that separate mechanism(s) may be involved. NEW & NOTEWORTHY First, dietary low- and high-copper/high-fructose-induced liver injury are associated with distinct alterations of gut microbiome. Second, dietary copper level plays a critical role in maintaining the gut barrier integrity, likely by acting on the intestinal tight junction proteins and the protective commensal bacteria Akkermansia. Third, the alterations of gut microbiome induced by dietary low and high copper with or without fructose differ mainly within the phylum Firmicutes. "
570,28456846,"Median urinary iodine concentration (UIC) is used to describe the iodine status of a population. However, the link between UIC and iodine intake may vary during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to compare UIC during and after pregnancy, adjusting for factors that affect iodine intake. Two repeated measures of UIC and data on maternal iodine intake estimated through questionnaires were collected during pregnancy and 1-4 years after pregnancy in a subsample of women (n = 598) from a mother and child cohort study in Spain. Random-effects interval regression was used to assess the changes in UIC according to pregnancy status. Median UIC was similar during (133 μg/L) and after pregnancy (139 μg/L). After adjusting for iodised salt, iodine supplement consumption, and socio-demographic related variables, UIC was 24.0% (95% CI 11.3, 38.2) higher after than during pregnancy. This difference was maintained in a subsample of women with exhaustive information on diet (n = 291): 26.2%, 95% CI 10.3, 44.4. In an iodine sufficient area for the general population, iodine excretion was lower during than after pregnancy when factors affecting iodine intake were controlled for. Current recommendations of median UIC during pregnancy are based on the equivalence between iodine intake and UIC estimated from studies in non-pregnant populations, which might lead to overestimation of iodine deficiency during gestation. Further studies should evaluate the equivalence between iodine intake and its urinary excretion during pregnancy. "

572,35271586,"Pregnant Muslim women are exempt from fasting during Ramadan; however a majority are reported to fast. The impact of this form of maternal intermittent fasting (IF) on fetal development and offspring health is not well defined. Using a rat model, we have shown previously that maternal IF results in fetal growth restriction accompanied by changes in placental nutrient transport function. The aim of this study was to assess cardiovascular, metabolic and renal function in adult offspring of IF-exposed dams. Food was withheld from Wistar rats from 17:00 to 09:00 daily throughout pregnancy; controls had ad libitum access to food. Birth weight was unaffected; however male IF pups grew more slowly up to 10 weeks of age (P < 0.01) whereas IF females matched their control counterparts. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), glucose tolerance and basal renal function at 14 weeks were not affected by IF exposure. When offered saline solutions (0.9-2.1%) to drink, females showed a greater salt preference than males (P < 0.01); however there were no differences between dietary groups. A separate group of pups was weaned onto a 4% NaCl diet. SBP increased in IF pups sooner, at 7 weeks (P < 0.01), than controls which became hypertensive from 10 weeks. Renal function did not appear to differ; however markers of renal injury were elevated in IF males (P < 0.05). Maternal IF does not affect resting cardiovascular, metabolic and renal function; but when challenged by dietary salt load male IF offspring are more prone to renal injury. "

574,27049945,"Cells receive growth and survival stimuli through their attachment to an extracellular matrix (ECM). Overcoming the addiction to ECM-induced signals is required for anchorage-independent growth, a property of most malignant cells. Detachment from ECM is associated with enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) owing to altered glucose metabolism. Here we identify an unconventional pathway that supports redox homeostasis and growth during adaptation to anchorage independence. We observed that detachment from monolayer culture and growth as anchorage-independent tumour spheroids was accompanied by changes in both glucose and glutamine metabolism. Specifically, oxidation of both nutrients was suppressed in spheroids, whereas reductive formation of citrate from glutamine was enhanced. Reductive glutamine metabolism was highly dependent on cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1), because the activity was suppressed in cells homozygous null for IDH1 or treated with an IDH1 inhibitor. This activity occurred in absence of hypoxia, a well-known inducer of reductive metabolism. Rather, IDH1 mitigated mitochondrial ROS in spheroids, and suppressing IDH1 reduced spheroid growth through a mechanism requiring mitochondrial ROS. Isotope tracing revealed that in spheroids, isocitrate/citrate produced reductively in the cytosol could enter the mitochondria and participate in oxidative metabolism, including oxidation by IDH2. This generates NADPH in the mitochondria, enabling cells to mitigate mitochondrial ROS and maximize growth. Neither IDH1 nor IDH2 was necessary for monolayer growth, but deleting either one enhanced mitochondrial ROS and reduced spheroid size, as did deletion of the mitochondrial citrate transporter protein. Together, the data indicate that adaptation to anchorage independence requires a fundamental change in citrate metabolism, initiated by IDH1-dependent reductive carboxylation and culminating in suppression of mitochondrial ROS.

575,38587078,"Fibroblast growth factor 15/19 (FGF15/19, mouse/human ortholog) is expressed in the ileal enterocytes of the small intestine and released postprandially in response to bile acid absorption. Previous reports of FGF15-/- mice have limited our understanding of gut-specific FGF15's role in metabolism. Therefore, we studied the role of endogenous gut-derived FGF15 in bile acid, cholesterol, glucose, and energy balance. We found that circulating levels of FGF19 were reduced in individuals with obesity and comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease. Gene expression analysis of ileal FGF15-positive cells revealed differential expression during the obesogenic state. We fed standard chow or a high-fat metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis-inducing diet to control and intestine-derived FGF15-knockout (FGF15INT-KO) mice. Control and FGF15INT-KO mice gained similar body weight and adiposity and did not show genotype-specific differences in glucose, mixed meal, pyruvate, and glycerol tolerance. FGF15INT-KO mice had increased systemic bile acid levels but decreased cholesterol levels, pointing to a primary role for gut-derived FGF15 in regulating bile acid and cholesterol metabolism when exposed to obesogenic diet. These studies show that intestinal FGF15 plays a specific role in bile acid and cholesterol metabolism regulation but is not essential for energy and glucose balance. "
576,27693377,"Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is the first known endocrine signal activated by protein restriction. Although FGF21 is robustly elevated in low-protein environments, increased FGF21 is also seen in various other contexts such as fasting, overfeeding, ketogenic diets, and high-carbohydrate diets, leaving its nutritional context and physiological role unresolved and controversial. Here, we use the Geometric Framework, a nutritional modeling platform, to help reconcile these apparently conflicting findings in mice confined to one of 25 diets that varied in protein, carbohydrate, and fat content. We show that FGF21 was elevated under low protein intakes and maximally when low protein was coupled with high carbohydrate intakes. Our results explain how elevation of FGF21 occurs both under starvation and hyperphagia, and show that the metabolic outcomes associated with elevated FGF21 depend on the nutritional context, differing according to whether the animal is in a state of under- or overfeeding.

577,31770545,"Secreted frizzled-related protein 5 (Sfrp5) has been shown to be associated with energy homeostasis and insulin resistance in mouse models of obesity and diabetes. However, its central role in glucose and lipid metabolism is unknown. HFD-fed rats received ICV infusions of vehicle or Sfrp5 during a pancreatic euglycemic clamp procedure. To delineate the pathway(s) by which ICV Sfrp5 modulates HGP and VLDL-TG secretion, we inhibited the hypothalamic K ICV Sfrp5 in HFD-fed rats significantly increased the glucose infusion required to maintain euglycemia due to HGP inhibition during the clamp procedure; moreover, hepatic PEPCK and G6Pase expression was decreased, and InsR and Akt phosphorylation was increased in the liver. ICV Sfrp5 also decreased circulating triglyceride levels via inhibiting hepatic VLDL-TG secretion. These changes were accompanied by the inhibition of enzymes related to lipogenesis in the liver. ICV Sfrp5 significantly increased insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of InsR and Akt in the hypothalamus of HFD-fed rats, and insulin-stimulated immunodetectable PIP3 levels were higher in Sfrp5 group than in control group both in vitro and vivo.

579,29942010,"Most tumor cells take up more glucose than normal cells. Splicing dysregulation is one of the molecular hallmarks of cancer. However, the role of splicing factor in glucose metabolism and tumor development remains poorly defined. Here, we show that upon glucose intake, the splicing factor SRSF5 is specifically induced through Tip60-mediated acetylation on K125, which antagonizes Smurf1-mediated ubiquitylation. SRSF5 promotes the alternative splicing of CCAR1 to produce CCAR1S proteins, which promote tumor growth by enhancing glucose consumption and acetyl-CoA production. Conversely, upon glucose starvation, SRSF5 is deacetylated by HDAC1, and ubiquitylated by Smurf1 on the same lysine, resulting in proteasomal degradation of SRSF5. The CCAR1L proteins accumulate to promote apoptosis. Importantly, SRSF5 is hyperacetylated and upregulated in human lung cancers, which correlates with increased CCAR1S expression and tumor progression. Thus, SRSF5 responds to high glucose to promote cancer development, and SRSF5-CCAR1 axis may be valuable targets for cancer therapeutics. "

581,37805583,"The current study explores the potential function and the underlying mechanisms of endothelial cell-derived R-spondin 3 (RSPO3) neuroprotection against ischemia/reperfusion-induced neuronal cell injury. In both neuronal cells (Neuro-2a) and primary murine cortical neurons, pretreatment with RSPO3 ameliorated oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)/re-oxygenation (OGD/R)-induced neuronal cell death and oxidative injury. In neurons RSPO3 activated the Akt, Erk and β-Catenin signaling cascade, but only Erk inhibitors reversed RSPO3-induced neuroprotection against OGD/R. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and neuronal cells, RSPO3-induced LGR4-Gab1-Gαi1/3 association was required for Erk activation, and either silencing or knockout of Gαi1 and Gαi3 abolished RSPO3-induced neuroprotection. In mice, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) increased RSPO3 expression and Erk activation in ischemic penumbra brain tissues. Endothelial knockdown or knockout of RSPO3 inhibited Erk activation in the ischemic penumbra brain tissues and increased MCAO-induced cerebral ischemic injury in mice. Conversely, endothelial overexpression of RSPO3 ameliorated MCAO-induced cerebral ischemic injury. We conclude that RSPO3 activates Gαi1/3-Erk signaling to protect neuronal cells from ischemia/reperfusion injury. "

583,37712288,"To fulfill their function, pancreatic beta cells require precise nutrient-sensing mechanisms that control insulin production. Transcription factor EB (TFEB) and its homolog TFE3 have emerged as crucial regulators of the adaptive response of cell metabolism to environmental cues. Here, we show that TFEB and TFE3 regulate beta-cell function and insulin gene expression in response to variations in nutrient availability. We found that nutrient deprivation in beta cells promoted TFEB/TFE3 activation, which resulted in suppression of insulin gene expression. TFEB overexpression was sufficient to inhibit insulin transcription, whereas beta cells depleted of both TFEB and TFE3 failed to suppress insulin gene expression in response to amino acid deprivation. Interestingly, ChIP-seq analysis showed binding of TFEB to super-enhancer regions that regulate insulin transcription. Conditional, beta-cell-specific, Tfeb-overexpressing, and Tfeb/Tfe3 double-KO mice showed severe alteration of insulin transcription, secretion, and glucose tolerance, indicating that TFEB and TFE3 are important physiological mediators of pancreatic function. Our findings reveal a nutrient-controlled transcriptional mechanism that regulates insulin production, thus playing a key role in glucose homeostasis at both cellular and organismal levels. "
584,25560321,"The strategies that control formation of the ventricular wall during heart development are not well understood. In previous studies, we documented IGF2 as a major mitogenic signal that controls ventricular cardiomyocyte proliferation and chamber wall expansion. Our objective in this study was to define the tissue source of IGF2 in heart development and the upstream pathways that control its expression. Using a number of mouse genetic tools, we confirm that the critical source of IGF2 is the epicardium. We find that epicardial Igf2 expression is controlled in a biphasic manner, first induced by erythropoietin and then regulated by oxygen and glucose with onset of placental function. Both processes are independently controlled by retinoic acid signalling. Our results demonstrate that ventricular wall cardiomyocyte proliferation is subdivided into distinct regulatory phases. Each involves instructive cues that originate outside the heart and thereby act on the epicardium in an endocrine manner, a mode of regulation that is mostly unknown in embryogenesis. "
585,12524443,"We have previously characterized an insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)-overexpressing beta-cell line. These beta-cells demonstrated elevated fractional insulin secretion and elevated cytosolic Ca(2+) levels compared with wild-type and vector controls. This effect of IRS-1 may be mediated via an interaction with the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA). Here we demonstrate that IRS-1 and IRS-2 localize to an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-enriched fraction in beta-cells using subcellular fractionation. We also observe co-localization of both IRS-1 and IRS-2 with ER marker proteins using immunofluorescent confocal microscopy. Furthermore, immuno-electron microscopy studies confirm that IRS-1 and SERCA3b localize to vesicles derived from the ER. In Chinese hamster ovary-T (CHO-T) cells transiently transfected with SERCA3b alone or together with IRS-1, SERCA3b co-immunoprecipitates with IRS-1. This interaction is enhanced with insulin treatment. SERCA3b also co-immunoprecipitates with IRS-1 in wild-type and IRS-1-overexpressing beta-cell lines. Ca(2+) uptake in ER-enriched fractions prepared from wild-type and IRS-1-overexpressing cell lines shows no significant difference, indicating that the previously observed decrease in Ca(2+) uptake by IRS-1-overexpressing cells is not the result of a defect in SERCA. Treatment of wild-type beta-cells with thapsigargin, an inhibitor of SERCA, resulted in an increase in glucose-stimulated fractional insulin secretion similar to that observed in IRS-1-overexpressing cells. The colocalization of IRS proteins and SERCA in the ER of beta-cells increases the likelihood that these proteins can interact with one another. Co-immunoprecipitation of IRS-1 and SERCA in CHO-T cells and beta-cells confirms that these proteins do indeed interact directly. Pharmacological inhibition of SERCA in beta-cells results in enhanced secretion of insulin. Taken together, our data suggest that interaction between IRS proteins and SERCA is an important regulatory step in insulin secretion. "

587,24967579,"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella) is one of the most significant food-borne pathogens affecting both humans and agriculture. We have determined that Salmonella encodes an uptake and utilization pathway specific for a novel nutrient, fructose-asparagine (F-Asn), which is essential for Salmonella fitness in the inflamed intestine (modeled using germ-free, streptomycin-treated, ex-germ-free with human microbiota, and IL10-/- mice). The locus encoding F-Asn utilization, fra, provides an advantage only if Salmonella can initiate inflammation and use tetrathionate as a terminal electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration (the fra phenotype is lost in Salmonella SPI1- SPI2- or ttrA mutants, respectively). The severe fitness defect of a Salmonella fra mutant suggests that F-Asn is the primary nutrient utilized by Salmonella in the inflamed intestine and that this system provides a valuable target for novel therapies.

588,35241836,"Transplantation of pancreatic islet cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells is a promising treatment for diabetes. Despite progress in the generation of stem-cell-derived islets (SC-islets), no detailed characterization of their functional properties has been conducted. Here, we generated functionally mature SC-islets using an optimized protocol and benchmarked them comprehensively against primary adult islets. Biphasic glucose-stimulated insulin secretion developed during in vitro maturation, associated with cytoarchitectural reorganization and the increasing presence of alpha cells. Electrophysiology, signaling and exocytosis of SC-islets were similar to those of adult islets. Glucose-responsive insulin secretion was achieved despite differences in glycolytic and mitochondrial glucose metabolism. Single-cell transcriptomics of SC-islets in vitro and throughout 6 months of engraftment in mice revealed a continuous maturation trajectory culminating in a transcriptional landscape closely resembling that of primary islets. Our thorough evaluation of SC-islet maturation highlights their advanced degree of functionality and supports their use in further efforts to understand and combat diabetes. "
589,26103964,"Saturated fatty acids are toxic to liver cells and are believed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. In experimental steatohepatitis induced by feeding mice a methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet, the degree of liver damage is related to dietary sugar content, which drives de novo lipogenesis and promotes the hepatic accumulation of saturated fatty acids. The objective of this study was to determine whether dietary palmitate exerts the same toxicity as carbohydrate-derived palmitate in the MCD model of fatty liver disease. We fed mice custom MCS and MCD formulas containing 4 different carbohydrate-fat combinations: starch-oleate, starch-palmitate, sucrose-oleate and sucrose-palmitate.  After 3 wk, we compared their metabolic and disease outcomes. Mice fed the custom MCD formulas developed varying degrees of hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis, in the order starch-oleate < starch-palmitate < sucrose-oleate < sucrose-palmitate. Liver injury correlated positively with the degree of hepatic lipid accumulation. Liver injury also correlated positively with the amount of palmitate in the liver, but the relationship was weak. Importantly, mice fed MCD starch-palmitate accumulated as much hepatic palmitate as mice fed MCD sucrose-oleate, yet their degree of liver injury was much lower. By contrast, mice fed MCD sucrose-palmitate developed severe liver injury, worse than that predicted by an additive influence of the two nutrients. In the MCD model of steatohepatitis, carbohydrate-derived palmitate in the liver is more hepatotoxic than dietary palmitate. Dietary palmitate becomes toxic when combined with dietary sugar in the MCD model, presumably by enhancing hepatic de novo lipogenesis. "

This study aimed to investigate the association between hepatokines and markers of endothelial dysfunction and vascular reactivity in obese adolescents. A total of 45 obese adolescents were categorized into three groups based on glucose tolerance: normal glucose tolerance (NGT), prediabetes (PD), and type 2 diabetes (T2D). We examined the relationships between FGF-21, fetuin-A, and chemerin with endothelial markers (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [PAI-1], intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1], and vascular cell adhesion marker-1 [VCAM-1]) and vascular surrogates (brachial artery reactivity testing [BART] and peak reactive hyperemia [PRH]). Obese adolescents (age 16.2±1.2 years; 62 % female, 65 % Hispanic) with NGT (n=20), PD (n=14), and T2D (n=11) had significant differences between groups in BMI; waist-hip ratio (p=0.05), systolic BP (p=0.008), LDL-C (p=0.02), PAI-1 (p<0.001).

Positive correlations were found between chemerin and both PAI-1 (r=0.6; p=0.05) and ICAM-1 (r=0.6; p=0.05), FGF-21 and PAI-1 (r=0.6; p<0.001), and fetuin-A with TNFα (r=-0.4; p=0.05). Negative correlations were found between chemerin and PRH (r= -0.5; p=0.017) and fetuin-A and PRH (r=-0.4; p=0.05). In our cohort, IR predicted higher FGF-21 levels suggesting a linear relationship may exist between the two parameters. Hepatokines can augment alterations in the microvascular milieu in obese adolescents as demonstrated by their associations with the markers PAI-1, ICAM-1, and PRH. "

Nurses' Health Study (1986-2010), Nurses' Health Study II (1991-2015), and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986-2014). 136 432 men and women aged 65 years or younger and free of diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, neurodegenerative disorders, gastric conditions, chronic kidney disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus before baseline. Weight change within a four year period. The final analyses included 46 722 women in the Nurses' Health Study, 67 186 women in the Nurses' Health Study II, and 22 524 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. On average, participants gained 1.5 kg (5th to 95th centile -6.8 to 10.0) every four years, amounting to 8.8 kg on average over 24 years. Among men and women, increases in glycemic index and glycemic load were positively associated with weight gain. For example, a 100 g/day increase in starch or added sugar was associated with 1.5 kg and 0.9 kg greater weight gain over four years, respectively, whereas a 10 g/day increase in fiber was associated with 0.8 kg less weight gain. Increased carbohydrate intake from whole grains (0.4 kg less weight gain per 100 g/day increase), fruit (1.6 kg less weight gain per 100 g/day increase), and non-starchy vegetables (3.0 kg less weight gain per 100 g/day increase) was inversely associated with weight gain, whereas increased intake from refined grains (0.8 kg more weight gain per 100 g/day increase) and starchy vegetables (peas, corn, and potatoes) (2.6 kg more weight gain per 100 g/day increase) was positively associated with weight gain. In substitution analyses, replacing refined grains, starchy vegetables, and sugar sweetened beverages with equal servings of whole grains, fruit, and non-starchy vegetables was associated with less weight gain. The magnitude of these associations was stronger among participants with overweight or obesity compared with those with normal weight (P<0.001 for interaction). Most of these associations were also stronger among women. The findings of this study highlight the potential importance of carbohydrate quality and source for long term weight management, especially for people with excessive body weight. Limiting added sugar, sugar sweetened beverages, refined grains, and starchy vegetables in favor of whole grains, fruit, and non-starchy vegetables may support efforts to control weight. "

593,30586434,"Dietary macronutrient composition alters metabolism through several mechanisms, including post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins. To connect diet and molecular changes, here we performed short- and long-term feeding of mice with standard chow diet (SCD) and high-fat diet (HFD), with or without glucose or fructose supplementation, and quantified liver metabolites, 861 proteins, and 1,815 protein level-corrected mitochondrial acetylation and succinylation sites. Nearly half the acylation sites were altered by at least one diet; nutrient-specific changes in protein acylation sometimes encompass entire pathways. Although acetyl-CoA is an intermediate in both sugar and fat metabolism, acetyl-CoA had a dichotomous fate depending on its source; chronic feeding of dietary sugars induced protein hyperacetylation, whereas the same duration of HFD did not. Instead, HFD resulted in citrate accumulation, anaplerotic metabolism of amino acids, and protein hypo-succinylation. Together, our results demonstrate novel connections between dietary macronutrients, protein post-translational modifications, and regulation of fuel selection in liver. "

Hence, we hypothesized that ectopic MYC expression perturbs the clock by deregulating E-box-driven components of the circadian network in cancer cells. We report here that deregulated expression of MYC or N-MYC disrupts the molecular clock in vitro by directly inducing REV-ERBα to dampen expression and oscillation of BMAL1, and this could be rescued by knockdown of REV-ERB. REV-ERBα expression predicts poor clinical outcome for N-MYC-driven human neuroblastomas that have diminished BMAL1 expression, and re-expression of ectopic BMAL1 in neuroblastoma cell lines suppresses their clonogenicity. Further, ectopic MYC profoundly alters oscillation of glucose metabolism and perturbs glutaminolysis. Our results demonstrate an unsuspected link between oncogenic transformation and circadian and metabolic dysrhythmia, which we surmise to be advantageous for cancer. "
595,16534190,"The purpose of this review article is to document from the literature values of blood/plasma glucose concentration and associated clinical signs and conditions in newborn infants (both term and preterm) that indicate a reasonable clinical probability that hypoglycemia is a proximate cause of acute and/or sustained neurological injury and to review the physiological and pathophysiological responses to hypoglycemia that may influence the ultimate outcome of newborns with low blood glucose. Our overall conclusion is that there is inadequate information in the literature to define any one value of glucose below which irreparable hypoglycemic injury to the central nervous system occurs, at any one time or for any defined period of time, in a population of infants or in any given infant. Clinical signs of prolonged and severe neurological disturbance (coma, seizures), extremely and persistently low plasma/blood glucose concentrations (0 to <1.0 mmol/l [0 to <18-20 mg/dl] for more than 1-2 h), and the absence of other obvious central nervous system (CNS) pathology (hypoxia-ischemia, intracranial hemorrhage, infection, etc.) are important for the diagnosis of injury due to glucose deficiency. Specific conditions, such as persistent hyperinsulinemia with severe hypoglycemic episodes that include seizures, also contribute to the diagnosis of hypoglycemic injury. Such lack of definitive measures of injury specific to glucose deficiency indicates that clinicians should be on the alert for infants at risk of hypoglycemia and for clinical signs and conditions that might herald severe hypoglycemia; they should have a low threshold for investigating and diagnosing 'hypoglycemia' with frequent measurements of plasma/blood glucose concentration; and they should treat low glucose concentrations promptly and maintain them in a safe range. Because there is no conclusive evidence or consensus in the literature that defines an absolute value or duration of 'hypoglycemia' that must occur, with our without related clinical complications, to produce neurological injury, clinicians should consider the information currently available, determine a 'target' plasma or blood glucose concentration that is acceptable, and treat infants with glucose concentrations below this value accordingly. Our intent in this review article is to highlight the studies relevant to this issue and help clinicians formulate a safe and, hopefully, effective strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of hypoglycemia.

596,23760753,"The present study is a Cross-Sectional Study and was conducted in Post-graduate department of Community Medicine, Govt. Medical College, Srinagar between Feb. 2012 and Jan. 2013. The sample size of 1,041 was estimated. The study was conducted to estimate the effect of relationship of salt iodine level and prevalence of goiter among women of reproductive age group in two districts of Kashmir valley, district Srinagar and district Ganderbal, which were selected randomly. A frame of the blocks and villages in the two districts and their population was formed. From each district 10% of the blocks were selected using simple random sampling. From each block, 5% of the villages were selected using simple random sampling. A door to door survey was conducted in the selected villages and all the women in the reproductive age group (15-49 years) identified and examined clinically for goiter after taking informed consent. Salt samples (one teaspoonful) from every household were taken and assessed for iodine content on spot and the iodine content of salt was assessed qualitatively by spot testing kits. The results of the present study have indicated that iodine deficiency continues to be a health problem. Almost the whole population consumes powdered salt but the storage and cooking practices diminish the iodine content of salt and results in decreased intake. Thus the need of the hour is to make people aware about proper storage and cooking practices. Women in the reproductive age group especially need to be made aware about the importance of consumption of adequately iodized salt because of the wide range of ill effects of iodine deficiency on the developing fetus and the growing child. In addition monitoring of iodine content of salt at distributor level should be done. "
597,32093791,"Nutritional ketosis, induced via either the classical ketogenic diet or the use of emulsified medium-chain triglycerides, is an established treatment for pharmaceutical resistant epilepsy in children and more recently in adults. In addition, the use of oral ketogenic compounds, fractionated coconut oil, very low carbohydrate intake, or ketone monoester supplementation has been reported to be potentially helpful in mild cognitive impairment, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autistic spectrum disorder. In these and other neurodegenerative and neuroprogressive disorders, there are detrimental effects of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation on neuronal function. However, they also adversely impact on neurone-glia interactions, disrupting the role of microglia and astrocytes in central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis. Astrocytes are the main site of CNS fatty acid oxidation; the resulting ketone bodies constitute an important source of oxidative fuel for neurones in an environment of glucose restriction. Importantly, the lactate shuttle between astrocytes and neurones is dependent on glycogenolysis and glycolysis, resulting from the fact that the astrocytic filopodia responsible for lactate release are too narrow to accommodate mitochondria. The entry into the CNS of ketone bodies and fatty acids, as a result of nutritional ketosis, has effects on the astrocytic glutamate-glutamine cycle, glutamate synthase activity, and on the function of vesicular glutamate transporters, EAAT, Na+, K+-ATPase, Kir4.1, aquaporin-4, Cx34 and KATP channels, as well as on astrogliosis. These mechanisms are detailed and it is suggested that they would tend to mitigate the changes seen in many neurodegenerative and neuroprogressive disorders. Hence, it is hypothesized that nutritional ketosis may have therapeutic applications in such disorders. "
598,36089123,"The UK Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL), announced in March 2016 and implemented in April 2018, is a fiscal policy to incentivise reformulation of eligible soft drinks. We aimed to explore perceptions of sugar, sugary drinks and the SDIL among adolescents in the UK post-implementation. 23 adolescents aged 11-14 years participated in four focus groups in 2018-2019. A semi-structured topic guide elicited relevant perspectives and included a group task to rank a selection of UK soft drinks based on their sugar content. Braun and Clarke's reflexive thematic analysis was used to undertake inductive analysis. Four main themes were present: 1) Sweetened drinks are bad for you, but some are worse than others; 2) Awareness of the SDIL and ambivalence towards it 3) The influence of drinks marketing: value, pricing, and branding; 4) Openness to population-level interventions. Young people had knowledge of the health implications of excess sugar consumption, which did not always translate to their own consumption. Ambivalence and a mixed awareness surrounding the SDIL was also present. Marketing and parental and school restriction influenced their consumption patterns, as did taste, enjoyment and consuming drinks for functional purposes (e.g., to give them energy). Openness to future population-level interventions to limit consumption was also present. Our findings suggest that adolescents are accepting of interventions that require little effort from young people in order to reduce their sugar consumption. Further education-based interventions are likely to be unhelpful, in contexts where adolescents understand the negative consequences of excess sugar and SSB consumption. "
599,37367531,"Elevated blood glucose following a meal is cleared by insulin-stimulated glucose entry into muscle and fat cells. The hormone increases the amount of the glucose transporter GLUT4 at the plasma membrane in these tissues at the expense of preformed intracellular pools. In addition, muscle contraction also increases glucose uptake via a gain in GLUT4 at the plasma membrane. Regulation of GLUT4 levels at the cell surface could arise from alterations in the rate of its exocytosis, endocytosis, or both. Hence, methods that can independently measure these traffic parameters for GLUT4 are essential to understanding the mechanism of regulation of membrane traffic of the transporter. Here, we describe cell population-based assays to measure the steady-state levels of GLUT4 at the cell surface, as well as to separately measure the rates of GLUT4 endocytosis and endocytosis. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

601,35446876,"Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, a major cause of kidney allograft dysfunction, has been linked to premature cellular senescence. The mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin protects from senescence in experimental models, but its antiproliferative properties have raised concern early after transplantation particularly at higher doses. Its effect on senescence has not been studied in kidney transplantation, yet. Rapamycin was applied to a rat kidney transplantation model (3 mg/kg bodyweight loading dose, 1.5 mg/kg bodyweight daily dose) for 7 days. Low Rapamycin trough levels (2.1-6.8 ng/mL) prevented the accumulation of p16INK4a positive cells in tubules, interstitium, and glomerula. Expression of the cytokines MCP-1, IL-1β, and TNF-α, defining the proinflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype, was abrogated. Infiltration with monocytes/macrophages and CD8+ T-lymphocytes was reduced and tubular function was preserved by Rapamycin. Inhibition of mTOR was not associated with impaired structural recovery, higher glucose levels, or weight loss. mTOR inhibition with low-dose Rapamycin in the immediate posttransplant period protected from premature cellular senescence without negative effects on structural and functional recovery from preservation/reperfusion damage, glucose homeostasis, and growth in a rat kidney transplantation model. Reduced senescence might maintain the renal regenerative capacity rendering resilience to future injuries resulting in protection from interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. "
602,25338001,"Irisin is a newly discovered myokine that links exercise with metabolic homeostasis. It is involved in modest weight loss and improves glucose intolerance. However, the direct effects and mechanisms of irisin on vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are not fully understood. In the current study, we demonstrated that irisin promoted Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cell (HUVEC) proliferation. It was further demonstrated that this pro-proliferation effect was mediated by irisin-induced activation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) signaling pathways. Inhibition of ERK signaling with U0126 decreased the pro-proliferation effect of irisin on HUVECs. It was also demonstrated that irisin reduced high glucose-induced apoptosis by up-regulating Bcl-2 expression and down-regulating Bax, Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 expression. In summary, these results suggested that irisin plays a novel role in sustaining endothelial homeostasis by promoting HUVEC proliferation via the ERK signaling pathway and protects the cell from high glucose-induced apoptosis by regulating Bcl-2,Bax and Caspase expression.

603,28453522,"Type-D personality, defined as a combination of high negative affect and high social isolation, has been associated with poor health outcomes. However, pathways underlying this association are largely unknown. We investigated the relationship between Type-D personality and several biological and behavioral pathways including the autonomic nervous system, the immune system, glucose regulation and sleep in a large, apparently healthy sample. Data from a total of 646 respondents (age 41.6±11.5, 12,2% women) were available for analysis. Persons with Type-D (negative affect and social isolation score ≥10) were contrasted with those without Type-D. Measures of plasma fibrinogen levels, white blood cell count, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), cholesterol, high-density and low-density lipoprotein, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), creatinine, triglycerides, and albumin were derived from fasting blood samples. Urine norepinephrine and free cortisol were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Time-domain heart rate variability (HRV) measures were calculated for the 24hr recording period and for nighttime separately. Persons with Type-D had higher HbA1c, FPG, and fibrinogen, and lower nighttime HRV than those without Type-D, suggesting worse glycemic control, systemic inflammation and poorer autonomic nervous system modulation in Type-D persons. In addition, those with Type-D reported less social support and greater sleep difficulties while no group differences were observed for alcohol and cigarette consumption, physical activity and body mass index. Findings provide some of the first evidence for multiple possible biological and behavioral pathways between Type-D personality and increased morbidity and mortality. "
604,28340340,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a worldwide epidemic with a medical need for additional targeted therapies. Suppression of hepatic glucose production (HGP) effectively ameliorates diabetes and can be exploited for its treatment. We hypothesized that targeting PGC-1α acetylation in the liver, a chemical modification known to inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis, could be potentially used for treatment of T2D. Thus, we designed a high-throughput chemical screen platform to quantify PGC-1α acetylation in cells and identified small molecules that increase PGC-1α acetylation, suppress gluconeogenic gene expression, and reduce glucose production in hepatocytes. On the basis of potency and bioavailability, we selected a small molecule, SR-18292, that reduces blood glucose, strongly increases hepatic insulin sensitivity, and improves glucose homeostasis in dietary and genetic mouse models of T2D. These studies have important implications for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of glucose metabolism and treatment of T2D. "

This is the first report of alpha coma (AC) caused by brain edema in a patient with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). A previously healthy 15-year-old girl was admitted to the intensive care unit due to altered state of consciousness during the course of treatment for DKA. Patient was in a coma, intubated and had tachycardia with poor peripheral perfusion. Results of laboratory analyses indicated severe DKA and computed tomography scan indicated diffuse brain edema. The EEG pattern showed uniform alpha activity. Treatment with intravenous fluids, insulin and mannitol was started. Patient`s state of consciousness gradually improved and on the third day she was extubated. On the fifth day, her neurologic status and EEG findings were completely normal with no residual neurological deficits. In conclusion, although AC is associated with a high fatality rate, favorable outcome can be achieved with prompt recognition and treatment of cerebral edema in pediatric patients with DKA. "
606,39472855,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its related complications are associated with schizophrenia. However, the relationship between antipsychotic medications (APs) and T2DM risk remains unclear. In this population-based, retrospective cohort study across the country, we investigated schizophrenia and the effect of APs on the risk of T2DM, and glucose homeostasis-related gene expression. We used information from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database of Taiwan for individuals newly diagnosed with schizophrenia (N = 4,606) and a disease-free control cohort (N = 4,606). The differences in rates of development of T2DM between the two cohorts were assessed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. The effects of APs on the expression of glucose homeostasis-related genes in liver and muscle cell lines were assessed using quantitative real-time PCR. After controlling potential associated confounding factors, the risk of T2DM was higher in the case group than that in the control group [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 1.80, p < 0.001]. Moreover, the likelihood of T2DM incidence in patients with schizophrenia without AP treatment (aHR, 2.83) was significantly higher than that in non-schizophrenia controls and those treated with APs (aHR ≤ 0.60). In an in vitro model, most APs did not affect the expression of hepatic gluconeogenesis genes but upregulated those beneficial for glucose homeostasis in muscle cells. This study demonstrates the impact of schizophrenia and APs and the risk of developing T2DM in Asian populations. Unmeasured confounding risk factors for T2DM may not have been included in the study. These findings may help psychiatric practitioners identify patients at risk of developing T2DM. "
607,29108736,"Few clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of oral sweet solutions for procedures in the emergency department (ED) have been published. To compare the efficacy of an oral sucrose solution vs. a placebo in reducing pain in infants undergoing venipuncture without cannulation. A randomized, double-blinded clinical trial was conducted in a pediatric ED. Infants 1 to 3 months old were randomly allocated to receive 2 mL of 88% sucrose or 2 mL of placebo, 2 min prior to venipuncture. The outcome measures were the difference in pain levels as assessed by the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability Pain Scale (FLACC) and Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) scores, crying time, and variations in heart rate. Eighty-two participants were recruited. Data were analyzed for 38 patients from each group (excluding protocol deviations). The mean difference in FLACC scores 1 min post venipuncture compared with baseline was 2.84 ± .64 (sucrose) vs. 2.71 ± .62 (placebo) (p = 0.98). For the NIPS score, it was 2.32 ± .47 (sucrose) vs. 1.63 ± .49 (placebo) (p = 0.60). The difference in the median crying time was not statistically significant between the two groups: 63.0 ± 3 (sucrose) vs. 48.5 ± 5 s (placebo) (p = 0.17). No significant difference was found in participants' heart rates 1 min post venipuncture compared with baseline: 33 ± 6 (sucrose) vs. 24 ± 5 beats per minute (placebo) (p = 0.44). In infants 1 to 3 months of age undergoing simple venipuncture, administration of an oral sweet solution did not statistically decrease pain scores, and participants' heart rate variations and crying time were not significantly changed.

609,27516634,"To determine whether sugar industry-related organizations influenced textual changes between the draft and final versions of the World Health Organization's (WHO's) 2015 guideline Sugars intake for adults and children. Stakeholder consultation submissions on the draft guideline from seven sugar industry-related and 10 public health organizations were assessed using the Wordscores program. Document scores were rescaled using the Martin-Vanberg transformation to improve comparability. Draft and final guidelines were compared to identify changes influenced by the sugar industry and public health organizations. There was a small shift in transformed Wordscores score between the draft and final guidelines, from 0.25 to 0.24, towards the industry position. The change was linked to increased use of the word ""low"" to describe the quality of the evidence, consistent with industry arguments. There was also a shift from use of the word ""consumption"" to ""intake"", irrespective of policy position. Scores for World Sugar Research Organisation and Sugar Nutrition UK submissions ( 0.11 and 0.18, respectively) represented strong pro-industry positions and scores for European Public Health Alliance and Wemos submissions (1.00 and 0.88, respectively) represented the strongest public health positions. Industry tactics included challenging the quality of the evidence, distinguishing between different types of sugar and advocating harm reduction. There was little change between draft and final versions of the WHO sugars intake guideline 2015, following industry consultation. The main change was linked to emphasizing the low quality of the evidence on sugar's adverse effects. Guideline development appeared relatively resistant to industry influence at the stakeholder consultation stage. Déterminer si les organisations liées au secteur sucrier ont influencé les modifications textuelles entre la version provisoire et la version finale de la directive de 2015 de l'Organisation mondiale de la Santé (OMS)  Les propositions issues de consultations avec les parties prenantes (7 organisations liées au secteur sucrier et 10 organismes de santé publique) au sujet de la version provisoire de la directive ont été évaluées à l'aide du programme Wordscores. Les scores des documents ont été réajustés suivant la procédure de transformation de Martin–Vanberg afin d'en améliorer la comparabilité. La version provisoire et la version finale de la directive ont été comparées afin de repérer les modifications influencées par l'industrie sucrière et les organismes de santé publique. On a observé un léger changement du score Wordscores transformé (de 0,25 à 0,24) entre la version provisoire et la version finale, en faveur de la position de l'industrie. Ce changement était lié à l'emploi plus fréquent du mot « mauvaise » pour décrire la qualité des éléments de preuve, ce qui concordait avec les arguments de l'industrie. Un autre changement concernait l'utilisation du mot « apport » au lieu de « consommation », indépendamment de la position politique. Les scores des propositions des organisations  Peu de changements ont été constatés entre la version provisoire et la version finale de la directive de 2015 de l'OMS sur l'apport en sucres suite à la consultation des organisations du secteur. Le principal changement concernait la mise en avant de la mauvaise qualité des preuves sur les effets néfastes du sucre. L'élaboration de la directive a relativement bien résisté à l'influence de l'industrie sucrière lors de la phase de consultation des parties prenantes. Determinar si las organizaciones relacionadas con la industria azucarera han influenciado en las modificaciones de texto entre el borrador y las versiones definitivas de la directriz  Se evaluaron las consultas de las partes interesadas sobre el borrador de la directriz enviadas por 7 organizaciones relacionadas con la industria azucarera y 10 organizaciones de salud pública utilizando el programa Wordscores. Los resultados del documento se clasificaron utilizando la transformación de Martin y Vanberg para mejorar la comparación. Se compararon el borrador y las directrices definitivas para identificar los cambios influenciados por la industria azucarera y las organizaciones de salud pública. Se detectó un ligero cambio en la puntuación de Wordscores transformada entre el borrador y las directrices definitivas, de 0,25 a 0,24 a favor de la industria. El cambio se relacionaba con el aumento del uso de la palabra “baja” para describir la calidad de la prueba, de forma coherente con los argumentos de la industria. También se encontró un cambio del uso de la palabra “consumo” a “ingesta”, independientemente de la postura política. Los resultados de la Organización Mundial de Investigación del Azúcar y Sugar Nutrition UK (0,11 y 0,18 respectivamente) representaron posturas muy favorables a la industria y los resultados de Alianza Europea de Salud Pública y Wemos (1,00 y 0,88 respectivamente) representaron las posturas más favorables a la salud pública. Entre las tácticas industriales se encontraban la obstaculización de la calidad de las pruebas, la distinción entre distintos tipos de azúcares y la defensa de la reducción de daños. Apenas se detectaron cambios entre el borrador y las versiones definitivas de la directriz sobre la ingesta de azúcares de 2015 de la OMS, tras la consulta a la industria. El principal cambio estaba relacionado con la enfatización de la escasa calidad de las pruebas sobre los efectos perjudiciales del azúcar. El desarrollo de la directriz se mostró relativamente resistente a la influencia de la industria en la etapa de consulta a las partes interesadas. تحديد ما إذا كانت المنظمات المرتبطة بصناعة السكر أثرت على التغييرات النصية بين المسودة والإصدارات النهائية للمبدأ التوجيهي الخاص بمنظمة الصحة العالمية لعام 2015 بشأن تناول السكريات للبالغين والأطفال. تم تقييم الطلبات المقدمة نتيجة التشاور مع الجهات المعنية عن مسودة المبدأ التوجيهي من 7 منظمات مرتبطة بصناعة السكر و10 منظمات صحية عامة باستخدام برنامج Wordscores. تمت إعادة صياغة نتائج المستندات باستخدام طريقة تحويل النصوص Martin–Vanberg لتحسين إمكانية المقارنة. وتمت مقارنة المسودة والإصدار النهائي من المبادئ التوجيهية للتعرّف على التغييرات المتأثرة من جانب صناعة السكر ومنظمات الصحة العامة. كان هناك تغيير طفيف في نتائج Wordscores  كان هناك تغيير طفيف بين المسودة والإصدارات النهائية للمبدأ التوجيهي الصادر عن منظمة الصحة العالمية عام 2015 بشأن تناول السكريات، وذلك في أعقاب المشاورات مع القائمين على الصناعة. كان التغيير الأساسي مرتبطًا بالتأكيد على تدني الجودة النوعية للأدلة المتعلقة بالآثار السلبية للسكر. وبدا أن عملية إعداد المبادئ التوجيهية مقاومة نسبيًا لتأثير القائمين على الصناعة في مرحلة التشاور مع الجهات المعنية. 旨在明确制糖业相关组织是否在世界卫生组织 (WHO) 2015 年度《成人和儿童糖摄入量指南》的草案到定稿期间影响文本更改。. 我们使用 Wordscores 程序评估了 7 家制糖业相关组织和 10 家公共卫生组织对指南草案的利益相关方协商意见书，并且采用 Martin–Vanberg 转换法重新调整了文档匹配度，以期提高可比性。对指南草案和定稿进行了比较，进而确定受制糖业和公共卫生组织影响的变更。. 转换后的指南草案和定稿的 Wordscores 匹配度有些变化，其行业地位从 0.25 变为 0.24。 该变化与为了描述证据质量而增加使用“低”字有关，这与行业论点一致。另一个转变为从“消耗”一词转为“摄入”，不论在何种政策主张下。世界糖业研究组织 (World Sugar Research Organisation) 和英国糖营养协会 (Sugar Nutrition UK) 意见书的匹配度（分别为 0.11 和 0.18）代表较为靠前的行业地位，欧洲公共卫生联盟 (European Public Health Alliance) 和 Wemos 意见书的匹配度（分别为 1.00 和 0.88）代表最高的公共卫生行业地位。行业策略包括验证证据质量、区分不同糖种类和倡导降低危害。. 经行业协商后， 2015 年世界卫生组织糖摄入量指南的草案和定稿之间基本没有变更。主要变化是为了强调关于糖的不良影响的证据质量很差。在利益相关方协商阶段，指南的编制基本表现出不受行业影响。. Определить, оказали ли влияние организации, связанные с сахарной промышленностью, на текстуальные различия между черновым и окончательным вариантом руководящих принципов Всемирной организации здравоохранения Sugars intake for adults and children (Использование сахаров взрослыми и детьми) 2015 года. С помощью программы Wordscores была осуществлена оценка представлений, направленных после консультации с заинтересованными лицами по черновому варианту руководящих принципов. Представления были направлены от 7 организаций, связанных с сахарной промышленностью, и 10 организаций общественного здравоохранения. Показатели анализа документов были нормализованы с помощью преобразования Мартина-Ванберга для улучшения сопоставимости. Черновой и окончательный варианты руководства сравнили для того, чтобы определить, какие изменения были вызваны организациями сахарной промышленности и общественного здравоохранения. Черновой и окончательный варианты руководства незначительно изменились в плане результатов анализа Wordscores, подвергнутых преобразованию, — с 0,25 до 0,24 в сторону сближения с позицией представителей сахарной промышленности. Это изменение было связано с увеличением употребления слова «low» (низкий) для описания качества фактических данных, приводимых против доводов представителей промышленности. Также слово «consumption» (потребление) было заменено словом «intake» (использование) сторонниками обеих позиций по политике. Судя по показателям оценки представлений, Всемирная организация исследования сахара и Sugar Nutrition UK были наиболее убежденными сторонниками позиции сахарной промышленности (0,11 и 0,18 соответственно), а позиции общественного здравоохранения сильнее других поддерживали Европейский альянс общественного здравоохранения и Wemos (1,00 и 0,88 соответственно). Тактика представителей промышленности включала оспаривание качества фактических данных, проведение различения между видами сахара и пропагандирование мер по снижению вреда. Различия, возникшие в результате консультации представителей промышленности, между черновым и оригинальным вариантами руководства Всемирной организации здравоохранения 2015 года, касающимися потребления сахаров, были незначительными. Основное изменение было связано с усилением акцента на низком качестве фактических данных, подтверждающих неблагоприятное действие сахара. Процесс разработки руководства оказался относительно устойчивым к влиянию промышленности на этапе консультации с заинтересованными лицами. "
610,22129639,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) currently affects 20%-30% of adults and 10% of children in industrialized countries, and its prevalence is increasing worldwide. Although NAFLD is a benign form of liver dysfunction, it can proceed to a more serious condition, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD is accompanied by obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus, and evidence suggests that fructose, a major caloric sweetener in the diet, plays a significant role in its pathogenesis. Inflammatory progression to NASH is proposed to occur by a two-hit process. The first ""hit"" is hepatic fat accumulation owing to increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis, inhibition of fatty acid beta oxidation, impaired triglyceride clearance and decreased very-low-density lipoprotein export. The mechanisms of the second ""hit"" are still largely unknown, but recent studies suggest several possibilities, including inflammation caused by oxidative stress associated with lipid peroxidation, cytokine activation, nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, and endogenous toxins of fructose metabolites.

611,2508054,"Renal calcifications have been described in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants, and diuretic drug-associated hypercalciuria is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of this lesion. Hyperoxaluria is an important cause of renal stone formation in children and adults. Because parenteral nutrition solutions contain the oxalate precursors ascorbate and glycine, the relationship between total parenteral nutrition administration and oxalate excretion in VLBW infants was examined. Administration of approximately 0.5 g of total parenteral nutrition protein per kilogram per day to VLBW infants was associated with an increased urinary oxalate concentration and an increased urinary oxalate to creatinine ratio, when compared with VLBW infants receiving a glucose and electrolyte solution. A further increase in urinary oxalate concentration and oxalate to creatinine ratio was noted when total parenteral nutrition protein was increased to approximately 1.5 g of protein per kilogram per day. In VLBW infants who receive total parenteral nutrition, elevated urinary oxalate concentrations may develop and may be a factor in the pathogenesis of nephrocalcinosis in these infants. "
612,12403226,"Persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI) is the most common cause of recurrent or persistent hypoglycemia in early childhood. Conventionally, pancreatectomy (Px) has often been recommended to control hypoglycemia. However, PHHI can be managed successfully by intensive medical treatment to avoid pancreatectomy. Data from 10 infants (8M, 2F) with PHHI were retrospectively analyzed. Eight patients (80%) developed symptoms within 72 hours after birth (early-onset). Six patients (60%) underwent 85 per cent-95 per cent Px due to failure of medical treatment. Two patients who underwent less than 95 per cent Px required second Px (97% and 99%). One patient developed permanent diabetes mellitus and malabsorption. Hypoglycemia could be successfully managed by medication alone in four patients (40%). Of these, three patients had early-onset neonatal hypoglycemia. Medication could be discontinued in three patients (75%). Three of ten patients (30%) had delayed development. Pancreatectomies and/or the diagnosis of PHHI were made late for these patients. One of these three children also developed epilepsy. Patients with PHHI frequently require pancreatectomy which commonly results in long-term complications especially diabetes mellitus and malabsorption. Our data suggest that PHHI can be managed successfully with an intensive medical regimen even in patients with early-onset hypoglycemia. Although medical management is very laborious for the family and physician, it should be applied until euglycemia is accomplished. Moreover, the early diagnosis of PHHI and the successful hypoglycemic control are very necessary to prevent permanent neurologic sequelae. "

In the studies reported here, the impact of EtOH on biologic and hormonal parameters of puberty was assessed in female rats. Rats were fed a liquid diet containing EtOH, pair fed an identical liquid diet containing dextrimaltose instead of EtOH, or fed a liquid diet not containing EtOH ad libitum. Feeding was started at 21, 25, or 28 d of age. EtOH markedly delayed the age at vaginal opening (34.5 +/- 0.5 d in controls vs 48.5 +/- 2.4 d in EtOH animals; p < 0.001), delayed the age at first estrous (40.9 +/- 0.6 d in controls vs 61.2 +/- 2.6 d in EtOH animals; p < 0.001), increased the length of the estrous cycle, and decreased the number of proestrous days. EtOH, concomitant with reduced ovarian and uterine weight, decreased serum estradiol and progesterone. Associated with these changes in ovarian hormones there was a selective increase in follicle-stimulating hormone, but not luteinizing hormone. EtOH consistently reduced insulin-like growth factor-1. In general, EtOH-induced disruption was more severe the younger the animals were at the start of feeding. Opiate receptor blockade with naltrexone completely prevented the EtOH-induced delay in vaginal opening. The impact of EtOH on female puberty is dramatic, is an emerging public health problem, and deserves more study. "
614,23782592,"Iodine deficiency during pregnancy and lactation may adversely affect fetal and infant development. Two initiatives were introduced in New Zealand to prevent deficiency: (1) mandatory fortification of bread with iodised salt; and (2) provision of a subsidised iodine supplement (150 μg) for all pregnant and breastfeeding women. The aim of this study was to assess iodine intake and status among a self-selecting sample of pregnant and lactating women in Palmerston North, both before and after the two initiatives. Pregnant and breastfeeding women were recruited before (n = 25 and 32; 2009) and after (n = 34 and 36; 2011) the initiatives. Iodine concentration was determined in 24-h urine and breast milk samples using inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Use of supplements and salt, knowledge of iodine deficiency, and awareness of the initiatives were determined by questionnaire. Median urine iodine concentration (UIC) was higher in 2011 compared with 2009 for both pregnant (85 and 47 μg L(-1) ) and breastfeeding (74 and 34 μg L(-1) ) participants; median UIC were below the cut-offs for adequate iodine status. However, in 2011, the estimated daily iodine intake during pregnancy was 217 μg day(-1) ; 74% of women achieved the Estimated Average Requirement. Knowledge of the initiatives was low, only 28-56% were aware of the need for iodine supplements and only 15-22% were aware of the mandatory addition of iodised salt to bread. Despite initiatives, UIC of these women indicates iodine deficiency, however, dietary intakes appear adequate. Ongoing surveillance of supplement use and iodine status among pregnant and lactating women throughout New Zealand is needed to fully assess the efficacy of the initiatives. Alternative strategies may require evaluation to ensure all women have adequate iodine during pregnancy and breastfeeding. "
615,28813010,"Preschool Mexican children consume 7% of their total energy intake from processed breakfast cereals. This study characterized the nutritional quality and labelling (claims and Guideline Daily Amount (GDA)) of the packaged breakfast cereals available in the Mexican market. Photographs of all breakfast cereals available in the 9 main food retail chains in the country were taken. The nutrition quality of cereals was assessed using the United Kingdom Nutrient Profiling Model (UKNPM). Claims were classified using the International Network for Food and Obesity/non-communicable Diseases Research, Monitoring and Action Support (INFORMAS) taxonomy and the GDA was defined according to the Mexican regulation, NOM-051. Overall, a total of 371 different breakfast cereals were analysed. The nutritional profile showed that 68.7% were classified as ""less healthy"". GDAs and claims were displayed more frequently on the ""less healthy"" cereals. Breakfast cereals within the ""less healthy"" category had significantly higher content of energy, sugar and sodium ( "
616,22894778,"Morbidity from allergic diseases is increasing. Basophils play a critical role in systemic anaphylaxis and chronic allergic inflammation. The prenatal environment must be regarded as a possible early risk factor for allergic diseases in children. Our objective was to determine if basophils harvested from neonates genetically predisposed to atopic disease had different levels of CD63 expression and IL-4 release properties in response to various stimuli (peptidoglycan, Dermatophagoides farinae, hyperosmotic mannitol). Blood samples were collected from 16 asthmatic and 18 healthy women and their newborns. Peripheral blood basophil histamine was measured using the human basophil degranulation test (HBDT), whereas activation was assessed by flow cytometric measurement of CD63 expression on the cord blood basophil surface. IL-4 levels were quantified by ELISA following allergen stimulation. The basophil degranulation index (DI) in granulocytes harvested from the peripheral blood of asthmatic women was assessed following stimulation with peptidoglycan (PGN), Dermatophagoides farinae (Df ) extract, or hyperosmotic mannitol. The DI was significantly higher in atopic women than in healthy controls. Upregulation of CD63 on the cord blood basophil surface was also detected in response to these stimuli. Basophils purified from the cord blood of neonates born to atopic mothers produced more IL-4 compared to basophils purified from the controls. These data suggested that various stimuli play a role in augmenting allergic reactions via modulation of activated basophil cytokine secretion. It may require new methods to stabilize the basophils in allergic diseases. "
617,34169513,"Many studies show that glucose metabolism in epileptic brain areas can be impaired. Energy is crucial to maintain normal brain function, including ion and neurotransmitter balances. Energy deficits can lead to disruption of ion gradients, which can trigger neuronal depolarization and generation of seizures. Thus, perturbed metabolic processing of glucose in epileptogenic brain areas indicates a specific nutritional need for people and animals with epilepsy, as they are likely to benefit from auxiliary brain fuels other than glucose. Ketogenic diets provide the ketone bodies acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate, which can be used as auxiliary fuel by the brain. In approximately 50% children and adults with certain types of epilepsy, who can tolerate and maintain these dietary regimens, seizure frequency can be effectively reduced. More recent data demonstrate that addition of medium chain triglycerides (MCTs), which provide the medium chain fatty acids octanoic and decanoic acid, as well as ketone bodies as auxiliary brain energy, can be beneficial in rodent seizure models, and dogs and humans with epilepsy. Here, this evidence is reviewed, including tolerance in 65% of humans, efficacy studies in dogs, possible anticonvulsant mechanisms of actions of MCTs, and specifically decanoic acid as well as metabolic and antioxidant mechanisms. In conclusion, MCTs are a promising adjunct to standard pharmacological treatment for both humans and dogs with epilepsy, as they lack central nervous system side effects found with current antiepileptic drugs. There is now a need for larger clinical trials in children, adults, and dogs to find the ideal composition and doses of MCTs and the types of epilepsy that respond best. "
618,37285600,"Elevated fasting free fatty acids (FFAs) and fasting glucose are additively associated with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and decreased β-cell function [quantified as disposition index (DI)]. We sought to examine how changes in fasting FFA and glucose alter islet function. We studied 10 subjects with normal fasting glucose (NFG) and normal glucose tolerance (NGT) on two occasions. On one occasion, Intralipid and glucose were infused overnight to mimic conditions present in IFG/IGT. In addition, we studied seven subjects with IFG/IGT on two occasions. On one occasion, insulin was infused to lower overnight FFA and glucose concentrations to those observed in people with NFG/NGT. The following morning, a labeled mixed meal was used to measure postprandial glucose metabolism and β-cell function. Elevation of overnight fasting FFA and glucose in NFG/NGT did not alter peak or integrated glucose concentrations (2.0 ± 0.1 vs. 2.0 ± 0.1 Mol per 5 h, Saline vs. Intralipid/glucose,  "
619,33091446,"Glucose metabolism enzymes and transporters play major role in cancer development and metastasis. In this study, we discuss glucose metabolism, transporters, receptors, hormones, oncogenes and tumor suppressors which interact with glucose metabolism and we try to discuss their major role in cancer development and cancer metabolism. We try to highlight the. Metabolic changes in cancer and metastasis upregulation of glycolysis is observed in many primary and metastatic cancers and aerobic glycolysis is the most favorable mechanism for glucose metabolism in cancer cells, and it is a kind of evolutionary change. The question that is posed at this juncture is: Can we use aerobic glycolysis phenotype and enzymes beyond this mechanism in estimating cancer prognosis and metastasis? Lactate is a metabolite of glucose metabolism and it is a key player in cancer and metastasis in both normoxic and hypoxic condition so lactate dehydrogenase can be a good prognostic biomarker. Furthermore, monocarboxylic transporter which is the main lactate transporter can be good target in therapeutic studies. Glycolysis enzymes are valuable enzymes in cancer and metastasis diagnosis and can be used as therapeutic targets in cancer treatment. Designing a diagnostic and prognostic profile for cancer metastasis seems to be possible base on glycolysis enzymes and glucose transporters. Also, glucose metabolism enzymes and agents can give us a clear vision in estimating cancer metastasis. We can promote a panel of genes that detect genetic changes in glucose metabolism agents to diagnose cancer metastasis. "
620,34658253,"Type 2 diabetes is a disease characterized by impaired insulin secretion and defective glucagon suppression in the postprandial period. We examined the effect of impaired glucagon suppression on glucose concentrations and endogenous glucose production (EGP) at different degrees of insulin secretory impairment. The contribution of anthropometric characteristics, peripheral, and hepatic insulin action to this variability was also examined. To do so, we studied 54 nondiabetic subjects on two occasions in which endogenous hormone secretion was inhibited by somatostatin, with glucagon infused at a rate of 0.65 ng/kg/min, at 0 min to prevent a fall in glucagon (nonsuppressed day) or at 120 min to create a transient fall in glucagon (suppressed day). Subjects received glucose (labeled with [3- "
621,29149910,"Iron deficiency anemia is a common finding in women of child-bearing age. Pica, or the ingestion of non-food or non-nutritive items, is a well-known manifestation of iron deficiency. A high sodium diet increases risk for nephrolithiasis. We describe the case of a 31-year-old woman with recurrent calcium nephrolithiasis and anemia who ate ice chips as well as spoons of salt daily. Treatment of pica may prove effective in preventing recurrent nephrolithiasis. A 31-year-old white woman with a past medical history of menorrhagia, anemia, and recurrent calcium nephrolithiasis presented for preoperative evaluation prior to ureterolithotomy. She described a daily pattern of eating continually from a cup of ice chips accompanied by multiple spoons of salt directly out of a salt shaker. These cravings had been present for many years, were bothersome to her, and interfered with her daily life. Laboratory findings revealed hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dL with ferritin of 3 ng/mL. History, physical, and laboratory data were consistent with pica secondary to iron deficiency anemia. She was prescribed orally administered ferrous sulfate 325 mg three times a day with meals. She continues to struggle with the symptoms of pica and orally administered supplementation. It is important that clinicians consider the possible diagnosis of sodium chloride pica in patients with iron deficiency anemia and recurrent nephrolithiasis. Treatment of anemia and resolution of pica may prove effective in preventing future nephrolithiasis. Specific questioning about pica symptoms in patients with iron deficiency anemia and recurrent nephrolithiasis may be helpful diagnostically and therapeutically. "
622,30951171,"The transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) is a key mediator in the insulin signaling pathway and controls multiple physiological functions, including hepatic glucose production (HGP) and pancreatic β-cell function. We previously demonstrated that S256 in human FOXO1 (FOXO1-S256), equivalent to S253 in mouse FoxO1 (FoxO1-S253), is a key phosphorylation site mediating the effect of insulin as a target of protein kinase B on suppression of FOXO1 activity and expression of target genes responsible for gluconeogenesis. Here, we investigated the role of FoxO1-S253 phosphorylation in control of glucose homeostasis in vivo by generating global FoxO1-S253A/A knockin mice, in which FoxO1-S253 alleles were replaced with alanine (A substitution) blocking FoxO1-S253 phosphorylation. FoxO1-S253A/A mice displayed mild increases in feeding blood glucose and insulin levels but decreases in fasting blood glucose and glucagon concentrations, as well as a reduction in the ratio of pancreatic α-cells/β-cells per islet. FoxO1-S253A/A mice exhibited a slight increase in energy expenditure but barely altered food intake and glucose uptake among tissues. Further analyses revealed that FoxO1-S253A/A enhances FoxO1 nuclear localization and promotes the effect of glucagon on HGP. We conclude that dephosphorylation of S253 in FoxO1 may reflect a molecular basis of pancreatic plasticity during the development of insulin resistance. "
623,30472805,"Plasma-Lyte 148® is a balanced, crystalloid intravenous (IV) fluid which is both calcium-free and isotonic. It prevents the hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and iatrogenic hyponatremia seen with use of 0.9% sodium chloride and hypotonic solutions, respectively. However, data on compatibility with commonly used drugs are lacking. To investigate the stability of Plasma-Lyte 148® and Plasma-Lyte 148® + 5% Glucose with eight commonly used therapeutic agents when compared with 5% glucose and 0.9% sodium chloride as diluents. We aimed to provide vital data which may facilitate the introduction of what appears to be a safer and more economic fluid. Plasma-Lyte 148® and Plasma-Lyte 148® + 5% Glucose were mixed with morphine, midazolam, fentanyl, ketamine, clonidine, aminophylline, salbutamol, and furosemide at set concentrations. Comparisons were made to 0.9% sodium chloride and 5% glucose fluid controls. Six repeats of each IV fluid and drug admixture were analyzed through high-performance liquid chromatography at three time points: 0, 2, and 24 hours. A concentration change of <5% was defined as chemically stable. Physical stability was assessed by observation of precipitate formation or color change. pH changes were measured using a Fisherbrand Hydrus 300 pH meter. Relative to starting concentration, all drugs except midazolam were stable to ±3%. All examined therapeutic agents were chemically stable at 2 and 24 hours relative to control solutions. No precipitate formed in any of the samples. All Plasma-Lyte 148® and Plasma-Lyte 148® + 5% Glucose drug admixtures remained in a safe, peripheral administration pH range of 5-9 and were closer to the pH of blood than standard fluid-drug admixtures. Morphine, fentanyl, ketamine, salbutamol, aminophylline, and clonidine are stable for 24 hours when mixed with Plasma-Lyte 148® and Plasma-Lyte 148®+5% Glucose for administration at concentrations equivalent to those found at a typical Y-site with maintenance fluid. Furosemide is stable at lower concentrations than those seen at a Y-site, but midazolam displayed instability. "
624,37660168,"MAVS is an adapter protein involved in RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling in mitochondria, peroxisomes, and mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs). However, the role of MAVS in glucose metabolism and RLR signaling cross-regulation and how these signaling pathways are coordinated among these organelles have not been defined. This study reports that RLR action drives a switch from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) through MAVS. We show that peroxisomal MAVS is responsible for glucose flux shift into PPP and type III interferon (IFN) expression, whereas MAMs-located MAVS is responsible for glucose flux shift into HBP and type I IFN expression. Mechanistically, peroxisomal MAVS interacts with G6PD and the MAVS signalosome forms at peroxisomes by recruiting TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1). By contrast, MAMs-located MAVS interact with glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase, and the MAVS signalosome forms at MAMs by recruiting TRAF6 and TRAF2. Our findings suggest that MAVS mediates the interaction of RLR signaling and glucose metabolism. "
625,23823479,"Glucagon-like peptides (GLP-1/GLP-2) are coproduced and highlighted as key modulators to improve glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity after bariatric surgery. However, it is unknown if CNS GLP-2 plays any physiological role in the control of glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. We show that mice lacking GLP-2 receptor (GLP-2R) in POMC neurons display glucose intolerance and hepatic insulin resistance. GLP-2R activation in POMC neurons is required for GLP-2 to enhance insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production (HGP) and gluconeogenesis. GLP-2 directly modulates excitability of POMC neurons in GLP-2R- and PI3K-dependent manners. GLP-2 initiates GLP-2R-p85α interaction and facilitates PI3K-Akt-dependent FoxO1 nuclear exclusion in POMC neurons. Central GLP-2 suppresses basal HGP and enhances insulin sensitivity, which are abolished in POMC-p110α KO mice. Thus, CNS GLP-2 plays a key physiological role in the control of HGP through activating PI3K-dependent modulation of membrane excitability and nuclear transcription of POMC neurons in the brain. "
626,18708173,"Pancreatic Derived Factor (PANDER) is a novel cytokine-like protein dominantly expressed within the endocrine pancreas. Our previous study demonstrated that the PANDER promoter was both tissue-specific and glucose-responsive. Surrounding the PANDER transcriptional start site are several putative A- and E-Box elements that may bind to the various pancreatic transcriptional factors of MafA, BETA2/NeuroD, and Pancreatic Duodenal Homeobox-1 (PDX-1). To characterize the transcriptional regulatory factors involved in PANDER gene expression, we performed co-transfection reporter gene analysis and demonstrated upregulation by all three transcription factors, with the greatest individual increase stemming from PDX-1. Potential binding of PDX-1 to A box (TAAT) regions of the PANDER promoter was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and further corroborated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Binding of PDX-1 to the A box regions was inhibited by mutagenized (TAGT) oligonucleotides. Site-directed mutagenesis of the three PDX-1 A box binding motifs revealed that A box sites 2 and 3 in combination were critical for maximal gene expression and deletion resulted in a 82% reduction in promoter activity. Furthermore, deletion of A box sites 2 and 3 completely diminished the glucose-responsiveness of the PANDER promoter. Our findings demonstrate that PANDER is a potential PDX-1 target gene and the A box sites within the promoter region are critical for basal and glucose-stimulated PANDER expression. "
627,36834778,"Glioblastoma cells adapt to changes in glucose availability through metabolic plasticity allowing for cell survival and continued progression in low-glucose concentrations. However, the regulatory cytokine networks that govern the ability to survive in glucose-starved conditions are not fully defined. In the present study, we define a critical role for the IL-11/IL-11Rα signalling axis in glioblastoma survival, proliferation and invasion when cells are starved of glucose. We identified enhanced IL-11/IL-11Rα expression correlated with reduced overall survival in glioblastoma patients. Glioblastoma cell lines over-expressing IL-11Rα displayed greater survival, proliferation, migration and invasion in glucose-free conditions compared to their low-IL-11Rα-expressing counterparts, while knockdown of IL-11Rα reversed these pro-tumorigenic characteristics. In addition, these IL-11Rα-over-expressing cells displayed enhanced glutamine oxidation and glutamate production compared to their low-IL-11Rα-expressing counterparts, while knockdown of IL-11Rα or the pharmacological inhibition of several members of the glutaminolysis pathway resulted in reduced survival (enhanced apoptosis) and reduced migration and invasion. Furthermore, IL-11Rα expression in glioblastoma patient samples correlated with enhanced gene expression of the glutaminolysis pathway genes GLUD1, GSS and c-Myc. Overall, our study identified that the IL-11/IL-11Rα pathway promotes glioblastoma cell survival and enhances cell migration and invasion in environments of glucose starvation via glutaminolysis. "
628,32474930,"Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD-Ia) is an inherited metabolic disease caused by a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphatase-α (G6Pase-α or G6PC) which plays a critical role in blood glucose homeostasis by catalyzing the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to glucose and phosphate in the terminal step of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Patients with GSD-Ia manifest life-threatening fasting hypoglycemia along with the excessive accumulation of hepatic glycogen and triglycerides which results in hepatomegaly and a risk of long-term complications such as hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma (HCA/HCC). The etiology of HCA/HCC development in GSD-Ia, however, is unknown. Recent studies have shown that the livers in model animals of GSD-Ia display impairment of autophagy, a cellular recycling process which is critical for energy metabolism and cellular homeostasis. However, molecular mechanisms of autophagy impairment and its involvement in pathogenesis in GSD-Ia are still under investigation. Here, we summarize the latest advances for signaling pathways implicated in hepatic autophagy impairment and the roles of autophagy in hepatic tumorigenesis in GSD-Ia. In addition, recent evidence has illustrated that autophagy plays an important role in hepatic metabolism and liver-directed gene therapy mediated by recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV). Therefore, we highlight the possible role of hepatic autophagy in metabolic control and rAAV-mediated gene therapy for GSD-Ia. In this review, we also provide potential therapeutic strategies for GSD-Ia on the basis of molecular mechanisms underlying hepatic autophagy impairment in GSD-Ia. "
629,23248173,"Protection and restoration of a functional β-cell mass are fundamental strategies for prevention and treatment of diabetes. Consequently, knowledge of signals that determine the functional β-cell mass is of immense clinical relevance. Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) superfamily signaling pathways play a critical role in development and tissue specification. Nevertheless, the role of these pathways in adult β-cell homeostasis is not well defined. Here, we ablated TGFβ receptor I and II genes in mice undergoing two surgical β-cell replication models (partial pancreatectomy or partial duct ligation), representing two triggers for β-cell proliferation, increased β-cell workload and local inflammation, respectively. Our data suggest that TGFβ receptor signaling is necessary for baseline β-cell proliferation. By either provision of excess glucose or treatment with exogenous insulin, we further demonstrated that inflammation and increased β-cell workload are both stimulants for β-cell proliferation but are TGFβ receptor signaling dependent and independent, respectively. Collectively, by using a pancreas-specific TGFβ receptor-deleted mouse model, we have identified two distinct pathways that regulate adult β-cell proliferation. Our study thus provides important information for understanding β-cell proliferation during normal growth and in pancreatic diseases. "
630,28830979,"Despite the fact that skeletal muscle insulin resistance is the hallmark of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), inflexibility in substrate energy metabolism has been observed in other tissues such as liver, adipose tissue, and heart. In the heart, structural and functional changes ultimately lead to diabetic cardiomyopathy. However, little is known about the early biochemical changes that cause cardiac metabolic dysregulation and dysfunction. We used a dietary model of fructose-induced T2DM (10% fructose in drinking water for 6 weeks) to study cardiac fatty acid metabolism in early T2DM and related signaling events in order to better understand mechanisms of disease. In early type-2 diabetic hearts, flux through the fatty acid oxidation pathway was increased as a result of increased cellular uptake (CD36), mitochondrial uptake (CPT1B), as well as increased  "
631,7965433,"Because factors that predispose infants to persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) may cause oxidant stress, which in turn may increase demands for cysteine and glutathione, we investigated the availability of cysteine and its precursors in PPHN and related disorders. Plasma concentrations of four sulfur-containing and two non-sulfur-containing amino acids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in blood from infants with PPHN, both those managed conventionally (PPHN group) and those treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, as well as from infants with hyaline membrane disease. Concentrations also were measured in umbilical venous cord blood samples from a healthy control population, in venous plasma from infants receiving only intravenously administered glucose-containing solutions because they had noncardiopulmonary illnesses (""fasted"" group), and from otherwise healthy, orally fed infants (""fed"" group). The plasma total cyst(e)ine concentration was markedly lower in the three groups (PPHN, PPHN and extracorpeal membrane oxygenation, and hyaline membrane disease) receiving an elevated inspired oxygen concentration (0.6 to 1.0) than in fasted or fed control infants. In contrast, levels of plasma methionine, the other major sulfur amino acid, were low in the three groups receiving an elevated inspired oxygen concentration, as well as in fasted infants. Glycine and serine, two non-sulfur-containing amino acids, had a pattern similar to that of plasma methionine. Thus infants with PPHN and hyaline membrane disease have low plasma total cyst(e)ine levels, an effect that does not appear to result primarily from nutritional deprivation. We speculate that the role of cysteine in bioactivation of nitric oxide and as a precursor of glutathione may be relevant to the pathogenesis and evolution of PPHN and respiratory distress syndrome. Further studies are needed to determine whether increased demands for cysteine exist in these disorders. "
632,37169760,"Hepatocyte apoptosis plays an essential role in the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatocyte apoptosis remain unclear. Here, we identify UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase (UGDH) as a suppressor of NASH-associated liver damage by inhibiting RIPK1 kinase-dependent hepatocyte apoptosis. UGDH is progressively reduced in proportion to NASH severity. UGDH absence from hepatocytes hastens the development of liver damage in male mice with NASH, which is suppressed by RIPK1 kinase-dead knockin mutation. Mechanistically, UGDH suppresses RIPK1 by converting UDP-glucose to UDP-glucuronate, the latter directly binds to the kinase domain of RIPK1 and inhibits its activation. Recovering UDP-glucuronate levels, even after the onset of NASH, improved liver damage. Our findings reveal a role for UGDH and UDP-glucuronate in NASH pathogenesis and uncover a mechanism by which UDP-glucuronate controls hepatocyte apoptosis by targeting RIPK1 kinase, and suggest UDP-glucuronate metabolism as a feasible target for more specific treatment of NASH-associated liver damage.

633,35594055,"Trafficking regulator of GLUT4-1, TRARG1, positively regulates insulin-stimulated GLUT4 trafficking and insulin sensitivity. However, the mechanism(s) by which this occurs remain(s) unclear. Using biochemical and mass spectrometry analyses we found that TRARG1 is dephosphorylated in response to insulin in a PI3K/Akt-dependent manner and is a novel substrate for GSK3. Priming phosphorylation of murine TRARG1 at serine 84 allows for GSK3-directed phosphorylation at serines 72, 76 and 80. A similar pattern of phosphorylation was observed in human TRARG1, suggesting that our findings are translatable to human TRARG1. Pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 increased cell surface GLUT4 in cells stimulated with a submaximal insulin dose, and this was impaired following Trarg1 knockdown, suggesting that TRARG1 acts as a GSK3-mediated regulator in GLUT4 trafficking. These data place TRARG1 within the insulin signaling network and provide insights into how GSK3 regulates GLUT4 trafficking in adipocytes. "
634,34850904,"Osteoglycin (OGN) is a proteoglycan released from bone and muscle which has been associated with markers of metabolic health. However, it is not clear whether the levels of circulating OGN change throughout the adult lifespan or if they are associated with clinical metabolic markers or fitness. We aimed to identify the levels of circulating OGN across the lifespan and to further explore the relationship between OGN and aerobic capacity as well as OGN's association with glucose and HOMA-IR. 107 individuals (46 males and 61 females) aged 21-87 years were included in the study. Serum OGN levels, aerobic capacity (VO2peak), glucose, and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were assessed. T-tests were used to compare participant characteristics between sexes. Regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between OGN and age, and OGN and fitness and metabolic markers. OGN displayed a nonlinear, weak ""U-shaped"" relationship with age across both sexes. Men had higher levels of OGN than women across the lifespan (β = 0.23, P = .03). Age and sex explained 16% of the variance in OGN (adjusted R2 = 0.16; P < .001). Higher OGN was associated with higher VO2peak (β = 0.02, P = .001); however, those aged <50 showed a stronger positive relationship than those aged >50. A higher OGN level was associated with a higher circulating glucose level (β = 0.17, P < .01). No association was observed between OGN and HOMA-IR. OGN was characterized by a U-shaped curve across the lifespan which was similar between sexes. Those with a higher aerobic capacity or higher glucose concentration had higher OGN levels. Our data suggest an association between OGN and aerobic fitness and glucose regulation. Future studies should focus on exploring the potential of OGN as a biomarker for chronic disease. "
635,38609891,"Mild hyperglycaemia is associated with increased birth weight but association with other neonatal outcomes is controversial. We aimed to study neonatal outcomes in untreated mild hyperglycaemia using different oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) thresholds. This register-based study included all (n = 4,939) singleton pregnant women participating a 75 g 2-h OGTT in six delivery hospitals in Finland in 2009. Finnish diagnostic cut-offs for GDM were fasting ≥ 5.3, 1 h ≥ 10.0 or 2-h glucose ≥ 8.6 mmol/L. Women who did not meet these criteria but met the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria (fasting 5.1-5.2 mmol/L and/or 2-h glucose 8.5 mmol/L, n = 509) or the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) criteria (2-h glucose 7.8-8.5 mmol/L, n = 166) were considered as mild untreated hyperglycaemia. Women who met both the Finnish criteria and the IADPSG or the NICE criteria were considered as treated GDM groups (n = 1292 and n = 612, respectively). Controls were normoglycaemic according to all criteria (fasting glucose < 5.1 mmol/L, 1-h glucose < 10.0 mmol/L and 2-h glucose < 8.5 mmol/L, n = 3031). Untreated mild hyperglycemia groups were compared to controls and treated GDM groups. The primary outcome - a composite of adverse neonatal outcomes, including neonatal hypoglycaemia, hyperbilirubinaemia, birth trauma or perinatal mortality - was analysed using multivariate logistic regression. The risk for the adverse neonatal outcome in untreated mild hyperglycemia was not increased compared to controls (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71-1.44, using the IADPSG criteria; aOR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.60-1.85, using the NICE criteria). The risk was lower compared to the treated IADPSG (aOR 0.38, 95% CI 0.27-0.53) or the treated NICE group (aOR 0.32, 95% CI 0.18-0.57). The risk of adverse neonatal outcomes was not increased in mild untreated hyperglycaemia compared to normoglycaemic controls and was lower than in the treated GDM groups. The OGTT cut-offs of 5.3 mmol/L at fasting and 8.6 mmol/L at 2 h seem to sufficiently identify clinically relevant GDM, without excluding neonates with a risk of adverse outcomes. "
636,38178094,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), the predominant malignancy of the oral cavity, is characterized by high incidence and low survival rates. Emerging evidence suggests a link between circadian rhythm disruptions and cancer development. The circadian gene TIMELESS, known for its specific expression in various tumors, has not been extensively studied in the context of OSCC. This study aims to explore the influence of TIMELESS on OSCC, focusing on cell growth and metabolic alterations. We analyzed TIMELESS expression in OSCC using western blot, immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, and data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). The role of TIMELESS in OSCC was examined through clone formation, MTS, cell cycle, and EdU assays, alongside subcutaneous tumor growth experiments in nude mice. We also assessed the metabolic impact of TIMELESS by measuring glucose uptake, lactate production, oxygen consumption, and medium pH, and investigated its effect on key metabolic proteins including silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), hexokinase 2 (HK2), pyruvate kinase isozyme type M2 (PKM2), recombinant lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1). Elevated TIMELESS expression in OSCC tissues and cell lines was observed, correlating with reduced patient survival. TIMELESS overexpression enhanced OSCC cell proliferation, increased glycolytic activity (glucose uptake and lactate production), and suppressed oxidative phosphorylation (evidenced by reduced oxygen consumption and altered pH levels). Conversely, TIMELESS knockdown inhibited these cellular and metabolic processes, an effect mirrored by manipulating SIRT1 levels. Additionally, SIRT1 was positively associated with TIMELESS expression. The expression of SIRT1, HK2, PKM2, LDHA and GLUT1 increased with the overexpression of TIMELESS levels and decreased with the knockdown of TIMELESS. TIMELESS exacerbates OSCC progression by modulating cellular proliferation and metabolic pathways, specifically by enhancing glycolysis and reducing oxidative phosphorylation, largely mediated through the SIRT1 pathway. This highlights TIMELESS as a potential target for OSCC therapeutic strategies. "
637,34155315,"The prevalence of maternal obesity is increasing in the United States. Offspring born to women with obesity or poor glycemic control have greater odds of becoming obese and developing metabolic disease later in life. Our group has utilized a macaque model to study the metabolic effects of consumption of a calorically-dense, Western-style diet (WSD; 36.3% fat) during pregnancy. Here, our objective was to characterize the effects of WSD and obesity, alone and together, on maternal glucose tolerance and insulin levels in dams during each pregnancy. Recognizing the collinearity of maternal measures, we adjusted for confounding factors including maternal age and parity. Based on intravenous glucose tolerance tests, dams consuming a WSD showed lower glucose area under the curve during first study pregnancies despite increased body fat percentage and increased insulin area under the curve. However, with (1) prolonged WSD feeding, (2) multiple diet switches, and/or (3) increasing age and parity, WSD was associated with increasingly higher insulin levels during glucose tolerance testing, indicative of insulin resistance. Our results suggest that prolonged or recurrent calorically-dense WSD and/or increased parity, rather than obesity per se, drive excess insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. These observations in a highly relevant species are likely of clinical and public health importance given the comparative ease of maternal dietary modifications relative to the low likelihood of successfully reversing obesity in the course of any given pregnancy.

638,33030062,"We hypothesise that dietary sodium intake interacts with serum uric acid to influence blood pressure (BP) in children and adolescents. In the present study, we investigated ambulatory BP in relation to hyperuricaemia, dietary sodium intake and their interaction in children and adolescents with hypertension. A total of 616 study participants were 10-24 years old and had primary hypertension diagnosed after admission in a specialised inpatient ward. Ambulatory BP monitoring was performed during hospitalisation. 24-h urine was collected for measurements of electrolytes. Hyperuricaemia was defined as a serum uric acid of ≥327.25 μmol/L in patients <18 years old and of ≥420 and ≥360 μmol/L, respectively, in male and female patients ≥18 years old. In adjusted analyses, patients with hyperuricaemia ( Both hyperuricaemia and higher dietary sodium intake were associated with higher pulse pressure, and their interaction further heightened systolic BP.

639,31930788,"The maintenance and strengthening of public health and the prevention of diseases associated with the malnutrition of children and adults is an urgent and acute problem facing the population of the whole world. Diabetes type 2 has become a serious problem for modern medicine. This disease is widespread throughout the world among children and adolescents. There are substantial grounds to believe that this global incidence is related to obesity and physical inactivity. There is a diverse assortment of ice-creams and frozen desserts available all around the world. Even with the development of the ice-cream industry, frozen desserts for people suffering from diabetes type I and II have not been sufficiently developed. Therefore, this study aims to select low-calorie components for use in the manufacture of sherbet ice-cream without sucrose in their composition, with a low glycemic index and with a high content of protein and vitamins. Tо develop the technology and formulation of the product, a combination of appropriate starter cultures and their ratios were determined. The most suitable fruit mix with a low glycemic index was chosen to maintain the product with properties desirable to consumers. Combined starter cultures, consisting of CHN-22 and St-Body 1 at a ratio of 7:3 were selected experimentally. The best thixotropic properties were shown by the test samples with a titratable acidity of 60&ndash;65&deg;Т at a fermentation temperature of 33 &plusmn;1&deg;C. The fruit mixture for the sherbet ice-cream was made from fruits and berries recommended for people with diabetes, including cherries, blueberries and lingonberries at a ratio of 3:4:3, respectively. The part of the mixture that was inserted into the sherbet ice-cream was evaluated as 25% of the weight of the final mixture. Stevioside and syrup of Jerusalem artichoke were selected at amounts of 0.05% and 7.5% by weight of the mixture respectively. The resulting sherbet was not inferior in sweetness to the control sample with 21% sucrose. The shelf life of the low-fat fermented sherbet ice-cream without sugar was obtained according to the results of research on organoleptic, physicochemical and microbiological properties and was substantiated as 3 months at 18&deg;С. The presented production procedure enables the manufacture of a low-fat, sugar-free product with preventive and therapeutic properties for people who suffer from diabetes and obesity. Studies were conducted on the influence of the introduced starter cultures and sweeteners on the organoleptic, physicochemical and rheological parameters of the developed low-fat frozen sherbet. Starter cultures and doses of stevioside which had a favorable effect on the indicators of the finished product were selected. "
640,32916151,"Fructose consumption increases risk factors for cardiometabolic disease. It is assumed that the effects of free sugars on risk factors are less potent because they contain less fructose. We compared the effects of consuming fructose, glucose or their combination, high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), on cardiometabolic risk factors. Adults (18-40 years; BMI 18-35 kg/m 145 subjects (26.0 ± 5.8 years; body mass index 25.0 ± 3.7 kg/m A significant interaction between fructose and glucose contributed to increases of lipoprotein risk factors when the two monosaccharides were co-ingested as HFCS. Thus, the effects of HFCS on lipoprotein risks factors are not solely mediated by the fructose content and it cannot be assumed that glucose is a benign component of HFCS. Our findings suggest that HFCS may be as harmful as isocaloric amounts of pure fructose and provide further support for the urgency to implement strategies to limit free sugar consumption. "
641,28029217,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) potentially harms the child before birth. We previously found GDM to be associated with developmental changes in the central nervous system. We now hypothesise that GDM may also impact on the fetal autonomic nervous system under metabolic stress like an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). We measured heart rate variability (HRV) of mothers and fetuses during a three-point OGTT using fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG). Measurements were performed in the fMEG Centre in Tübingen. After exclusion of 23 participants, 13 pregnant women with GDM and 36 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance were examined. All women underwent the same examination setting with OGTT during which fMCG was recorded three times. Parameters of heart rate variability were measured. Compared with mothers with normal glucose regulation, mothers with GDM showed increased heart rate but no significant differences of maternal HRV. In contrast, HRV in fetuses of mothers with GDM differed from those in the metabolically healthy group regarding standard deviation normal to normal beat (SDNN) (P = 0.012), low-frequency band (P = 0.008) and high-frequency band (P = 0.031). These HRV parameters exhibit a decrease only in GDM fetuses during the second hour of the OGTT. These results show an altered response of the fetal autonomic nervous system to metabolic stress in GDM-complicated pregnancies. Hence, disturbances in maternal glucose metabolism might not only impact on the central nervous system of the fetus but may also affect the fetal autonomic nervous system. Metabolic stress reveals a different response of fetal autonomic nervous system in GDM-complicated pregnancies. "

643,27207544,"Increased sugar-sweetened beverage consumption has been linked to higher rates of obesity. Using functional MRI, we assessed brain perfusion responses to drinking two commonly consumed monosaccharides, glucose and fructose, in obese and lean adolescents. Marked differences were observed. In response to drinking glucose, obese adolescents exhibited decreased brain perfusion in brain regions involved in executive function (prefrontal cortex [PFC]) and increased perfusion in homeostatic appetite regions of the brain (hypothalamus). Conversely, in response to drinking glucose, lean adolescents demonstrated increased PFC brain perfusion and no change in perfusion in the hypothalamus. In addition, obese adolescents demonstrated attenuated suppression of serum acyl-ghrelin and increased circulating insulin level after glucose ingestion; furthermore, the change in acyl-ghrelin and insulin levels after both glucose and fructose ingestion was associated with increased hypothalamic, thalamic, and hippocampal blood flow in obese relative to lean adolescents. Additionally, in all subjects there was greater perfusion in the ventral striatum with fructose relative to glucose ingestion. Finally, reduced connectivity between executive, homeostatic, and hedonic brain regions was observed in obese adolescents. These data demonstrate that obese adolescents have impaired prefrontal executive control responses to drinking glucose and fructose, while their homeostatic and hedonic responses appear to be heightened. Thus, obesity-related brain adaptations to glucose and fructose consumption in obese adolescents may contribute to excessive consumption of glucose and fructose, thereby promoting further weight gain.

However, in humans, it is difficult to separate out the relative contributions of genetics, environment, or the process of IVF, which includes ovarian stimulation (OS) and embryo culture. Therefore, we examined glucose metabolism in young adult humans and in adult male C57BL/6J mice conceived by IVF versus natural birth under energy-balanced and high-fat-overfeeding conditions. In humans, peripheral insulin sensitivity, as assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (80 mU/m(2)/min), was lower in IVF patients (n = 14) versus control subjects (n = 20) after 3 days of an energy-balanced diet (30% fat). In response to 3 days of overfeeding (+1,250 kcal/day, 45% fat), there was a greater increase in systolic blood pressure in IVF versus controls (P = 0.02). Mice conceived after either OS alone or IVF weighed significantly less at birth versus controls (P < 0.01). However, only mice conceived by IVF displayed increased fasting glucose levels, impaired glucose tolerance, and reduced insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in the liver after 8 weeks of consuming either a chow or high-fat diet (60% fat). Thus, OS impaired fetal growth in the mouse, but only embryo culture resulted in changes in glucose metabolism that may increase the risk of the development of metabolic diseases later in life, in both mice and humans.

645,29750366,"Choline, an essential nutrient, serves as a methyl-group donor for DNA methylation and is a constituent of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and a precursor to major components of cell membranes. Findings from animal studies suggest that choline supplementation during pregnancy can mitigate adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on growth and neurocognitive function. We conducted a randomized, double-blind exploratory trial to examine feasibility and acceptability of a choline supplementation intervention during pregnancy. Seventy heavy drinkers, recruited in mid-pregnancy, were randomly assigned to receive a daily oral dose of 2 g of choline or a placebo from time of enrollment until delivery. Each dose consisted of an individually wrapped packet of powder that, when mixed with water, produced a sweet tasting grape-flavored drink. Adherence was assessed by collecting used and unused drink packets on a monthly basis and tabulating the number used. Side effects were assessed in monthly interviews. Blood samples obtained at enrollment and at 4 and 12 weeks after randomization were assayed for plasma choline concentration. Adherence was good-to-excellent (median doses taken = 74.0%; interquartile range = 53.9 to 88.7%) and was not related to a range of sociodemographic characteristics or to alcohol consumption ascertained using a timeline follow-back interview. By 4 weeks, plasma choline concentrations were significantly higher in the choline supplementation than the placebo arm, and this group difference continued to be evident at 12 weeks. The only side effect was a small increase in nausea/dyspepsia. No effects were seen for diarrhea, vomiting, muscle stiffness, blood pressure, or body odor changes. This study demonstrated that a choline supplementation program with very heavy drinkers during pregnancy is feasible even among highly disadvantaged, poorly educated women. The broad acceptability of this intervention is indicated by our finding that adherence was not related to maternal education, intellectual function, depression, nutritional status, or alcohol use. "

The advances in CF clinical care in the past 2 decades are mainly attributed to anti-infective therapy as well as aggressive nutritional management. Currently, there are multiple therapeutic agents that are in clinical trial that target either the underlying CFTR defect or the downstream effects of CFTR. The broad spectrum of therapeutic agents being studied as well as the advances in therapies that target the underlying CFTR defect are exciting, making it likely that at least one of the treatments will make a major difference in how we will treat CF in the future.

647,25867738,"Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) have become an important cell source to address the lack of primary cardiomyocytes available for basic research and translational applications. To differentiate hiPSCs into cardiomyocytes, various protocols including embryoid body (EB)-based differentiation and growth factor induction have been developed. However, these protocols are inefficient and highly variable in their ability to generate purified cardiomyocytes. Recently, a small molecule-based protocol utilizing modulation of Wnt/β-Catenin signaling was shown to promote cardiac differentiation with high efficiency. With this protocol, greater than 50%-60% of differentiated cells were cardiac troponin-positive cardiomyocytes were consistently observed. To further increase cardiomyocyte purity, the differentiated cells were subjected to glucose starvation to specifically eliminate non-cardiomyocytes based on the metabolic differences between cardiomyocytes and non-cardiomyocytes. Using this selection strategy, we consistently obtained a greater than 30% increase in the ratio of cardiomyocytes to non-cardiomyocytes in a population of differentiated cells. These highly purified cardiomyocytes should enhance the reliability of results from human iPSC-based in vitro disease modeling studies and drug screening assays. "

649,16543226,"GLUT1 is essential for human brain development and function, as evidenced by the severe epileptic encephalopathy observed in children with GLUT1 deficiency syndrome resulting from inherited loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding this facilitative glucose transporter. To further elucidate the pathophysiology of this disorder, the zebrafish orthologue of human GLUT1 was identified, and expression of this gene was abrogated during early embryonic development, resulting in a phenotype of aberrant brain organogenesis consistent with the observed expression of Glut1 in the embryonic tectum and specifically rescued by human GLUT1 mRNA. Affected embryos displayed impaired glucose uptake concomitant with increased neural cell apoptosis and subsequent ventricle enlargement, trigeminal ganglion cell loss, and abnormal hindbrain architecture. Strikingly, inhibiting expression of the zebrafish orthologue of the proapoptotic protein Bad resulted in complete rescue of this phenotype, and this occurred even in the absence of restoration of apparent glucose uptake. Taken together, these studies describe a tractable system for elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms of Glut1 deficiency and provide compelling in vivo genetic evidence directly linking nutrient availability and activation of mitochondria-dependent apoptotic mechanisms during embryonic brain development.

650,29662201,"Proliferating cells, compared with quiescent cells, are more dependent on glucose for their growth. Although glucose transport in keratinocytes is mediated largely by the Glut1 facilitative transporter, we found that keratinocyte-specific ablation of Glut1 did not compromise mouse skin development and homeostasis. Ex vivo metabolic profiling revealed altered sphingolipid, hexose, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism in Glut1-deficient keratinocytes, thus suggesting metabolic adaptation. However, cultured Glut1-deficient keratinocytes displayed metabolic and oxidative stress and impaired proliferation. Similarly, Glut1 deficiency impaired in vivo keratinocyte proliferation and migration within wounded or UV-damaged mouse skin. Notably, both genetic and pharmacological Glut1 inactivation decreased hyperplasia in mouse models of psoriasis-like disease. Topical application of a Glut1 inhibitor also decreased inflammation in these models. Glut1 inhibition decreased the expression of pathology-associated genes in human psoriatic skin organoids. Thus, Glut1 is selectively required for injury- and inflammation-associated keratinocyte proliferation, and its inhibition offers a novel treatment strategy for psoriasis. "
651,36289536,"Lipid and glucose metabolism abnormalities are associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index is a recently developed indicator that can identify individuals at risk for NAFLD. However, the applicability of the TyG index for identifying NAFLD in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of the TyG index to identify individuals at risk for NAFLD in the T2DM population. A total of 2280 participants with T2DM were recruited in this cross-sectional study. The TyG index was calculated, and NAFLD was diagnosed by ultrasonography. Binary logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association of the TyG index, glycemic parameters and lipid parameters with NAFLD. Logistic regression analysis showed that the TyG index was significantly associated with NAFLD in subjects with T2DM, the odds ratio (OR) were 3.27 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.03-5.27; P < 0.001) for NAFLD in the highest TyG quartile after adjustment for known confounders. In stratified analysis, an elevated TyG index were more remarkably associated with NAFLD in younger patients (< 65 years; OR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.83-3.02; P < 0.001), females (OR, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.67-4.32; P < 0.001), patients with BMI < 25 kg/m The TyG index is significantly associated with NAFLD and shows superior ability for identify NAFLD risk compared with other lipid and glycemic parameters in T2DM.

653,37795361,"Obesity is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease development. Here, we aimed to examine and compare the predictive values of three novel obesity indices, lipid accumulation product (LAP), visceral adiposity index (VAI), and triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, for cardiovascular subclinical organ damage. A total of 1,773 healthy individuals from the Hanzhong Adolescent Hypertension Study cohort were enrolled. Anthropometric, biochemical, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR), brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), and Cornell voltage-duration product data were collected. Furthermore, the potential risk factors for subclinical organ damage were investigated, with particular emphasis on examining the predictive value of the LAP, VAI, and TyG index for detecting subclinical organ damage. LAP, VAI, and TyG index exhibited a significant positive association with baPWV and uACR. However, only LAP and VAI were found to have a positive correlation with Cornell product. While the three indices did not show an association with electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy, higher values of LAP and TyG index were significantly associated with an increased risk of arterial stiffness and albuminuria. Furthermore, after dividing the population into quartiles, the fourth quartiles of LAP and TyG index showed a significant association with arterial stiffness and albuminuria when compared with the first quartiles, in both unadjusted and fully adjusted models. Additionally, the concordance index (C-index) values for LAP, VAI, and TyG index were reasonably high for arterial stiffness (0.856, 0.856, and 0.857, respectively) and albuminuria (0.739, 0.737, and 0.746, respectively). Lastly, the analyses of continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) demonstrated that the TyG index exhibited significantly higher predictive values for arterial stiffness and albuminuria compared with LAP and VAI. LAP, VAI, and, especially, TyG index demonstrated utility in screening cardiovascular subclinical organ damage among Chinese adults in this community-based sample. These indices have the potential to function as markers for early detection of cardiovascular disease in otherwise healthy individuals. "
654,32398434,"While Omegaven, an omega-3 (n3) fatty acid-based lipid emulsion, fosters insulin signaling in healthy hearts, it is unknown whether beneficial metabolic effects occur in insulin-resistant diabetic hearts. Diabetic hearts from fructose-fed Sprague-Dawley rats were perfused in the working mode for 90 minutes in the presence of 11 mM glucose and 1.2 mM palmitate bound to albumin, the first 30 minutes without insulin followed by 60 minutes with insulin (50 mU/L). Hearts were randomly allocated to Intralipid (25 and 100 µM), Omegaven (25 and 100 µM), or no emulsion (insulin alone) for 60 minutes. Glycolysis, glycogen synthesis, and glucose oxidation were measured with the radioactive tracers [5-H]glucose and [U-C]glucose. Central carbon metabolites, acyl-coenzyme A species (acyl-CoAs), ketoacids, purines, phosphocreatine, acylcarnitines, and acyl composition of phospholipids were measured with mass spectrometry. Diabetic hearts showed no response to insulin with regard to glycolytic flux, consistent with insulin resistance. Addition of either lipid emulsion did not alter this response but unexpectedly increased glucose oxidation (ratio of treatment/baseline, ie, fold change): no insulin 1.3 (0.3) [mean (standard deviation)], insulin alone 1.4 (0.4), insulin + 25 µM Intralipid 1.8 (0.5), insulin + 100 µM Intralipid 2.2 (0.4), P < .001; no insulin 1.3 (0.3), insulin alone 1.4 (0.4), insulin + 25 µM Omegaven 2.3 (0.5) insulin + 100 µM Omegaven 1.9 (0.4), P < .001. Intralipid treatment led to accumulation of acylcarnitines as a result of the released linoleic acid (C18:2-n6) and enhanced its integration into phospholipids, consistent with incomplete or impaired β-oxidation necessitating a compensatory increase in glucose oxidation. Accumulation of acylcarnitines was also associated with a higher nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced/oxidized (NADH/NAD) ratio, which inhibited pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), and resulted in excess lactate production. In contrast, Omegaven-treated hearts showed no acylcarnitine accumulation, low malonyl-CoA concentrations consistent with activated β-oxidation, and elevated PDH activity and glucose oxidation, together indicative of a higher metabolic rate possibly by substrate cycling. Omegaven is the preferred lipid emulsion for insulin-resistant diabetic hearts. "
655,32393898,"Glucose is catabolized by two fundamental pathways, glycolysis to make ATP and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway to make reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). The first step of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway is catalyzed by the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). Here we develop metabolite reporter and deuterium tracer assays to monitor cellular G6PD activity. Using these, we show that the most widely cited G6PD antagonist, dehydroepiandosterone, does not robustly inhibit G6PD in cells. We then identify a small molecule (G6PDi-1) that more effectively inhibits G6PD. Across a range of cultured cells, G6PDi-1 depletes NADPH most strongly in lymphocytes. In T cells but not macrophages, G6PDi-1 markedly decreases inflammatory cytokine production. In neutrophils, it suppresses respiratory burst. Thus, we provide a cell-active small molecule tool for oxidative pentose phosphate pathway inhibition, and use it to identify G6PD as a pharmacological target for modulating immune response. "

We have previously demonstrated in vitro that this process is associated with less hemolysis of red blood cells (RBCs) with use of an isotonic solution compared with a hypotonic 0.25 normal saline (NS) solution. The objective of this study was to compare the in vivo effect on hemolysis of 2 UAC infusion/flush regimens (an isotonic regimen vs a hypotonic regimen) and to assess the early nutritional benefit of an amino acid solution as the isotonic UAC infusion solution. Infants who had a birth weight of < or =1.5 kg and were expected to have a UAC for > or =3 days were enrolled within 24 hours of life into this prospective, double-blind, randomized, clinical trial of 2 UAC infusion solution/flush regimens. Power analysis demonstrated that 40 infants were needed to determine differences in hemolysis quantified by plasma-free hemoglobin (PFH) level. Nutrition from glucose was evaluated by measurement of daily dextrose calories. C-peptide was measured to evaluate endogenous insulin production. Adverse events and protein tolerance were tracked. Twenty-two infants (mean gestational age: 27 weeks; 945 g birth weight) were enrolled in each group, for an average of 4.2 days (range: 2.5-8 days). There were no group differences in demographics. PFH levels were lower for infants who received isotonic amino acid (IAA) in comparison with 0.25 NS (33 +/- 14 mg/dL vs 62 +/- 27 mg/dL, respectively). C-peptide was higher in those who received IAA, as were nonprotein calories received on days 4 to 6 of the study (51 +/- 11 kcal/kg/day vs 44 +/- 12 kcal/kg/day, IAA vs 0.25 NS, respectively). Lower PFH levels in IAA versus 0.25 NS group were consistent with our hypothesis of decreased hemolysis with an isotonic infusion/flush regimen. IAA use may also allow greater early glucose nutrition, as indicated by the higher level of endogenous insulin production and improved glucose tolerance. IAA seems to be a superior UAC solution to 0.25 NS in that it is associated with less hemolysis and improved nutrition. "

660,28615356,"A potentially useful approach for drug discovery is to connect gene expression profiles of disease-affected tissues (""disease signatures"") to drug signatures, but it remains to be shown whether it can be used to identify clinically relevant treatment options. We analyzed coexpression networks and genetic data to identify a disease signature for type 2 diabetes in liver tissue. By interrogating a library of 3800 drug signatures, we identified sulforaphane as a compound that may reverse the disease signature. Sulforaphane suppressed glucose production from hepatic cells by nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and decreased expression of key enzymes in gluconeogenesis. Moreover, sulforaphane reversed the disease signature in the livers from diabetic animals and attenuated exaggerated glucose production and glucose intolerance by a magnitude similar to that of metformin. Finally, sulforaphane, provided as concentrated broccoli sprout extract, reduced fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in obese patients with dysregulated type 2 diabetes. "
661,26918583,"Blood glucose is an important fuel for endurance exercise. It can be derived from ingested carbohydrate, stored liver glycogen and newly synthesized glucose (gluconeogenesis). We hypothesized that athletes habitually following a low carbohydrate high fat (LCHF) diet would have higher rates of gluconeogenesis during exercise compared to those who follow a mixed macronutrient diet. We used stable isotope tracers to study glucose production kinetics during a 2 h ride in cyclists habituated to either a LCHF or mixed macronutrient diet. The LCHF cyclists had lower rates of total glucose production and hepatic glycogenolysis but similar rates of gluconeogenesis compared to those on the mixed diet. The LCHF cyclists did not compensate for reduced dietary carbohydrate availability by increasing glucose synthesis during exercise but rather adapted by altering whole body substrate utilization. Endogenous glucose production (EGP) occurs via hepatic glycogenolysis (GLY) and gluconeogenesis (GNG) and plays an important role in maintaining euglycaemia. Rates of GLY and GNG increase during exercise in athletes following a mixed macronutrient diet; however, these processes have not been investigated in athletes following a low carbohydrate high fat (LCHF) diet. Therefore, we studied seven well-trained male cyclists that were habituated to either a LCHF (7% carbohydrate, 72% fat, 21% protein) or a mixed diet (51% carbohydrate, 33% fat, 16% protein) for longer than 8 months. After an overnight fast, participants performed a 2 h laboratory ride at 72% of maximal oxygen consumption. Glucose kinetics were measured at rest and during the final 30 min of exercise by infusion of [6,6-(2) H2 ]-glucose and the ingestion of (2) H2 O tracers. Rates of EGP and GLY both at rest and during exercise were significantly lower in the LCHF group than the mixed diet group (Exercise EGP: LCHF, 6.0 ± 0.9 mg kg(-1)  min(-1) , Mixed, 7.8 ± 1.1 mg kg(-1)  min(-1) , P < 0.01; Exercise GLY: LCHF, 3.2 ± 0.7 mg kg(-1)  min(-1) , Mixed, 5.3 ± 0.9 mg kg(-1)  min(-1) , P < 0.01). Conversely, no difference was detected in rates of GNG between groups at rest or during exercise (Exercise: LCHF, 2.8 ± 0.4 mg kg(-1)  min(-1) , Mixed, 2.5 ± 0.3 mg kg(-1)  min(-1) , P = 0.15). We conclude that athletes on a LCHF diet do not compensate for reduced glucose availability via higher rates of glucose synthesis compared to athletes on a mixed diet. Instead, GNG remains relatively stable, whereas glucose oxidation and GLY are influenced by dietary factors. "

The selective induction of 14-3-3γ in cortical neurons by OGD was verified by the in vivo ischemic stroke model. Knocking down 14-3-3γ alone or inhibiting 14-3-3/client interactions was sufficient to induce cell death in normal cultured neurons and exacerbate OGD-induced neuronal death. Ectopic overexpression of 14-3-3γ significantly reduced OGD-induced cell death in cultured neurons. Co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer demonstrated that endogenous 14-3-3γ bound directly to more p-β-catenin Ser37 but not p-Bad, p-Ask-1, p-p53 and Bax. During OGD, p-β-catenin Ser37 but not p-β-catenin Ser45 was increased prominently, which correlated with Bax elevation in cortical neurons. OGD promoted the entry of 14-3-3γ into the nuclei, in correlation with the increase of nuclear p-β-catenin Ser37 in neurons. Overexpression of 14-3-3γ significantly reduced Bax expression, whereas knockdown of 14-3-3γ increased Bax in cortical neurons. Abolishing β-catenin phosphorylation at Ser37 (S37A) significantly reduced Bax and cell death in neurons upon OGD. Finally, 14-3-3γ overexpression completely suppressed β-catenin-enhanced Bax and cell death in neurons upon OGD. Based on these data, we propose that the 14-3-3γ/p-β-catenin Ser37/Bax axis determines cell survival or death of neurons during ischemia, providing novel therapeutic targets for ischemic stroke as well as other related neurological diseases.

663,24424042,"Protection against insulitis and diabetes by active vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), in nonobese diabetic mice has until now mainly been attributed to its immunomodulatory effects, but also protective effects of this hormone on inflammation-induced β-cell death have been reported. The aim of this study was to clarify the molecular mechanisms by which 1,25(OH)2D3 contributes to β-cell protection against cytokine-induced β-cell dysfunction and death. Human and mouse islets were exposed to IL-1β and interferon-γ in the presence or absence of 1,25(OH)2D3. Effects on insulin secretion and β-cell survival were analyzed by glucose-stimulated insulin release and electron microscopy or Hoechst/propidium iodide staining, respectively. Gene expression profiles were assessed by Affymetrix microarrays. Nuclear factor-κB activity was tested, whereas effects on secreted chemokines/cytokines were confirmed by ELISA and migration studies. Cytokine exposure caused a significant increase in β-cell apoptosis, which was almost completely prevented by 1,25(OH)2D3. In addition, 1,25(OH)2D3 restored insulin secretion from cytokine-exposed islets. Microarray analysis of murine islets revealed that the expression of approximately 4000 genes was affected by cytokines after 6 and 24 hours (n = 4; >1.3-fold; P < .02), of which nearly 250 genes were modified by 1,25(OH)2D3. These genes belong to functional groups involved in immune response, chemotaxis, cell death, and pancreatic β-cell function/phenotype. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate a direct protective effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 against inflammation-induced β-cell dysfunction and death in human and murine islets, with, in particular, alterations in chemokine production by the islets. These effects may contribute to the beneficial effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 against the induction of autoimmune diabetes. "
664,11723054,"Cytokines have been shown to have dramatic effects on pancreatic islets and insulin-secreting beta-cell lines. It is well established that cytokines such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) inhibit beta-cell function and are cytotoxic to human and rodent pancreatic islets in vitro. Despite the pleiotropic effects of cytokines on beta-cells, the specific signal transduction pathways and molecular events involved in beta-cell dysfunction remain largely unresolved. In this report, we have examined IL-1beta stimulation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) activity in insulin-secreting clonal cell lines. We demonstrate that IL-1beta transiently activates 46- and 54-kDa isoforms of JNK in cultured RINm5F beta-cells. Furthermore, IL-1beta stimulation of JNK activity is specific, because TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma were without effect. Stable overexpression of JNK1 in RINm5F cells increased levels of activated JNK without affecting kinase activity. JNK-interacting protein (JIP) associates with endogenous as well as overexpressed JNK, suggesting that JIP may serve to regulate JNK activity. Finally, we demonstrate that activated JNK is fully retained in cytoplasmic and membrane compartments without any nuclear translocation. Together, these data indicate that IL-1beta-stimulated JNK activity may be distinctly targeted to cytoplasmic and/or membrane compartments in clonal insulin-producing cells, and that JIP may serve to localize JNK activity to specific substrates.

665,29750367,"We recently demonstrated the acceptability and feasibility of a randomized, double-blind choline supplementation intervention for heavy drinking women during pregnancy. In this study, we report our results relating to the efficacy of this intervention in mitigating adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on infant growth and cognitive function. Sixty-nine Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) heavy drinkers in Cape Town, South Africa, recruited in mid-pregnancy, were randomly assigned to receive a daily oral dose of either 2 g of choline or placebo from time of enrollment until delivery. Each dose consisted of an individually wrapped packet of powder that, when mixed with water, produced a sweet tasting grape-flavored drink. The primary outcome, eyeblink conditioning (EBC), was assessed at 6.5 months. Somatic growth was measured at birth, 6.5, and 12 months, recognition memory and processing speed on the Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence, at 6.5 and 12 months. Infants born to choline-treated mothers were more likely to meet criterion for conditioning on EBC than the placebo group. Moreover, within the choline arm, degree of maternal adherence to the supplementation protocol strongly predicted EBC performance. Both groups were small at birth, but choline-treated infants showed considerable catch-up growth in weight and head circumference at 6.5 and 12 months. At 12 months, the infants in the choline treatment arm had higher novelty preference scores, indicating better visual recognition memory. This exploratory study is the first to provide evidence that a high dose of choline administered early in pregnancy can mitigate adverse effects of heavy PAE on EBC, postnatal growth, and cognition in human infants. These findings are consistent with studies of alcohol-exposed animals that have demonstrated beneficial effects of choline supplementation on classical conditioning, learning, and memory. "
666,31023625,"In type 2 diabetes (T2D), oxidative stress contributes to the dysfunction and loss of pancreatic β cells. A highly conserved feature of the cellular response to stress is the regulation of mRNA translation; however, the genes regulated at the level of translation are often overlooked due to the convenience of RNA sequencing technologies. Our goal is to investigate translational regulation in β cells as a means to uncover novel factors and pathways pertinent to cellular adaptation and survival during T2D-associated conditions. Translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) followed by RNA-seq or RT-qPCR was used to identify changes in the ribosome occupancy of mRNAs in Min6 cells. Gene depletion studies used lentiviral delivery of shRNAs to primary mouse islets or CRISPR-Cas9 to Min6 cells. Oxidative stress and apoptosis were measured in primary islets using cell-permeable dyes with fluorescence readouts of oxidation and activated cleaved caspase-3 and-7, respectively. Gene expression was assessed by RNA-seq, RT-qPCR, and western blot. ChIP-qPCR was used to determine chromatin enrichment. TRAP-seq in a PDX1-deficiency model of β cell dysfunction uncovered a cohort of genes regulated at the level of mRNA translation, including the transcription factor JUND. Using a panel of diabetes-associated stressors, JUND was found to be upregulated in mouse islets cultured with high concentrations of glucose and free fatty acid, but not after treatment with hydrogen peroxide or thapsigargin. This induction of JUND could be attributed to increased mRNA translation. JUND was also upregulated in islets from diabetic db/db mice and in human islets treated with high glucose and free fatty acid. Depletion of JUND in primary islets reduced oxidative stress and apoptosis in β cells during metabolic stress. Transcriptome assessment identified a cohort of genes, including pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory genes, regulated by JUND that are commonly dysregulated in models of β cell dysfunction, consistent with a maladaptive role for JUND in islets. A translation-centric approach uncovered JUND as a stress-responsive factor in β cells that contributes to redox imbalance and apoptosis during pathophysiologically relevant stress. "
667,37189016,"Inflammation is a key contributor to diabetic kidney disease pathogenesis, including reactive oxidation stress (ROS)-mediated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway. In this study, we examined the effect of Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) on anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties under high glucose (HG) condition and the potential mechanism in glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs). We showed that AS-IV concentration-dependently reduced GMCs proliferation, restrained ROS release and hydrogen peroxide content, and suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as pro-fibrotic factors expression, which were associated with the inhibition of NF-κB and nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling activation. Accordingly, both NF-κB overexpression by using RNA plasmid and Nrf2 gene silencing by using RNA interference weakened the ability of AS-IV to ameliorate HG-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell proliferation. Furthermore, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)/serine/threonine protein kinase (Akt) and extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) signaling pathway regulated the process of AS-IV-induced Nrf2 activation and antioxidant capacity, which evidenced by using PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or ERK inhibitor PD98059 that largely abolished the AS-IV efficacy. Taken together, these results indicated that AS-IV protected against HG-induced GMCs damage by inhibiting ROS/NF-kB-induced increases of inflammatory cytokines, fibrosis biomarkers, and cell proliferation via up-regulation of Nrf2-dependent antioxidant enzyme expression, which were mediated by PI3K/Akt and ERK signaling pathway activation.

668,28324109,"We tested the hypothesis that exposure of glut3+/- mice to a ketogenic diet ameliorates autism-like features, which include aberrant behavior and electrographic seizures. We first investigated the life course sex-specific changes in basal plasma-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-brain metabolic profile, brain glucose transport/uptake, glucose and monocarboxylate transporter proteins, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the presence or absence of systemic insulin administration. Glut3+/- male but not female mice (5 months of age) displayed reduced CSF glucose/lactate concentrations with no change in brain Glut1, Mct2, glucose uptake or ATP. Exogenous insulin-induced hypoglycemia increased brain glucose uptake in glut3+/- males alone. Higher plasma-CSF ketones (β-hydroxybutyrate) and lower brain Glut3 in females vs males proved protective in the former while enhancing vulnerability in the latter. As a consequence, increased synaptic proteins (neuroligin4 and SAPAP1) with spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic activity subsequently reduced hippocampal glucose content and increased brain amyloid β1-40 deposition in an age-dependent manner in glut3+/- males but not females (4 to 24 months of age). We then explored the protective effect of a ketogenic diet on ultrasonic vocalization, sociability, spatial learning and memory, and electroencephalogram seizures in male mice (7 days to 6 to 8 months of age) alone. A ketogenic diet partially restored sociability without affecting perturbed vocalization, spatial learning and memory, and reduced seizure events. We conclude that (1) sex-specific and age-dependent perturbations underlie the phenotype of glut3+/- mice, and (2) a ketogenic diet ameliorates seizures caused by increased cortical excitation and improves sociability, but fails to rescue vocalization and cognitive deficits in glut3+/- male mice.

671,29971529,"Islet transplantation is a treatment option that can help individuals with type 1 diabetes become insulin independent, but inefficient oxygen and nutrient delivery can hamper islet survival and engraftment due to the size of the islets and loss of the native microvasculature. We hypothesised that size-controlled pseudoislets engineered via centrifugal-forced-aggregation (CFA-PI) in a platform we previously developed would compare favourably with native islets, even after taking into account cell loss during the process. Human islets were dissociated and reaggregated into uniform, size-controlled CFA-PI in our microwell system. Their performance was assessed in vitro and in vivo over a range of sizes, and compared with that of unmodified native islets, as well as islet cell clusters formed by a conventional spontaneous aggregation approach (in which dissociated islet cells are cultured on ultra-low-attachment plates). In vitro studies included assays for membrane integrity, apoptosis, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion assay and total DNA content. In vivo efficacy was determined by transplantation under the kidney capsule of streptozotocin-treated Rag1 CFA-PI exhibit markedly increased uniformity over native islets, as well as substantially improved glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (8.8-fold to 11.1-fold, even after taking cell loss into account) and hypoxia tolerance. In vivo, CFA-PI function similarly to (and potentially better than) native islets in reversing hyperglycaemia (55.6% for CFA-PI vs 20.0% for native islets at 500 islet equivalents [IEQ], and 77.8% for CFA-PI vs 55.6% for native islets at 1000 IEQ), and significantly better than spontaneously aggregated control cells (55.6% for CFA-PI vs 0% for spontaneous aggregation at 500 IEQ, and 77.8% CFA-PI vs 33.4% for spontaneous aggregation at 1000 IEQ; p < 0.05). Glucose clearance in the CFA-PI groups was improved over that in the native islet groups (CFA-PI 18.1 mmol/l vs native islets 29.7 mmol/l at 60 min; p < 0.05) to the point where they were comparable with the non-transplanted naive normoglycaemic control mice at a low IEQ of 500 IEQ (17.2 mmol/l at 60 min). The ability to efficiently reformat dissociated islet cells into engineered pseudoislets with improved properties has high potential for both research and therapeutic applications. "
672,8969285,"Obesity is a common component of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and plays an important role in the development of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) has been associated with morbid obesity and an increased propensity for early development of NIDDM. It has been assumed that the etiology for this increased rate of NIDDM is related to the morbid obesity and concomitant insulin resistance, but this remains controversial. To shed light on the glucoregulatory mechanisms in PWS, we studied both pediatric and adult PWS patients with normoglycemia. The objectives of our study were (1) to examine glucose, insulin, and C-peptide responses to oral (OGTT) and intravenous (IVGTT) glucose tolerance tests; (2) to characterize acute first- and second-phase insulin secretion during an IVGTT; (3) to assess hepatic insulin extraction (HIE) and insulin clearance (IC) in PWS subjects; and (4) to determine whether beta-cell function in PWS is age-dependent. These results in PWS were compared with values obtained in age-, sex-, and body mass index (BMI)-matched non-PWS obese controls. Three groups were studied. Group I consisted of nine PWS subjects under the age of 13 years and 22 age-, sex-, weight-, and puberty stage-matched obese subjects who underwent OGTT. Group II consisted of 14 adult PWS subjects and 10 age-, weight-, and BMI-matched obese adults who underwent OGTT. Group III consisted of nine adult PWS subjects and eight age-, sex-, and weight-matched obese adults who underwent frequently sampled IVGTT (FSIVGTT). During the OGTT in the pediatric group, fasting (86 +/- 3 v 89 +/- 2 mg/dL), peak (144 +/- 11 v 147 +/- 4 mg/dL), and total area under the curve (AUC) (6,984 +/- 1,320 v 6,963 +/- 615 mg/dL x min) glucose levels were not significantly different in PWS versus obese children, respectively. In contrast, fasting (20 +/- 6 v 37 +/- 4 microU/mL), peak (114 +/- 24 v 214 +/- 23 microU [correction of mU]/mL), and total AUC (12,673 +/- 2,176 v 26,734 +/- 2,608 microU/mL microU/mL min) insulin levels were significantly lower in pediatric PWS. During the OGTT in the adult groups, neither fasting insulin (16.7 +/- 2.8 v 13.5 +/- 2.5 microU/mL) nor total AUC for insulin (10,664 +/- 1,955 v 11,623 +/- 1,584 microU/mL x min) were significantly different in adult PWS and obese groups. During the IVGTT in adults, both first-phase (138 +/- 42 v 454 +/- 102 microU/mL x min) and second-phase (295 +/- 66 v 1,015 +/- 231 microU/mL x min) insulin release were significantly reduced in PWS subjects despite similar glucose levels. Similarly, first-phase (8.6 +/- 2.3 v 21 +/- 4.6 ng/dL x min) and second-phase (47 +/- 4.6 v 75 +/- 14 ng/dL x min) C-peptide responses were also significantly reduced in PWS subjects. In contrast, mean HIE and IC was 33% higher in PWS subjects versus obese controls (15.4 +/- 1.5 v 10.3 +/- 1.6). Similarly, poststimulation HIE and IC was significantly greater (5.2 +/- 0.8 v 2.4 +/- 0.4) in the PWS group compared with the obese group (P < .01). In summary, this study demonstrates that nondiabetic PWS subjects manifest (1) a reduced beta-cell response to glucose stimulation, (2) a significantly increased HIE compared with obese controls, and (3) a dissociation of obesity and insulin resistance, in contrast to normal obese subjects. We conclude that glucoregulatory mechanisms are different in obese PWS versus non-PWS subjects. "
673,35010994,"Given their widespread use and their notorious effects on the lining of gut cells, including the enteroendocrine cells, we explored if chronic exposure to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) affects metabolic balance in a mouse model of NSAID-induced enteropathy. We administered variable NSAIDs to C57Blk/6J mice through intragastric gavage and measured their energy balance, glucose hemostasis, and GLP-1 levels. We treated them with Exendin-9 and Exendin-4 and ran a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. Chronic administration of multiple NSAIDs to C57Blk/6J mice induces ileal ulcerations and weight loss in animals consuming a high-fat diet. Despite losing weight, NSAID-treated mice exhibit no improvement in their glucose tolerance. Furthermore, glucose-stimulated (glucagon-like peptide -1) GLP-1 is significantly attenuated in the NSAID-treated groups. In addition, Exendin-9-a GLP-1 receptor antagonist-worsens glucose tolerance in the control group but not in the NSAID-treated group. Finally, the hyper-insulinemic euglycemic clamp study shows that endogenous glucose production, total glucose disposal, and their associated insulin levels were similar among an ibuprofen-treated group and its control. Exendin-4, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, reduces insulin levels in the ibuprofen group compared to their controls for the same glucose exchange rates. Chronic NSAID use can induce small intestinal ulcerations, which can affect intestinal GLP-1 production, hepatic insulin sensitivity, and consequently, hepatic glucose production. "
674,24559830,"Cupping worldwide has been part of traditional medicine systems and is in the western world used as CAM therapy mainly for treating pain syndromes. The mode of action is up to now unclear. In order to investigate its mechanism we measured in parallel metabolic changes in the tissue under the cupping glass and pressure pain thresholds. In 12 volunteers (6 healthy subjects and 6 patients with chronic neck pain) a microdialysis system was implanted subcutaneously on both sides (left and right) above the trapezius muscle. After baseline measures cupping was performed at one randomly selected side (left or right), the other side served as control. Every 20 min during baseline measures and for 280 min after cupping, microdialysis probes for detection of lactate, pyruvate, glucose and glycerin were taken. In addition, pain thresholds were measured before and after cupping with algometry. Cupping resulted in a strong increase of lactate (beginning 160 min after cupping until the end of the measurements) and the lactate/pyruvate ratio, indicating an anaerobe metabolism in the surrounding tissue. Baseline pain thresholds were non-significantly lower in neck pain patients compared to healthy controls and slightly increased immediately after cupping (p<0.05 compared to baseline close to the area of cupping in healthy subjects and on the foot in neck pain patients). After 280 min no more significant changes of pain thresholds were detected. Cupping induces >280 min lasting anaerobe metabolism in the subcutaneous tissue and increases immediate pressure pain thresholds in some areas. "
675,15280017,"Glucose re-addition to carbohydrate starved yeast cells leads to a transient elevation of eytosolic calcium (TECC). Concomitantly, a cytosolic proton extrusion occurs through the activation of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase and the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPases. This study addressed the dissipation of the TECC through intracellular compartmentalization and the possible affects of the H(+)-ATPases on this process. Both the vacuole and the Golgi-ER apparatus were found to play important roles in distributing calcium to internal stores. Additionally, the inhibition of cytosolic proton extrusion augmented cytosolic calcium responses. A model where pH dependent cytosolic calcium buffering plays an important role in the dissipation of the TECC in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is proposed. "
676,35285025,"Asthma, a major non-communicable disease, affects both adults and children and is associated with high morbidity compared with other chronic diseases. The glycolysis-associated activation of type 2 helper T (Th2) cells is the critical immunopathological mechanism involved in asthma deterioration. Long-term use of steroids as a medical treatment for asthma induces side effects and resistance. Pterostilbene (PS), a stilbenoid compound found in blueberry and vines, exhibits antihyperglycemic and anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, we hypothesized that the modulation of T cell immunity by PS may be an applicable intervention to treat asthma. Airway hyperresponsiveness, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 levels, IgE, IgG, pulmonary infiltrated monocytes and eosinophils, and mucosubstances were measured in house dust mite (HDM)-induced asthmatic mice under PS treatment. Bioenergetic metabolism, PI3K-mTOR signalling, GATA3 expression and histone acetylation in PS-treated Th2 cells were investigated. PS improved HDM-induced pulmonary allergic airway inflammation by inhibiting Th2 cell and eosinophil accumulation in HDM asthmatic mice both in the preventive and therapeutic models. Targeting glycolysis resulted in IL-4 inhibition via the downregulation of mTOR, GATA3 and histone acetylation in PS-treated Th2 cells. Glucose supplementation reversed the inhibitory effect of PS on Th2 cells in vitro. Adoptive transfer with glucose-treated Th2 cells enhanced Th2 activation and eosinophilic accumulation in PS-treated asthmatic mice. Furthermore, PS significantly inhibited IL-4 production of CD4 "
677,29718253,"To objectively appraise evidence for possible adverse effects of long-term statin therapy on glucose homeostasis, cognitive, renal and hepatic function, and risk for haemorrhagic stroke or cataract. A literature search covering 2000-2017 was performed. The Panel critically appraised the data and agreed by consensus on the categorization of reported adverse effects. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and genetic studies show that statin therapy is associated with a modest increase in the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus (about one per thousand patient-years), generally defined by laboratory findings (glycated haemoglobin ≥6.5); this risk is significantly higher in the metabolic syndrome or prediabetes. Statin treatment does not adversely affect cognitive function, even at very low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and is not associated with clinically significant deterioration of renal function, or development of cataract. Transient increases in liver enzymes occur in 0.5-2% of patients taking statins but are not clinically relevant; idiosyncratic liver injury due to statins is very rare and causality difficult to prove. The evidence base does not support an increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke in individuals without cerebrovascular disease; a small increase in risk was suggested by the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction of Cholesterol Levels study in subjects with prior stroke but has not been confirmed in the substantive evidence base of RCTs, cohort studies and case-control studies. Long-term statin treatment is remarkably safe with a low risk of clinically relevant adverse effects as defined above; statin-associated muscle symptoms were discussed in a previous Consensus Statement. Importantly, the established cardiovascular benefits of statin therapy far outweigh the risk of adverse effects. "
678,28276778,"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) affects many women of child-bearing age and is characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory and metabolic dysfunction. A primary treatment goal is weight reduction. The weight loss effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), previously demonstrated in diabetic and obese non-diabetic patients, offer a unique opportunity to expand the medical options available to PCOS patients. Areas covered: Available clinical trials of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist therapy in PCOS were reviewed. Literature was searched from PubMed using appropriate search terms up to November 2016. Expert commentary: The available studies of GLP-1 RA therapy in the treatment of excess body weight in women with PCOS demonstrate that exenatide and liraglutide are effective in weight reduction either as monotherapy or in combination with metformin. A few studies showed that androgens may be modestly decreased and menstrual frequency may be increased. Eating behavior may be improved with liraglutide therapy. Glucose parameters are generally improved. GLP-1RAs were well-tolerated, with nausea being the most significant adverse side effect. Barriers to utilization may be the short duration studies, lack of familiarity of the medication, the route of administration (injection) and the variable outcomes on ovulation and hyperandrogenism.

679,23294025,"Untreated glycogen storage disease (GSD)-1a patients experience hypoglycaemia and growth retardation. The present study examined the effects of dietary interventions on the maintenance of normoglycaemia. Clinical trials were identified from EMBASE (January 1980 to November 2011), MEDLINE (January 1948 to November 2011) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2011, Issue 4). The intermittent administration of uncooked cornstarch was compared with: (i) continuous nocturnal feeding of dextrose; (ii) modified uncooked cornstarch; and (iii) dextrose and an uncooked cornstarch-dextrose mixture. One author extracted the data, and assessed the trial eligibility and risk of bias. Quality assessment and data extraction were conducted and checked independently. Of 41 articles retrieved, five controlled trials (49 participants) were identified with follow-up at 2 days to 14 years. Results from three nonrandomised controlled trials comparing uncooked cornstarch with continuous nocturnal feeding of dextrose were pooled in a meta-analysis based on a fixed-effect model. Twenty-six participants (three trials) receiving uncooked cornstarch showed a significant increase in blood glucose concentration: mean difference (MD) 0.62 mmol L(-1) [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23-1.00] (P = 0.002), 21 (two trials) increased serum insulin: MD 62.37 pmol L(-1) (95% CI = 32.19-92.55) (P < 0.0001) and 22 (three trials) increased plasma total cholesterol: MD 0.68 mmol L(-1) (95% CI = 0.17- 1.20) (P = 0.01) compared to continuous nocturnal feeding of dextrose. Twenty-eight subjects (three trials) showed decreased plasma lactate after nocturnal feeding: MD -0.42 mmol L(-1) (95% CI = -0.58 to -0.25) (P < 0.00001). Short- to long-term overnight intermittent administration of uncooked cornstarch prevents nocturnal hypoglycaemia in GSD-1a children more effectively than continuous nocturnal feeding of dextrose. "
680,21222652,"Metabolic complications arising from excessive fructose consumption are increasing dramatically even in young children, but little is known about ontogenetic mechanisms regulating Glut5 [glucose transporter 5; encoded by the Slc2a5 (solute carrier family 2 member 5) gene]. Glut5 expression is low postnatally and does not increase, unless luminal fructose and systemic glucocorticoids are present, until ≥ 14 days of age, suggesting substrate-inducible age- and hormone-sensitive regulation. In the present study, we perfused intestines of 10- and 20-day-old rats with either fructose or glucose then analysed the binding of Pol II (RNA polymerase II) and GR (glucocorticoid receptor), as well as acetylation of histones H3 and H4 by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Abundance of Glut5 mRNA increased only with fructose perfusion and age, a pattern that matched that of Pol II binding and histone H3 acetylation to the Glut5 promoter. Although many regions of the Glut5 promoter respond to developmental signals, fewer regions perceive dietary signals. Age- but not fructose-dependent expression of Sglt1 [sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter 1 encoded by the Slc5a1(solute carrier family 5 member 1) gene] also correlated with Pol II binding and histone H3 acetylation. In contrast, G6Pase (glucose-6-phosphatase; encoded by the G6pc gene) expression, which decreases with age and increases with fructose, is associated only with age-dependent changes in histone H4 acetylation. Induction of Glut5 during ontogenetic development appears to be specifically mediated by GR translocation to the nucleus and subsequent binding to the Glut5 promoter, whereas the glucocorticoid-independent regulation of Sglt1 by age was not associated with any GR binding to the Sglt1 promoter.

681,19726707,"The C57Bl/6J mouse strain, the genetic background of many transgenic and gene knockout models, is salt sensitive and resistant to renal injury. We tested the hypothesis that renal dopaminergic function is defective in C57Bl/6J mice. On normal NaCl (0.8%, 1 wk) diet, anesthetized and conscious (telemetry) blood pressures were similar in C57Bl/6J and SJL/J mice. High NaCl (6%, 1 wk) increased blood pressure (approximately 30%) in C57Bl/6J but not in SJL/J mice and urinary dopamine to greater extent in SJL/J than in C57Bl/6J mice. Absolute and fractional sodium excretions were lower in SJL/J than in C57Bl/6J mice. The blood pressure-natriuresis plot was shifted to the right in C57Bl/6J mice. Renal expressions of D(1)-like (D(1)R and D(5)R) and angiotensin II AT(1) receptors were similar on normal salt, but high salt increased D(5)R only in C57Bl/6J. GRK4 expression was lower on normal but higher on high salt in C57Bl/6J than in SJL/J mice. Salt increased the excretion of microalbumin and 8-isoprostane (oxidative stress marker) and the degree of renal injury to a greater extent in SJL/J than in C57Bl/6J mice. A D(1)-like receptor agonist increased sodium excretion whereas a D(1)-like receptor antagonist decreased sodium excretion in SJL/J but not in C57Bl/6J mice. In contrast, parathyroid hormone had a similar natriuretic effect in both strains. These results show that defective D(1)-like receptor function is a major cause of salt sensitivity in C57Bl/6J mice, decreased renal dopamine production might also contribute. The relative resistance to renal injury of C57Bl/6J may be a consequence of decreased production of reactive oxygen species. "
682,33765582,"Protein O-GlcNAcylation is a dynamic post-translational protein modification that regulates fundamental cellular functions in both normal physiology and diseases. The levels of protein O-GlcNAcylation are determined by flux of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), which is a branch of glycolysis, and are directly controlled by a pair of enzymes: O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA). An increase in protein O-GlcNAcylation has been shown to have protective effects on ischemia-related insults in the heart and brain. To determine whether O-GlcNAcylation plays a beneficial role in ischemia-reperfusion (IR)-induced intestinal injury, we used pharmacological manipulation of O-GlcNAc to induce loss- and gain-of-function conditions and evaluated the viability and apoptosis of intestinal epithelioid cells in an in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model and tissue injury grade in a small intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (SIIR) mouse model. We found that 1) Upregulation of O-GlcNAcylation induced by glucosamine (GlcN, increase in HBP flux) or thiamet G (an OGA inhibitor) enhanced intestinal cell survival in the OGD model. In contrast, downregulation of O-GlcNAcylation induced by DON (due to a reduction in HBP flux) or OMSI-1 (an OGT inhibitor) made the cells more susceptible to hypoxia injury. 2) Reducing the increase in O-GlcNAcylation levels with a combination of either GlcN with DON or thiamet G with OMSI-1 partly canceled its protective effect on OGD-induced cell injury. 3) In the in vivo SIIR mouse model, GlcN augmented intestinal protein O-GlcNAcylation and significantly alleviated intestinal injury by inhibiting cell apoptosis. These results indicate that acute increases in protein O-GlcNAcylation confer protection against intestinal ischemia insults, suggesting that O-GlcNAcylation, as an endogenous stress sensor, could be a universal protective mechanism and could be a potential therapeutic target for intestinal ischemic disease.

683,37523800,"Systematic reviews, meta-analyses and Mendelian randomization studies suggest that cardiometabolic diseases may be associated with COVID-19 risk and prognosis, with evidence implicating insulin resistance (IR) as a common biological mechanism. As driving factors for IR, we examined body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) among postmenopausal women in association with COVID-19 outcomes (positivity and hospitalization), and the role of glucose homeostasis as a mediator of this relationship. Associations of BMI and WC at baseline (1993-1998) with COVID-19 outcomes collected at Survey 1 (June-December, 2020) and/or Survey 2 (September-December, 2021) were evaluated among 42,770 Women's Health Initiative (WHI) participants (baseline age: 59.36 years) of whom 16,526 self-reported having taken ≥1 COVID-19 test, with 1242 reporting ≥1 positive COVID-19 test and 362 reporting ≥1 COVID-19 hospitalization. We applied logistic regression and causal mediation analyses to sub-samples with available fasting biomarkers of glucose homeostasis (glucose, insulin, Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance, Homeostasis Model Assessment for β-cell function, Quantitative Insulin-sensitivity Check Index, Triglyceride-Glucose index (TyG)) at baseline, whereby 57 of 759 reported COVID-19 test positivity and 23 of 1896 reported COVID-19 hospitalization. In fully adjusted models, higher BMI, WC and TyG were associated with COVID-19 test positivity and hospitalization. Glucose concentrations mediated associations of BMI and WC with COVID-19 positivity, whereas TyG mediated BMI and WC's associations with COVID-19 hospitalization. Obesity and central obesity markers collected an average of 24 years prior were associated with COVID-19 outcomes among postmenopausal women. Glucose concentration and TyG partly mediated these associations. "
684,39153791,"Postpartum anaemia is often caused by iron deficiency with onset during the antepartum period and can be exacerbated by excessive blood loss at birth. Its prevalence is estimated as 50-80% in low-income and middle-income countries. It poses adverse consequences on the mother and negatively impacts her ability to care for her newborn. Prompt treatment of postpartum anaemia is thus important. Adherence to oral iron is reportedly low in Nigeria due to its side effects and forgetfulness by the mothers. Intravenous iron such as ferric carboxymaltose, given as a single dose, might help overcome adherence issues, but investigation in a high-quality randomised control trial in Nigeria is first required while evaluation of challenges around its implementation is also warranted. To determine the clinical effectiveness, tolerability and safety, of using intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (intervention) vs oral ferrous sulphate (control) for treating moderate to severe iron deficiency anaemia in postpartum women and to evaluate implementation of ferric carboxymaltose in treating postpartum anaemia in Nigeria. This study is an open-label randomised controlled trial with a concurrent implementation study. It is a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation design conducted in four states across Northern and Southern Nigeria. A total of 1400 eligible and consenting women with postpartum moderate to severe anaemia (haemoglobin concentration <100 g/L) will be randomised to intravenous ferric carboxymaltose; a single dose at 20 mg/kg to a maximum of 1000 mg infusion administered at enrolment (intervention) or oral ferrous sulphate; 200 mg (65 mg elemental iron) two times per day from enrolment until 6 weeks postpartum (control). The primary outcome, proportion of participants who are anaemic (Hb <110 g/L) at 6 weeks postpartum will be analysed by intention-to-treat. Haemoglobin concentration, full blood count, serum iron, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation and total iron binding capacity will be measured at specific intervals. Implementation outcomes such as acceptability and feasibility of using ferric carboxymaltose for postpartum anaemia treatment in Nigeria will be assessed. This study is approved by the ethics committee of the teaching hospitals, Ministry of Health of the four states as required, National Health Research Ethics Committee and the drug regulatory agency, National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC). Findings of this research will be presented at conferences and will be published in international peer-reviewed journals and shared with stakeholders within and outside Nigeria.

685,35236789,"Long-term hypercaloric diets may adversely affect the development of ovarian follicles. We investigated the effects of high sugar (HS), high fat low sugar (HFLS), and high fat normal sugar (HFNS) diets on the ovarian follicle development in mice fed with these diets as compared to those fed with normal diet (control) for 180 days. Body weight, gonadal fat, glucose, lipid, insulin, estrous cycle, sex hormones and ovarian tissues were examined, and metabolism-related protein expression in the ovaries was evaluated by immunoblotting. The mice fed with hypercaloric diets showed hyperinsulinemia and hyperlipidemia, and exhibited heavier body and gonadal fat weights, longer estrous cycles, and fewer preantral and antral follicles than mice fed with normal diet. The sex hormone levels in the blood were similar to those in controls, except for significantly elevated estradiol levels in the HS diet group. The AMPKα phosphorylation was reduced, while AKT phosphorylation and caspase-3 levels were increased in the ovarian tissues of mice in all three hypercaloric diet groups than those in control. Taken together, the results suggest hyperinsulinemia and hyperlipidemia as possible mechanisms that impair the development of ovarian follicles in response to long-term exposure to unhealthy hypercaloric diets.

687,38347169,"Epidemiological evidence suggests an association between CS and offspring metabolic syndrome (MetS), but whether a causal relationship exists is unknown. In this study, timed-mated Wistar rat dams were randomly assigned to cesarean section (CS), vaginal delivery (VD), and surrogate groups. The offspring from both CS and VD groups were reared by surrogate dams until weaning, and weaned male offspring from both groups were randomly assigned to receive normal diet (ND) or high-fat/high-fructose diet (HFF) ad libitum for 39 weeks. By the end of study, CS-ND offspring gained 17.8% more weight than VD-ND offspring, while CS-HFF offspring gained 36.4% more weight than VD-HFF offspring. Compared with VD-ND offspring, CS-ND offspring tended to have increased triglycerides (0.27 mmol/l, 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.50), total cholesterol (0.30 mmol/l, -0.08 to 0.68), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (0.30 mmol/l, -0.01 to 0.60); more pronounced differences were observed between CS-HFF and VD-HFF offspring in these indicators (triglyceride, 0.66 mmol/l, 0.35 to 0.97; total cholesterol, 0.46 mmol/l, 0.13 to 0.79; and FPG, 0.55 mmol/l, 0.13 to 0.98). CS offspring were more prone to adverse metabolic profile and HFF might exacerbate this condition, indicating the association between CS and MetS is likely to be causal. Whether the observed associations between CS and MetS in non-randomized human studies are causally relevant remains undetermined. Compared with vaginally born offspring rats, CS born offspring gained more body weight and tended to have compromised lipid profiles and abnormal insulin sensitivity, suggesting a causal relationship between CS and MetS that may be further amplified by a high-fat/high-fructose diet. Due to the high prevalence of CS births globally, greater clinical consideration must be given to the potential adverse effects of CS, and whether these risks should be made known to patients in clinical practice merits evaluation.

688,33627831,"βA3/A1-crystallin, a lens protein that is also expressed in astrocytes, is produced as βA3 and βA1-crystallin isoforms by leaky ribosomal scanning. In a previous human proteome high-throughput array, we found that βA3/A1-crystallin interacts with protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a key regulator of glucose metabolism. This prompted us to explore possible roles of βA3/A1-crystallin in metabolism of retinal astrocytes. We found that βA1-crystallin acts as an uncompetitive inhibitor of PTP1B, but βA3-crystallin does not. Loss of βA1-crystallin in astrocytes triggers metabolic abnormalities and inflammation. In CRISPR/cas9 gene-edited βA1-knockdown (KD) mice, but not in βA3-knockout (KO) mice, the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic retinopathy (DR)-like phenotype is exacerbated. Here, we have identified βA1-crystallin as a regulator of PTP1B; loss of this regulation may be a new mechanism by which astrocytes contribute to DR. Interestingly, proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) patients showed reduced βA1-crystallin and higher levels of PTP1B in the vitreous humor. "
689,33526784,"Recent advances in cell-free synthetic biology have given rise to gene circuit-based sensors with the potential to provide decentralized and low-cost molecular diagnostics. However, it remains a challenge to deliver this sensing capacity into the hands of users in a practical manner. Here, we leverage the glucose meter, one of the most widely available point-of-care sensing devices, to serve as a universal reader for these decentralized diagnostics. We describe a molecular translator that can convert the activation of conventional gene circuit-based sensors into a glucose output that can be read by off-the-shelf glucose meters. We show the development of new glucogenic reporter systems, multiplexed reporter outputs and detection of nucleic acid targets down to the low attomolar range. Using this glucose-meter interface, we demonstrate the detection of a small-molecule analyte; sample-to-result diagnostics for typhoid, paratyphoid A/B; and show the potential for pandemic response with nucleic acid sensors for SARS-CoV-2.

690,27479157,"Hypothermic kidney storage causes preservation injury and is poorly tolerated by renal grafts. We investigated whether static cold storage (SCS) can be safely replaced with a novel technique of pressure-controlled normothermic ex vivo kidney perfusion (NEVKP) in heart-beating donor kidney transplantation. Right kidneys were removed from 30 kg Yorkshire pigs in a model of heart-beating donation and either preserved in cold histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution for 8 hours (n = 5), or subjected to 8 hours of pressure-controlled NEVKP (n = 5) followed by renal heterotopic autotransplantation. During NEVKP, physiologic perfusion conditions were maintained with low intrarenal resistance and normal electrolyte and pH parameters. Aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase as injury markers were below the detectable analyzer range (<4 and <100 U/L, respectively). Perfusate lactate concentration decreased from baseline until the end of perfusion (10.38 ± 0.76 mmol/L vs 1.22 ± 0.26 mmol/L; P < 0.001). Posttransplantation, animals transplanted with NEVKP versus SCS grafts demonstrated similar serum creatinine peak levels (NEVKP, 2.0 ± 0.5 vs SCS 2.7 ± 0.7 mg/dL; P = 0.11) and creatinine clearance on day 10 (NEVKP, 65.9 ± 18.8 mL/min vs SCS 61.2 ± 15.6 mL/min; P = 0.74). After 10 days of follow-up, animals transplanted with NEVKP grafts had serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen values comparable to their basal levels (P = 0.49 and P = 0.59), whereas animals transplanted with SCS grafts had persistently elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen when compared with basal levels (P = 0.01 and P = 0.03). Continuous pressure-controlled NEVKP is feasible and safe in good quality heart-beating donor kidney grafts. It maintains a physiologic environment and excellent graft function ex vivo during preservation without causing graft injury. "
691,2288230,"Glucose and steroids have been used in the treatment of children with Reye's syndrome, while carnitine and coenzyme Q10 have been the subject of some recent studies which suggest that these agents may have a role in the treatment of Reye's syndrome and Reye-like syndrome due to margosa oil poisoning. Because of the paucity of causes of Reye's syndrome seen at any one centre, the clinical variability of the disease, and limited knowledge of definite aetiologic factors, controlled clinical trials are not easy to carry out or to interpret in human cases. These caveats were overcome by evaluation of these four treatment modalities in an established margosa-oil-induced animal model of Reye's syndrome. Effectiveness of the treatment modalities was determined from clinical response and histopathologic parameters (grading of light microscopic fatty changes and ultrastructural changes in the hepatocytes). Results show that carnitine per se produces a small improvement in survival, but statistically, more significant benefit is seen with glucose administration. Carnitine plus 10% dextrose appears to produce better results. Evaluation of coenzyme Q10 and carnitine on histopathologic parameters in the liver after a sublethal dose of margosa oil showed no obvious ameliorating effect on liver pathology. Steroids (dexamethasone/methylprednisolone) had no beneficial effects in reducing mortality, affecting glycogen storage or lipid accumulation. Changes in the mitochondria, ribosomes and endoplasmic reticulum were unaltered from the groups treated with margosa oil alone. While glucose and carnitine supplements appear to be beneficial, the other modes of therapy do not seem to hold much promise in the treatment of Reye-like syndrome in the margosa-oil-induced animal model.

692,38942091,"Bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs) Tas2r108 gene possesses a high abundance in mouse kidney; however, the biological functions of Tas2r108 encoded receptor TAS2Rs member 4 (TAS2R4) are still unknown. In the present study, we found that mouse TAS2R4 (mTAS2R4) signaling was inactivated in chronic high glucose-stimulated mouse podocyte cell line MPC, evidenced by the decreased protein expressions of mTAS2R4 and phospholipase C β2 (PLCβ2), a key downstream molecule of mTAS2R4 signaling. Nonetheless, agonism of mTAS2R4 by quinine recovered mTAS2R4 and PLCβ2 levels, and increased podocyte cell viability as well as protein expressions of ZO-1 and nephrin, biomarkers of podocyte slit diaphragm, in high glucose-cultured MPC cells. However, blockage of mTAS2R4 signaling with mTAS2R4 blockers γ-aminobutyric acid and abscisic acid, a Gβγ inhibitor Gallein, or a PLCβ2 inhibitor U73122 all abolished the effects of quinine on NLRP3 inflammasome and p-NF-κB p65 as well as the functional podocyte proteins in MPC cells in a high glucose condition. Furthermore, knockdown of mTAS2R4 with lentivirus-carrying Tas2r108 shRNA also ablated the effect of quinine on the key molecules of the above inflammatory signalings and podocyte functions in high glucose-cultured MPC cells. In summary, we demonstrated that activation of TAS2R4 signaling alleviated the podocyte injury caused by chronic high glucose, and inhibition of NF-κB p65 and NLRP3 inflammasome mediated the protective effects of TAS2R4 activation on podocytes. Moreover, activation of TAS2R4 signaling could be an important strategy for prevention and treatment of diabetic kidney disease. "
693,32817701,"This study assessed within-trial cost-effectiveness of a shared care program (SC, n = 339) for pregnancy outcomes compared to usual care (UC, n = 361), as implemented in a randomized trial of Chinese women with gestational diabetes (GDM). SC consisted of an individualized dietary advice and physical activity counseling program. The UC was a one-time group education program. The effectiveness was measured by number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one macrosomia/large for gestational age (LGA) infant. The cost-effectiveness was measured by incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in terms of cost (2012 Chinese Yuan/US dollar) per case of macrosomia and LGA prevented. The study took both a health care system and a societal perspective. This study found that the NNT was 16/14 for macrosomia/LGA. The incremental cost for treating a pregnant woman was ¥1,877 ($298) from a health care system perspective and ¥2,056 ($327) from a societal perspective. The cost of preventing a case of macrosomia/LGA from the two corresponding perspectives were ¥30,032/¥26,278 ($4,775/$4,178) and ¥32,896/¥28,784 ($5,230/$4,577), respectively. Considering the potential severe adverse health and economic consequences of a macrosomia/LGA infant, our findings suggest that implementing this lifestyle intervention for women with GDM is an efficient use of health care resources.

696,27494059,"We examined the effect of mild (Mi; ∼25%) and moderate (Mo; ∼50%) maternal calorie restriction (MCR) vs ad libitum-fed controls on placental glucose and leucine transport impacting fetal growth potential. We observed in MiMCR a compensatory increase in transplacental (TP) glucose transport due to increased placental glucose transporter isoform (GLUT)-3 but no change in GLUT1 protein concentrations. This change was paralleled by increased glut3 mRNA and 5-hydroxymethylated cytosines with enhanced recruitment of histone 3 lysine demethylase to the glut3 gene locus. To assess the biologic relevance of placental GLUT1, we also examined glut1 heterozygous null vs wild-type mice and observed no difference in placental GLUT3 and TP or intraplacental glucose and leucine transport. Both MCR states led to a graded decrease in TP and intraplacental leucine transport, with a decline in placental L amino acid transporter isoform 2 (LAT2) concentrations and increased microRNA-149 (targets LAT2) and microRNA-122 (targets GLUT3) expression in MoMCR alone. These changes were accompanied by a step-wise reduction in uterine and umbilical artery Doppler blood flow with decreased fetal left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening. We conclude that MiMCR transactivates placental GLUT3 toward preserving TP glucose transport in the face of reduced leucine transport. This contrasts MoMCR in which a reduction in placental GLUT3 mediated glucose transport with a reciprocal increase in miR-122 expression was encountered. A posttranscriptional reduction in LAT2-mediated leucine transport also occurred with enhanced miR-149 expression. Both MCR states, although not affecting placental GLUT1, resulted in uteroplacental insufficiency and fetal growth restriction with compromised cardiovascular health. "
697,11882508,"In neonatal pigs, the feeding-induced stimulation of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle, but not liver, can be reproduced by insulin infusion when essential amino acids and glucose are maintained at fasting levels. In the present study, 7- and 26-day-old pigs were studied during 1) fasting, 2) hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic-euaminoacidemic clamps, 3) euinsulinemic-euglycemic-hyperaminoacidemic clamps, and 4) hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic-hyperaminoacidemic clamps. Amino acids were clamped using a new amino acid mixture enriched in nonessential amino acids. Tissue protein synthesis was measured using a flooding dose of L-[4-(3)H]phenylalanine. In 7-day-old pigs, insulin infusion alone increased protein synthesis in various skeletal muscles (from +35 to +64%), with equivalent contribution of myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic proteins, as well as cardiac muscle (+50%), skin (+34%), and spleen (+26%). Amino acid infusion alone increased protein synthesis in skeletal muscles (from +28 to +50%), also with equivalent contribution of myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic proteins, as well as liver (+27%), pancreas (+28%), and kidney (+10%). An elevation of both insulin and amino acids did not have an additive effect. Similar qualitative results were obtained in 26-day-old pigs, but the magnitude of the stimulation of protein synthesis by insulin and/or amino acids was lower. The results suggest that, in the neonate, the stimulation of protein synthesis by feeding is mediated by either amino acids or insulin in most tissues; however, the feeding-induced stimulation of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle is uniquely regulated by both insulin and amino acids.

698,9023461,"The lactulose H2-breath test is the most widely used non-invasive approach for evaluation of orocoecal transit time (OCTT). In the present study, doubly-labelled lactose-[13C, 15N]ureide (DLLU) was synthesized to investigate the OCTT in comparison to the conventional lactulose H2-breath test. Additionally the bacterial breakdown rate (BBR) and rate of elimination and the metabolic pathways of the cleavage products of DLLU (13CO2, [15N]urea, and 15NH3) were investigated. In a first study, DLLU was administered as a single oral-pulse-labelling (dosage: one gram) either without and after pretreatment of five grams of unlabelled lactoseureide (LU) on the day prior to the study to twelve healthy adult volunteers after breakfast. Breath and urine were collected in one and two hour-intervals, respectively, over a one-day period. 13C-enrichment in breath as well as 15N-enrichment in urine fractions were measured by continuous flow-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (CF-IRMS). In a second study, lactulose was administered to the same subjects (dosage: ten grams). Breath was collected in quarter, half and one hour-intervals over a ten hour-period. Hydrogen concentration in breath was analysed using an electrochemical detector. The comparison of the lactose-[13C]ureide 13CO2-breath test and the lactulose H2-breath test showed that the mean increase of the 13C-enrichment in CO2 occurred 1.18 h later than the mean increase of H2 in breath. The resulting OCTTs derived from the two methods were 3.02 +/- 1.4 and 1.84 +/- 0.5 h (P < 0.05) and the corresponding BRs were 9.63 +/- 3.4 and 6.07 +/- 1.7 h (P < 0.01), respectively. The 15N-enrichment of urinary urea and ammonia without and after pretreatment with LU started between two and three hours after DLLU-administration. The cumulative percentage urinary excretion of the 15N- and 13C-tracer was 29.9% and 13.6% respectively, and was slightly increased after LU-pretreatment to 32.1% and 14.6% of the dose administered. A total of 35.2% of the 13C was found to be exhaled and remained approximately constant after LU-pretreatment (36.2%). The use of the lactulose H2-breath test for evaluation of the OCTT showed a statistically significant shortening of 1.18 h in comparison to the lactose-[13C]ureide 13CO2-breath test in healthy adults. The most important limitations of the lactulose H2-breath test are its low specificity and sensitivity due to dose-dependent accelerations of OCTT, interfering H2-rise from malabsorbed dietary fibre and H2-non-producers. In contrast, our lactose-[13C]ureide 13CO2-breath test was confirmed to avoid these disadvantages and to yield reliable results. This test is recommended especially if higher sensitivity and specificity is required, if IRMS-technique is available and if lactulose H2-tests lead to insufficient results. "
699,20566664,"Pancreatic-derived factor (PANDER, FAM3B) is a pancreatic islet-specific cytokine-like protein that is secreted from beta-cells upon glucose stimulation. The biological function of PANDER is unknown, and to address this we generated and characterized a PANDER knockout mouse. To generate the PANDER knockout mouse, the PANDER gene was disrupted and its expression was inhibited by homologous recombination via replacement of the first two exons, secretion signal peptide and transcriptional start site, with the neomycin gene. PANDER(-/-) mice were then phenotyped by a number of in vitro and in vivo tests to evaluate potential effects on glucose regulation, insulin sensitivity, and beta-cell morphology and function. Glucose tolerance tests demonstrated significantly higher blood glucose levels in PANDER(-/-) versus wild-type male mice. To identify the mechanism of the glucose intolerance, insulin sensitivity and pancreatic beta-cell function were examined. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps and insulin tolerance testing showed similar insulin sensitivity for both the PANDER(-/-) and wild-type mice. The in vivo insulin response following intraperitoneal glucose injection surprisingly produced significantly higher insulin levels in the PANDER(-/-) mice, whereas insulin release was blunted with arginine administration. Islet perifusion and calcium imaging studies showed abnormal responses of the PANDER(-/-) islets to glucose stimulation. In contrast, neither islet architecture nor insulin content was impacted by the loss of PANDER. Interestingly, the elevated insulin levels identified in vivo were attributed to decreased hepatic insulin clearance in the PANDER(-/-) islets. Taken together, these results demonstrated decreased pancreatic beta-cell function in the PANDER(-/-) mouse. These results support a potential role of PANDER in the pancreatic beta-cell for regulation or facilitation of insulin secretion. "
700,16925864,"Butyrate is an important substrate for maintenance of colonic health and oligofructose fermentation by human faecal bacteria can increase butyrate production in vitro. However, oligofructose appears to be fermented by mainly acetate and lactate-producing bacteria rather than butyrate-producing bacteria. Isotope labelling studies using [U-(13)C(6)]glucose were used to show that (13)C(2) and (13)C(4) were the major labelled butyrate species produced from glucose fermentation, via [(13)C(2)]acetate-acetyl CoA as intermediate. Bacterial interconversion reactions were quantified and acetate conversion to butyrate and lactate conversion to acetate, propionate and butyrate were observed. Addition of oligofructose to faecal batch cultures significantly increased butyrate production. Of the newly synthesised butyrate from oligofructose fermentation, 80 % was derived from interconversion of extracellular acetate and lactate, with acetate being quantitatively more significant. Carbohydrates, such as oligofructose, have prebiotic properties. In addition, oligofructose selectively stimulates the bacterial conversion of acetate and lactate to butyrate. Carbohydrates with similar properties represent a refinement of the prebiotic definition, termed butyrogenic prebiotics, because of their additional functionality. "
701,32890688,"Humans are ubiquitously exposed bisphenol A (BPA), and epidemiological studies show a positive association between BPA exposure and diabetes risk, but the impact of parental exposure on offspring diabetes risk in humans is unknown. Our previous studies in mice show disruption of metabolic health upon maternal BPA exposure. The current study was undertaken to determine whether exposure in fathers causes adverse metabolic consequences in offspring. Male C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to BPA in the diet beginning at 5 weeks of age resulting in the following dietary exposure groups: Control (0 μg/kg/day), Lower BPA (10 μg/kg/day) and Upper BPA (10 mg/kg/day). After 12 weeks of dietary exposure, males were mated to control females. Mothers and offspring were maintained on the control diet. Post-pubertal paternal BPA exposure did not affect offspring body weight, body composition or glucose tolerance. However, when fathers were exposed to BPA during gestation and lactation, their female offspring displayed impaired glucose tolerance in the absence of compromised in vivo insulin sensitivity or reduced ex vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Male offspring exhibited normal glucose tolerance. Taken together, these studies show there is an early window of susceptibility in which paternal BPA exposure can cause sex-specific impairments in glucose homeostasis. "

703,24747834,"Ataxia-telangiectasia is a recessive genetic disorder (ATM is the mutated gene) of childhood with severe motor impairments and whereas homozygotes manifest the disorder, heterozygotes are asymptomatic. Structural brain imaging and post-mortem studies in individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia have reported cerebellar atrophy; but abnormalities of motor control characteristic of extrapyramidal dysfunction suggest impairment of broader motor networks. Here, we investigated possible dysfunction in other brain areas in individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia and tested for brain changes in asymptomatic relatives to assess if heterozygocity affects brain function. We used positron emission tomography and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose to measure brain glucose metabolism (quantified as µmol/100 g/min), which serves as a marker of brain function, in 10 adults with ataxia-telangiectasia, 19 non-affected adult relatives (12 siblings, seven parents) and 29 age-matched healthy controls. Statistical parametric mapping and region of interest analyses were used to compare individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia, asymptomatic relatives, and unrelated controls. We found that participants with ataxia-telangiectasia had lower metabolism in cerebellar hemispheres (14%, P < 0.001), anterior vermis (40%, P < 0.001) and fusiform gyrus (20%, P < 0.001) compared with controls or siblings, and lower metabolism in hippocampus (12%, P = 0.05) compared with controls, and showed significant intersubject variability (decreases in vermis ranged from 18% to 60%). Participants with ataxia-telangiectasia also had higher metabolism in globus pallidus (16%, P = 0.05), which correlated negatively with motor performance. Asymptomatic relatives had lower metabolism in anterior vermis (12%; P = 0.01) and hippocampus (19%; P = 0.002) than controls. Our results indicate that, in addition to the expected decrease in cerebellar metabolism, participants with ataxia-telangiectasia had widespread changes in metabolic rates including hyperactivity in globus pallidus indicative of basal ganglia involvement. Changes in basal ganglia metabolism offer potential insight into targeting strategies for therapeutic deep brain stimulation. Our finding of decreased metabolism in vermis and hippocampus of asymptomatic relatives suggests that heterozygocity influences the function of these brain regions. "

We aimed to evaluate who needs to be undertaken a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to find underlying subclinical diabetes. This prospective study included 713 patients with either compensated (Child-Turcotte-Pugh [CTP] class A) or decompensated cirrhosis (CTP class B/C) without previous DM history. All patients underwent a 75-g OGTT. The patients were divided into three groups: normal glucose tolerance (NGT), IGT, and newly diagnosed DM (subclinical DM). Among 713 patients, NGT was diagnosed in 139 (19.5%), IGT in 252 (35.3%), and subclinical DM in 322 (45.2%) patients, respectively. During a median follow-up period of 42.0 months, the cumulative survival rates of patients were as follows: NGT, 75.6%; IGT, 57.6%; and subclinical DM, 54.8%. Overall, IGT (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.605; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.009-2.553; P = 0.046) and subclinical DM (aHR, 1.840; 95% CI = 1.183-2.861; P = 0.001) were identified as independent predictors of mortality. In patients with compensated cirrhosis (n = 415), neither IGT nor subclinical DM conferred a higher mortality risk. However, among patients with decompensated cirrhosis (n = 298), those with IGT (aHR, 2.394; P = 0.015) and subclinical DM (aHR, 2.211; P = 0.022) showed a survival rate worse than those with NGT. In addition, subclinical DM was identified as an independent risk factor for infection (aHR, 2.508; P = 0.007). IGT and subclinical diabetes by OGTT are associated with an unfavorable prognosis in cirrhosis, and the effect is pronounced in the decompensated state. gov, Number NCT04828512 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04828512).

705,25807043,"Accumulating evidence has suggested that a suboptimal early life environment produces multigenerational developmental defects. A proposed mechanism is stable inheritance of DNA methylation. Here we show that maternal bisphenol A (BPA) exposure in C57BL/6 mice produces multigenerational metabolic phenotypes in their offspring. Using various methods including dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry analyses, glucose tolerance tests, and perifusion islet studies, we showed that exposure to 10 μg/kg/d and 10 mg/kg/d BPA in pregnant F0 mice was associated with higher body fat and perturbed glucose homeostasis in F1 and F2 male offspring but not female offspring. To provide insight into the mechanism of the multigenerational metabolic abnormalities, we investigated the maternal metabolic milieu and inheritance of DNA methylation across generations. We showed that maternal glucose homeostasis during pregnancy was altered in the F0 but not F1 female mice. The results suggested that a compromised maternal metabolic milieu may play a role in the health of the F1 offspring but cannot account for all of the observed multigenerational phenotypes. We further demonstrated that the metabolic phenotypes in the F1 and F2 BPA male offspring were linked to fetal overexpression of the imprinted Igf2 gene and increased DNA methylation at the Igf2 differentially methylated region 1. Studies in H19(Δ3.8/+) mouse mutants supported the role of fetal Igf2 overexpression in altered adult glucose homeostasis. We conclude that early life BPA exposure at representative human exposure levels can perturb metabolic health across multiple generations in the mouse through stable inheritance of DNA methylation changes at the Igf2 locus.

706,36222894,"The lack of pre-clinical large animal models of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remains a growing, yet unmet obstacle to improving understanding of this complex condition. We examined whether chronic cardiometabolic stress in Ossabaw swine, which possess a genetic propensity for obesity and cardiovascular complications, produces an HFpEF-like phenotype. Swine were fed standard chow (lean; n = 13) or an excess calorie, high-fat, high-fructose diet (obese; n = 16) for ~ 18 weeks with lean (n = 5) and obese (n = 8) swine subjected to right ventricular pacing (180 beats/min for ~ 4 weeks) to induce heart failure (HF). Baseline blood pressure, heart rate, LV end-diastolic volume, and ejection fraction were similar between groups. High-rate pacing increased LV end-diastolic pressure from ~ 11 ± 1 mmHg in lean and obese swine to ~ 26 ± 2 mmHg in lean HF and obese HF swine. Regression analyses revealed an upward shift in LV diastolic pressure vs. diastolic volume in paced swine that was associated with an ~ twofold increase in myocardial fibrosis and an ~ 50% reduction in myocardial capillary density. Hemodynamic responses to graded hemorrhage revealed an ~ 40% decrease in the chronotropic response to reductions in blood pressure in lean HF and obese HF swine without appreciable changes in myocardial oxygen delivery or transmural perfusion. These findings support that high-rate ventricular pacing of lean and obese Ossabaw swine initiates underlying cardiac remodeling accompanied by elevated LV filling pressures with normal ejection fraction. This distinct pre-clinical tool provides a unique platform for further mechanistic and therapeutic studies of this highly complex syndrome. "
707,35984512,"This in vitro study evaluated the efficacy of toothpaste containing fluoride (F), sodium trimetaphosphate (TMP), and xylitol and erythritol (XE) to inhibit or repair initial enamel erosion lesions. Bovine enamel blocks (n = 120) were selected according to surface hardness (SH) and randomly divided into 5 experimental groups (n = 24 blocks/group): Placebo (no F, TMP, XE); 1100 ppm F; 16% xylitol + 4% erythritol (XE); 200 ppm F + 0.2% TMP (200 ppm F/TMP); and 200 ppm F + 0.2% TMP + 16% xylitol + 4% erythritol (200 ppm F/TMP/XE). The sound and softened blocks were immersed in toothpaste slurry in human saliva for 2 min. The blocks were then submitted to 4 erosive challenges in citric acid (0.75%, pH 3.5), each challenge for 1 min, with stirring. The SH of the blocks was determined after treatment (t) and after the 4 erosive challenges. In addition, the precipitates were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Variables were submitted to a two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance followed by a Student-Newman-Keuls test (p < 0.05). Toothpaste containing 200 ppm F/TMP/XE led to the highest protective and repair effect compared to the other groups (p < 0.001). The protective and repair effect was XE > 200 ppm F/TMP > 1100 ppm F > placebo (p < 0.001). All groups produced precipitates with a thicker layer for XE and TMP groups. Toothpaste containing 200 ppm F, TMP, and polyols demonstrated a superior protective and repair effect in initial enamel erosive lesions in vitro. Toothpaste containing F and polyols could be an advantage in patients affected by dental erosion, due to its higher preventive potential, mainly in individuals who frequently drink acidic beverages. However, future studies are needed to confirm these results. "
708,22669248,"The orexigenic hormone ghrelin is important in diabetes because it has an inhibitory effect on insulin secretion. Ghrelin ablation in leptin-deficient ob/ob (Ghrelin(-/-):ob/ob) mice increases insulin secretion and improves hyperglycemia. The physiologically relevant ghrelin receptor is the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R), and GHS-R antagonists are thought to be an effective strategy for treating diabetes. However, since some of ghrelin's effects are independent of GHS-R, we have utilized genetic approaches to determine whether ghrelin's effect on insulin secretion is mediated through GHS-R and whether GHS-R antagonism indeed inhibits insulin secretion. We investigated the effects of GHS-R on glucose homeostasis in Ghsr-ablated ob/ob mice (Ghsr(-/-):ob/ob). Ghsr ablation did not rescue the hyperphagia, obesity, or insulin resistance of ob/ob mice. Surprisingly, Ghsr ablation worsened the hyperglycemia, decreased insulin, and impaired glucose tolerance. Consistently, Ghsr ablation in ob/ob mice upregulated negative β-cell regulators (such as UCP-2, SREBP-1c, ChREBP, and MIF-1) and downregulated positive β-cell regulators (such as HIF-1α, FGF-21, and PDX-1) in whole pancreas; this suggests that Ghsr ablation impairs pancreatic β-cell function in leptin deficiency. Of note, Ghsr ablation in ob/ob mice did not affect the islet size; the average islet size of Ghsr(-/-):ob/ob mice is similar to that of ob/ob mice. In summary, because Ghsr ablation in leptin deficiency impairs insulin secretion and worsens hyperglycemia, this suggests that GHS-R antagonists may actually aggravate diabetes under certain conditions. The paradoxical effects of ghrelin ablation and Ghsr ablation in ob/ob mice highlight the complexity of the ghrelin-signaling pathway. "
709,36353228,"Methamphetamine (METH) is a psychostimulant drug that induces addiction. Previous epidemiological studies have demonstrated that maternal METH abuse during pregnancy causes low birthweight (LBW) in the offspring. As a source of essential nutrients, in particular glucose, the placenta plays a key role in fetal development. LBW leads to health problems such as obesity, diabetes, and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). However, the detailed mechanism underlying offspring's LBW and health hazards caused by METH are not fully understood. Therefore, we investigated the effects of prenatal METH exposure on LBW and fetal-placental relationship by focusing on metabolism. We found dysfunction of insulin production in the pancreas of fetuses exposed to METH. We also found a reduction of the glycogen cells (GCs) storing glycogens in the junctional zone of placenta, all of which suggest abnormal glucose metabolism affects the fetal development. These results suggest that dysfunction in fetal glucose metabolism may cause LBW and future health hazards. Our findings provide novel insights into the cause of LBW  "
710,32121669,"Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder featuring chronic, complex neuropsychiatric features. The etiology and pathogenesis of schizophrenia are not fully understood. Oxidative-antioxidant imbalance is a potential determinant of schizophrenia. Oxidative, nitrosative, or sulfuric damage to enzymes of glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle, as well as calcium transport and ATP biosynthesis might cause impaired bioenergetics function in the brain. This could explain the initial symptoms, such as the first psychotic episode and mild cognitive impairment. Another concept of the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia is associated with impaired glucose metabolism and insulin resistance with the activation of the mTOR mitochondrial pathway, which may contribute to impaired neuronal development. Consequently, cognitive processes requiring ATP are compromised and dysfunctions in synaptic transmission lead to neuronal death, preceding changes in key brain areas. This review summarizes the role and mutual interactions of oxidative damage and impaired glucose metabolism as key factors affecting metabolic complications in schizophrenia. These observations may be a premise for novel potential therapeutic targets that will delay not only the onset of first symptoms but also the progression of schizophrenia and its complications. "
711,12048212,"To determine whether reduction of insulin resistance could ameliorate fructose-induced very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) oversecretion and to explore the mechanism of this effect, fructose-fed hamsters received placebo or rosiglitazone for 3 weeks. Rosiglitazone treatment led to normalization of the blunted insulin-mediated suppression of the glucose production rate and to a approximately 2-fold increase in whole body insulin-mediated glucose disappearance rate (p < 0.001). Rosiglitazone ameliorated the defect in hepatocyte insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, IRS-1, and IRS-2 and the reduced protein mass of IRS-1 and IRS-2 induced by fructose feeding. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B levels were increased with fructose feeding and were markedly reduced by rosiglitazone. Rosiglitazone treatment led to a approximately 50% reduction of VLDL secretion rates (p < 0.05) in vivo and ex vivo. VLDL clearance assessed directly in vivo was not significantly different in the FR (fructose-fed + rosiglitazone-treated) versus F (fructose-fed + placebo-treated) hamsters, although there was a trend toward a lower clearance with rosiglitazone. Enhanced stability of nascent apolipoprotein B (apoB) in fructose-fed hepatocytes was evident, and rosiglitazone treatment resulted in a significant reduction in apoB stability. The increase in intracellular mass of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein seen with fructose feeding was reduced by treatment with rosiglitazone. In conclusion, improvement of hepatic insulin signaling with rosiglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist, is associated with reduced hepatic VLDL assembly and secretion due to reduced intracellular apoB stability.

712,30770249,"Elevated glucose metabolism in immune cells represents a hallmark feature of many inflammatory diseases, such as sepsis. However, the role of individual glucose metabolic pathways during immune cell activation and inflammation remains incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate a previously unrecognized anti-inflammatory function of the O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) signaling associated with the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP). Despite elevated activities of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, activation of macrophages with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in attenuated HBP activity and protein O-GlcNAcylation. Deletion of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), a key enzyme for protein O-GlcNAcylation, led to enhanced innate immune activation and exacerbated septic inflammation. Mechanistically, OGT-mediated O-GlcNAcylation of the serine-threonine kinase RIPK3 on threonine 467 (T467) prevented RIPK3-RIPK1 hetero- and RIPK3-RIPK3 homo-interaction and inhibited downstream innate immunity and necroptosis signaling. Thus, our study identifies an immuno-metabolic crosstalk essential for fine-tuning innate immune cell activation and highlights the importance of glucose metabolism in septic inflammation. "
713,25594249,"Pancreatic β-cells with severely knocked down cytosolic malic enzyme (ME1) and mitochondrial NAD(P) malic enzyme (ME2) show normal insulin secretion. The mitochondrial NADP malic enzyme (ME3) is very low in pancreatic β-cells, and ME3 was previously thought unimportant for insulin secretion. Using short hairpin RNAs that targeted one or more malic enzyme mRNAs in the same cell, we generated more than 25 stable INS-1 832/13-derived insulin cell lines expressing extremely low levels of ME1, ME2, and ME3 alone or low levels of two of these enzymes in the same cell line. We also used double targeting of the same Me gene to achieve even more severe reduction in Me1 and Me2 mRNAs and enzyme activities than we reported previously. Knockdown of ME3, but not ME1 or ME2 alone or together, inhibited insulin release stimulated by glucose, pyruvate or 2-aminobicyclo [2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid-plus-glutamine. The data suggest that ME3, far more than ME1 or ME2, is necessary for insulin release. Because ME3 enzyme activity is low in β-cells, its role in insulin secretion may involve a function other than its ME catalytic activity. "
714,17619885,"Maternal folic acid deficiency is the most important metabolic factor in the etiology of neural tube defects (NTD) and is reduced by ethanol, which is extensively consumed by young women. The objective of the study was to determine whether folic acid supplementation in dietary saccharose is efficient in the prevention NTD induced by ethanol in fetuses of Swiss mice. Pregnant mice were divided into four groups of six animals each: control (C), ethanol (E), deficient-supplemented (DS), and deficient-supplemented + ethanol (DSE). Groups C and E received commercial mouse chow (containing 3 mg/kg folic acid) throughout the experiment, while groups DS and DSE received a folic acid-free diet with the addition of saccharose supplemented with folic acid (2 mg/kg folic acid) in water. Group E and DSE animals received ethanol (4 g/kg) administered intraperitoneally from the seventh to the ninth gestational day (gd) and were euthanized on the 18th gd, while groups C and DS received saline. Congenital anomalies were observed in groups E and DSE. The fetal weight and length of the animals in group E were lower than in groups C and DS and, in group DSE, were lower than in groups C and DS. The placental diameter of group E was smaller than that of group C, and the placental weight of group C animals was lower than that of groups E, DSE, and DS. The study demonstrated that dietary supplementation with folate in saccharose is an accessible means of consumption that could be further diffused but in an increased dose than recommended to reduce the teratogenic effects of ethanol.

715,37968246,"To determine the impact of implementing emergency care pathway(s) for screening, diagnosing and managing women with gestational diabetes (GDM) during COVID-19. Retrospective multicentre cohort. Nine National Health Service (NHS) Hospital Trusts/Health boards in England and Scotland. 4915 women with GDM pre-pandemic (1 April 2018 to 31 March 2020), and 3467 women with GDM during the pandemic (1 May 2020 to 31 March 2021). We examined clinical outcomes for women with GDM prior to and during the pandemic following changes in screening methods, diagnostic testing, glucose thresholds and introduction of virtual care for monitoring of antenatal glycaemia. Intervention at birth, perinatal mortality, large-for-gestational-age infants and neonatal unit admission. The new diagnostic criteria more often identified GDM women who were multiparous, had higher body mass index (BMI) and greater deprivation, and less frequently had previous GDM (all p < 0.05). During COVID, these women had no differences in the key outcome measures. Of the women, 3% were identified with pre-existing diabetes at antenatal booking. Where OGTT continued during COVID, but virtual care was introduced, outcomes were also similar pre- and during the pandemic. Using HbA1c and fasting glucose identified a higher risk GDM population during the pandemic but this had minimal impact on pregnancy outcomes. The high prevalence of undiagnosed pre-existing diabetes suggests that women with GDM risk factors should be offered HbA1c screening in early pregnancy. "
716,37644353,"Head and neck cancer (HNC) is the fifth most common cancer globally. Diagnosis at early stages are critical to reduce mortality and improve functional and esthetic outcomes associated with HNC. Metabolomics is a promising approach for discovery of biomarkers and metabolic pathways for risk assessment and early detection of HNC. To summarize and consolidate the available evidence on metabolomics and HNC in plasma/serum, saliva, and urine. A systematic search of experimental research was executed using PubMed and Web of Science. Available data on areas under the curve was extracted. Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis were performed to identify metabolic pathways altered in HNC. Fifty-four studies were eligible for data extraction (33 performed in plasma/serum, 15 in saliva and 6 in urine). Metabolites with high discriminatory performance for detection of HNC included single metabolites and combination panels of several lysoPCs, pyroglutamate, glutamic acid, glucose, tartronic acid, arachidonic acid, norvaline, linoleic acid, propionate, acetone, acetate, choline, glutamate and others. The glucose-alanine cycle and the urea cycle were the most altered pathways in HNC, among other pathways (i.e. gluconeogenesis, glycine and serine metabolism, alanine metabolism, etc.). Specific metabolites that can potentially serve as complementary less- or non-invasive biomarkers, as well as metabolic pathways integrating the data from the available studies, are presented. The present work highlights utility of metabolite-based biomarkers for risk assessment, early detection, and prognostication of HNC, as well as facilitates incorporation of available metabolomics studies into multi-omics data integration and big data analytics for personalized health.

717,37347736,"Metformin is used by women during pregnancy to manage diabetes and crosses the placenta, yet its effects on the fetus are unclear. We show that the liver is a site of metformin action in fetal sheep and macaques, given relatively abundant OCT1 transporter expression and hepatic uptake following metformin infusion into fetal sheep. To determine the effects of metformin action, we performed studies in primary hepatocytes from fetal sheep, fetal macaques, and juvenile macaques. Metformin increases AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, decreases mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, and decreases glucose production in fetal and juvenile hepatocytes. Metformin also decreases oxygen consumption in fetal hepatocytes. Unique to fetal hepatocytes, metformin activates stress pathways (e.g., increased PGC1A gene expression, NRF-2 protein abundance, and phosphorylation of eIF2α and CREB proteins) alongside perturbations in hepatokine expression (e.g., increased growth/differentiation factor 15 [GDF15] and fibroblast growth factor 21 [FGF21] expression and decreased insulin-like growth factor 2 [IGF2] expression). Similarly, in liver tissue from sheep fetuses infused with metformin in vivo, AMPK phosphorylation, NRF-2 protein, and PGC1A expression are increased. These results demonstrate disruption of signaling and metabolism, induction of stress, and alterations in hepatokine expression in association with metformin exposure in fetal hepatocytes. The major metformin uptake transporter OCT1 is expressed in the fetal liver, and fetal hepatic uptake of metformin is observed in vivo. Metformin activates AMPK, reduces glucose production, and decreases oxygen consumption in fetal hepatocytes, demonstrating similar effects as in juvenile hepatocytes. Unique to fetal hepatocytes, metformin activates metabolic stress pathways and alters the expression of secreted growth factors and hepatokines. Disruption of signaling and metabolism with increased stress pathways and reduced anabolic pathways by metformin in the fetal liver may underlie reduced growth in fetuses exposed to metformin. "
718,29490093,"A-β + ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) is a subset of type 2 diabetes in which patients have severe but reversible β cell dysfunction of unknown etiology. Plasma metabolomic analysis indicates that abnormal arginine metabolism may be involved. The objective of this study was to determine the relation between gut microbiome and arginine metabolism and the relation between arginine availability and β cell function in KPD patients compared with control participants. Kinetics of arginine and related metabolites were measured with stable isotope tracers, and insulin secretory responses to arginine and glucose were determined under euglycemic and hyperglycemic conditions in 6 KPD patients and 6 age-, gender-, and body mass index-matched control participants. Glucose potentiation of arginine-induced insulin secretion was performed in a different set of 6 KPD and 3 control participants. Arginine availability was higher in KPD patients during euglycemia [53.5 ± 4.3 (mean ± SEM) compared with 40.3 ± 2.4 μmol · kg lean body mass (LBM)-1 · h-1, P = 0.03] but declined more in response to hyperglycemia (Δ 10.15 ± 2.6 compared with Δ 3.20 ± 1.3 μmol · kg LBM-1 · h-1, P = 0.041). During hyperglycemia, ornithine flux was not different between groups but after an arginine bolus, plasma ornithine AUC trended higher in KPD patients (3360 ± 294 compared with 2584 ± 259 min · μmol · L-1, P = 0.08). In both euglycemia and hyperglycemia, the first-phase insulin responses to glucose stimulation were lower in KPD patients (euglycemic insulin AUC 282 ± 108 compared with 926 ± 257 min · μU · mL-1, P = 0.02; hyperglycemic insulin AUC 358 ± 79 compared with 866 ± 292 min · μU · mL-1, P = 0.05), but exogenous arginine restored first-phase insulin secretion in KPD patients to the level of control participants. Compared with control participants, KPD patients have increased arginine availability in the euglycemic state, indicating a higher requirement. This is compromised during hyperglycemia, with an inadequate supply of arginine to sustain metabolic functions such as insulin secretion. Exogenous arginine administration restores a normal insulin secretory response. "
719,39251890,"Brain function requires a constant supply of glucose. However, the brain has no known energy stores, except for glycogen granules in astrocytes. In the present study, we report that continuous oligodendroglial lipid metabolism provides an energy reserve in white matter tracts. In the isolated optic nerve from young adult mice of both sexes, oligodendrocytes survive glucose deprivation better than astrocytes. Under low glucose, both axonal ATP levels and action potentials become dependent on fatty acid β-oxidation. Importantly, ongoing oligodendroglial lipid degradation feeds rapidly into white matter energy metabolism. Although not supporting high-frequency spiking, fatty acid β-oxidation in mitochondria and oligodendroglial peroxisomes protects axons from conduction blocks when glucose is limiting. Disruption of the glucose transporter GLUT1 expression in oligodendrocytes of adult mice perturbs myelin homeostasis in vivo and causes gradual demyelination without behavioral signs. This further suggests that the imbalance of myelin synthesis and degradation can underlie myelin thinning in aging and disease. "
720,19466654,"To evaluate hepatic reserve function by monitoring functional hepatic flow in cirrhotic patients admitted for surgical treatments. Thirty-seven biopsy-proved cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension and 10 healthy volunteers entered the study. Eleven were Child-Pugh class A, 18 class B, and 8 class C. Eight patients undergone Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), 10 were submitted to the combination of TIPS and portal-azygous disconnection, 10 were treated with surgical portal-azygous disconnection, and 9 were treated with the combination of portal-azygous disconnection and spleno-renal shunt. The functional hepatic flow (FHF) and total hepatic flow (THF) were determined by means of modified hepatic clearance of D-sorbitol combined with duplex Doppler color sonography. Portal pressure was measured directly by portal vein catheterization. Portal blood flow, hepatic artery flow, and THF significantly increased in cirrhotic patients compared to the controls, while FHF was significantly reduced. Both portal pressure and FHF decreased in cirrhotic patients submitted to TIPS, the combination of TIPS and portal-azygous disconnection, or the combination of portal-azygous disconnection and spleno-renal shunt (p <.05). FHF decreased significantly in patients treated with TIPS compared to other patients (p <.01). The portal pressure decreased in patients treated with portal-azygous disconnection while FHF maintained no changes (p >.05). Monitor of FHF in cirrhotic patients is valuable to predict different hepatic reserve function in patients receiving different surgical operations. "
721,38042462,"G protein-coupled receptor 124 (GPR124) regulates central nervous system angiogenesis and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and its deficiency aggravates BBB breakdown and hemorrhagic transformation in ischemic mice. However, excessive GPR124 expression promotes inflammation in atherosclerotic mice. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of GPR124 in hypoxia/ischemia-induced cerebrovascular endothelial cell injury. bEnd.3 cells were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), and time-dependent changes in GPR124 mRNA and protein expression were evaluated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting. The effects of GPR124 overexpression or knockdown on the expression of pyroptosis-related genes were assessed at the mRNA and protein levels. Tadehaginoside (TA) was screened as a potential small molecule targeting GPR124, and its effects on pyroptosis-related signaling pathways were investigated. Finally, the therapeutic efficacy of TA was evaluated using a rat model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (tMCAO/R). During OGD, the expression of GPR124 initially increased and then decreased over time, with the highest levels observed 1 h after OGD. The overexpression of GPR124 enhanced the OGD-induced expression of NLRP3, Caspase-1, and Gasdermin D (GSDMD) in bEnd.3 cells, whereas GPR124 knockdown reduced pyroptosis. Additionally, TA exhibited a high targeting ability to GPR124, significantly inhibiting its function and expression and suppressing the expression of pyroptosis-related proteins during OGD. Furthermore, TA treatment significantly reduced the cerebral infarct volume and pyroptotic signaling in tMCAO/R rats. Our findings suggest that GPR124 mediates pyroptotic signaling in endothelial cells during the early stages of hypoxia/ischemia, thereby exacerbating ischemic injury. "
722,36424672,"Dietary carbohydrates and fats are intrinsically correlated within the habitual diet. We aimed to disentangle the associations of starch and sucrose from those of fat, in relation to allergic sensitization, asthma and rhinoconjuctivitis prevalence in humans, and to investigate underlying mechanisms using murine models. Epidemiological data from participants of two German birth cohorts (age 15) were used in logistic regression analyses testing cross-sectional associations of starch and sucrose (and their main dietary sources) with aeroallergen sensitization, asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis, adjusting for correlated fats (saturated, monounsaturated, omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated) and other covariates. For mechanistic insights, murine models of aeroallergen-induced allergic airway inflammation (AAI) fed with a low-fat-high-sucrose or -high-starch versus a high-fat diet were used to characterize and quantify disease development. Metabolic and physiologic parameters were used to track outcomes of dietary interventions and cellular and molecular responses to monitor the development of AAI. Oxidative stress biomarkers were measured in murine sera or lung homogenates. We demonstrate a direct association of dietary sucrose with asthma prevalence in males, while starch was associated with higher asthma prevalence in females. In mice, high-carbohydrate feeding, despite scant metabolic effects, aggravated AAI compared to high-fat in both sexes, as displayed by humoral response, mucus hypersecretion, lung inflammatory cell infiltration and T High consumption of digestible carbohydrates is associated with an increased prevalence of asthma in humans and aggravated lung allergic inflammation in mice, involving oxidative stress-related mechanisms.

723,32411318,"Diabetes mellitus, a worldwide health threat, is considered an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The overall cardiovascular risk of diabetes is similar to the one having one myocardial infarction (MI) attack although the precise impact of diabetes on MI-induced myocardial anomalies remains elusive. Given that mortality following MI is much greater in diabetic patients compared to nondiabetic patients, this study was designed to examine the effect of melatonin on MI injury-induced myocardial dysfunction in diabetes. Adult mice were made diabetic using high-fat feeding and streptozotocin (100 mg/kg body weight) prior to MI and were treated with melatonin (50 mg/kg/d, p.o.) for 4 weeks prior to assessment of cardiac geometry and function. The MI procedure in diabetes displayed overt changes in cardiac geometry (chamber dilation and interstitial fibrosis) and functional anomalies (reduced fractional shortening and cardiomyocyte contractile capacity) in association with elevated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation and p53 level. Melatonin treatment markedly attenuated cardiac dysfunction and myocardial fibrosis in post-MI diabetic mice. Furthermore, melatonin decreased JNK phosphorylation, reduced p53 levels, and suppressed apoptosis in hearts from the post-MI diabetic group.  "
724,27292642,"Pdx1 and Oc1 are co-expressed in multipotent pancreatic progenitors and regulate the pro-endocrine gene Neurog3. Their expression diverges in later organogenesis, with Oc1 absent from hormone+ cells and Pdx1 maintained in mature β cells. In a classical genetic test for cooperative functional interactions, we derived mice with combined Pdx1 and Oc1 heterozygosity. Endocrine development in double-heterozygous pancreata was normal at embryonic day (E)13.5, but defects in specification and differentiation were apparent at E15.5, the height of the second wave of differentiation. Pancreata from double heterozygotes showed alterations in the expression of genes crucial for β-cell development and function, decreased numbers and altered allocation of Neurog3-expressing endocrine progenitors, and defective endocrine differentiation. Defects in islet gene expression and β-cell function persisted in double heterozygous neonates. These results suggest that Oc1 and Pdx1 cooperate prior to their divergence, in pancreatic progenitors, to allow for proper differentiation and functional maturation of β cells. "
725,25815791,"The aim of the present study was to determine whether gastric cancer chemoresistance was increased under high glucose conditions by means of a clinical case study and experimental cytology. The expression of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), silent information regulator 1 (sirt1), p53, p-glycoprotein (P-gp) and topoisomerase (topo)-IIα was evaluated in gastric cancer tissues and gastric cancer with diabetes tissues by immunohistochemistry. Subsequently, the survival time of the patients was assessed. For further investigation, the human gastric cancer cell line SGC7901 was subjected to different glucose concentrations and the aforementioned proteins were detected using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. Finally, cell sensitivity to chemotherapy treatment was examined in order to elucidate the role of high glucose in MDR. Positive expression of Nampt, Sirt1, p53, P-gp and Topo-IIα was observed to be higher in gastric cancer with diabetes patients compared with gastric cancer patients (P=0.01, 0.003, 0.0025, 0.016 and 0.336, respectively) with reduced survival time. Similar results were observed in SGC7901 cells. Additionally, cell proliferation rates of SGC7901 cells increased at glucose concentrations of 4,500 and 9,000 mg/l. Notably, the inhibition rates of 5-fluorouracil on cells decreased over 48 h when treated with 4,500 and 9,000 mg/l glucose compared with 1,000 mg/l. In conclusion, patients suffering from gastric cancer and diabetes exhibited greater negative effects, such as a poorer response to chemotherapy and had a lower survival time. High glucose conditions promoted gastric cancer cell proliferation and reduced susceptibility to chemotherapy drugs. These data provided a potential diagnostic and therapeutic strategy for gastric cancer chemoresistance. "

727,35889803,"Background: Fructose providing excess calories in the form of sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) increases markers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Whether this effect holds for other important food sources of fructose-containing sugars is unclear. To investigate the role of food source and energy, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials of the effect of fructose-containing sugars by food source at different levels of energy control on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) markers. Methods and Findings: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched through 7 January 2022 for controlled trials ≥7-days. Four trial designs were prespecified: substitution (energy-matched substitution of sugars for other macronutrients); addition (excess energy from sugars added to diets); subtraction (excess energy from sugars subtracted from diets); and ad libitum (energy from sugars freely replaced by other macronutrients). The primary outcome was intrahepatocellular lipid (IHCL). Secondary outcomes were alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE. We included 51 trials (75 trial comparisons, n = 2059) of 10 food sources (sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs); sweetened dairy alternative; 100% fruit juice; fruit; dried fruit; mixed fruit sources; sweets and desserts; added nutritive sweetener; honey; and mixed sources (with SSBs)) in predominantly healthy mixed weight or overweight/obese younger adults. Total fructose-containing sugars increased IHCL (standardized mean difference = 1.72 [95% CI, 1.08 to 2.36], p < 0.001) in addition trials and decreased AST in subtraction trials with no effect on any outcome in substitution or ad libitum trials. There was evidence of influence by food source with SSBs increasing IHCL and ALT in addition trials and mixed sources (with SSBs) decreasing AST in subtraction trials. The certainty of evidence was high for the effect on IHCL and moderate for the effect on ALT for SSBs in addition trials, low for the effect on AST for the removal of energy from mixed sources (with SSBs) in subtraction trials, and generally low to moderate for all other comparisons. Conclusions: Energy control and food source appear to mediate the effect of fructose-containing sugars on NAFLD markers. The evidence provides a good indication that the addition of excess energy from SSBs leads to large increases in liver fat and small important increases in ALT while there is less of an indication that the removal of energy from mixed sources (with SSBs) leads to moderate reductions in AST. Varying uncertainty remains for the lack of effect of other important food sources of fructose-containing sugars at different levels of energy control. "
728,38043867,"Patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS) dependent on home parenteral nutrition (HPN) commonly cycle infusions overnight, likely contributing to circadian misalignment and sleep disruption. The objective of this quasi-experimental, single-arm, controlled, pilot trial was to examine the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of daytime infusions of HPN in adults with SBS without diabetes. Enrolled patients were fitted with a continuous glucose monitor and wrist actigraph and were instructed to cycle their infusions overnight for 1 wk, followed by daytime for another week. The 24-h average blood glucose, the time spent >140 mg/dL or <70 mg/dL, and sleep fragmentation were derived for each week and compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Patient-reported quality-of-life outcomes were also compared between the weeks. Twenty patients (mean age, 51.7 y; 75% female; mean body mass index, 21.5 kg/m Daytime HPN was feasible and safe in adults with SBS and, compared with overnight HPN, improved subjective sleep without increasing 24-h glucose concentrations. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04743960 (https://classic. gov/ct2/show/NCT04743960). "
729,15115098,"To study the influence of high-lactose probiotic-containing formula on the course of acute diarrhea, an experiment using a randomized controlled clinical trial with patients having acute diarrhea for 3 days was conducted. One hundred patients were allocated into two groups that were comparable for age, sex, and nutritional status. The test group was administered high-lactose Bifidobacterium bifidum-containing formula, while the control group had no high-lactose probiotic until the end of the experiment. The degree of subsequent diarrhea and recovery were monitored in both groups. The results for the test and control groups were analyzed and compared using the chi-square test and Fisher exact test with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05. The study results revealed that there was no significant difference between the test and control groups (p>0.05) as well as at positive clinical test (13%) and positive floating test (65%). However, the patients receiving probiotic-containing formula had significantly less frequency of stools, when compared with the control group (p<0.05). "
730,38067490,"N-glycanase 1 (NGLY1) is an essential enzyme involved in the deglycosylation of misfolded glycoproteins through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which could hydrolyze N-glycan from N-glycoprotein or N-glycopeptide in the cytosol. Recent studies indicated that NGLY1 inhibition is a potential novel drug target for antiviral therapy. In this study, structure-based virtual analysis was applied to screen candidate NGLY1 inhibitors from 2960 natural compounds. Three natural compounds, Poliumoside, Soyasaponin Bb, and Saikosaponin B2 showed significantly inhibitory activity of NGLY1, isolated from traditional heat-clearing and detoxifying Chinese herbs. Furthermore, the core structural motif of the three NGLY1 inhibitors was a disaccharide structure with glucose and rhamnose, which might exert its action by binding to important active sites of NGLY1, such as Lys238 and Trp244. In traditional Chinese medicine, many compounds containing this disaccharide structure probably targeted NGLY1. This study unveiled the leading compound of NGLY1 inhibitors with its core structure, which could guide future drug development. "
731,24705280,"Evidence favours insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia as the predominant, perhaps primary, defects in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The aim of the present study was to evaluate insulin metabolism in young women with PCOS but normal glucose tolerance as compared with age, body mass index and insulin resistance-matched controls to answer the question whether women with PCOS hypersecrete insulin in comparison to appropriately insulin resistance-matched controls. Sixty-nine cases were divided according to their body mass index (BMI) in normal-weight (N = 29), overweight (N = 24) and obese patients (N = 16). Controls were 479 healthy women (age 16-49 y). Whole body Insulin Sensitivity (WBISI), fasting, and total insulin secretion were estimated following an oral glucose tolerance test (C-peptide deconvolution method). Across classes of BMI, PCOS patients had greater insulin resistance than matched controls (p<0.0001 for all the comparisons), but they showed higher fasting and total insulin secretion than their age, BMI and insulin resistance-matched peers (p<0.0001 for all the comparisons). Women with PCOS show higher insulin resistance but also larger insulin secretion to maintain normal glucose homeostasis than age-, BMI- and insulin resistance-matched controls. "
732,31554925,"Overweight children and adolescents are at high risk for adult and late life obesity. This report investigates some underlying mechanisms contributing to obesity during early life in an animal model. We generated a strain of transgenic mice, cU2, overexpressing human microRNA 34c, a microRNA functionally implicated in adipogenesis. Male and female cU2 mice exhibit significant weight gain, accompanied by marked increase in abdominal fat mass and metabolic abnormalities, including reduction of both glucose clearance rate and insulin sensitivity, as early as two months of age. Adipogenesis derailment at this early age is suggested by decreased expression of adiponectin, the fat mass and obesity-associated gene, and the adiponectin receptor R1, coupled with a reduction of the brown fat biomarker PAT2 and the adipogenesis inhibitor SIRT1. Notably, adiponectin is an important adipokine and an essential regulator of glucose and fatty acid homeostasis. cU2 mice may provide a crucial animal model for investigating the role of miR-34c in early onset insulin resistance and visceral fat mass increase, contributing to accelerated body weight gain and metabolic disorders. Intervention in this dysregulation may open a new preventive strategy to control early-life weight gain and abnormal insulin resistance, and thus prevalent adult and late life obesity. "
733,34686554,"To determine if liver cirrhosis is associated with reduced efficacy of insulin-glucose treatment in moderate to severe hyperkalaemia. Retrospective, cohort study. Two secondary and one tertiary care hospital at a large metropolitan healthcare network in Melbourne, Australia. This study included 463 adults with a mean age of 68.7±15.8 years, comprising 79 patients with cirrhosis and 384 without cirrhosis as controls, who received standard insulin-glucose treatment for a serum potassium ≥6.0 mmol/L from October 2016 to March 2020. Patients were excluded if they received an insulin infusion, or if there was inadequate follow-up data for at least 6 hours after IDT due to death, lost to follow-up or inadequate biochemistry monitoring. The mean Model for End-stage Liver Disease score in patients with cirrhosis was 22.2±7.5, and the distribution of the Child-Pugh score for cirrhosis was: class A (24%), class B (46%), class C (30%). The primary outcome was the degree of potassium lowering and the secondary outcome was the proportion of patients who achieved normokalaemia, within 6 hours of treatment. The mean pretreatment potassium for the cohort was 6.57±0.52 mmol/L. After insulin-glucose treatment, mean potassium lowering was 0.84±0.58 mmol/L in patients with cirrhosis compared with 1.33±0.75 mmol/L for controls (p<0.001). The proportion of patients achieving normokalaemia was 33% for patients with cirrhosis, compared with 53% for controls (p=0.001). By multivariable regression, on average, liver cirrhosis was associated with a reduced potassium lowering effect of 0.42 mmol/L (95% CI 0.22 to 0.63 mmol/L, p<0.001) from insulin-glucose treatment, after adjusting for age, serum creatinine, cancer, pretreatment potassium level, β-blocker use and cotreatments (sodium polystyrene sulfonate, salbutamol, sodium bicarbonate). Our observational data suggest reduced efficacy of insulin-glucose treatment for hyperkalaemia in patients with cirrhosis. "
734,24292196,"The prevalence of cognitive abnormalities in children has partly been ascribed to environmental chemical exposure. Appropriate animal models and tools for evaluating higher brain function are required to examine this problem. A recently developed behavioral test in which rats learn six unique flavor-location pairs in a test arena was used to evaluate paired-associate learning, a hallmark of the higher cognitive function that is essential to language learning in humans. Pregnant Long-Evans rats were dosed by gavage with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) or 2,3,7,8-tetrabromodibenzo-p-dioxin (TBDD) at a dose of 0, 200, or 800 ng/kg (referred as Control, TCDD-200, TCDD-800, TBDD-200, or TBDD-800, hereafter) on gestational day 15, and the offspring was tested during adulthood. Paired-associate learning was found to be impaired in the TCDD-200 and TBDD-200 groups, but not in either group exposed to 800 ng/kg, the observations of which were ensured by non-cued trials. As for the emotional aspect, during habituation, the TCDD-200 and TBDD-200 groups showed significantly longer latencies to enter the test arena from a start box than the Control, TCDD-800, and TBDD-800 groups, suggesting that the TCDD-200 and TBDD-200 groups manifested anxiety-like behavior. Thus, both the chlorinated dioxin and its brominated congener affected higher brain function to a similar extent in a nearly identical manner. Use of the behavioral test that can evaluate paired-associate learning in rats demonstrated that in utero and lactational exposure to not only TCDD but also TBDD perturbed higher brain function in rat offspring in a nonmonotonic manner.

735,39080603,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant risk factor for pulmonary hypertension (PH), a complication that adversely affects patient prognosis. However, the mechanisms underlying this association remain poorly understood. A major obstacle to progress in this field is the lack of a reliable animal model replicating CKD-PH. This study aimed to establish a stable rat model of CKD-PH. We employed a combined approach, inducing CKD through a 5/6 nephrectomy and concurrently exposing the rats to a high-salt diet. The model's hemodynamics were evaluated dynamically, alongside a comprehensive assessment of pathological changes in multiple organs. Lung tissues and serum samples were collected from the CKD-PH rats to analyze the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), evaluate the activity of key vascular components within the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), and characterize alterations in the serum metabolic profile. At 14 weeks post-surgery, the CKD-PH rats displayed significant changes in hemodynamic parameters indicative of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Additionally, right ventricular hypertrophy was observed. Notably, no evidence of pulmonary vascular remodeling was found. Further analysis revealed RAAS dysregulation and downregulated ACE2 expression within the pulmonary vascular endothelium of CKD-PH rats. Moreover, the serum metabolic profile of these animals differed markedly from the sham surgery group. Our findings suggest that the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension in CKD-PH rats is likely a consequence of a combined effect: RAAS dysregulation, decreased ACE2 expression in pulmonary vascular endothelial cells, and metabolic disturbances.

736,29613981,"The purpose of this study was to report a case of phacomorphic glaucoma following retinal detachment repair with silicone oil (SO) in a pediatric patient. Case report. A chart review was conducted at St. Michael's Hospital and The Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, Canada), where the patient received ophthalmic care from July 28, 2015 onwards. A 14-year-old boy with a history of traumatic retinal detachment and proliferative vitreoretinopathy in the left eye, requiring 2 pars plana vitrectomies, membrane peel, and SO tamponade, presented with 1-day history of decreased vision in the left eye, severe headache, nausea, and vomiting. Visual acuity was hand motions; intraocular pressure (IOP) was 54 mm Hg; the pupil was middilated and minimally reactive with a reverse relative afferent pupillary defect. Slit-lamp examination revealed an injected eye with diffuse microcystic corneal edema, a shallow anterior chamber (AC), and an intumescent cataract. Gonioscopy demonstrated closed angles in 3 quadrants. Compared with his last examination 6 weeks prior, where only a mild posterior subcapsular cataract was noted, the patient's presentation was suggestive of rapid lens intumescence causing acute angle-closure glaucoma. He was given topical and systemic treatment, including intravenous mannitol, and his IOP reduced to 22 mm Hg after 7 hours. Urgent lensectomy was performed the following day. Preoperative ultrasound biomicroscopy revealed a greatly increased lens thickness of 5.12 mm and an AC depth of 1.12 mm. The integrity of both anterior and posterior lens capsules was confirmed intraoperatively, and SO remained confined to the posterior segment. Postoperatively, the iris returned to a normal configuration with open angles, and IOP was 16 mm Hg with no antiglaucoma medications at the last follow-up. Acute angle-closure in children is a rare event. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of phacomorphic glaucoma secondary to vitreoretinal surgery in the pediatric population. Although uncommon, ophthalmologists should be aware of this potential complication with the intraocular use of SO and administer urgent treatment accordingly. "
737,37364047,"Carboxypeptidase E (CPE) facilitates the conversion of prohormones into mature hormones and is highly expressed in multiple neuroendocrine tissues. Carriers of CPE mutations have elevated plasma proinsulin and develop severe obesity and hyperglycemia. We aimed to determine whether loss of Cpe in pancreatic β-cells disrupts proinsulin processing and accelerates development of diabetes and obesity in mice. Pancreatic β-cell-specific Cpe knockout mice (βCpeKO; Cpefl/fl x Ins1Cre/+) lack mature insulin granules and have elevated proinsulin in plasma; however, glucose-and KCl-stimulated insulin secretion in βCpeKO islets remained intact. High-fat diet-fed βCpeKO mice showed weight gain and glucose tolerance comparable with those of Wt littermates. Notably, β-cell area was increased in chow-fed βCpeKO mice and β-cell replication was elevated in βCpeKO islets. Transcriptomic analysis of βCpeKO β-cells revealed elevated glycolysis and Hif1α-target gene expression. On high glucose challenge, β-cells from βCpeKO mice showed reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, increased reactive oxygen species, reduced MafA, and elevated Aldh1a3 transcript levels. Following multiple low-dose streptozotocin injections, βCpeKO mice had accelerated development of hyperglycemia with reduced β-cell insulin and Glut2 expression. These findings suggest that Cpe and proper proinsulin processing are critical in maintaining β-cell function during the development of hyperglycemia. Carboxypeptidase E (Cpe) is an enzyme that removes the carboxy-terminal arginine and lysine residues from peptide precursors. Mutations in CPE lead to obesity and type 2 diabetes in humans, and whole-body Cpe knockout or mutant mice are obese and hyperglycemic and fail to convert proinsulin to insulin. We show that β-cell-specific Cpe deletion in mice (βCpeKO) does not lead to the development of obesity or hyperglycemia, even after prolonged high-fat diet treatment. However, β-cell proliferation rate and β-cell area are increased, and the development of hyperglycemia induced by multiple low-dose streptozotocin injections is accelerated in βCpeKO mice. "
738,27644880,"IL-33 is a member of IL-1 superfamily that drives production of Th2-related cytokines. Recently, accumulating evidence suggest an involvement of IL-33 in carcinogenesis. Herein, we determine a close correlation of IL-33 expression and cancer progress in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Overexpression of IL-33 by transfection with IL-33 expression vector enhances NSCLC outgrowth and metastasis, while genetic knockdown of IL-33 by transfection with IL-33 shRNA limits NSCLC progression. In consistent, IL-33 stimulation of NSCLC cells leads to robust NSCLC outgrowth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, IL-33-triggered NSCLC progression relies on ST2 receptor and could be abrogated by ST2 blockade. IL-33/ST2 pathway up-regulates membrane glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) on NSCLC cells, enhancing their glucose uptake and glycolysis. Accordingly, interfering GLUT1 expression dampens IL-33-enhanced glucose uptake and glycolysis in NSCLC cells, thereby abrogates IL-33-induced NSCLC outgrowth and metastasis. In essence, these findings derived from patients' NSCLC cells uncover a new function of IL-33 in NSCLC pathogenesis and identify GLUT1 as a novel target of IL-33 signaling. Block IL-33 is a promising therapeutic strategy to limit NSCLC glycolysis and tumor progression in clinical practice. "
739,37643311,"Nutrition therapy for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has conventionally focused on carbohydrate restriction. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we tested the hypothesis that a diet (all meals provided) with liberalized complex carbohydrate (60%) and lower fat (25%) (CHOICE diet) could improve maternal insulin resistance and 24-h glycemia, resulting in reduced newborn adiposity (NB%fat; powered outcome) versus a conventional lower-carbohydrate (40%) and higher-fat (45%) (LC/CONV) diet. After diagnosis (at ∼28-30 weeks' gestation), 59 women with diet-controlled GDM (mean ± SEM; BMI 32 ± 1 kg/m2) were randomized to a provided LC/CONV or CHOICE diet (BMI-matched calories) through delivery. At 30-31 and 36-37 weeks of gestation, a 2-h, 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed and a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) was worn for 72 h. Cord blood samples were collected at delivery. NB%fat was measured by air displacement plethysmography (13.4 ± 0.4 days). There were 23 women per group (LC/CONV [214 g/day carbohydrate] and CHOICE [316 g/day carbohydrate]). For LC/CONV and CHOICE, respectively (mean ± SEM), NB%fat (10.1 ± 1 vs. 10.5 ± 1), birth weight (3,303 ± 98 vs. 3,293 ± 81 g), and cord C-peptide levels were not different. Weight gain, physical activity, and gestational age at delivery were similar. At 36-37 weeks of gestation, CGM fasting (86 ± 3 vs. 90 ± 3 mg/dL), 1-h postprandial (119 ± 3 vs. 117 ± 3 mg/dL), 2-h postprandial (106 ± 3 vs. 108 ± 3 mg/dL), percent time in range (%TIR; 92 ± 1 vs. 91 ± 1), and 24-h glucose area under the curve values were similar between diets. The %time >120 mg/dL was statistically higher (8%) in CHOICE, as was the nocturnal glucose AUC; however, nocturnal %TIR (63-100 mg/dL) was not different. There were no between-group differences in OGTT glucose and insulin levels at 36-37 weeks of gestation. A ∼100 g/day difference in carbohydrate intake did not result in between-group differences in NB%fat, cord C-peptide level, maternal 24-h glycemia, %TIR, or insulin resistance indices in diet-controlled GDM.

740,36607285,"Hyperglycemia is closely related to adverse pregnancy outcomes including pre-eclampsia (PE), a life-threatening complication with a substantial morbidity and mortality. However, the pathogenesis of abnormal placentation in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)-associated PE remains elusive. Here we isolated exosomes from the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with normal level of glucose (NG) and high levels of glucose (HG). The exosomes were added to HTR-8a/SVneo cells, a trophoblast cell line. High-throughput RNA-sequencing was performed to analyzed the changed RNAs in the exosomes and exosome-treated HTR-8a/SVneo cells. HTR-8a/SVneo cell phenotypes were evaluated from the aspects of cell proliferation, cell invasion and DNA damage. After treatment with HG, the changed RNAs in exosomes was enriched in RNA stabilization and oxidative stress. The altered RNAs in the HTR-8a/SVneo cells treated with exosomes from HG-induced HUVECs were enriched in pathways related to cell adhesion, migration, DNA damage response and angiogenesis. The HG-induced exosomes impaired the proliferation and invasion of HTR-8a cells and caused the DNA damage. HG up-regulated PUM2 in the exosomes and exosome-treated HTR-8a/SVneo cells. PUM2 interacted with SOX2 mRNA, resulting in the mRNA degradation. Overexpression of SOX2 prevented the damage to HTR-8a/SVneo cells caused by the exosomes from HG-induced HUVECs. We demonstrate that high glucose-induced endothelial exosomes mediate abnormal phenotypes of trophoblasts through PUM2-mediated repression of SOX2. Our results reveal a novel regulatory mechanism of hyperglycemia in development of abnormal placentation and provide potential targets for preventing adverse pregnancy outcomes. "
741,36206761,"Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) is becoming recognized as a pleiotropic mediator of metabolic disorders. However, the relationship between LCN2 and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is not well understood. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore it. A systematic search of Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wan-fang Database was done for relevant articles published up to September 29, 2021. Standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated to explore the association of LCN2 levels with GDM using Revman 5.3 and Stata 15.1. Fifteen case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis. The patients with GDM had significantly higher levels of blood LCN2 than parturients with normal glucose tolerance (SMD=3.41, 95% CI=2.24 to 4.58). Meta-regression and subgroup analysis were conducted to investigate the source of heterogeneity. Likely sources of heterogeneity were age and testing methods. This study found that GDM showed higher blood LCN2 levels than controls. However, caution is warranted on the interpretation of these findings. Standardized LCN2 measurement methods and longitudinal studies are required to disentangle and better understand the relationships observed. "
742,27004006,"To prospectively analyze the impact of increased intestinal permeability (IP) on mortality and the occurrence of infections in patients with cirrhosis. IP was quantified using the lactulose/mannitol (L/M) test in 46 hospitalized patients with cirrhosis (25 Child-Pugh A/B, 21 Child-Pugh C) and in 16 healthy controls. Markers of inflammation [LPS-binding protein, Interleukin-6 (IL-6)] and enterocyte death [intestinal fatty-acid binding protein (I-FABP)] were determined in serum using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Patients were followed for one year and assessed for survival, liver transplantation, the necessity of hospitalization and the occurrence of bacterial infections. The primary endpoint of the study was defined as differences in survival between patients with pathological and without pathological lactulose/mannitol test. Thirty-nine (85%) patients with cirrhosis had a pathologically increased IP index (L/M ratio > 0.07) compared to 4 (25%) healthy controls (P < 0.0001). The IP index correlated with the Child-Pugh score (r = 0.484, P = 0.001) and with serum IL-6 (r = 0.342, P = 0.02). Within one year, nineteen (41%) patients developed a total of 33 episodes of hospitalization with bacterial or fungal infections. Although patients who developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) (n = 7) had a higher IP index than patients who did not (0.27 vs 0.14, P = 0.018), the baseline IP index did not predict time to infection, infection-free survival or overall survival, neither when assessed as linear variable, as tertiles, nor dichotomized using an established cut-off. In contrast, model for end-stage liver disease score, Child-Pugh score, the presence of ascites, serum IL-6 and I-FABP were univariate predictors of infection-free survival. Although increased IP is a frequent phenomenon in advanced cirrhosis and may predispose to SBP, it failed to predict infection-free and overall survival in this prospective cohort study. "
743,12237095,"Although mixtures of HES and sugars are used to preserve cells during freezing or drying, little is known about the glass transition of HES, or how mixtures of HES and sugars vitrify. These difficulties may be due to the polydispersity between HES samples or differences in preparation techniques, as well as problems in measuring the glass transition temperature (T(g)) using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In this report, we examine the T(g) of mixtures of HES and trehalose sugar with <1% moisture content using DSC measurements. By extrapolating these measurements to pure HES using the Gordon-Taylor and Fox equations, we were able to estimate the T(g) of our HES sample at 44 degrees C. These results were additionally confirmed by using mixtures of glucose-HES which yielded a similar extrapolated T(g) value. Our approach to estimating the glass transition temperature of HES may be useful in other cases where glass transitions are not easily identified. "
744,38215787,"The purpose of this study was to explore the correlation between inflammatory indicators and blood lipids and to further provide a theoretical basis for the diagnosis and treatment of clinical polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Whole-blood cell counts and hormone and blood lipid levels were measured in 110 patients with PCOS and 126 healthy women. The differences in the above levels and the correlation between inflammation and blood lipid levels in the two groups were determined, and classified according to BMI. Differences in inflammatory indices were also analyzed. The independent risk factors for PCOS were analyzed by binary logistic regression. The PCOS group had greater BMI and greater body weight than the control group. The inflammatory indicators WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte counts and the NLR were significantly higher than those of the control group. It had higher testosterone (TSTO), triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) levels. Correlation analysis showed that leukocyte and neutrophil counts were positively correlated with TSTO and TG levels and negatively correlated with HDL. In the BMI ≥ 24 and BMI < 24 groups, WBC was higher in PCOS patients than in healthy controls. Logistic regression showed that TSTO, TG and FSH were independent risk factors for PCOS. Inflammatory markers are correlated with blood lipids in PCOS. During the treatment of PCOS, blood lipids and serum inflammatory factors should be monitored. "
745,32842160,"Ketogenic diets (KDs) are used to treat epilepsies resistant to pharmacotherapy or some inborn errors of metabolism. For prolonged anesthesia, use of balanced electrolyte solutions (BESs) supplemented with 0.5% glucose has been advocated to maintain ketosis while preventing hypoglycemia. Unfortunately, there is no BES containing 0.5% glucose available from pharmacies. In a laboratory study, we investigated the physical and chemical stability of different BES mixtures containing 0.5% glucose. In total, six approaches were chosen to create a BES with 0.5% glucose: three different glucose-free BESs were supplemented with glucose. Additionally, commercially available BES containing 1% glucose was diluted with three different glucose-free BESs to obtain a solution containing 0.5% glucose. Turbidity, pH, electrical conductivity, and macroscopic appearance of these solutions were measured immediately, at 24 hours, and after 7 days, and were compared with the original BES. Turbidity, pH, and electrical conductivity, as well as macroscopic appearance did not exceed the changes of the controls. No signs of incompatibility reactions could be observed in a 1-week time period. Our study supports the stability of the examined BES containing 0.5% glucose for prolonged anesthesia in patients on KD. Clinical studies are needed to evaluate if BES containing 0.5% glucose is superior in patients on KDs. "
746,31116953,"The wood frog is one of the few freeze-tolerance vertebrates. This is accomplished in part by the accumulation of cryoprotectant glucose, metabolic rate depression, and stress response activation. These may be achieved by mechanisms such as DNA methylation, which is typically associated with transcriptional repression. Hyperglycemia is also associated with modifications to epigenetic profiles, indicating an additional role that the high levels of glucose play in freeze tolerance. We sought to determine whether DNA methylation is affected during freezing exposure, and whether this is due to the wood frog's response to hyperglycemia. We examined global DNA methylation and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in the liver and muscle of frozen and glucose-loaded wood frogs. The results showed that levels of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) increased in the muscle, suggesting elevated DNA methylation during freezing. DNMT activities also decreased in muscle during thawing, glucose loading, and in vitro glucose experiments. Liver DNMT activities were similar to muscle; however, a varied response to DNMT levels and a decrease in 5mC highlight the metabolic role the liver plays during freezing. Glucose was also shown to decrease DNMT activity levels in the wood frog, in vitro, elucidating a potentially novel regulatory mechanism. Together these results suggest an interplay between freeze tolerance and hyperglycemic regulation of DNA methylation. "
747,34736488,"Most preterm infants require a continuous glucose infusion in the early postnatal period due to the interruption of the transplacental glucose supply after birth to promote better neurodevelopmental outcomes. To investigate the glucose infusion rate (GIR) on parenteral nutrition (PN) in the first week of life administered in preterm infants and its effect on neonatal morbidity and mortality. This study included 97 infants aged < 37 gestational weeks and weighed < 2500 g at birth. Infants recruited in this study were classified into 3 groups based on the GIR usage in parenteral nutrition as follows: GIR usage of 5- < 7 g/kg/day (Group I), GIR usage of 7-13 g/kg/day (Group II), and GIR usage of > 13-15 g/kg/day (Group III). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyzes were carried out to investigate whether the GIR usage in the three groups was associated with selected neonatal morbidities and mortality. Neonatal morbidities analyzed included respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, retinopathy of prematurity, pulmonary hypertension, hypoglycemia, and hyperglycemia. Of 97 preterm infants included, 51.5% infants had a gestational age of 34- < 37 weeks, and 54.6% infants had a birth weight of 1500- < 2500 g. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the GIR usage of 5- < 7 g/kg/day was an independent variable that significantly increased the risk of hypoglycemia (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 4.000, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 1.384-11.565, P = 0.010) and reduced the risk of sepsis (AOR = 0.096, 95% CI = 0.012-0.757, P = 0.026). The GIR usage in all three groups did not increase the risk of mortality. For neonatal morbidity analyzed in this study, RDS (AOR = 5.404, 95%CI = 1.421-20.548, P = 0.013) was an independent risk factor of mortality. The GIR usage of < 7 g/kg/day in PN in the first week of life administered to preterm infants was an independent variable in increasing hypoglycemia, but in contrast, reducing the risk of sepsis. "
748,27638595,"Krabbe disease (KD) is caused by mutations in the galactosylceramidase (GALC) gene, which encodes a lysosomal enzyme that degrades galactolipids, including galactosylceramide and galactosylsphingosine (psychosine). GALC deficiency results in progressive intracellular accumulation of psychosine, which is believed to be the main cause for the demyelinating neurodegeneration in KD pathology. Umbilical cord blood transplantation slows disease progression when performed presymptomatically but carries a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Accurate presymptomatic diagnosis is therefore critical to facilitate the efficacy of existing transplant approaches and to avoid unnecessary treatment of children who will not develop KD. Unfortunately, current diagnostic criteria, including GALC activity, genetic analysis, and psychosine measurement, are insufficient for secure presymptomatic diagnosis. This study performs a global metabolomic analysis to identify pathogenetic metabolic pathways and novel biomarkers implicated in the authentic mouse model of KD known as twitcher. At a time point before onset of signs of disease, twitcher hindbrains had metabolic profiles similar to WT, with the exception of a decrease in metabolites related to glucose energy metabolism. Many metabolic pathways were altered after early signs of disease in the twitcher, including decreased phospholipid turnover, restricted mitochondrial metabolism of branched-chain amino acids, increased inflammation, and changes in neurotransmitter metabolism and osmolytes. Hypoxanthine, a purine derivative, is increased before signs of disease appear, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for early diagnosis of KD. Additionally, given the early changes in glucose metabolism in the pathogenesis of KD, diagnostic modalities that report metabolic function, such as positron emission tomography, may be useful in KD. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

749,27424148,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease causing progressive destruction of pancreatic β cells, ultimately resulting in loss of insulin secretion producing hyperglycemia usually affecting children. Replacement of damaged β cells by cell therapy can treat it. Currently available strategies are insulin replacement and islet/pancreas transplantation. Unfortunately these offer rescue for variable duration due to development of autoantibodies. For pancreas/islet transplantation a deceased donor is required and various shortfalls of treatment include quantum, cumbersome technique, immune rejection and limited availability of donors. Stem cell therapy with assistance of cellular reprogramming and β-cell regeneration can open up new therapeutic modalities. The present review describes the history and current knowledge of T1DM, evolution of cell therapies and different cellular therapies to cure this condition. "
750,23995291,"Functional smooth muscle engineering requires isolation and expansion of smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and this process is particularly challenging for visceral smooth muscle tissue where progenitor cells have not been clearly identified. Herein we showed for the first time that efficient SMCs can be obtained from human amniotic fluid stem cells (hAFSCs). Clonal lines were generated from c-kit(+) hAFSCs. Differentiation toward SM lineage (SMhAFSCs) was obtained using a medium conditioned by PDGF-BB and TGF-β1. Molecular assays revealed higher level of α smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), desmin, calponin, and smoothelin in SMhAFSCs when compared to hAFSCs. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrated that SMhAFSCs also presented in the cytoplasm increased intermediate filaments, dense bodies, and glycogen deposits like SMCs. SMhAFSC metabolism evaluated via mass spectrometry showed higher glucose oxidation and an enhanced response to mitogenic stimuli in comparison to hAFSCs. Patch clamp of transduced hAFSCs with lentiviral vectors encoding ZsGreen under the control of the α-SMA promoter was performed demonstrating that SMhAFSCs retained a smooth muscle cell-like electrophysiological fingerprint. Eventually SMhAFSCs contractility was evident both at single cell level and on a collagen gel. In conclusion, we showed here that hAFSCs under selective culture conditions are able to give rise to functional SMCs. "
751,25765514,"Nutrition in pregnancy can elicit long-term effects on the health of offspring. Although fructose consumption has increased globally and is linked to metabolic syndrome, little is known about the long-term effects of maternal high-fructose (HF) exposure during gestation and lactation, especially on renal programming. We examined potential key genes and pathways that are associated with HF-induced renal programming using whole-genome RNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) to quantify the abundance of RNA transcripts in kidneys from 1-day-, 3-week-, and 3-month-old male offspring. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats received regular chow or chow supplemented with HF (60% diet by weight) during the entire period of pregnancy and lactation. Male offspring exhibited programmed hypertension at 3 months of age. Maternal HF intake modified over 200 renal transcripts from nephrogenesis stage to adulthood. We observed that 20 differentially expressed genes identified in 1-day-old kidney are related to regulation of blood pressure. Among them, Hmox1, Bdkrb2, Adra2b, Ptgs2, Col1a2 and Tbxa2r are associated with endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). NGS also identified genes in arachidonic acid metabolism (Cyp2c23, Hpgds, Ptgds and Ptges) that may be potential key genes/pathways contributing to renal programming and hypertension. Collectively, our NGS data suggest that maternal HF intake elicits a defective adaptation of interrelated EDHFs during nephrogenesis which may lead to renal programming and hypertension in later life. Moreover, our results highlight genes and pathways involved in renal programming as potential targets for therapeutic approaches to prevent metabolic-syndrome-related comorbidities in children with HF exposure in early life.

754,26634435,"Hyperosmotic stress may induce apoptosis of different cells. However, oocytes show tolerance to osmotic stress during cryopreservation by vitrification, which is an assisted reproductive technique. The underlying mechanism is still not understood. Here, we demonstrated that hyperosmosis produced by high concentrations of cryoprotectants, including DMSO, ethylene glycol and sucrose, significantly upregulated the protein levels of aquaporin (AQP) 7, but not AQP3 and AQP9, in mouse oocytes. Knockdown of AQP7 expression by siRNA-injection significantly reduced the survival of oocytes after vitrification. In oocytes, AQP7 was shown to bind with F-actin, a protein involved in almost all biological events. Moreover, we found that hyperosmosis could upregulate the phosphorylation levels of CPE-binding protein (CPEB) and Aurora A. Inhibition of the PI3K and PKC pathways blocked the hyperosmosis-induced upregulation of AQP7 and the phosphorylation of CPEB and Aurora A in oocytes. In conclusion, hyperosmosis could upregulate the expression of AQP7 via Aurora A/CPEB phosphorylation mediated by the PI3K and PKC pathways, and upregulation of AQP7 plays an important role in improving of tolerance to hyperosmotic stress and survival of oocytes during cryopreservation by vitrification.

756,26936652,"Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) induces metabolic syndrome, which is often characterized by insulin resistance (IR), in adults. Previous research has shown that microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) play a role in the target genes involved in this process, but the mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we examined miRNA profiles using samples of skeletal muscles from both IUGR and control rat offspring whose mothers were fed either a protein-restricted diet or a diet which involved normal amounts of protein during pregnancy, respectively. miR‑29a was found to be upregulated in the skeletal muscles of IUGR offspring. The luciferase reporter assay conﬁrmed the direct interaction between miR‑29a and peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor δ (PPARδ). Overexpression of miR‑29a in the skeletal muscle cell line C2C12 suppressed the expression of its target gene PPARδ, which, in turn, influenced the expression of its coactivator, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α). Thus, PPARδ/PGC-1α‑dependent signals together reduced insulin-dependent glucose uptake and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. Overexpression of miR‑29a also caused a decrease in levels of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), the most important glucose transporter in skeletal muscle, which partially induced a decrease insulin‑dependent glucose uptake. These findings provide evidence for a novel micro-RNA‑mediated mechanism of PPARδ regulation, and we also noted the IR-promoting actions of miR-29a in skeletal muscles of IUGR. "
757,37230214,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a liver manifestation of metabolic syndrome, and is estimated to affect one billion individuals worldwide. An increased intake of a high-fat diet (HFD) and sugar-sweetened beverages are risk-factors for NAFLD development, but how their combined intake promotes progression to a more severe form of liver injury is unknown. Here we show that fructose metabolism via ketohexokinase (KHK) C isoform leads to unresolved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress when coupled with a HFD intake. Conversely, a liver-specific knockdown of KHK in mice consuming fructose on a HFD is adequate to improve the NAFLD activity score and exert a profound effect on the hepatic transcriptome. Overexpression of KHK-C in cultured hepatocytes is sufficient to induce ER stress in fructose free media. Upregulation of KHK-C is also observed in mice with genetically induced obesity or metabolic dysfunction, whereas KHK knockdown in these mice improves metabolic function. Additionally, in over 100 inbred strains of male or female mice hepatic KHK expression correlates positively with adiposity, insulin resistance, and liver triglycerides. Similarly, in 241 human subjects and their controls, hepatic Khk expression is upregulated in early, but not late stages of NAFLD. In summary, we describe a novel role of KHK-C in triggering ER stress, which offers a mechanistic understanding of how the combined intake of fructose and a HFD propagates the development of metabolic complications.

758,39304237,"Oral iron for anaemia in pregnancy is often not well tolerated, with poor adherence. Iron administered intravenously might address these tolerance and adherence issues. We investigated the effectiveness and safety of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose versus oral ferrous sulphate on anaemia and iron deficiency among pregnant women in Nigeria. We did a multicentre, open-label, parallel, randomised controlled trial of pregnant women (aged 15-49 years) with haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations of less than 10 g/dL at 20-32 weeks' gestation from 11 primary, secondary, or tertiary health facilities in Nigeria (five in Lagos and six in Kano). Exclusion criteria included vaginal bleeding, blood transfusion or major surgery within the past 3 months, symptomatic anaemia, anaemia known to be unrelated to iron deficiency, clinically confirmed malabsorption syndrome, previous hypersensitivity to any form of iron, pre-existing maternal depression or other major psychiatric illness, immune-related diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis, or severe allergic reactions. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) by nurses and doctors using a web-based randomisation service to either receive a single dose of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (20 mg/kg to a maximum of 1000 mg) or oral ferrous sulphate (200 mg; 65 mg elemental iron) three times daily until 6 weeks postpartum. The study was primarily unmasked. Primary outcomes were maternal anaemia (Hb <11 g/dL) at 36 weeks' gestation and preterm birth at before 37 weeks' gestation, with analysis by intention to treat in participants with available data. This study was registered at the ISRCTN registry on Dec 10, 2020 (ISRCTN63484804) and on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04976179) on April 7, 2021. Between Aug 10, 2021, and Dec 15, 2022, 13 724 pregnant women were screened for eligibility. 12 668 were excluded due to ineligibility for inclusion, and 1056 provided consent to participate and were randomly assigned to either the intravenous or oral administration groups. 527 were assigned to the intravenous ferric carboxymaltose group and 529 were assigned to the oral ferrous sulphate group. 518 in the intravenous group were assessed at 36 weeks' gestational age and after 518 deliveries, and 511 completed the 6 weeks postpartum visit. 513 in the oral ferrous sulphate group were assessed at 36 weeks' gestational age and after 512 deliveries, and 501 completed the 6 weeks postpartum visit. No significant difference was found in anaemia at 36 weeks (299 [58%] of 517 in the intravenous group vs 305 [61%] of 503 in the oral group; risk ratio 0·95, 95% CI 0·85-1·06; p=0·36), nor in preterm birth (73 [14%] of 518 vs 77 [15%] of 513; 0·94, 0·70-1·26; p=0·66). There were no significant differences in adverse events. The most common adverse events were diarrhoea (in six participants) and vomiting (in three participants) in the oral group and fatigue (in two participants) and headache (in two participants) in the intravenous group. Although the effect on overall anaemia did not differ, intravenous iron reduced the prevalence of iron deficiency to a greater extent than oral iron and was considered to be safe. We recommend that intravenous iron be considered for anaemic pregnant women in Nigeria and similar settings. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. "

760,33484149,"There are few evidence-based strategies to attenuate the risk of metabolic syndrome in offspring exposed to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Berberine (BBR) is an isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from Chinese herbs and exhibits glucose lowering properties. We hypothesized that dietary BBR would improve health outcomes in the mouse offspring of GDM dams. Wild-type C57BL/6 female mice were fed either a Lean-inducing low-fat diet (L-LF,10% kcal fat, 35% kcal sucrose) or a GDM-inducing high-fat diet (GDM-HF, 45% kcal fat, 17.5% sucrose) for 6 wk prior to breeding with wild-type C57BL/6 male mice throughout pregnancy and the suckling period. The resulting Lean and GDM-exposed male and female offspring were randomly assigned an LF (10% kcal fat, 35% kcal sucrose), HF (45% kcal fat, 17.5% sucrose), or high-fat berberine (HFB) (45% kcal fat, 17.5% sucrose diet) containing BBR (160 mg/kg/d, HFB) at weaning for 12 wk. The main outcome was to evaluate the effects of BBR on obesity, pancreatic islet function, and cardiac contractility in GDM-exposed HF-fed offspring. Significance between measurements was determined using a 2 (gestational exposure) × 3 (diet) factorial design by a 2- way ANOVA using Tukey post-hoc analysis. In the GDM-HF group, body weights were significantly increased (16%) compared with those in baseline (L-LF) animals (P < 0.05). Compared with the L-LF animals, the GDM-HF group had a reduction in pancreatic insulin glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (74%) and increased cardiac isovolumetric contraction time (IVCT; ∼150%) (P < 0.05). Compared with GDM-HF animals, the GDM-HFB group with the dietary addition of BBR had significantly reduced body weight (16%), increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic islets (254%), and reduced systolic heart function (46% IVCT) (P < 0.05). In a mouse model of GDM, dietary BBR treatment provided protection from obesity and the development of pancreatic islet and cardiac dysfunction. "
761,31997826,"BACKGROUND Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) results from the restoration of blood supply to ischemic organs, including the heart. Expression of microRNA-668-3p (miR-668-3p) is known to protect the kidney from IRI. This study aimed to investigate the role of miR-668-3p in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in a rat H9c2 cardiomyocyte model of IRI. MATERIAL AND METHODS Rat H9c2 cardiomyocytes were cultured in glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) under anaerobic conditions, followed by oxygenation, to create the OGD model of IRI. The luciferase reporter assay evaluated the interaction between stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), or CXC motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12), and miR-668-3p. Protein and mRNA levels of SDF-1, CXCR4, Bcl2, Bax, cleaved caspase-3, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (p-eNOS) were analyzed by Western blot and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and apoptosis were assessed by flow cytometry. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) measured reactive oxygen species (ROS), including malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), p-eNOS, and the inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in H9c2 cell supernatants. RESULTS In the OGD rat H9c2 cardiomyocyte model of IRI, miR-668-3p levels were reduced. Overexpression of miR-668-3p inhibited SDF-1, CXCR4, the expression of inflammatory cytokines, markers of oxidative stress, and p-eNOS. The overexpression of SDF-1 reversed these findings. Overexpression of SDF-1 promoted cell apoptosis, which was reduced by miR-668-3p. CONCLUSIONS In the OGD rat H9c2 cardiomyocyte model of IRI, miR-668-3p suppressed mediators of inflammation and oxidative stress and enhanced cell viability through the SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling pathway.

762,27396327,"Understanding the fiber-type specification and metabolic switch in skeletal muscle provides insights into energy metabolism in physiology and diseases. Here, we show that miR-182 is highly expressed in fast-twitch muscle and negatively correlates with blood glucose level. miR-182 knockout mice display muscle loss, fast-to-slow fiber-type switching, and impaired glucose metabolism. Mechanistic studies reveal that miR-182 modulates glucose utilization in muscle by targeting FoxO1 and PDK4, which control fuel selection via the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC). Short-term high-fat diet (HFD) feeding reduces muscle miR-182 levels by tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), which contributes to the upregulation of FoxO1/PDK4. Restoration of miR-182 expression in HFD-fed mice induces a faster muscle phenotype, decreases muscle FoxO1/PDK4 levels, and improves glucose metabolism. Together, our work establishes miR-182 as a critical regulator that confers robust and precise controls on fuel usage and glucose homeostasis. Our study suggests that a metabolic shift toward a faster and more glycolytic phenotype is beneficial for glucose control. "
763,27132231,"The present study generated a novel DNA complex to specifically target endothelial NF-κB to inhibit cerebral vascular inflammation. This DNA complex (GS24-NFκB) contains a DNA decoy which inhibits NF-κB activity, and a DNA aptamer (GS-24), a ligand of transferrin receptor (TfR), which allows for targeted delivery of the DNA decoy into cells. The results indicate that GS24-NFκB was successfully delivered into a murine brain-derived endothelial cell line, bEND5, and inhibited inflammatory responses induced by tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) or oxygen-glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R) via down-regulation of the nuclear NF-κB subunit, p65, as well as its downstream inflammatory cytokines, inter-cellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1). The inhibitory effect of the GS24-NFκB was demonstrated by a significant reduction in TNF-α or OGD/R induced monocyte adhesion to the bEND5 cells after GS24-NFκB treatment. Intravenous (i.v.) injection of GS24-'NFκB (15mg/kg) was able to inhibit the levels of phoseph-p65 and VCAM-1 in brain endothelial cells in a mouse lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory model in vivo. In conclusion, our approach using DNA nanotechnology for DNA decoy delivery could potentially be utilized for inhibition of inflammation in ischemic stroke and other neuro-inflammatory diseases affecting cerebral vasculature.

764,15185208,"Infants requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have the highest rates of protein catabolism ever reported. Recent investigations have found that such extreme protein breakdown is refractory to conventional nutritional management. In this pilot study, the authors sought to use the anabolic hormone insulin to reduce the profound protein degradation in this cohort. Four parenterally fed infants on ECMO were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, crossover trial. Subjects were administered an insulin infusion using a 4-hour hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp followed by a control saline infusion on consecutive days in random order. Whole-body protein flux and breakdown were quantified using a primed continuous infusion of the stable isotope L-[1-13C]leucine. Statistical analyses were performed using paired t tests. Serum insulin levels were increased 15-fold during the insulin clamp compared with the saline control (407 +/- 103 v 26 +/- 12 microU/mL; P <.05). During the insulin infusion, infants had decreased rates of total leucine flux (214 +/- 25 v 298 +/- 38 micromol/kg/h; P <.05) and leucine flux derived from protein breakdown (156 +/- 40 v 227 +/- 54 micromol/kg/h; P <.05) when compared with saline control. Overall, insulin administration produced a 32% reduction in protein breakdown (P <.05). In this pilot study, the anabolic hormone insulin markedly reduced protein breakdown in critically ill infants on ECMO. Because elevated protein breakdown correlates with mortality and morbidity, the administration of intravenous insulin may ultimately have broad applicability to the metabolic management of critically ill infants.

765,35060344,"Compared to the exhaustive study of transgenerational programming of obesity and diabetes through exposures in the prenatal period, postnatal programming mechanisms are understudied, including the potential role of breast milk composition linking maternal metabolic status (body mass index and diabetes) and offspring growth, metabolic health and future disease risk. This narrative review will principally focus on four emergent bioactive compounds [microRNA's (miRNA), lipokines/signalling lipids, small molecules/metabolites and fructose] that, until recently were not known to exist in breast milk. The objective of this narrative review is to integrate evidence across multiple fields of study that demonstrate the importance of these compositional elements of breast milk during lactation and the subsequent effect of breast milk components on the health of the infant. Current knowledge on the presence of miRNA's, lipokines/signalling lipids, small molecules/metabolites and fructose in breast milk and their associations with infant outcomes is compelling, but far from resolved. Two themes emerge: (1) maternal metabolic phenotypes are associated with these bioactives and (2) though existing in milk at low concentrations, they are also associated with offspring growth and body composition. Breast milk research is gaining momentum though we must remain focused on understanding how non-nutritive bioactive components are affected by the maternal phenotype, how they subsequently impact infant outcomes. Though early, there is evidence to suggest fructose is associated with fat mass in the 1st months of life whereas 12,13 diHOME (brown fat activator) and betaine are negatively associated with early adiposity and growth.

766,24360749,"Walnut consumption is associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). We assessed the effect of walnuts on lipid and glucose metabolism, adipokines, inflammation and endothelial function in healthy Caucasian men and postmenopausal women ≥50years old. Forty subjects (mean±SEM: age 60±1years, BMI 24.9±0.6kg/m(2); 30 females) were included in a controlled, cross-over study and randomized to receive first a walnut-enriched (43g/d) and then a Western-type (control) diet or vice-versa, with each lasting 8weeks and separated by a 2-week wash-out. At the beginning and end of each diet phase, measurements of fasting values, a mixed meal test and an assessment of postprandial endothelial function (determination of microcirculation by peripheral artery tonometry) were conducted. Area under the curve (AUC), incremental AUC (iAUC) and treatment×time interaction (shape of the curve) were evaluated for postprandial triglycerides, VLDL-triglycerides, chylomicron-triglycerides, glucose and insulin. Compared with the control diet, the walnut diet significantly reduced non-HDL-cholesterol (walnut vs. control: -10±3 vs. -3±2mg/dL; p=0.025) and apolipoprotein-B (-5.0±1.3 vs. -0.2±1.1mg/dL; p=0.009) after adjusting for age, gender, BMI and diet sequence. Total cholesterol showed a trend toward reduction (p=0.073). Fasting VLDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, and HbA1c did not change significantly. Similarly, fasting adipokines, C-reactive protein, biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction, postprandial lipid and glucose metabolism and endothelial function were unaffected. Daily consumption of 43g of walnuts for 8weeks significantly reduced non-HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein-B, which may explain in part the epidemiological observation that regular walnut consumption decreases CHD risk.

767,29044608,"Pancreatic beta cells sense changes in nutrients during the cycles of fasting and feeding and release insulin accordingly to maintain glucose homeostasis. Abnormal beta cell nutrient sensing resulting from gene mutations leads to hypoglycemia or diabetes. Glucokinase (GCK) plays a key role in beta cell glucose sensing. As one form of congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI), activating mutations of GCK result in a decreased threshold for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and hypoglycemia. In contrast, inactivating mutations of GCK result in diabetes, including a mild form (MODY2) and a severe form (permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM)). Mutations of beta cell ion channels involved in insulin secretion regulation also alter glucose sensing. Activating or inactivating mutations of ATP-dependent potassium (K "
768,21552279,"5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is a modified base present at low levels in diverse cell types in mammals. 5hmC is generated by the TET family of Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent enzymes through oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC). 5hmC and TET proteins have been implicated in stem cell biology and cancer, but information on the genome-wide distribution of 5hmC is limited. Here we describe two novel and specific approaches to profile the genomic localization of 5hmC. The first approach, termed GLIB (glucosylation, periodate oxidation, biotinylation) uses a combination of enzymatic and chemical steps to isolate DNA fragments containing as few as a single 5hmC. The second approach involves conversion of 5hmC to cytosine 5-methylenesulphonate (CMS) by treatment of genomic DNA with sodium bisulphite, followed by immunoprecipitation of CMS-containing DNA with a specific antiserum to CMS. High-throughput sequencing of 5hmC-containing DNA from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells showed strong enrichment within exons and near transcriptional start sites. 5hmC was especially enriched at the start sites of genes whose promoters bear dual histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) marks. Our results indicate that 5hmC has a probable role in transcriptional regulation, and suggest a model in which 5hmC contributes to the 'poised' chromatin signature found at developmentally-regulated genes in ES cells.

769,37811713,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a progressive muscle disease caused by the absence of functional dystrophin protein, is associated with multiple cellular, physiological, and metabolic dysfunctions. As an added complication to the primary insult, obesity/insulin resistance (O/IR) is frequently reported in patients with DMD; however, how IR impacts disease severity is unknown. We hypothesized a high-fat, high-sucrose diet (HFHSD) would induce O/IR, exacerbate disease severity, and cause metabolic alterations in dystrophic mice. To test this hypothesis, we treated 7-wk-old mdx (disease model) and C57 mice with a control diet (CD) or an HFHSD for 15 wk. The HFHSD induced insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and hyperglycemia in C57 and mdx mice. Of note, mdx mice on CD were also insulin resistant. In addition, visceral adipose tissue weights were increased with HFHSD in C57 and mdx mice though differed by genotype. Serum creatine kinase activity and histopathological analyses using Masson's trichrome staining in the diaphragm indicated muscle damage was driven by dystrophin deficiency but was not augmented by diet. In addition, markers of inflammatory signaling, mitochondrial abundance, and autophagy were impacted by disease but not diet. Despite this, in addition to disease signatures in CD-fed mice, metabolomic and lipidomic analyses demonstrated a HFHSD caused some common changes in C57 and mdx mice and some unique signatures of O/IR within the context of dystrophin deficiency. In total, these data revealed that in mdx mice, 15 wk of HFHSD did not overtly exacerbate muscle injury but further impaired the metabolic status of dystrophic muscle. "

771,31368136,"Perinatal iron deficiency causes changes in offspring mesenteric artery function in adulthood, particularly in males, which can be exacerbated by chronic intake of a high salt diet. Perinatal iron deficient male offspring exhibit enhanced conversion of big endothelin-1 to active endothelin-1, coinciding with decreased nitric oxide levels. Perinatal iron deficient male offspring have reduced nitric oxide-mediated endothelial-dependent vasodilatation coincident with increased vascular superoxide levels following consumption of a high salt diet. Perinatal iron deficiency has no apparent effects on vascular function in female offspring, even when fed a high salt diet. These results help us better understand underlying vascular mechanisms contributing to increased cardiovascular risk from perinatal stressors such as iron deficiency. Pre- and immediate postnatal stressors, such as iron deficiency, can alter developmental trajectories and predispose offspring to long-term cardiovascular dysfunction. Here, we investigated the impact of perinatal iron deficiency on vascular function in the adult offspring, and whether these long-term effects were exacerbated by prolonged consumption of a high salt diet in adulthood. Female Sprague Dawley rats were fed either an iron-restricted or -replete diet prior to and throughout pregnancy. Six weeks prior to experimentation at 6 months of age, adult offspring were fed either a normal or high salt diet. Mesenteric artery responses to vasodilators and vasoconstrictors were assessed ex vivo by wire myography. Male perinatal iron deficient offspring exhibited decreased reliance on nitric oxide with methacholine-induced vasodilatation (interaction P = 0.03), coincident with increased superoxide levels when fed the high salt diet (P = 0.01). Male perinatal iron deficient offspring exhibit enhanced big endothelin-1 conversion to active endothelin-1 (P = 0.02) concomitant with decreased nitric oxide levels (P = 0.005). Female offspring vascular function was unaffected by perinatal iron deficiency, albeit the high salt diet was associated with impaired vasodilation and decreased nitric oxide production (P = 0.02), particularly in the perinatal iron deficient offspring. These findings implicate vascular dysfunction in the sex-specific programming of cardiovascular dysfunction in the offspring by perinatal iron deficiency. "
772,30952834,"Accumulating evidence suggests that aerobic glycolysis is important for colorectal cancer (CRC) development. However, the underlying mechanisms have yet to be elucidated. B7-H3, an immunoregulatory protein, is broadly overexpressed by multiple tumor types and plays a vital role in tumor progression. In this study, we found that overexpression of B7-H3 effectively increased the rate of glucose consumption and lactate production, whereas knockdown of B7-H3 had the opposite effect. Furthermore, we showed that B7-H3 increased glucose consumption and lactate production by promoting hexokinase 2 (HK2) expression in CRC cells, and we also found that HK2 was a key mediator of B7-H3-induced CRC chemoresistance. Depletion of HK2 expression or treating cells with HK2 inhibitors could reverse the B7-H3-induced increase in aerobic glycolysis and B7-H3-endowed chemoresistance of cancer cells. Moreover, we verified a positive correlation between the expression of B7-H3 and HK2 in tumor tissues of CRC patients. Collectively, our findings suggest that B7-H3 may be a novel regulator of glucose metabolism and chemoresistance via controlling HK2 expression in CRC cells, a result that could help develop B7-H3 as a promising therapeutic target for CRC treatment.

773,37115805,"The aim of this study was to determine the impact of glycyrrhizin, an inhibitor of high mobility group box 1, on glucose metabolic disorders and ovarian dysfunction in mice with polycystic ovary syndrome. We generated a polycystic ovary syndrome mouse model by using dehydroepiandrosterone plus high-fat diet. Glycyrrhizin (100 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected into the polycystic ovary syndrome mice and the effects on body weight, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, estrous cycle, hormone profiles, ovarian pathology, glucolipid metabolism, and some molecular mechanisms were investigated. Increased number of cystic follicles, hormonal disorders, impaired glucose tolerance, and decreased insulin sensitivity in the polycystic ovary syndrome mice were reverted by glycyrrhizin. The increased high mobility group box 1 levels in the serum and ovarian tissues of the polycystic ovary syndrome mice were also reduced by glycyrrhizin. Furthermore, increased expressions of toll-like receptor 9, myeloid differentiation factor 88, and nuclear factor kappa B as well as reduced expressions of insulin receptor, phosphorylated protein kinase B, and glucose transporter type 4 were restored by glycyrrhizin in the polycystic ovary syndrome mice. Glycyrrhizin could suppress the polycystic ovary syndrome-induced upregulation of high mobility group box 1, several inflammatory marker genes, and the toll-like receptor 9/myeloid differentiation factor 88/nuclear factor kappa B pathways, while inhibiting the insulin receptor/phosphorylated protein kinase B/glucose transporter type 4 pathways. Hence, glycyrrhizin is a promising therapeutic agent against polycystic ovary syndrome. "

Data uploaded by MiniMed 780G system users from 27 August 2020 to 22 July 2021 were aggregated and retrospectively analysed based on self-reported age (≤15 years and >15 years) for three cohorts: (a) post-AHCL initiation, (b) 6-month longitudinal post-AHCL initiation and (c) pre- versus post-AHCL initiation. Analyses included mean percentage of time spent in AHCL and at sensor glucose ranges, insulin delivered and the proportion of users achieving recommended glucose management indicator (GMI < 7.0%) and time in target range (TIR 70-180 mg/dl > 70%) goals. Users aged 15 years or younger (N = 3211) achieved a GMI of 6.8% ± 0.3% and TIR of 73.9% ± 8.7%, while spending 92.7% of time in AHCL. Users aged older than 15 years (N = 8874) achieved a GMI of 6.8% ± 0.4% and TIR of 76.5% ± 9.4% with 92.3% of time in AHCL. Time spent at less than 70 mg/dl was within the recommended target of less than 4% (3.2% and 2.3%, respectively). Similar outcomes were observed for each group (N = 790 and N = 1642, respectively) in the first month following AHCL initiation, and were sustained over the 6-month observation period.

775,26455539,"Osthole may be a dual agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) α/γ and ameliorate the insulin resistance (IR), but its mechanisms are not yet understood completely. We investigated the effects of osthole on PPARα/γ-mediated target genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism in liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle in fatty liver and IR rats. The rat model was established by orally feeding high-fat and high-sucrose emulsion for 9 weeks. The experimental rats were treated with osthole 5-10 mg/kg by gavage after feeding the emulsion for 6 weeks, and were sacrificed 4 weeks after administration. After treatment with osthole 5-10 mg/kg for 4 weeks, the lipid levels in serum and liver were decreased by 37.9-67.2% and 31.4-38.5% for triglyceride, 33.1-47.5% and 28.5-31.2% for free fatty acid, respectively, the fasting blood glucose, fasting serum insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of IR were also decreased by 17.2-22.7%, 25.9-26.7%, and 37.5-42.8%, respectively. Osthole treatment might simultaneously decrease the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, diacylglycerol acyltransferase, and fatty acid synthase mRNA expressions in liver and adipose tissue, and increase the carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A mRNA expression in liver and glucose transporter-4 mRNA expression in skeletal muscle, especially in the osthole 10 mg/kg group (p < 0.01). Osthole can improve glucose and lipid metabolism in fatty liver and IR rats, and its mechanisms may be associated with synergic modulation of PPARα/γ-mediated target genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism in liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle.

776,29130958,"Hearts from diabetic subjects are susceptible to myocardial ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury. Propofol has been shown to protect against myocardial I/R injury due to its antioxidant properties while the underlying mechanism remained incompletely understood. Thus, this study aimed to determine whether or not propofol could attenuate myocardial I/R injury by attenuating mitochondrial dysfunction/damage through upregulating Caveolin (Cav)-3 under hyperglycemia. Cultured rat cardiomyocyte H9C2 cells were subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in the absence or presence of propofol under high glucose (HG), and cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and mitochondrial viability as well as creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content were measured with colorimetric Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays. Intracellular levels of oxidative stress was assessed using 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) fluorescent staining and mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis was assessed by detecting mitochondrial membrane potential and the activation of apoptotic caspases 3 and 9. Exposure of cells to HG without or with H/R both significantly increased cell injury, cell apoptosis and enhanced oxidative stress that were associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased Cav-3 protein expression. All these changes were further exacerbated following H/R under HG. Administration of propofol at concentrations from 12.5 to 50 µM but not 100 µM significantly attenuated H/R injury that was associated with increased Cav-3 expression and activation of the prosurvival proteins Akt and STAT3 with the optimal protective effects seen at 50 µM of propofol (P25). The beneficial effects of propofol(P25) were abrogated by Cav-3 disruption with β-methyl-cyclodextrin. Propofol counteracts cardiomyocyte H/R injury by attenuating mitochondrial damage and improving mitochondrial biogenesis through upregulating Cav-3 during hyperglycemia. "
777,25127027,"Insulin resistance and early type-2 diabetes are highly prevalent. However, it is unknown whether Intralipid® and sevoflurane protect the early diabetic heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury. Early type-2 diabetic hearts from Sprague-Dawley rats fed for 6 weeks with fructose were exposed to 15 min of ischemia and 30 min of reperfusion. Intralipid® (1%) was administered at the onset of reperfusion. Peri-ischemic sevoflurane (2 vol.-%) served as alternative protection strategy. Recovery of left ventricular function was recorded and the activation of Akt and ERK 1/2 was monitored. Mitochondrial function was assessed by high-resolution respirometry and mitochondrial ROS production was measured by Amplex Red and aconitase activity assays. Acylcarnitine tissue content was measured and concentration-response curves of complex IV inhibition by palmitoylcarnitine were obtained. Intralipid® did not exert protection in early diabetic hearts, while sevoflurane improved functional recovery. Sevoflurane protection was abolished by concomitant administration of the ROS scavenger N-2-mercaptopropionyl glycine. Sevoflurane, but not Intralipid® produced protective ROS during reperfusion, which activated Akt. Intralipid® failed to inhibit respiratory complex IV, while sevoflurane inhibited complex I. Early diabetic hearts exhibited reduced carnitine-palmitoyl-transferase-1 activity, but palmitoylcarnitine could not rescue protection and enhance postischemic functional recovery. Cardiac mitochondria from early diabetic rats exhibited an increased content of subunit IV-2 of respiratory complex IV and of uncoupling protein-3. Early type-2 diabetic hearts lose complex IV-mediated protection by Intralipid® potentially due to a switch in complex IV subunit expression and increased mitochondrial uncoupling, but are amenable to complex I-mediated sevoflurane protection.

778,21324479,"To determine potential factors regulating gluconeogenesis (GNG) in extremely low birth weight infants receiving total parenteral nutrition. Seven infants (birth weight, 0.824 ± 0.068 kg; gestational age, 25.4 ± 0.5 weeks; postnatal age, 3.3 ± 0.2 days) were studied for 11 hours, with parenteral lipid and amino acid therapy continued at prestudy rates. Glucose was supplied at prestudy rates for the first 5 hours (period 1) and was then reduced to 6 mg/kg·min for 1 hour and further to ~3 mg/kg·min for 5 hours (period 2). A total of 2.5 mg/kg·min of the glucose was replaced by [U-(13)C]glucose throughout the study for measurements of glucose production and GNG. Concentrations of glucose, insulin, glucagons, and cortisol were determined. GNG and glucose production remained unchanged (2.12 ± 0.23 vs. 1.84 ± 0.25 mg/kg·min [P = NS] and 2.44 ± 0.27 vs. 2.51 ± 0.31 mg/kg·min [P = NS], respectively), despite a 60% reduction of the glucose infusion rate and subsequent 30% (124.7 ± 10.8 to 82.6 ± 8.9 mg/dL; P = .009) and 70% (26.9 ± 4.7 to 6.6 ± 0.4 μU/mL; P = .002) decreases in glucose and insulin concentrations, respectively. Cortisol and glucagon concentrations remained unchanged. In extremely low birth weight infants receiving total parenteral nutrition, GNG is a continuous process that is not affected by infusion rates of glucose or concentrations of glucose or insulin. "
779,12851879,"Our aim was to determine whether the intestinotrophic effects of GLP-2 are mediated by acute up-regulation of intestinal substrate utilization in TPN-fed piglets. Twenty-four 12-day-old pigs, fitted with a portal flow probe and carotid, jugular and portal catheters, were fed by TPN for 7 days. On day 8, a group of pigs (n = 8) was infused intravenously with saline (control) for 4 hours and then with GLP-2 (500 pmol x kg(-1) x hour(-1), GLP-2) for 4 hours. (2)H-glucose and (13)C-phenylalanine were infused to estimate their kinetics and protein turnover. Another group (n = 8) received consecutive intravenous infusions of saline, GLP-2, and GLP-2 plus N(G)-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 50 micromol x kg(-1) x hour(-1)) for 4 hours each. GLP-2 acutely increased portal-drained visceral (PDV) blood flow rate (+25%) and intestinal blood volume (+51%) in TPN-fed piglets. GLP-2 also increased intestinal constitutive nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and endothelial NOS protein abundance. GLP-2 acutely increased PDV glucose uptake (+90%) and net lactate production (+79%). Co-infusion of GLP-2 plus L-NAME did not increase either PDV blood flow rate or glucose uptake. GLP-2 increased PDV indispensable amino acid uptake by 220% and protein synthesis by 125%, but did not decrease protein breakdown or phenylalanine oxidation. We conclude that in TPN-fed neonatal pigs, GLP-2 acutely stimulates intestinal blood flow and glucose utilization, and this response is nitric oxide-dependent. These findings suggest that GLP-2 may play an important physiological role in the regulation of intestinal blood flow and that nitric oxide is involved in GLP-2 receptor function. "
780,10647545,"The rating of perceived exertion (RPE) is an indicator of exercise effort in adolescents that may be influenced by certain pediatric conditions. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and glucose intake on RPE. Eight male adolescents with IDDM and eight healthy controls of similar age, weight, and VO2peak cycled for 60 min at 60%VO2peak on two occasions spaced 1-4 wk apart. During a control trial (CT), subjects drank water, and in a glucose trial (GT), glucose at a rate of approximately 1.5 g x kg(-1) x h(-1). Heart rate, ventilation, and RPE (Borg 6-20 scale) were assessed at 5, 25, 35, and 55 min and blood glucose and lactate levels before and at 30 and 60 min. RPE in both trials was 15-25% higher in IDDM versus healthy subjects (F = 8.83; df = 1,14; eta-squared = 0.39; P = 0.01). In CT, it increased from 10.6 +/- 0.4 at 5 min to 15.2 +/- 0.6 at 55 min in IDDM and from 9.3 +/- 0.9 at 5 min to 13.0 +/- 0.8 at 55 min in healthy adolescents. In GT, RPE increased similarly to CT in the IDDM group but was 1-2 points lower in the healthy group. Blood glucose levels were 4.8 +/- 1.8 mmol x L(-1) and 1.8 +/- 0.4 mmol x L(-1) higher by the end of exercise in GT than in CT for the IDDM and healthy groups, respectively. There were no differences in heart rate, ventilation, or lactate levels between the groups or trials. For exercise performed at a similar moderate intensity, RPE in IDDM is higher by 2-3 points than in controls. Compared with water, glucose intake is associated with lower RPE in healthy, but not in IDDM, adolescents. "
781,27621180,"Metformin administration is associated with myocardial protection during ischemia and/or reperfusion, possibly via inhibition of inflammatory responses in the heart. Exposure to pathogens, in addition to the activation of the immune system and the associated metabolic dysfunction, often results in compromised myocardial function. We examined whether metformin administration could maintain the normal myocardial function in experimental moderate Gram negative infection, induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. 129xC57BL/6 mice were divided into control groups that received either vehicle or a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of low dose LPS (5mg/kg body wt), and metformin treated groups that received either daily metformin (4mg/kg/animal) i.p. injections for five days prior to LPS administration [Experiment 1], or a single metformin injection following same dose of LPS [Experiment 2]. LPS alone caused cardiac dysfunction, as confirmed by echocardiography, whereas metformin administration, either before or after LPS, rescued myocardial function. LPS caused marked reduction of the cardiac metabolism-related genes tested, including Prkaa2, Cpt1b, Ppargc1a and Ppargc1b; reduction of fatty acid oxidation, as reflected by the regulation of Ppara, Acaca and Acacb; increased glucose transport, as shown by Slc2a4 levels; reduction of ATP synthesis; significant increase of inflammatory markers, in particular IL6; and reduction of autophagy. Pretreatment with metformin normalized the levels of all these factors. We show for the first time that metformin protects the myocardium from LPS-associated myocardial dysfunction mainly by supporting its metabolic activity and allowing efficient energy utilization. Metformin can be a potential cardioprotective agent in individuals susceptible to exposure to pathogens. "
782,26814014,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex metabolic disease, and cardiovascular disease is a leading complication of diabetes. Epicardial adipose tissue surrounding the heart displays biochemical, thermogenic, and cardioprotective properties. However, the metabolic cross-talk between epicardial fat and the myocardium is largely unknown. This study sought to understand epicardial adipose tissue metabolism from heart failure patients with or without diabetes. We aimed to unravel possible differences in glucose and lipid metabolism between human epicardial and subcutaneous adipocytes and elucidate the potential underlying mechanisms involved in heart failure. Insulin-stimulated [(14)C]glucose uptake and isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis were measured in isolated epicardial and subcutaneous adipocytes. The expression of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in adipocytes. In addition, epicardial and subcutaneous fatty acid composition was analyzed by high-resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The difference between basal and insulin conditions in glucose uptake was significantly decreased (P= 0.006) in epicardial compared with subcutaneous adipocytes. Moreover, a significant (P< 0.001) decrease in the isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis was also observed when the two fat depots were compared, and it was strongly correlated with lipolysis, lipid storage, and inflammation-related gene expression. Moreover, the fatty acid composition of these tissues was significantly altered by diabetes. These results emphasize potential metabolic differences between both fat depots in the presence of heart failure and highlight epicardial fat as a possible therapeutic target in situ in the cardiac microenvironment.

783,25283330,"Adipocyte dysfunction is associated with many metabolic diseases such as obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes. Previous studies found that phloretin promotes 3T3-L1 cells differentiation, but the underlying mechanisms for phloretin's effects on adipogenesis remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that phloretin enhanced the lipid accumulation in porcine primary adipocytes in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, phloretin increased the utilization of glucose and nonesterified fatty acid, while it decreased the lactate output. Microarray analysis revealed that genes associated with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), mitogen-activated protein kinase and insulin signaling pathways were altered in response to phloretin. We further confirmed that phloretin enhanced expression of PPARγ, CAAT enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα) and adipose-related genes, such as fatty acids translocase and fatty acid synthase. In addition, phloretin activated the Akt (Thr308) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and therefore, inactivated Akt targets protein. Wortmannin effectively blocked the effect of phloretin on Akt activity and the protein levels of PPARγ, C/EBPα and fatty acid binding protein-4 (FABP4/aP2). Oral administration of 5 or 10 mg/kg phloretin to C57BL BKS-DB mice significantly decreased the serum glucose level and improved glucose tolerance. In conclusion, phloretin promotes the adipogenesis of porcine primary preadipocytes through Akt-associated signaling pathway. These findings suggested that phloretin might be able to increase insulin sensitivity and alleviate the metabolic diseases. "
784,25243853,"The growth-promoting effect of combined therapy with GH and IGF-I in normal rats is not known. We therefore investigated the efficacy of treatment with recombinant human (rh)GH and/or rhIGF-I on longitudinal bone growth and bone mass in intact, prepubertal, female Sprague-Dawley rats. rhGH was injected twice daily sc (5 mg/kg·d) and rhIGF-I continuously infused sc (2.2 or 4.4 mg/kg·d) for 28 days. Longitudinal bone growth was monitored by weekly x-rays of tibiae and nose-anus length measurements, and tibial growth plate histomorphology was analyzed. Bone mass was evaluated by peripheral quantitative computed tomography. In addition, serum levels of IGF-I, rat GH, acid labile subunit, IGF binding protein-3, 150-kDa ternary complex formation, and markers of bone formation and degradation were measured. Monotherapy with rhGH was more effective than rhIGF-I (4.4 mg/kg·d) to increase tibia and nose-anus length, whereas combined therapy did not further increase tibia, or nose-anus, lengths or growth plate height. In contrast, combined rhGH and rhIGF-I (4.4 mg/kg·d) therapy had an additive stimulatory effect on cortical bone mass vs rhGH alone. Combined treatment with rhGH and rhIGF-I resulted in markedly higher serum IGF-I concentrations vs rhGH alone but did not compromise the endogenous secretion of GH. We conclude that rhIGF-I treatment augments cortical bone mass but does not further improve bone growth in rhGH-treated young, intact, female rats. "
785,18682537,"Chronic somatotropin (pST) treatment in pigs increases muscle protein synthesis and circulating insulin, a known promoter of protein synthesis. Previously, we showed that the pST-mediated rise in insulin could not account for the pST-induced increase in muscle protein synthesis when amino acids were maintained at fasting levels. This study aimed to determine whether the pST-induced increase in insulin promotes skeletal muscle protein synthesis when amino acids are provided at fed levels and whether the response is associated with enhanced translation initiation factor activation. Growing pigs were treated with pST (0 or 180 microg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) for 7 days, and then pancreatic-glucose-amino acid clamps were performed. Amino acids were raised to fed levels in the presence of either fasted or fed insulin concentrations; glucose was maintained at fasting throughout. Muscle protein synthesis was increased by pST treatment and by amino acids (with or without insulin) (P<0.001). In pST-treated pigs, fed, but not fasting, amino acid concentrations further increased muscle protein synthesis rates irrespective of insulin level (P<0.02). Fed amino acids, with or without raised insulin concentrations, increased the phosphorylation of S6 kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1), decreased inactive 4EBP1.eIF4E complex association, and increased active eIF4E.eIF4G complex formation (P<0.02). pST treatment did not alter translation initiation factor activation. We conclude that the pST-induced stimulation of muscle protein synthesis requires fed amino acid levels, but not fed insulin levels. However, under the current conditions, the response to amino acids is not mediated by the activation of translation initiation factors that regulate mRNA binding to the ribosomal complex. "
786,37138353,"Cryptosporidiosis is one of the main causes of diarrhea in children and young livestock. The interaction of the parasite with the intestinal host cells has not been characterized thoroughly yet but may be affected by the nutritional demand of the parasite. Hence, we aimed to investigate the impact of C. parvum infection on glucose metabolism in neonatal calves. Therefore, N = 5 neonatal calves were infected with C. parvum on the first day of life, whereas a control group was not (N = 5). The calves were monitored clinically for one week, and glucose absorption, turnover and oxidation were assessed using stable isotope labelled glucose. The transepithelial transport of glucose was measured using the Ussing chamber technique. Glucose transporters were quantified on gene and protein expression level using RT-qPCR and Western blot in the jejunum epithelium and brush border membrane preparations. Plasma glucose concentration and oral glucose absorption were decreased despite an increased electrogenic phlorizin sensitive transepithelial transport of glucose in infected calves. No difference in the gene or protein abundance of glucose transporters, but an enrichment of glucose transporter 2 in the brush border was observed in the infected calves. Furthermore, the mRNA for enzymes of the glycolysis pathway was increased indicating enhanced glucose oxidation in the infected gut. In summary, C. parvum infection modulates intestinal epithelial glucose absorption and metabolism. We assume that the metabolic competition of the parasite for glucose causes the host cells to upregulate their uptake mechanisms and metabolic machinery to compensate for the energy losses. "
787,8844006,Glucose-galactose malabsorption (GGM) is an autosomal recessive disorder which presents with severe osmotic diarrhoea shortly after birth. Two proband siblings with GGM were previously demonstrated to contain a missense mutation (D28N) in the Na(+)-dependent glucose/galactose cotransporter (SGLT1) that accounts for the defect in sugar absorption. Prenatal screening for GGM was performed in two subsequent pregnancies in this large consanguineous family. The first exon of the SGLT1 gene was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA and screened for the presence of the D28N mutation by EcoRV restriction digestion. The proband's sibling was heterozygous and a cousin was not a carrier of the D28N mutation. Both children at 2-years of age remain healthy and have had no diarrhoeal symptoms. Molecular biology techniques will allow a prospective determination of the presence of an abnormal SGLT1 allete and potentially decrease the postnatal morbidity. 
788,33096483,"Disordered folliculogenesis is a core characteristic of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and androgen receptors (ARs) are closely associated with hyperandrogenism and abnormalities in folliculogenesis in PCOS. However, whether the new AR binding partner phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) in granulosa cells (GCs) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of PCOS remains unclear. We identified the new AR binding partner PGK1 by co-IP (co-immunoprecipitation) in luteinized GCs, and reconfirmed by co-IP, co-localization and GST pull down assay, and checked PGK1 expression levels with qRT-PCR and western blotting. Pharmaceuticals rescue assays in mice, and metabolism assay, AR protein stability and RNA-seq of PGK1 targets in cells proved the function in PCOS. PGK1 and AR are highly expressed in PCOS luteinized GCs and PCOS-like mouse ovarian tissues. PGK1 regulated glucose metabolism and deteriorated PCOS-like mouse metabolic disorder, and paclitaxel rescued the phenotype of PCOS-like mice and reduced ovarian PGK1 and AR protein levels. PGK1 inhibited AR ubiquitination levels and increased AR stability in an E3 ligase SKP2-dependent manner. Additionally, PGK1 promoted AR nuclear translocation, and RNA-seq data showed that critical ovulation-related genes were regulated by the PGK1-AR axis. PGK1 regulated GCs metabolism and interacted with AR to regulate the expression of key ovulation genes, and also mediated cell proliferation and apoptosis, which resulted in the etiology of PCOS. This work highlights the pathogenic mechanism and represents a novel therapeutic target for PCOS.

789,35854131,"Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is a rare inborn error of fructose metabolism caused by the deficiency of aldolase B. Since treatment consists of a fructose-, sucrose- and sorbitol-restrictive diet for life, patients are at risk of presenting vitamin deficiencies. Although there is no published data on the status of these vitamins in HFI patients, supplementation with vitamin C and folic acid is common. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess vitamin C and folate status and supplementation practices in a nationwide cohort of HFI patients. Vitamin C and folic acid dietary intake, supplementation and circulating levels were assessed in 32 HFI patients and 32 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Most of the HFI participants presented vitamin C (96.7%) and folate (90%) dietary intake below the recommended population reference intake. Up to 69% received vitamin C and 50% folic acid supplementation. Among HFI patients, 15.6% presented vitamin C and 3.1% folate deficiency. The amount of vitamin C supplementation and plasma levels correlated positively (R = 0.443; p = 0.011). Interestingly, a higher percentage of non-supplemented HFI patients were vitamin C deficient when compared to supplemented HFI patients (30% vs. 9.1%; p = 0.01) and to healthy controls (30% vs. 3.1%; p < 0.001). Our results provide evidence for the first time supporting vitamin C supplementation in HFI. There is great heterogeneity in vitamin supplementation practices and, despite follow-up at specialised centres, vitamin C deficiency is common. Further research is warranted to establish optimal doses of vitamin C and the need for folic acid supplementation in HFI. "

Male and female mice were fed a high-fat, high-sugar (HF-HS) diet or an HF-HS diet supplemented with fish oil (HF-HS-FO) and were treated with olanzapine or vehicle for 29 days beginning on postnatal day 37. In male mice, adolescent olanzapine treatment suppressed weight gain during and after treatment and improved metabolic function in adulthood; dietary fish oil reduced weight gain, increased expression of fatty acid oxidation genes, and decreased expression of genes associated with fatty acid synthesis and inflammation. In contrast, few effects were observed in female mice. The current results suggest that adolescent olanzapine exposure can produce long-term alterations in weight and metabolic function in male mice and that dietary fish oil can reduce adverse effects of lifelong consumption of an HF-HS diet. Because expected adverse effects of adolescent olanzapine treatment were not observed, the potential beneficial effects of dietary fish oil for SGA-induced weight gain and metabolic dysfunction could not be evaluated.

791,23025820,"Among the 3.5 million annual new head injury cases is a subpopulation of children and young adults who experience repeated traumatic brain injury (TBI). The duration of vulnerability after a single TBI remains unknown, and biomarkers have yet to be determined. Decreases in glucose metabolism (cerebral metabolic rate of glucose [CMRglc]) are consistently observed after experimental and human TBI. In the current study, it is hypothesized that the duration of vulnerability is related to the duration of decreased CMRglc and that a single mild TBI (mTBI) increases the brain's vulnerability to a second insult for a period, during which a subsequent mTBI will worsen the outcome. Postnatal day 35 rats were given sham, single mTBI, or two mTBI at 24-h or 120-h intervals. (14)C-2-deoxy-D-glucose autoradiography was conducted at 1 or 3 days post-injury to calculate CMRglc. At 24 h after a single mTBI, CMRglc is decreased by 19% in both the parietal cortex and hippocampus, but approached sham levels by 3 days post-injury. When a second mTBI is introduced during the CMRglc depression of the first injury, the consequent CMRglc is depressed (36.5%) at 24 h and remains depressed (25%) at 3 days. In contrast, when the second mTBI is introduced after the metabolic recovery of the first injury, the consequent CMRglc depression is similar to that seen with a single injury. Results suggest that the duration of metabolic depression reflects the time-course of vulnerability to second injury in the juvenile brain and could serve as a valuable biomarker in establishing window of vulnerability guidelines.

792,33372336,"Diabetes is a risk factor for intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). Studies have demonstrated that diabetes may affect IVDD through transcriptional regulation; however, whether post-transcriptional regulation is involved in diabetic IVDD (DB-IVDD) is still unknown. This study was performed to illustrate the role of HuR, an RNA-binding protein, in DB-IVDD development and its mechanism. The expression of HuR was evaluated in nucleus pulposus (NP) tissues from diabetic IVDD patients and in high glucose-treated NP cells. Senescence and autophagy were assessed in HuR over-expressing and downregulation NP cells. The mRNAs that were regulated by HuR were screened, and immunoprecipitation was applied to confirm the regulation of HuR on targeted mRNAs. The results showed that the expression of HuR was decreased in diabetic NP tissues and high glucose-treated NP cells. Downregulation of HuR may lead to increased senescence in high glucose-treated NP cells, while autophagy activation attenuates senescence in HuR deficient NP cells. Mechanistic study showed that HuR prompted Atg7 mRNA stability via binding to the AU-rich elements. Furthermore, overexpression of Atg7, but not HuR, may ameliorate DB-IVDD in rats in vivo. In conclusion, HuR may suppress senescence through autophagy activation via stabilizing Atg7 in diabetic NP cells; while Atg7, but not HuR, may serve as a potential therapeutic target for DB-IVDD. "
793,37347793,"To investigate whether glucoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus can sense and respond to physiological variation in the blood glucose (BG) level, we combined continuous arterial glucose monitoring with continuous measures of the activity of a specific subset of neurons located in the hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus that express pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (VMNPACAP neurons) obtained using fiber photometry. Data were collected in conscious, free-living mice during a 1-h baseline monitoring period and a subsequent 2-h intervention period during which the BG level was raised either by consuming a chow or a high-sucrose meal or by intraperitoneal glucose injection. Cross-correlation analysis revealed that, following a 60- to 90-s delay, interventions that raise the BG level reliably associate with reduced VMNPACAP neuron activity (P < 0.01). In addition, a strong positive correlation between BG and spontaneous VMNPACAP neuron activity was observed under basal conditions but with a much longer (∼25 min) temporal offset, consistent with published evidence that VMNPACAP neuron activation raises the BG level. Together, these findings are suggestive of a closed-loop system whereby VMNPACAP neuron activation increases the BG level; detection of a rising BG level, in turn, feeds back to inhibit these neurons. To our knowledge, these findings constitute the first evidence of a role in glucose homeostasis for glucoregulatory neurocircuits that, like pancreatic β-cells, sense and respond to physiological variation in glycemia. By combining continuous arterial glucose monitoring with fiber photometry, studies investigated whether neurons in the murine ventromedial nucleus that express pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (VMNPACAP neurons) detect and respond to changes in glycemia in vivo. VMNPACAP neuron activity rapidly decreases (within <2 min) when the blood glucose level is raised by either food consumption or glucose administration. Spontaneous VMNPACAP neuron activity also correlates positively with glycemia, but with a longer temporal offset, consistent with reports that hyperglycemia is induced by experimental activation of these neurons. Like pancreatic β-cells, neurons in the hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus appear to sense and respond to physiological variation in glycemia. "
794,24450245,"This study was designed to assess the urinary iodine concentrations of schoolchildren at baseline and after iodized salt supplementation in eastern region of Nepal. A cross sectional study was conducted from August 2009 to July 2011 among schoolchildren of three eastern districts of Nepal: Sunsari, Dhankuta, and Tehrathum. A sample of 828 school age children from the three districts was chosen for the study after obtaining written consent from their guardians. The schoolchildren treatment group (n=300) was provided with a supplement of iodized salt for six months. Urinary iodine concentration was estimated by ammonium persulfate digestion microplate method at baseline and after supplementation. Urinary iodine controls L1, L2 (Seronorm, Norway) were analyzed to obtain intra-assay CVs (L1 = 7.4%, L2 = 3.3%) and inter assay CVs (L1=23.5%, L2=11.26%). Median interquartile range urinary iodine concentration in the three districts: Sunsari, Dhankuta and Tehrathum at baseline versus intervention were 272.0 (131.5-473.0) microg/l versus 294.0 (265.0-304.0) microg/l (p=0.379), 247.0 (144.5-332.32) versus 361.0 (225.66-456.52) microg/l (p<0.001), and 349.5 (203.75-458.09) microg/l versus 268.76 (165.30-331.67) microg/l (p<0.001), respectively. This study indicated improved iodine status and increased median urinary iodine concentration after iodized salt supplementation. Regular monitoring of population urinary iodine concentration at national and regional levels should be performed to ensure that all individuals have optimal delivery of iodine nutrition. "
795,9209586,"We describe a method of orally administering 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) for positron emission tomography (PET) scans to determine local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (LCMRGlc), normalized to that of whole brain, in fully conscious, non-restrained primates. Oral FDG-PET studies were performed in both non-restrained and chaired monkeys, and in one human where results could be compared with traditional intravenous FDG administration. The oral route of FDG administration gave images and whole brain-normalized PET LCMRGlc results comparable to those obtained by the intravenous route. This oral FDG-PET method may provide a useful means by which to obtain measures of LCMRGlcs for brain structures, relative to each other, in non-restrained, non-drugged primates in field and laboratory studies. This method might also have clinical applications for PET studies of children. "
796,29539590,"Despite clinical findings suggesting that the form (liquid versus solid) of the sugars may significantly affect the development of metabolic diseases, no experimental data are available on the impact of their formulations on gut microbiota, integrity and hepatic outcomes. In the present sudy, C57Bl/6j mice were fed a standard diet plus water (SD), a standard diet plus 60% fructose syrup (L-Fr) or a 60% fructose solid diet plus water (S-Fr) for 12 weeks. Gut microbiota was characterized through 16S rRNA phylogenetic profiling and shotgun sequencing of microbial genes in ileum content and related volatilome profiling. Fructose feeding led to alterations of the gut microbiota depending on the fructose formulation, with increased colonization by Clostridium, Oscillospira and Clostridiales phyla in the S-Fr group and Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Lachnospiraceae and Dorea in the L-Fr. S-Fr evoked the highest accumulation of advanced glycation end products and barrier injury in the ileum intestinal mucosa. These effects were associated to a stronger activation of the lipopolysaccharide-dependent proinflammatory TLR4/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in the liver of S-Fr mice than of L-Fr mice. In contrast, L-Fr intake induced higher levels of hepatosteatosis and markers of fibrosis than S-Fr. Fructose-induced ex novo lipogenesis with production of SCFA and MCFA was confirmed by metagenomic analysis. These results suggest that consumption of fructose under different forms, liquid or solid, may differently affect gut microbiota, thus leading to impairment in intestinal mucosa integrity and liver homeostasis.

797,1425156,"First-degree relatives of patients with NIDDM manifest severe insulin resistance despite normal glucose tolerance test. To examine the mechanisms underlying the normal glucose tolerance, we evaluated the serum glucose/C-peptide/insulin dynamics and free fatty acid (FFA) as well as substrate oxidation rates and energy expenditure (EE) (indirect calorimetry) in nine young offspring of NIDDM patients (mean +/- SEM age 30 +/- 2.3 years, body mass index 24.2 +/- 1.2 kg/m2). Nine age-, sex- and weight-matched, normal subjects with no family history of diabetes served as the controls. Metabolic parameters were measured before, during and after a two-step glucose infusion (2 and 4 mg/kg.min) for 120 min. Mean basal serum glucose, insulin and C-peptide levels were similar in both groups. During 2 mg/kg.min glucose infusion, mean serum insulin and C-peptide rose to significantly (P less than 0.05-0.02) greater levels in the offspring vs. controls, while serum glucose levels were similar. With the 4 mg/kg.min glucose infusion, mean serum glucose, insulin and C-peptide levels were significantly (P less than 0.02-0.001) greater in the offspring at 100-120 min. Isotopically-derived (D[3-3H]glucose), basal hepatic glucose output (HGO) was not significantly different between the offspring vs. controls (1.86 +/- 0.30 vs. 1.78 +/- 0.06 mg/kg.min). During glucose infusion, basal HGO was partially suppressed by 66% at 60 min and by 100% at 120 min in the offspring. In contrast, HGO was completely (100%) suppressed at both times in the controls. Following cessation of glucose infusion, HGO rose to 1.64 +/- 0.12 mg/kg.min in the offspring and 1.46 +/- 0.05 mg/kg.min in the controls (P less than 0.05) between 200 and 240 min. These were 88% and 82% of the respective basal HGO values. At low glucose infusion (t = 0-60 min), the mean absolute, non-oxidative glucose disposal remained 1.5-fold greater in the offspring while at higher glucose infusion, nonoxidative glucose metabolism was not different in both groups. Throughout the study period, oxidative glucose disposal rate was not significantly different in both groups. The mean basal FFA was significantly greater in the offspring vs. controls (865 +/- 57 vs. 642 +/- 45 microEq/l). It was appropriately suppressed during glucose infusion to a similar nadir in both groups (395 +/- 24 vs. 375 +/- 33 microEq/l). The mean basal lipid oxidation was also significantly greater in the offspring than controls (1.06 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.75 +/- 0.04 mg/kg.min, P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) "
798,35792176,"The intramuscular administration of antenatal steroids to women at risk of preterm delivery achieves high maternal and fetal plasma steroid concentrations, which are associated with adverse effects and may reduce treatment efficacy. We have demonstrated that antenatal steroid efficacy is independent of peak maternofetal steroid levels once exposure is maintained above a low threshold. This study aimed to test, using a sheep model of pregnancy, whether the low-dose antenatal steroid regimen proposed as part of the Antenatal Corticosteroids for Improving Outcomes in Preterm Newborns trial would achieve preterm lung maturation equivalent to that of the existing World Health Organization dexamethasone treatment regimen, but with reduced risk of adverse outcomes. Following ethical review and approval, date-mated ewes with single fetuses received intramuscular injections of either (1) four 6-mg maternal intramuscular injections of dexamethasone phosphate every 12 hours (n=22), (2) 4 2-mg maternal intramuscular injections of betamethasone phosphate every 12 hours (n=21), or (3) 4 2-mL maternal intramuscular injections of saline every 12 hours (n=16). Of note, 48 hours after first injection, (124±1 day), lambs were delivered, ventilated for 30 minutes, and euthanized for sampling. Arterial blood gas, respiratory, hematological, and biochemical data were analyzed for between-group differences with analysis of variance according to distribution and variance, with P<.05 taken as significant. After 30 minutes of ventilation, lambs from both steroid-treated groups had significant and equivalent improvements in lung function relative to saline control (P<.05). There was no significant difference in arterial blood pH, pO This study reported that in preterm lambs, a low-dose treatment regimen of 8 mg betamethasone achieves lung maturation equivalent to that of a 24-mg dexamethasone-based regimen, but with smaller perturbations to the maternofetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. These data suggested that given steroid pharmacokinetic differences between sheep and humans, a betamethasone dose of 2 mg may remain above the minimum dose necessary for robust maturation of the preterm lung. Maternal weight-adjusted betamethasone doses might also be a key to reducing perturbations to the maternofetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. "
799,24332968,"β cell failure in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with hyperglycemia, but the mechanisms are not fully understood. Congenital hyperinsulinism caused by glucokinase mutations (GCK-CHI) is associated with β cell replication and apoptosis. Here, we show that genetic activation of β cell glucokinase, initially triggering replication, causes apoptosis associated with DNA double-strand breaks and activation of the tumor suppressor p53. ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP channels) and calcineurin mediate this toxic effect. Toxicity of long-term glucokinase overactivity was confirmed by finding late-onset diabetes in older members of a GCK-CHI family. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetic treatment or p53 deletion rescues β cells from glucokinase-induced death, but only GLP-1 analog rescues β cell function. DNA damage and p53 activity in T2D suggest shared mechanisms of β cell failure in hyperglycemia and CHI. Our results reveal membrane depolarization via KATP channels, calcineurin signaling, DNA breaks, and p53 as determinants of β cell glucotoxicity and suggest pharmacological approaches to enhance β cell survival in diabetes.

801,32669607,"Whether glucose is predominantly metabolized via oxidative phosphorylation or glycolysis differs between quiescent versus proliferating cells, including tumor cells. However, how glucose metabolism is coordinated with cell cycle in mammalian cells remains elusive. Here, we report that mammalian cells predominantly utilize the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in G1 phase, but prefer glycolysis in S phase. Mechanistically, coupling cell cycle with metabolism is largely achieved by timely destruction of IDH1/2, key TCA cycle enzymes, in a Skp2-dependent manner. As such, depleting SKP2 abolishes cell cycle-dependent fluctuation of IDH1 protein abundance, leading to reduced glycolysis in S phase. Furthermore, elevated Skp2 abundance in prostate cancer cells destabilizes IDH1 to favor glycolysis and subsequent tumorigenesis. Therefore, our study reveals a mechanistic link between two cancer hallmarks, aberrant cell cycle and addiction to glycolysis, and provides the underlying mechanism for the coupling of metabolic fluctuation with periodic cell cycle in mammalian cells.

806,33205998,"Neurons in the brain stem dorsal vagal complex (DVC) take part in a continuous bidirectional crosstalk, in which they receive and respond to a vast array of signaling molecules, including glucose. Importantly, chronic dysregulation of blood glucose concentration, a hallmark of high prevalence pathologies, such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome, can induce neuroplasticity in DVC neural networks, which is hypothesized to either contribute to or compensate for the glycemic or insulinemic dysregulation observed in these conditions. Here, we revisit the topic of vagal reflexes to review recent research on the importance of DVC function in regulating systemic glucose homeostasis and the neuroplastic changes in this brain region that are associated with systemic glucose alterations. We also discuss the critical connection between these nuclei and the gut and the role of central vagal circuits in the favorable outcomes associated with bariatric surgical procedures for metabolic disorders.

807,33786878,"A highly sensitive silica-alumina (Si-Al)-modified capacitive non-Faradaic glucose biosensor was introduced to monitor gestational diabetes. Glucose oxidase (GOx) was attached to the Si-Al electrode surface as the probe through amine-modification followed by glutaraldehyde premixed GOx as aldehyde-amine chemistry. This Si-Al (∼50 nm) modified electrode surface has increased the current flow upon binding of GOx with glucose. Capacitance values were increased by increasing the glucose concentrations. A mean capacitance value was plotted and the detection limit was found as 0.03 mg/mL with the regression coefficient value, R² = 0.9782 [y = 0.8391x + 1.338] on the linear range between 0.03 and 1 mg/mL. Further, a biofouling experiment with fructose and galactose did not increase the capacitance, indicating the specific glucose detection. This Si-Al-modified capacitance sensor detects a lower level of glucose presence and helps in monitoring gestational diabetes. "
808,35683984,"A high-calorie diet has contributed greatly to the prevalence of overweight and obesity worldwide for decades. These conditions also affect pregnant women and have a negative impact on the health of both the woman and the fetus.

It has also been shown that prenatal exposure to an unbalanced diet might permanently alter neurotransmission in offspring. In this study, using a rat model, we evaluated the effects of a maternal high-sugar diet on the level of extracellular glutamate and the expression of key transporters crucial for maintaining glutamate homeostasis in offspring. Glutamate concentration was assessed in extracellular fluid samples collected from the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of male and female offspring.

809,25416820,"Maternal caloric restriction during late gestation reduces birth weight, but whether long-term adverse metabolic outcomes of intra-uterine growth retardation (IUGR) are dependent on either accelerated postnatal growth or exposure to an obesogenic environment after weaning is not established. We induced IUGR in twin-pregnant sheep using a 40% maternal caloric restriction commencing from 110 days of gestation until term (∼147 days), compared with mothers fed to 100% of requirements. Offspring were reared either as singletons to accelerate postnatal growth or as twins to achieve standard growth. To promote an adverse phenotype in young adulthood, after weaning, offspring were reared under a low-activity obesogenic environment with the exception of a subgroup of IUGR offspring, reared as twins, maintained in a standard activity environment. We assessed glucose tolerance together with leptin and cortisol responses to feeding in young adulthood when the hypothalamus was sampled for assessment of genes regulating appetite control, energy and endocrine sensitivity. Caloric restriction reduced maternal plasma glucose, raised non-esterified fatty acids, and changed the metabolomic profile, but had no effect on insulin, leptin, or cortisol. IUGR offspring whose postnatal growth was enhanced and were obese showed insulin and leptin resistance plus raised cortisol. This was accompanied by increased hypothalamic gene expression for energy and glucocorticoid sensitivity. These long-term adaptations were reduced but not normalized in IUGR offspring whose postnatal growth was not accelerated and remained lean in a standard post-weaning environment. IUGR results in an adverse metabolic phenotype, especially when postnatal growth is enhanced and offspring progress to juvenile-onset obesity. "

811,23876293,"There are three isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) in the pancreatic insulin cell; IDH1 (cytosolic) and IDH2 (mitochondrial) use NADP(H). IDH3 is mitochondrial, uses NAD(H) and was believed to be the IDH that supports the citric acid cycle. With shRNAs targeting mRNAs for these enzymes we generated cell lines from INS-1 832/13 cells with severe (80%-90%) knockdown of the mitochondrial IDHs separately and together in the same cell line. With knockdown of both mitochondrial IDH's mRNA, enzyme activity and protein level, (but not with knockdown of only one mitochondrial IDH) glucose- and BCH (an allosteric activator of glutamate dehydrogenase)-plus-glutamine-stimulated insulin release were inhibited. Cellular levels of citrate, α-ketoglutarate, malate and ATP were altered in patterns consistent with blockage at the mitochondrial IDH reactions. We were able to generate only 50% knockdown of Idh1 mRNA in multiple cell lines (without inhibition of insulin release) possibly because greater knockdown of IDH1 was not compatible with cell line survival. The mitochondrial IDHs are redundant for insulin secretion. When both enzymes are severely knocked down, their low activities (possibly assisted by transport of IDH products and other metabolic intermediates from the cytosol into mitochondria) are sufficient for cell growth, but inadequate for insulin secretion when the requirement for intermediates is certainly more rapid. The results also indicate that IDH2 can support the citric acid cycle. As almost all mammalian cells possess substantial amounts of all three IDH enzymes, the biological principles suggested by these results are probably extrapolatable to many tissues. "
812,24517147,"The clinical syndromes of severe acute malnutrition may have early life origins because children with marasmus have lower birth weight than those with kwashiorkor. We hypothesized that resultant metabolic effects may persist into adulthood. We investigated whether marasmus survivors (MS) are more insulin resistant and glucose intolerant than kwashiorkor survivors (KS). This was a case-control study in Jamaican adults. We performed oral glucose tolerance tests on 191 adults (aged 17-50 y; 52% male; body mass index 24.2 ± 5.5 kg/m(2)). There were 43 MS; 38 KS; 70 age-, sex-, and body mass index-matched community controls; and 40 age- and birth weight-matched controls. We measured insulin sensitivity with the whole-body insulin sensitivity index, and β-cell function with the insulinogenic index and the oral disposition index. Fasting glucose was comparable across groups, but glucose intolerance was significantly more common in MS (19%) than in KS (3%), community controls (11%), and birth weight-matched controls (10%). The whole-body insulin sensitivity index was lower in MS than KS (P = .06) but similar between MS and controls. The insulinogenic index and oral disposition index were lower in MS compared with all three groups (P < .01). Marasmus survivors tend to be less insulin sensitive, but have significantly lower insulin secretion and are more glucose intolerant compared with kwashiorkor survivors and controls. This suggests that poor nutrition in early life causes β-cell dysfunction, which may predispose to the development of diabetes. "
813,30463471,"There is increasing evidence that the global rise in temperature is contributing to the onset of diabetes, which could be mediated by a concomitant reduction in brown fat activity. Brown (and beige) fat are characterised as possessing a unique mitochondrial protein uncoupling protein (UCP)1 that when activated can rapidly generate large amounts of heat. Primary environmental stimuli of UCP1 include cold-exposure and diet, leading to increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system and large amounts of lipid and glucose being oxidised by brown fat. The exact contribution remains controversial, although recent studies indicate that the amount of brown and beige fat in adult humans has been greatly underestimated. We therefore review the potential mechanisms by which glucose could be utilised within brown and beige fat in adult humans and the extent to which these are sensitive to temperature and diet. This includes the potential contribution from the peridroplet and cytoplasmic mitochondrial sub-fractions recently identified in brown fat, and whether a proportion of glucose oxidation could be UCP1-independent. It is thus predicted that as new methods are developed to assess glucose metabolism by brown fat, a more accurate determination of the thermogenic and non-thermogenic functions could be feasible in humans.

814,35283260,"Naïve and primed pluripotent stem cells recapitulate the peri- and post-implantation development, respectively. Thus, investigation of distinct traits between each pluripotent stem cell type would shed light on early embryonic processes. Herein, by screening a fluorescent probe library, we found that intracellular glycogen led to specific reactivity to CDg4, a glycogen fluorescence sensor, in both human and mouse naïve embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The requirement of constant inhibition of Gsk3β as well as high oxidative phosphorylation (OxPHOS) in naïve compared to primed ESCs was closely associated to high level of intracellular glycogen in naïve ESCs. Both capacity of OxPHOS and stored glycogen, rescued naïve ESCs by transient inhibition of glycolysis, which selectively eliminated primed ESCs. Additionally, naïve ESCs with active OxPHOS were enriched from a mixture with primed ESCs by high reactivity to ATP-Red1, a mitochondrial ATP fluorescence probe. These results indicate the active OxPHOS and high intracellular glycogen as a novel ""biomarker"" delineating metabolic remodeling during the transition of naïve pluripotency. "
815,30373146,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a serious pregnancy complication, in which women without previously diagnosed diabetes develop chronic hyperglycemia during gestation. In most cases, this hyperglycemia is the result of impaired glucose tolerance due to pancreatic β-cell dysfunction on a background of chronic insulin resistance. Risk factors for GDM include overweight and obesity, advanced maternal age, and a family history or any form of diabetes. Consequences of GDM include increased risk of maternal cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes and macrosomia and birth complications in the infant. There is also a longer-term risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in the child. GDM affects approximately 16.5% of pregnancies worldwide, and this number is set to increase with the escalating obesity epidemic. While several management strategies exist-including insulin and lifestyle interventions-there is not yet a cure or an efficacious prevention strategy. One reason for this is that the molecular mechanisms underlying GDM are poorly defined. This review discusses what is known about the pathophysiology of GDM, and where there are gaps in the literature that warrant further exploration. "
816,30587161,"Bariatric surgery (BS) is regarded to be the most effective treatment of obesity with long lasting beneficial effects including weight loss and improvement of metabolic disorders. A considerable number of women undergoing BS are at childbearing age.Although the surgery mediated weight loss has a positive effect on pregnancy outcome, the procedures might be associated with adverse outcomes as well, for example micronutrient deficiencies, iron or B12 deficiency anemia, dumping syndrome, surgical complications such as internal hernias, and small for gestational age (SGA) offspring, possibly due to maternal undernutrition. Also, there is no international consensus concerning the ideal time to conception after BS. Hence, the present narrative review intents to summarize the available literature concerning the most common challenges which arise before and during pregnancy after BS, such as fertility related considerations, vitamin and nutritional deficiencies and their adequate compensation through supplementation, altered glucose metabolism and its implications for gestational diabetes screening, the symptoms and treatment of dumping syndrome, surgical complications and the impact of BS on pregnancy outcome. The impact of different bariatric procedures on pregnancy and fetal outcome will also be discussed, as well as general considerations concerning the monitoring and management of pregnancies after BS.Whereas BS leads to the mitigation of many obesity-related pregnancy complications, such as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), pregnancy induced hypertension and fetal macrosomia; those procedures pose new risks which might lead to adverse outcomes for mothers and offspring, for example nutritional deficiencies, anemia, altered maternal glucose metabolism and small for gestational age children.

817,25338812,"Besides their role in facilitating lipid absorption, bile acids are increasingly being recognized as signaling molecules that activate cell-signaling receptors. Targeted disruption of the sterol 12α-hydroxylase gene (Cyp8b1) results in complete absence of cholic acid (CA) and its derivatives. Here we investigate the effect of Cyp8b1 deletion on glucose homeostasis. Absence of Cyp8b1 results in improved glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and β-cell function, mediated by absence of CA in Cyp8b1(-/-) mice. In addition, we show that reduced intestinal fat absorption in the absence of biliary CA leads to increased free fatty acids reaching the ileal L cells. This correlates with increased secretion of the incretin hormone GLP-1. GLP-1, in turn, increases the biosynthesis and secretion of insulin from β-cells, leading to the improved glucose tolerance observed in the Cyp8b1(-/-) mice. Thus, our data elucidate the importance of Cyp8b1 inhibition on the regulation of glucose metabolism. "
818,14966672,"We recently showed in mice that maternal diabetes increases embryonic susceptibility to caudal regression induced by vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid. Here we tested whether in the maternal diabetic milieu hyperglycaemia is the critical factor responsible for mediating this increased susceptibility. Non-diabetic pregnant mice were made hyperglycaemic by subcutaneous injections of glucose at regular intervals. Conversely, diabetic pregnant mice were treated with phlorizin to induce renal glucosuria and thus reduce blood glucose concentrations. Pregnant mice were treated with retinoic acid and the extent of caudal regression in mouse embryos, measured in terms of the ratio of tail length to crown-rump length was assessed. Embryos were also examined for Wnt-3a expression and cell death. Embryos of mice treated with glucose had a greater extent of caudal regression induced by retinoic acid than saline-treated controls, with enhanced down-regulation of Wnt-3a expression and exacerbated cell death specifically at the caudal end of the embryo. Embryos of diabetic mice treated with phlorizin had a similar extent of caudal regression to embryos of non-diabetic mice after treatment with retinoic acid. Hyperglycaemia increases embryonic susceptibility to caudal regression induced by retinoic acid, with the underlying cellular and molecular changes closely mimicking those that occur in maternal diabetes. Reduction of blood glucose concentrations in diabetic mice completely abolishes this increased susceptibility to retinoic acid. These results suggest that in maternal diabetes hyperglycaemia is the critical factor responsible for potentiating the teratogenic effect of retinoic acid. "
819,26159928,"Mutations in the protein alpha-synuclein (SNCA) have been linked to Parkinson's disease. We recently reported that non-mutated SNCA enhanced glucose uptake through the Gab1-PI3 kinase-Akt pathway and elucidated its effects on glucose regulation. Here, we examined the association of SNCA with insulin resistance (IR), a condition that is characterized by decreased tissue glucose uptake. Our observations include those from a population study as well as a SNCA-deficient mouse model, which had not previously been characterized in an IR scenario. In 1,152 patients, we found that serum SNCA levels were inversely correlated with IR indicators--body mass index, homeostatic model assessment for IR (HOMA-IR) and immunoreactive insulin (IRI)--and, to a lesser extent, with blood pressure and age. Additionally, SNCA-deficient mice displayed alterations in glucose and insulin responses during diet-induced IR. Moreover, during euglycemic clamp assessments, SNCA knock-out mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) showed severe IR in adipose tissues and skeletal muscle. These findings provide new insights into IR and diabetes and point to SNCA as a potential candidate for further research. "
820,27373162,"The effect of gut microbiota on obesity and insulin resistance is now recognized, but the underlying host-dependent mechanisms remain poorly undefined. We find that tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 knockout (Timp3(-/-)) mice fed a high-fat diet exhibit gut microbiota dysbiosis, an increase in branched chain and aromatic (BCAA) metabolites, liver steatosis, and an increase in circulating soluble IL-6 receptors (sIL6Rs). sIL6Rs can then activate inflammatory cells, such as CD11c(+) cells, which drive metabolic inflammation. Depleting the microbiota through antibiotic treatment significantly improves glucose tolerance, hepatic steatosis, and systemic inflammation, and neutralizing sIL6R signaling reduces inflammation, but only mildly impacts glucose tolerance. Collectively, our results suggest that gut microbiota is the primary driver of the observed metabolic dysfunction, which is mediated, in part, through IL-6 signaling. Our findings also identify an important role for Timp3 in mediating the effect of the microbiota in metabolic diseases. "

822,33430045,"Plant-based nutritional supplementation has been shown to attenuate and reduce mortality in the processes of both acute and chronic disorders, including diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer, inflammatory diseases, and neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. Low-level systemic inflammation is an important contributor to these afflictions and diets enriched in phytochemicals can slow the progression. The goal of this study was to determine the impact of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation on changes in glucose and insulin tolerance, performance enhancement, levels of urinary neopterin and concentrations of neurotransmitters in the striatum in mouse models. Both acute and chronic injections of LPS (2 mg/kg or 0.33 mg/kg/day, respectively) reduced glucose and insulin tolerance and elevated neopterin levels, which are indicative of systemic inflammatory responses. In addition, there were significant decreases in striatal neurotransmitter levels (dopamine and DOPAC), while serotonin (5-HT) levels were essentially unchanged. LPS resulted in impaired execution in the incremental loading test, which was reversed in mice on a supplemental plant-based diet, improving their immune function and maintaining skeletal muscle mitochondrial activity. In conclusion, plant-based nutritional supplementation attenuated the metabolic changes elicited by LPS injections, causing systemic inflammatory activity that contributed to both systemic and neurological alterations.

823,32045699,"Untargeted lipidomics is a powerful tool to discover new biomarkers and to understand the physiology and pathology of lipids. The use of stable isotopes as tracers to investigate the kinetics of lipids is another tool able to supply dynamic information on lipid synthesis and catabolism. Coupling the two methodology is then very appealing in the study of lipid metabolism. The main issue to face is to perform thousands of calculations in order to obtain kinetic parameters starting from the MS raw data. An automated computerized routine able to do accomplish such task is presented in this paper. We analyzed the lipid kinetics of palmitic acid (PA) in hepatoma liver cells cultured in vitro in which insulin resistance has been induced by high glucose supplementation. The deuterated palmitate tracer (d5PA) was administered as a bolus and the cells were harvested daily for 48 h. 5dPA was incorporated into 326 monoisotopic compounds and in 84 of their [M + 1] isotopologues detected by high resolution orbitrap MS. The differences between the kinetics curves showed that at least four long chain triglycerides (TG) species incorporated more PA in glucose treated cells, while phosphocholines, sphingomyelins, mono- and di-glycerides and ceramides (Cer) incorporated less tracer under glucose treatment. Nevertheless, Cer amount was increased by glucose treatment. In conclusion we developed an automated powerful algorithm able to model simultaneously hundreds of kinetic curves obtained in a cell culture spiked with a stable isotope tracer, and to analyze the difference between the two different cell models.

824,35963981,"To estimate the association between consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks and unsweetened fruit juice with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components in participants of the Brazilian Longitudinal Adult Health Study (ELSA-Brasil) after 4 years of follow-up. We used data from ELSA-Brasil cohort (N = 15,105). The sample consisted of 6,124 civil servants free of the MetS at baseline (35 to 74 years, both sexes). The consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks and unsweetened fruit juice was estimated by a food frequency questionnaire previously validated. The outcome was MetS and its components (Joint Interim Statement criteria). To test the association between beverage consumption at baseline (2008-2010) and MetS and its components at follow-up (2012-2014), we used Poisson regression models with robust variance adjusting for potential confounders. After 4-year follow-up, the higher consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks (≥ 1 serving/day = 250 mL/day) increased the relative risk of MetS (RR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.04-1.45), high fasting glucose (RR = 1.23; 95% CI 1.01-1.48), and high blood pressure (RR = 1.23; 95% CI 1.00-1.54). Moderate consumption of this beverage (0.4 to < 1 serving/day) increased the relative risk of high waist circumference (WC) (RR = 1.21; 95% CI 1.02-1.42). After adjustment for confounding variables, the consumption of unsweetened fruit juice was not associated with the MetS and its components. Higher sugar-sweetened soft drinks consumption was associated with a higher risk relative of MetS, high fasting glucose, and high blood pressure, while moderate consumption of this beverage increased the relative risk of high WC in Brazilian adults.

825,26456562,"High multivitamin (HV) content in gestational diets has long-term metabolic effects in rat offspring. These changes are associated with in utero modifications of gene expression in hypothalamic food intake regulation. However, the role of fat-soluble vitamins in mediating these effects has not been explored. Vitamin A is a plausible candidate due to its role in gene methylation. Vitamin A intake above requirements during pregnancy affects the development of neurocircuitries involved in food intake and reward regulation. Pregnant Wistar rats were fed AIN-93G diets with the following content: recommended multivitamins (1-fold multivitamins: RV), high vitamin A (10-fold vitamin A: HA) or HV with only recommended vitamin A (10-fold multivitamins, 1-fold vitamin A: HVRA). Body weight, food intake and preference, mRNA expression and DNA methylation of hippocampal dopamine-related genes were assessed in male offspring brains at different developmental windows: birth, weaning and 14weeks postweaning. HA offspring had changes in dopamine-related gene expression at all developmental windows and DNA hypermethylation in the dopamine receptor 2 promoter region compared to RV offspring. Furthermore, HA diet lowered sucrose preference but had no effect on body weight and expression of hypothalamic genes. In contrast, HVRA offspring showed only at adulthood changes in expression of hippocampal genes and a modest effect on hypothalamic genes. High vitamin A intake alone in gestational diets has long-lasting programming effects on the dopaminergic system that are further translated into decreased sucrose preference but not food intake. "
826,36296955,"The association between manganese (Mn) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) is unclear, and no prior study has studied this association longitudinally. The aim of this study was to assess longitudinal associations of Mn exposure with MetS and metabolic outcomes. We used data from the San Luis Valley Diabetes Study (SLVDS), a prospective cohort from rural Colorado with data collected from 1984−1998 (n = 1478). Urinary Mn was measured at baseline (range = 0.20−42.5 µg/L). We assessed the shape of the cross-sectional association between Mn and MetS accounting for effect modification by other metals at baseline using Bayesian kernel machine regression. We assessed longitudinal associations between baseline quartiles of Mn and incident MetS using Fine and Gray competing risks regression models (competing risk = mortality) and between quartiles of Mn and metabolic outcomes using linear mixed effects models. We did not observe evidence that quartiles of Mn were associated with incident MetS (p-value for trend = 0.52). Quartiles of Mn were significantly associated with lower fasting glucose (p-value for trend < 0.01). Lead was found to be a possible effect modifier of the association between Mn and incident MetS. Mn was associated with lower fasting glucose in this rural population. Our results support a possible beneficial effect of Mn on diabetic markers. "
827,14960743,"Insulin resistance appears to be the best predictor of the development of diabetes in the children of patients with type 2 diabetes, but the mechanism responsible is unknown. We performed hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies in combination with infusions of [6,6-(2)H(2)]glucose in healthy, young, lean, insulin-resistant offspring of patients with type 2 diabetes and insulin-sensitive control subjects matched for age, height, weight, and physical activity to assess the sensitivity of liver and muscle to insulin. Proton ((1)H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies were performed to measure intramyocellular lipid and intrahepatic triglyceride content. Rates of whole-body and subcutaneous fat lipolysis were assessed by measuring the rates of [(2)H(5)]glycerol turnover in combination with microdialysis measurements of glycerol release from subcutaneous fat. We performed (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies to assess the rates of mitochondrial oxidative-phosphorylation activity in muscle. The insulin-stimulated rate of glucose uptake by muscle was approximately 60 percent lower in the insulin-resistant subjects than in the insulin-sensitive control subjects (P<0.001) and was associated with an increase of approximately 80 percent in the intramyocellular lipid content (P=0.005). This increase in intramyocellular lipid content was most likely attributable to mitochondrial dysfunction, as reflected by a reduction of approximately 30 percent in mitochondrial phosphorylation (P=0.01 for the comparison with controls), since there were no significant differences in systemic or localized rates of lipolysis or plasma concentrations of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, resistin, or adiponectin. These data support the hypothesis that insulin resistance in the skeletal muscle of insulin-resistant offspring of patients with type 2 diabetes is associated with dysregulation of intramyocellular fatty acid metabolism, possibly because of an inherited defect in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.

828,25539463,"Luminal preservation of the intestine is an attractive method to locally mitigate preservation injury and ischemic-reperfusion injury in small bowel transplantation (SBT) because this method has a potential to maintain the intestinal graft integrity. Hydrogen is noted as an antioxidant material by reducing hydroxyl radicals. We hypothesized that hydrogen-containing solution can be an optimum material for luminal preservation method in SBT. Ischemic reperfusion was induced in Lewis rats by occlusion of the supramesenteric artery and vein for 90 min. Experimental protocols were divided into four groups: sham operation group, no luminal injection (control) group, luminal injection of 5% glucose saline (GS) solution group, and luminal injection of hydrogen-rich GS (HRGS) group. Two milliliters of experimental solution was locally injected into the lumen of the intestine before declamping of vessels. Oxidative stress markers, proinflammatory cytokines, apoptosis in the crypt cells, and morphologic changes of the intestine were assessed. The production of malondialdehyde and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, as oxidative stress markers, were markedly suppressed in HRGS group. The level of proinflammatory cytokines, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase and interleukin-6, was significantly inhibited in HRGS group. Crypt apoptosis was also significantly suppressed in HRGS group. Histopathologically, integrity of villus in intestine was maintained in HRGS group in comparison to the other groups. Luminal injection of hydrogen-rich solution can reduce oxidative stress and consequently ameliorate ischemic-reperfusion injury. Hydrogen-containing solution can be a novel and promising luminal preservation material in SBT. "
829,22532550,"Glucose transporter 1 facilitates glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier. By increasing histone acetylation at the SLC2A1 promotor, valproic acid could increase SLC2A1 gene expression. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of valproic acid on glucose transport in astrocyte cultures derived from SLC2A1 heterozygous mice. Primary astrocyte cultures were prepared from the cerebral cortex of 1-day-old neonatal mice. Cultured astrocytes were incubated with valproic acid (0.05, 0.5, and 5 mM) for 48 hours. On day 3, the glucose uptake capacity of the astrocytes was measured by using (14)C-2-Deoxy-d-glucose under zero-trans conditions. The heterozygous astrocyte glucose uptake treated with valproic acid (0.05 and 0.5 mM) for 48 hours was significantly increased compared with the untreated control heterozygous astrocytes. Our findings demonstrate that valproic acid increased glucose transport capacity in SLC2A1 heterozygous cerebral astrocytes. "
830,26143929,"Maternal carbohydrate intake is one important determinant of fetal body composition, but whether increased exposure to individual sugars has long-term adverse effects on the offspring is not well established. Therefore, we examined the effect of fructose feeding on the mother, placenta, fetus and her offspring up to 6 months of life when they had been weaned onto a standard rodent diet and not exposed to additional fructose. Dams fed fructose were fatter, had raised plasma insulin and triglycerides from mid-gestation and higher glucose near term. Maternal resistance arteries showed changes in function that could negatively affect regulation of blood pressure and tissue perfusion in the mother and development of the fetus. Fructose feeding had no effect on placental weight or fetal metabolic profiles, but placental gene expression for the glucose transporter GLUT1 was reduced, whereas the abundance of sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter-2 was raised. Offspring born to fructose-fed and control dams were similar at birth and had similar post-weaning growth rates, and neither fat mass nor metabolic profiles were affected. In conclusion, raised fructose consumption during reproduction results in pronounced maternal metabolic and vascular effects, but no major detrimental metabolic effects were observed in offspring up to 6 months of age.

831,20649546,"Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a maternally inherited multisystem mitochondrial disorder. Although many molecular and cellular mechanisms have been discovered leading to mitochondrial cytopathy, the pathogenic mechanism of stroke-like episodes seen in MELAS has not been clarified yet. According to the muscle and brain pathology and vascular physiology, mitochondrial angiopathy, or endothelial dysfunction, were proposed to play an important role for developing stroke-like episodes. Based on a hypothesis of mitochondrial angiopathy theory, we use L-arginine in MELAS patients and report its usefulness. This review aims to give a general idea on the actual knowledge about the possible pathogenic mechanism of stroke-like episodes, including clinical symptoms that lead to stroke-like episodes, muscle, or brain pathology, molecular cellular functions, neuroimagings including MRI, MRS, and SPECT, and the proposed site of action of L-arginine therapy on MELAS patients. Currently, L-arginine therapy may be the most promising for the treatment of stroke-like episodes in MELAS. "
832,30247538,"Adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth and stunting at birth, have long-term health implications. The relation between adverse birth outcomes and chronic, asymptomatic gastrointestinal inflammation (environmental enteric dysfunction-EED) is poorly understood. We aimed to examine the relation between maternal EED and adverse birth outcomes in a sample of pregnant Ugandan women and their newborn infants. We conducted a prospective cohort study in Mukono, Uganda. A total of 258 pregnant women were enrolled at their first prenatal visit (∼18 weeks of gestation). EED was measured by urinary lactulose:mannitol (L:M) ratio and serum concentrations of antibodies to the bacterial components flagellin and LPS. Covariates were obtained from survey data collected at 2 time points. Associations were assessed through the use of unadjusted and adjusted simple linear regression models. Complete birth outcome data were recorded for 220 infants within 48 h of delivery. Mean ± SD gestational age was 39.7 ± 2.1 wk, and 7% were born preterm. Mean ± SD length and length-for-age z score (LAZ) at birth were 48.1 ± 3.2 cm and -0.44 ± 1.07, respectively. L:M ratio was not associated with any birth outcome. In adjusted models, higher concentrations of natural log-transformed anti-flagellin immunoglobin G (IgG) and anti-LPS IgG were significantly associated with shorter length of gestation (β: -0.89 wk; 95% CI: -1.77, -0.01 wk, and β: -1.01 wk; 95% CI: -1.87, -0.17 wk, respectively) and with reduced length (β: -0.80 cm; 95% CI: -1.55, -0.05 cm, and β: -0.79 cm; 95% CI: -1.54, -0.04 cm, respectively) and LAZ at birth (β -0.44 z score; 95% CI: -0.83, -0.05, and β: -0.40 z score; 95% CI: -0.79, -0.01, respectively). Maternal anti-flagellin and anti-LPS IgG concentrations in pregnancy, but not L:M ratio, were associated with shorter gestation and reduced infant length at birth. Further research on the relation between maternal EED and birth outcomes is warranted. "
833,31078968,"Apigenin, a natural flavonoid compound, can improve the myocardial abnormal glucolipid metabolism and down-regulate the myocardial hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in hypertensive cardiac hypertrophic rats. However, whether or not the ameliorative effect of glucolipid metabolism is from the reduction of HIF-1α expression remains uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the exact relationship between them in angiotensin Ⅱ (Ang Ⅱ)/hypoxia-stimulated or HIF-1α overexpressed H9c2 cells. Two cell models with Ang Ⅱ/hypoxia-induced hypertrophy and HIF-1α overexpression were established. After treatment of the cells with different concentrations of apigenin, the levels of total protein, free fatty acids (FFA), and glucose were detected by the colorimetric method, the level of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was detected by the ELISA method, and the expressions of HIF-1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α/γ (PPARα/γ), carnitine palmitoyltmnsferase-1 (CPT-1), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK-4), glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase genes (GPAT), and glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4) proteins were detected by the Western blot assay. Following treatment of the both model cells with apigenin 1-10 μM for 24 h, the levels of intracellular total protein, ANP, and FFA were decreased, while the level of cultured supernatant glucose was increased. Importantly, apigenin treatment could inhibit the expressions of HIF-1α, PPARγ, GPAT, and GLUT-4 proteins, and increase the expressions of PPARα, CPT-1, and PDK-4 proteins. Apigenin could exert an ameliorative effect on abnormal glucolipid metabolism in AngⅡ/hypoxia-stimulated or HIF-1α-overexpressed H9c2 cells, and its mechanisms were associated with the inhibition of HIF-1α expression and subsequent upregulation of PPARα-mediated CPT-1 and PDK-4 expressions and downregulation of PPARγ-mediated GPAT and GLUT-4 expressions.

834,34904279,"Thrombin activity enhancement and its receptor protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) activation play vital roles in neurologic deficits in the central nervous system. Our recent study showed that PAR-1 upregulation stimulated by chronic high glucose (HG) caused central neuron injury through neuroinflammation; however, the molecular mechanisms are far from clear. In the present study, we found that HG resulted in neuronal injury of SH-SY5Y cells as evidenced by decreased cell viability and increased lactate dehydrogenase release and elevated the mRNA level of PAR-1. Moreover, we predicted and determined several potential microRNAs (miRs) combining with the 3'-UTR of PAR-1 mRNA, finding that miR-20a-5p, miR-93-5p, and miR-190a-5p were significantly decreased in HG-cultured SH-SY5Y cells compared with control. Further, SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected with miR-20a-5p or miR-190a-5p mimic were established, and overexpression efficiency were confirmed. It was found that miR-20a-5p or miR-190a-5p overexpression markedly decreased PAR-1 mRNA level and protein expression in SH-SY5Y cells cultured with HG and normal glucose, indicating that miR-20a or miR-19a deficiency contributed to HG-induced PAR-1 upregulation. Together, our findings demonstrated that PAR-1 upregulation mediated HG-induced neuronal damage in central neurons, which was achieved through miR-20a or miR-190a deficiency. "
835,37197939,"The study aimed to assess the total prevalence of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), and separately, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) among adults and to determine their potential association with fructose consumption. Data from the Hellenic National Nutrition and Health Survey were included (3798 adults; 58·9 % females). Information regarding FGID symptomatology was assessed using self-reported physician diagnosis questionnaires the reliability of which were screened using the ROME III, in a sample of the population. Fructose intake was estimated from 24 h recalls, and the MedDiet score was used to assess adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The prevalence of FGID symptomatology was 20·2 %, while 8·2 % had IBS (representing 40·2 % of total FGID). The likelihood of FGID was 28 % higher (95 %CI: 1·03-1·6) and of IBS 49 % (95 %CI: 1·08-2·05) in individuals with higher fructose intake than with lower intake (3rd tertile compared with 1st). When area of residence was accounted for, individuals residing in the Greek islands had a significantly lower probability of FGID and IBS compared with those residing in Mainland and the main Metropolitan areas, with Islanders also achieving a higher MedDiet score and lower added sugar intake, comparatively to inhabitants of the main metropolitan areas. FGID and IBS symptomatology was most prominent among individuals with higher fructose consumption, and this was most conspicuous in areas with a lower Mediterranean diet adherence, suggesting that the dietary source of fructose rather than total fructose should be examined in relation to FGID.

838,25579865,"Insulin resistance is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, and is associated with inflammatory cardiometabolic disease. Given differences between African ancestry (AA) and European ancestry (EA) in the epidemiology of type 2 diabetes as well as in response to inflammatory stress, we investigated potential race differences in glucose homeostasis responses during experimental endotoxemia in humans. Healthy volunteers (age 18-45 years, BMI 18-30 kg/m(2), 47% female, African-ancestry (AA, n=42) and European-ancestry (EA, n=106)) were recruited as part of the Genetics of Evoked Responses to Niacin and Endotoxemia (GENE) Study. Subjects underwent an inpatient endotoxin challenge (1 ng/kg LPS) and two frequently-sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests (FSIGTT). Insulin and glucose values obtained during FSIGTT pre- and 24-hours post-LPS were analyzed using the minimal model. FSIGTT derived insulin sensitivity index (SI), disposition index (DI) and glucose effectiveness (SG) decreased significantly following LPS (p<0.0001) while the acute insulin response to glucose (AIR(g)) increased (p<0.0001). Although expected race differences were observed in glucose homeostasis parameters at baseline prior to LPS e.g., lower SI (2.5 vs. 4.1 μU/L/min, p<0.0001) but higher AIR(g) (median 848 vs. 290 μU/L/min, p<0.0001) in AA vs. EA, the changes in glucose homeostasis responses to LPS were directionally and proportionally consistent across race e.g., SI median -35% in EA and -29% in AA and AIR(g) median +17% in EA and +26% in AA. Both EA and AA samples modulated glucose and insulin homeostasis similarly during endotoxemia. Race differences in response to environmental inflammatory stress are unlikely to be a substantial contributor to the observed difference in diabetes incidence and complications between EA and AA. "
839,38446901,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the main cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and progresses faster in males than in females. We identify sex-based differences in kidney metabolism and in the blood metabolome of male and female individuals with diabetes. Primary human proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) from healthy males displayed increased mitochondrial respiration, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and greater injury when exposed to high glucose compared with PTECs from healthy females. Male human PTECs showed increased glucose and glutamine fluxes to the TCA cycle, whereas female human PTECs showed increased pyruvate content. The male human PTEC phenotype was enhanced by dihydrotestosterone and mediated by the transcription factor HNF4A and histone demethylase KDM6A. In mice where sex chromosomes either matched or did not match gonadal sex, male gonadal sex contributed to the kidney metabolism differences between males and females. A blood metabolomics analysis in a cohort of adolescents with or without diabetes showed increased TCA cycle metabolites in males. In a second cohort of adults with diabetes, females without DKD had higher serum pyruvate concentrations than did males with or without DKD. Serum pyruvate concentrations positively correlated with the estimated glomerular filtration rate, a measure of kidney function, and negatively correlated with all-cause mortality in this cohort. In a third cohort of adults with CKD, male sex and diabetes were associated with increased plasma TCA cycle metabolites, which correlated with all-cause mortality. These findings suggest that differences in male and female kidney metabolism may contribute to sex-dependent outcomes in DKD. "
840,36509832,"Variations in dietary intake and environmental exposure patterns of essential and non-essential trace metals influence many aspects of human health throughout the life span. To examine the relationship between urine profiles of essential and non-essential metals in mother-offspring pairs and their association with early dysglycemia. Herein, we report findings from an ancillary study to the international Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome Follow-Up Study (HAPO-FUS) that examined urinary essential and non-essential metal profiles from mothers and offspring ages 10-14 years (1012 mothers, 1013 offspring, 968 matched pairs) from 10 international sites. Our analysis demonstrated a diverse exposure pattern across participating sites. In multiple regression modelling, a positive association between markers of early dysglycemia and urinary zinc was found in both mothers and offspring after adjustment for common risk factors for diabetes. The analysis showed weaker, positive, and negative associations of the 2-h glucose value with urinary selenium and arsenic respectively. A positive association between 2-h glucose values and cadmium was found only in mothers in the fully adjusted model when participants with established diabetes were excluded. There was a high degree of concordance between mother and offspring urinary metal profiles. Mother-to-offspring urinary metal ratios were unique for each metal, providing insights into changes in their homeostasis across the lifespan. Urinary levels of essential and non-essential metals are closely correlated between mothers and their offspring in an international cohort. Urinary levels of zinc, selenium, arsenic, and cadmium showed varying degrees of association with early dysglycemia in a comparatively healthy cohort with a low rate of preexisting diabetes. Our data provides novel evidence for a strong correlation between mother and offspring urinary metal patterns with a unique mother-to-offspring ratio for each metal. The study also provides new evidence for a strong positive association between early dysglycemia and urinary zinc, both in mothers and offspring. Weaker positive associations with urinary selenium and cadmium and negative associations with arsenic were also found. The low rate of preexisting diabetes in this population provides the unique advantage of minimizing the confounding effect of preexisting, diabetes related renal changes that would alter the relationship between dysglycemia and renal metal excretion.

841,34376643,"Plasma hyaluronan (HA) increases systemically in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and the HA synthesis inhibitor, 4-Methylumbelliferone, has been proposed to treat the disease. However, HA is also implicated in normal physiology. Therefore, we generated a Hyaluronan Synthase 2 transgenic mouse line, driven by a tet-response element promoter to understand the role of HA in systemic metabolism. To our surprise, adipocyte-specific overproduction of HA leads to smaller adipocytes and protects mice from high-fat-high-sucrose-diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance. Adipocytes also have more free glycerol that can be released upon beta3 adrenergic stimulation. Improvements in glucose tolerance were not linked to increased plasma HA. Instead, an HA-driven systemic substrate redistribution and adipose tissue-liver crosstalk contributes to the systemic glucose improvements. In summary, we demonstrate an unexpected improvement in glucose metabolism as a consequence of HA overproduction in adipose tissue, which argues against the use of systemic HA synthesis inhibitors to treat obesity and T2D.

842,28178172,"Both oral sucrose (OS) and nonnutritive sucking (NNS) are effective nonpharmacological methods to alleviate procedures pain in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) newborns when they were used alone, but the combined effect of OS+NNS remains controversial. So, we conducted this study to evaluate the efficiency of NNS combined with oral sucrose on pain relief in NICU newborns undergoing painful procedures. We searched PubMed, Ovid (Medline), Embase (Medline), Cochrane Central Library, and other resources such as Google Scholar, bibliographies of included literatures for all available articles. Two reviewers screened literatures and extracted data independently. The fixed effects model was used to pool the results using Reviewer Manager (RevMan) 5.3. As each study included in our meta-analysis had been approved by Ethics Committee or institutional review board, thus our study did not need ethical approval. Seven randomized controlled trials, including 599 participants, were contained in our meta-analysis. The combination of oral sucrose and NNS is associated with reduced pain scores (mean difference [MD], -0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.68 to -0.36); shortened crying time (MD,-0.92; 95% CI, -1.39 to -0.44); but the 2 groups did not differ significantly in reducing bradycardia (MD, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.32-1.68), tachycardia (MD, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.38-1.10), or desaturations (MD, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.32-1.68). The pooled evidence indicates that the combination measures may serve as an evidence-based guideline for pain relief among patients having minor pain. Besides, it also indicates that OS combined with NNS can be an alternative for better prevention and management of procedure pain in NICU newborns. Nevertheless, the results may be limited due to incomplete data, and thus, more randomized controlled trials or well-designed studies are required to determine the effects of OS+NNS in the future. "

846,26890260,"There are unprecedented epidemics of obesity, such as type II diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) in developed countries. A concerning percentage of American children are being affected by obesity and NAFLD. Studies have suggested that the maternal environment in utero might play a role in the development of these diseases later in life. In this study, we documented that inhibiting SIRT1 signaling in human fetal hepatocytes rapidly led to an increase in intracellular glucose and lipids levels. More importantly, both de novo lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis related genes were upregulated upon SIRT1 inhibition. The AKT/FOXO1 pathway, a major negative regulator of gluconeogenesis, was decreased in the human fetal hepatocytes inhibited for SIRT1, consistent with the higher level of gluconeogenesis. These results indicate that SIRT1 is an important regulator of lipid and carbohydrate metabolisms within human fetal hepatocytes, acting as an adaptive transcriptional response to environmental changes.

847,16846599,"alpha-Glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.3) is a lysosomal enzyme that hydrolyses alpha-1,4- and alpha-1,6-linkages of glycogen to produce free glucose. A deficiency in alpha-glucosidase activity results in glycogen storage disorder type II (GSD II), also called Pompe disease. Here, d-glucose was shown to be a competitive inhibitor of alpha-glucosidase and when added to culture medium at 6.0 g/L increased the production of this protein by CHO-K1 expression cells and stabilised the enzyme activity. D-Glucose also prevented alpha-glucosidase aggregation/precipitation and increased protein yield in a modified purification scheme. In fibroblast cells, from adult-onset GSD II patients, D-glucose increased the residual level of alpha-glucosidase activity, suggesting that a structural analogue of d-glucose may be used for enzyme enhancement therapy.

848,35593438,"Children of women with pre-eclampsia have increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) and metabolic disease in adult life. Furthermore, the risk of pregnancy complications is higher in daughters born to women affected by pre-eclampsia than in daughters born after uncomplicated pregnancies. While aberrant inflammation contributes to the pathophysiology of pregnancy complications, including pre-eclampsia, the contribution of maternal inflammation to subsequent risk of CV and metabolic disease as well as pregnancy complications in the offspring remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that 24-week-old female rats (F1) born to dams (F0) exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) during pregnancy (to induce inflammation) exhibited mild systolic dysfunction, increased cardiac growth-related gene expression, altered glucose tolerance, and coagulopathy; whereas male F1 offspring exhibited altered glucose tolerance and increased visceral fat accumulation compared with F1 sex-matched offspring born to saline-treated dams. Both male and female F1 offspring born to LPS-treated dams had evidence of anemia. Fetuses (F2) from F1 females born to LPS-treated dams were growth restricted, and this reduction in fetal growth was associated with increased CD68 positivity (indicative of macrophage presence) and decreased expression of glucose transporter-1 in their utero-placental units. These results indicate that abnormal maternal inflammation can contribute to increased risk of CV and metabolic disease in the offspring, and that the effects of inflammation may cross generations. Our findings provide evidence in support of early screening for CV and metabolic disease, as well as pregnancy complications in offspring affected by pre-eclampsia or other pregnancy complications associated with aberrant inflammation.

850,29720109,Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder after streptococcal infection (PANDAS) is a specific autoimmune response to group-A streptococcal infections in children and adolescents with a sudden onset of obsessive-compulsive disorders or tic-like symptoms. Cerebral metabolic changes of patients have not yet been observed. We present a case of an 18-year old male with a PANDAS-like condition after developing tic-like symptoms and involuntary movements three weeks after cardiac surgery. The patient had suffered from pharyngotonsillitis before the symptoms started. The anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titer was elevated (805 kU/l). Antibiotic therapy did not improve his condition. Intravenous immunoglobulins and high-dose cortisone therapy had minor beneficial effects on his involuntary movements. 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/ computer tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) demonstrated pronounced hypermetabolism of the basal ganglia and cortical hypometabolism. The patient was treated with five cycles of plasmapheresis. A marked clinical improvement was observed after four months. Cerebral metabolic alterations had completely normalized. This is the first report of cerebral metabolic changes observed on FDG-PET/CT in a patient with a PANDAS-like condition with a normalization following immunomodulatory treatment. Cerebral FDG-PET/CT might be a promising tool in the diagnosis of PANDAS. 
851,31456337,"Alzheimer disease (AD) patients demonstrate various clinical features reminiscent of children (the retrogenesis model). The Binet test is available for assessing mental development and deterioration. However, neuroimaging correlations remain to be clarified. Although AD patients also manifest social judgment disability, there are few cognitive tests, contrary to so many memory tests. Among the database, we noticed that the Binet test includes the subscale of social judgement using illogical sentences and pictures. The aim of this study is to clarify the neuroimaging correlations for the Binet test, especially for the illogical questions. Forty participants were selected from the database of the Tajiri Project. The Tanaka-Binet test was used to evaluate the mental age and the basic age. The latter is the age level at which the patient can completely accomplish all questions at the immediately lower age level and is used for calculating the mental age. Using the subtests of illogical sentences/pictures, logical judgment abilities were assessed. Using magnetic resonance imaging, we performed four-grade visual evaluation for cortical atrophy. The cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRglc) was measured using an autoradiographic method of  There was a significant Spearman's correlation between the clinical stage and the basic age. Degree of frontal, temporal and hippocampal atrophy were correlated with the basic age. The entire grey matter and frontal and temporal CMRglc were associated with the basic age. The illogical sentences scores were correlated with the bilateral temporal, hippocampal and the left parieto-temporal CMRglc, whereas the illogical picture scores were correlated with the right parieto-temporal CMRglc. We found that frontal and temporal atrophy as well as hypometabolism were associated with the basic age. Regarding the illogical judgment, the current PET data analysis disclosed that there may be a double dissociation between verbal/non-verbal judgments and the left/right parieto-temporal areas. "
852,32681564,"Better understanding of aspects of taste in adolescents is needed since it has bearings on food policies, food industry and pharmaceutical design. Furthermore, taste preferences likely play a role in overeating and anorexia. We aimed to validate a questionnaire about taste preferences and dietary habits along with measurements of sense of smell and taste. We included adolescents from nearby schools in Aarhus, Denmark, from 2017 to 2019. Scoring preferences and habits on a Likert scale, they completed a food item questionnaire. Their chemosensation was tested by the Sniffin' Sticks and Taste Drop Test. We included 100 adolescents: 53 males, 47 females; average age: 15.9 years (12-17 years). Retest of the questionnaire showed good reliability (Cohen's kappa: 0.5953). Snacks scored the highest average liking (4.48), whereas starches had the highest frequency of consumption (3.64). Bitter taste threshold was positively associated with liking and familiarity with vegetables (P = .032; P = .012), respectively. Healthy self-reported dietary habits were associated with a higher self-reported consumption of vegetables and a decreased consumption of snacks. Adolescents preferred unhealthy food items, but they also reported more frequent consumption of healthy than unhealthy food items. A higher threshold for the bitter taste, that is, being less sensitive to bitter taste, was associated with higher liking and familiarity of vegetables. "
853,32603600,"Several studies have reported that health problems occur in assisted reproductive technology (ART)-conceived offspring. Recently, investigations have demonstrated that paternal environmental conditions influence offspring health. However, it is unclear whether the factors that cause male infertility per se affect offspring health and contribute to health problems in ART-born children. Scrotal heat stress represents a common cause for oligoasthenozoospermia, and in these cases, in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) is typically recommended for those individuals trying to conceive. We exposed C57BL/6J male mice to frequent and mild scrotal heat stress (fmSHS) (39°C for 30 min once weekly for 5 consecutive wk). Sperm was subjected to IVF-ET with oocytes of untreated C57BL/6J females to produce offspring mice. Glucose intolerance and insulin resistance was observed in the male offspring mice derived from fmSHS-exposed fathers. Islets, after evaluation, remained unchanged. Genes involved in glucose metabolism, especially, those in insulin signaling pathways, showed dysregulation in the liver of the fmSHS-derived male offspring. Differentially methylated regions were found in the sperm of fmSHS-exposed mice by whole genome bisulfite sequencing. Interestingly, abnormal methylation of some genes with altered expression in offspring was observed in both the sperm of fmSHS fathers and the liver of their male offspring. Our results suggest that the factors that cause male infertility can affect male offspring health by an epigenetic mechanism. "
854,24032394,"Altered cerebral metabolism and mitochondrial function have been identified in experimental and clinical studies of pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI). Metabolic changes detected using (1)H (proton) magnetic resonance spectroscopy correlate with long-term outcomes in children after severe TBI. We previously identified early (4-h) and sustained (24-h and 7-day) abnormalities in brain metabolites after controlled cortical impact (CCI) in immature rats. The current study aimed to identify specific alterations of cerebral glucose metabolism at 24 h after TBI in immature rats. Rats (postnatal days 16-18) underwent CCI to the left parietal cortex. Sham rats underwent craniotomy only. Twenty-four hours after CCI, rats were injected (intraperitoneally) with [1,6-(13)C]glucose. Brains were removed, separated into hemispheres, and frozen. Metabolites were extracted with perchloric acid and analyzed using (1)H and (13)C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. TBI resulted in decreases in N-acetylaspartate in both hemispheres, compared to sham contralateral. At 24 h after TBI, there was significant decrease in the incorporation of (13)C label into [3-(13)C]glutamate and [2-(13)C]glutamate in the injured brain. There were no differences in percent enrichment of [3-(13)C]glutamate, [4-(13)C]glutamate, [3-(13)C]glutamine, or [4-(13)C]glutamine. There was significantly lower percent enrichment of [2-(13)C]glutamate in both TBI sides and the sham craniotomy side, compared to sham contralateral. No differences were detected in enrichment of (13)C glucose label in [2-(13)C]glutamine, [2-(13)C]GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), [3-(13)C]GABA, or [4-(13)C]GABA, [3-(13)C]lactate, or [3-(13)C]alanine between groups. Results suggest that overall oxidative glucose metabolism in the immature brain recovers at 24 h after TBI. Specific reductions in [2-(13)C]glutamate could be the result of impairments in either neuronal or astrocytic metabolism. Future studies should aim to identify pathways leading to decreased metabolism and develop cell-selective ""metabolic rescue."" "
855,36214339,"Fructose overconsumption promotes tumor progression. Neuroblastoma is a common extracranial tumor with about 50% 5-year survival rate in high-risk children. The anti-tumor effect of Tribulus terrestris might bring new hope to neuroblastoma therapy. However, whether fructose disturbs the therapeutic effect of T. terrestris is currently unknown. In this study, the mouse neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro 2a (N2a) cells, was used to investigate the therapeutic effects of T. terrestris extract at various dosages (0.01, 1, 100 ng/ml) in regular EMEM medium or extra added fructose (20 mM) for 24 h. 100 ng/ml T. terrestris treatment significantly reduced the cell viability, whereas the cell viabilities were enhanced at the dosages of 0.01 or 1 ng/ml T. terrestris in the fructose milieu instead. The inhibition effect of T. terrestris on N2a migration was blunted in the fructose milieu. Moreover, T. terrestris effectively suppressed mitochondrial functions, including oxygen consumption rates, the activities of electron transport enzymes, the expressions of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes, and mitochondrial membrane potential. These suppressions were reversed in the fructose group. In addition, the T. terrestris-suppressed mitofusin and the T. terrestris-enhance mitochondrial fission 1 protein were maintained at basal levels in the fructose milieu. Together, these results demonstrated that T. terrestris extract effectively suppressed the survival and migration of neuroblastoma via inhibiting mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and disturbing mitochondrial dynamics. Whereas, the fructose milieu blunted the therapeutic effect of T. terrestris, particularly, when the dosage is reduced. "

The purpose of this study is to extend our knowledge of HBM by investigating the role of maternal body mass index (BMI), sex and stage of lactation (month 1 vs. 6) on HBM insulin, glucose, leptin, IL-6 and TNF-α and their associations with infant body composition. Thirty-seven exclusively breastfeeding infants (n = 37; 16♀, 21♂), and their mothers (19-47 kg m A significant interaction between maternal BMI and infant sex on insulin levels (p = 0.0322) was observed such that insulin was 229% higher in obese mothers nursing female infants than in normal weight mothers nursing female infants and 179% higher than obese mothers nursing male infants. For leptin, a significant association with BMI category was observed (p < 0.0001) such that overweight and obese mothers had 96.5% and 315.1% higher leptin levels than normal weight mothers, respectively. Leptin was also found to have a significant (p = 0.0004) 33.7% decrease from months 1 to 6, controlling for BMI category and sex. A significant inverse relationship between month 1 leptin levels and infant length (p = 0.0257), percent fat (p = 0.0223), total fat mass (p = 0.0226) and trunk fat mass (p = 0.0111) at month 6 was also found.

857,33060792,"Irisin is a product of fibronectin type III domain-containing protein (Fndc5) and is involved in the regulation of adipokine secretion and the differentiation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. In this study, we aimed to determine whether irisin lacking affects glucose/lipid and bone metabolism. We knocked out the Fndc5 gene to generate irisin-lacking mice. Remarkable, irisin lacking was related to poor 'browning response', with a bigger size of the intraperitoneal white adipose cell and decreased a number of brown adipose cells in brown adipose of interscapular tissue. The irisin lacking mice had hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance, reduced HDL-cholesterol level, increased LDL-cholesterol level, and decreased insulin sensitivity. The lacking of irisin was associated with reduced bone strength and bone mass in mice. The increased number of osteoclasts and higher expression of RANKL indicated increased bone resorption in irisin lacking mice. The level of IL-6 and TNF-α also increased in irisin lacking mice. The results showed that irisin lacking was related to decreased 'browning response', glucose/lipid metabolic derangement, and reduced bone mass with increased bone resorption. Further studies are needed to confirm these initial observations and explore the mechanisms underlying the effects of irisin on glucose/lipid and bone metabolism. "
858,30348739,"Parents have reported that they want to learn how to reduce pain in infants during vaccinations. Our objective was to compare different levels of intensity of postnatal education about pain mitigation on parental self-reported use of interventions at future infant vaccinations. We conducted a longitudinal, 3-group parallel, add-on, randomized controlled trial on the postnatal ward of a hospital. New mothers, unaware of the hypothesis, were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 intervention groups and 3 follow-up groups (i.e., 9 groups, 3 × 3). The 3 intervention groups were control (general immunization information), pain pamphlet (pain mitigation information), and pain pamphlet and pain video (pain mitigation information). Both pain mitigation education groups also received general immunization information. The 3 follow-up groups were 2-, 4- and 6-month infant vaccinations. Mothers reported use of breastfeeding, sucrose and topical anesthetics during infant vaccinations in a telephone survey.

859,29353241,"Nutrients are transported through endothelial cells before being metabolized in muscle cells. However, little is known about the regulation of endothelial transport processes. Notch signaling is a critical regulator of metabolism and angiogenesis during development. Here, we studied how genetic and pharmacological manipulation of endothelial Notch signaling in adult mice affects endothelial fatty acid transport, cardiac angiogenesis, and heart function. Endothelial-specific Notch inhibition was achieved by conditional genetic inactivation of Rbp-jκ in adult mice to analyze fatty acid metabolism and heart function. Wild-type mice were treated with neutralizing antibodies against the Notch ligand Delta-like 4. Fatty acid transport was studied in cultured endothelial cells and transgenic mice. Treatment of wild-type mice with Delta-like 4 neutralizing antibodies for 8 weeks impaired fractional shortening and ejection fraction in the majority of mice. Inhibition of Notch signaling specifically in the endothelium of adult mice by genetic ablation of Rbp-jκ caused heart hypertrophy and failure. Impaired heart function was preceded by alterations in fatty acid metabolism and an increase in cardiac blood vessel density. Endothelial Notch signaling controlled the expression of endothelial lipase, Angptl4, CD36, and Fabp4, which are all needed for fatty acid transport across the vessel wall. In endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ-mutant mice, lipase activity and transendothelial transport of long-chain fatty acids to muscle cells were impaired. In turn, lipids accumulated in the plasma and liver. The attenuated supply of cardiomyocytes with long-chain fatty acids was accompanied by higher glucose uptake, increased concentration of glycolysis intermediates, and mTOR-S6K signaling. Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or displacing glucose as cardiac substrate by feeding a ketogenic diet prolonged the survival of endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ-deficient mice. This study identifies Notch signaling as a novel regulator of fatty acid transport across the endothelium and as an essential repressor of angiogenesis in the adult heart. The data imply that the endothelium controls cardiomyocyte metabolism and function. "
860,25017942,"The molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal leptin and insulin resistance in obesity and diabetes remain unclear. Here we show that induction of the unfolded protein response transcription factor spliced X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp1s) in pro-opiomelanocortin (Pomc) neurons alone is sufficient to protect against diet-induced obesity as well as improve leptin and insulin sensitivity, even in the presence of strong activators of ER stress. We also demonstrate that constitutive expression of Xbp1s in Pomc neurons contributes to improved hepatic insulin sensitivity and suppression of endogenous glucose production. Notably, elevated Xbp1s levels in Pomc neurons also resulted in activation of the Xbp1s axis in the liver via a cell-nonautonomous mechanism. Together our results identify critical molecular mechanisms linking ER stress in arcuate Pomc neurons to acute leptin and insulin resistance as well as liver metabolism in diet-induced obesity and diabetes.

861,29654605,"Appropriate calcium and phosphate supplementation is essential for bone growth in preterm infants. Using Rehabix-K2™ (AY Pharmaceuticals, Tokyo, Japan) and Pleamin-P Injection™ (Fuso Pharmaceutical Industries, Osaka, Japan) as the total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and amino acid solution, respectively, we investigated ways of maximizing calcium and phosphate in the TPN solution. Rehabix-K2, Pleamin-P, calcium gluconate, sodium phosphate, 50% glucose, and water were mixed in varying proportions to create 16 formulations. Precipitation assessment was done three times for each of the 16 formulations, and was based on the Japanese Pharmacopeia. Precipitation was observed 24 h after mixing when the calcium and phosphate were 60 mEq/L and 30 mmol/L or 80 mEq/L and 40 mmol/L, respectively. No precipitation was observed when the calcium and phosphate were 20 mEq/L and 10 mmol/L, respectively. Precipitation was observed once out of three times, when the calcium and phosphate were 40 mEq/L and 20 mmol/L, respectively, and the amino acids were 2% and 3% (mean pH, 6.13 and 6.26, respectively). No precipitation was observed, however, when the calcium and phosphate were 40 mEq/L and 20 mmol/L, respectively, and the amino acids were 0% and 1% (mean pH, 5.88 and 6.05, respectively). Not only the concentration of calcium and phosphate, but also the pH of the TPN solution, are crucial factors for precipitation. Based on these results, a well-balanced TPN solution maximizing calcium and phosphate availability will be able to be formulated. "
862,29454841,"Compelling evidence indicates that hypocretin/orexin signaling regulates arousal, stress and reward-seeking behaviors. However, most studies on drug reward-related processes have so far described the effects of pharmacological blockers disrupting hypocretin/orexin transmission. We report here an extensive study on cocaine-related behaviors in hypocretin/orexin-deficient mice (KO) and their heterozygous (HET) and wildtype (WT) littermates. We evaluated behavioral sensitization following repeated administrations and preference for an environment repeatedly paired with cocaine injections (15 mg/kg). Mice were also trained to self-administer cocaine (0.5-1.5 mg/kg/infusion). Our observations show that whereas all mice exhibited quite similar responses to acute administration of cocaine, only Hcrt KO mice exhibited reduced cocaine-seeking behaviors following a period of abstinence or extinction, and reduced cocaine incubation craving. Further, if the present findings confirm that Hcrt deficient mice may display a hypoactive phenotype, possibly linked to a reduced alertness concomitant to a decreased exploration of their environment, hypocretin/orexin defiency did not cause any attentional deficit. We thus report that innate disruption of hypocretin/orexin signaling moderately alters cocaine reward but significantly reduces long-term affective dependence that may explain the lack of relapse for cocaine seeking seen in Hcrt KO mice. Overall, with blunted cocaine intake at the highest concentration and reduced responsiveness to cocaine cues after prolonged abstinence, our findings suggest that hypocretin deficient mice may display signs of resilience to cocaine addiction.

863,30862112,"Little is known about the growth patterns of low birth weight neonates (<2500 g) during standardized thermal control and nutrition regulation to meet basal metabolism requirements compared to those of non-low birth weight neonates (2500 g and above). We retrospectively identified 10,544 non-low birth weight and 681 low birth weight neonates placed in thermo-controlled incubators for up to 24 h after birth. All neonates were fed a 5% glucose solution 1 h after birth and breastfed every 3 h (with supplementary formula milk if applicable) to meet basal metabolism requirements. Maximum body-weight loss (%), percentage body-weight loss from birth to peak weight loss (%/day), and percentage body-weight gain from peak weight loss to day 4 (%/day) were assessed by multivariable linear regression. Overall, the growth curves showed a uniform J-shape across all birth weight categories, with a low mean maximum body-weight loss (1.9%) and incidence of neonatal jaundice (0.3%). The body-weight loss patterns did not differ between the two groups. However, low birth weight neonates showed significantly faster growth patterns for percentage body-weight gain: β = 0.52 (95% confidence interval, 0.46 to 0.58). Under thermal control and nutrition regulation, low birth weight neonates might not have disadvantages in clinical outcomes or growth patterns. "

865,35841070,"High glucose-induced damage to the osteogenic differentiation of human periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) has long been a challenge to periodontal regeneration for diabetic individuals. Metformin is an anti-hyperglycemic drug that exhibits abundant biological activities associated with cell metabolism and downstream tissue regeneration. However, how metformin combats damage to PDLSC osteogenic differentiation under high glucose and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs was assessed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, ALP activity, Alizarin Red staining and quantitative assay, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. RNA-seq analysis was performed to screen target genes of metformin, and the effects of target genes were confirmed using lentivirus transfection. Western blot analysis was also used to detect the protein level of underlying signaling pathways. We found that osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs under high glucose was decreased, and metformin addition enhanced this capacity of differentiation. Furthermore, the results of RNA-seq analysis showed that natriuretic peptide receptor 3 (NPR3) was upregulated in PDLSCs under high glucose and downregulated after metformin addition. When the underlying pathways involved were investigated, we found that upregulation of NPR3 can compromise the metformin-enhanced PDLSC osteogenic differentiation and activate the MAPK pathway (especially the p38 MAPK and Erk1/2 pathway), and that inhibition of the NPR3-mediated p38 MAPK or Erk1/2 pathway enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs under high glucose. The present study suggests that metformin may enhance the osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs under high glucose via downregulation of NPR3 and inhibition of its downstream MAPK pathway. This is the first report identifying the involvement of NPR3-mediated MAPK pathway in the metformin-enhanced osteogenic differentiation, indicating that NPR3 antagonists, such as metformin, may be feasible therapeutics for periodontal tissue regeneration in diabetic individuals.

Adults with T2DM were enrolled in a cross-over study. Each episode of hypoglycaemia (capillary glucose <4.0 mmol/L) was randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment protocols: 0.3 g glucose/kg body-weight or a fixed dose of either 12 or 30 g glucose, independent of weight. All participants received each treatment in random order for up to 15 hypoglycaemic episodes. Glucose was re-tested 10 minutes after treatment, with a repeat dose if still <4 mmol/L. Mean (SD) age of the 30 participants was 68 (8.1) years, mean weight was 91.5 (16.8) kg and mean HbA1c was 58.7 (9.2) mmol/mol.

The odds ratio, adjusted for multiple comparisons, for resolution of hypoglycaemia at 10 minutes, comparing weight-based treatment and 12 g treatment was 3.2 (95% CI, 1.1-9.0), P = .009, comparing 30 g treatment and 12 g treatment was 8.9 (95% CI, 2.2-36.6), P < .001, and comparing weight-based treatment and 30 g treatment was 0.36 (95% CI, 0.08-1.67) P = .10. In T2DM, both a weight-based 0.3 g/kg treatment and a fixed 30 g glucose treatment result in higher blood glucose than a 12 g treatment, along with increased probability of resolution of hypoglycaemia after 10 minutes. Both treatments result in an excess of mild rebound hyperglycaemia (>8 mmol/L) at 30 minutes. "
867,38341040,"To examine whether sleep health in the first trimester could predict glucose metabolism in the second trimester. Pregnant women (N = 127) during the first trimester were recruited (August 2022 to March 2023). Overall sleep health was assessed by the Sleep Health Index. Various dimensions of sleep health were measured using a 7-day sleep diary and questionnaires. The outcomes, including diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and HbA1c, were obtained from the medical records in the second trimester. Poisson regression analysis and multiple linear regression were used for data analysis. The average age of the participants was 32.6 years. The incidence of GDM was 28.3 % and the mean HbA1c was 5.2 % (33 mmol/mol). Sleep duration regularity (RR = 1.808; 95 %CI 1.023, 3.196) was associated with GDM after controlling for confounders. SHI total score (β = -0.278; 95 %CI -0.022, -0.005) and sleep duration regularity (β = 0.243; 95 %CI 0.057, 0.372) were associated with HbA1c. Worse sleep health, particularly lower sleep regularity, predicted worse glucose metabolism among pregnant women. Healthcare professional may consider adding sleep-related assessment to prenatal care. Maintaining regular sleep should be encouraged. Studies examining the impact of sleep intervention on glucose metabolism among pregnant women are warranted. "
868,37311602,"Relationships between glycemic-lowering effects of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors and impact on kidney and cardiovascular outcomes are uncertain. We analyzed 4395 individuals with prebaseline and postbaseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) randomized to canagliflozin (n=2193) or placebo (n=2202) in The Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation trial. Effects on HbA1c were assessed using mixed models. Mediation of treatment effects by achieved glycemic control was analyzed using proportional hazards regression with and without adjustment for achieved HbA1c. End points included combined kidney or cardiovascular death, end-stage kidney disease or doubling of serum creatinine (primary trial outcome), and individual end point components. HbA1c lowering was modified by baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). For baseline eGFR 60-90, 45-59, and 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m The glycemic effects of canagliflozin are attenuated at lower eGFR but effects on kidney and cardiac end points are preserved. Non-glycemic effects may be primarily responsible for the kidney and cardioprotective benefits of canagliflozin.22. "
869,34232630,"Hindering the recombination of a photogenerated carrier is a crucial method to enhance the photoelectrochemical performance of ZnO due to its high exciton binding energy. Herein, the intramolecular donor-acceptor compensated semiconductor ZnO (I-D/A ZnO), introducing C dopants and oxygen vacancies, was prepared with the assistance of ascorbic acid (AA). According to the DFT calculations, the asymmetry DOS could lead to the longer carrier lifetime and the smaller electron transfer resistance. Then, the photoelectrochemical biosensor toward glucose was regarded as a model to discuss the application of ZnO in biosensors. As a result, the biosensor based on I-D/A ZnO showed good performance with high sensitivity, low limit of detection, and fine anti-interference, meaning that I-D/A ZnO is a promising semiconductor for photoelectrochemical biosensors.

870,26375425,"Estrogens act upon estrogen receptor (ER)α to inhibit feeding and improve glucose homeostasis in female animals. However, the intracellular signals that mediate these estrogenic actions remain unknown. Here, we report that anorexigenic effects of estrogens are blunted in female mice that lack ERα specifically in proopiomelanocortin (POMC) progenitor neurons. These mutant mice also develop insulin resistance and are insensitive to the glucose-regulatory effects of estrogens. Moreover, we showed that propyl pyrazole triol (an ERα agonist) stimulates the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway specifically in POMC progenitor neurons, and that blockade of PI3K attenuates propyl pyrazole triol-induced activation of POMC neurons. Finally, we show that effects of estrogens to inhibit food intake and to improve insulin sensitivity are significantly attenuated in female mice with PI3K genetically inhibited in POMC progenitor neurons. Together, our results indicate that an ERα-PI3K cascade in POMC progenitor neurons mediates estrogenic actions to suppress food intake and improve insulin sensitivity. "
871,39012939,"Hypoxia and low glucose abundance often occur simultaneously at sites of inflammation. In monocytes and macrophages, glucose-oxygen deprivation stimulates the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome to generate the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β. We found that concomitant glucose deprivation and hypoxia activated the NLRP3 inflammasome by constraining the function of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate kinase pathway. HMGCR is involved in the synthesis of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), which is required for the prenylation and lipid membrane integration of proteins. Under glucose-oxygen deprivation, GGPP synthesis was decreased, leading to reduced prenylation of the small GTPase Rac1, increased binding of nonprenylated Rac1 to the scaffolding protein IQGAP1, and enhanced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. In response to restricted oxygen and glucose supply, patient monocytes with a compromised mevalonate pathway due to mevalonate kinase deficiency or Muckle-Wells syndrome released more IL-1β than did control monocytes. Thus, reduced GGPP synthesis due to inhibition of HMGCR under glucose-oxygen deprivation results in proinflammatory innate responses, which are normally kept in check by the prenylation of Rac1. We suggest that this mechanism is also active in inflammatory autoimmune conditions. "
872,34784611,"The aim of the study is to evaluate whether values and the shape of the glucose curve during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in pregnancy identify women at risk of developing hypertension (HTN) later in life. This category includes the secondary analysis of a follow-up from a mild gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) study that included a treatment trial for mild GDM ( There was no association between fasting, 1-hour OGTT, and the outcomes. However, the 2-hour OGTT value was positively associated (adjusted odds ratio [aRR] per 10-unit increase 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.08), and the 3-hour was inversely associated (aRR per 10-unit increase 0.96, 95% CI 0.93-0.99) with the primary outcome. When the shape of the OGTT curve was evaluated, a monophasic OGTT response (peak at 1 hour followed by a decline in glucose) was associated with increased risk of elevated BP (41.3vs. 23.5%, aRR 1.66, 95% CI 1.17-2.35) and stage 1 HTN or higher (28.5 vs. 14.7%, aRR 1.83, 95% CI 1.15-2.92), compared with a biphasic OGTT response. Among persons with mild GDM or lesser degrees of glucose intolerance, the shape of the OGTT curve during pregnancy may help identify women who are at risk of HTN later in life, with biphasic shape to be associated with lower risk. · The shape of the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test curve may help identify patients who are at risk of having elevated BP or HTN 5 to 10 years following pregnancy.. · The 2-hour Oral Glucose Tolerance Test values is positively associated with elevated BP 5 to 10 years following pregnancy.. · This supports the concept of pregnancy as a window to future health and represents a potential novel biomarker for maternal cardiovascular health screening..

873,30446646,"Much of the mammalian skeleton originates from a cartilage template eventually replaced by bone via endochondral ossification. Despite much knowledge about growth factors and nuclear proteins in skeletal development, little is understood about the role of metabolic regulation. Here we report that genetic deletion of the glucose transporter Glut1 (Slc2a1), either before or after the onset of chondrogenesis in the limb, severely impairs chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy, resulting in dramatic shortening of the limbs. The cartilage defects are reminiscent to those caused by deficiency in Bmp signaling. Importantly, deletion of Bmpr1a in chondrocytes markedly reduces Glut1 levels in vivo, whereas recombinant BMP2 increases Glut1 mRNA and protein levels, boosting glucose metabolism in primary chondrocytes. Biochemical studies identify a Bmp-mTORC1-Hif1a signaling cascade resulting in upregulation of Glut1 in chondrocytes. The results therefore uncover a hitherto unknown connection between Bmp signaling and glucose metabolism in the regulation of cartilage development. "
874,37334605,"At least one-third of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients have cerebrovascular abnormalities, micro- and macro-infarctions, and ischemic white matter alterations. Stroke prognosis impacts AD development due to vascular disease. Hyperglycemia can readily produce vascular lesions and atherosclerosis, increasing the risk of cerebral ischemia. Our previous research has demonstrated that protein O-GlcNAcylation, a dynamic and reversible post-translational modification, provides protection against ischemic stroke. However, the role of O-GlcNAcylation in the exacerbation of cerebral ischemia injury due to hyperglycemia remains to be elucidated. In this study, we explored the role and underlying mechanism of protein O-GlcNAcylation in the exacerbation of cerebral ischemia injury caused by hyperglycemia. High glucose-cultured brain microvascular endothelial (bEnd3) cells were injured by oxygen-glucose deprivation. Cell viability was used as the assay result. Stroke outcomes and hemorrhagic transformation incidence were assessed in mice after middle cerebral artery occlusion under high glucose and streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemic conditions. Western blot estimated that O-GlcNAcylation influenced apoptosis levels in vitro and in vivo. In in vitro analyses showed that Thiamet-G induces upregulation of protein O-GlcNAcylation, which attenuates oxygen-glucose deprivation/R-induce injury in bEnd3 cells cultured under normal glucose conditions, while aggravated it under high glucose conditions. In in vivo analyses, Thiamet-G exacerbated cerebral ischemic injury and induced hemorrhagic transformation, accompanied by increased apoptosis. While blocking protein O-GlcNAcylation with 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine alleviated cerebral injury of ischemic stroke in different hyperglycemic mice. Overall, our study highlights the crucial role of O-GlcNAcylation in exacerbating cerebral ischemia injury under conditions of hyperglycemia. O-GlcNAcylation could potentially serve as a therapeutic target for ischemic stroke associated with AD. "
875,36437778,"Brain plasticity and function is impaired in conditions of metabolic dysregulation, such as obesity. Less is known on whether brain function is also affected by transient and physiological metabolic changes, such as the alternation between fasting and fed state. Here we asked whether these changes affect the transient shift of ocular dominance that follows short-term monocular deprivation, a form of homeostatic plasticity. We further asked whether variations in three of the main metabolic and hormonal pathways affected in obesity (glucose metabolism, leptin signalling and fatty acid metabolism) correlate with plasticity changes. We measured the effects of 2 h monocular deprivation in three conditions: post-absorptive state (fasting), after ingestion of a standardised meal and during infusion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an incretin physiologically released upon meal ingestion that plays a key role in glucose metabolism. We found that short-term plasticity was less manifest in fasting than in fed state, whereas GLP-1 infusion did not elicit reliable changes compared to fasting. Although we confirmed a positive association between plasticity and supraphysiological GLP-1 levels, achieved by GLP-1 infusion, we found that none of the parameters linked to glucose metabolism could predict the plasticity reduction in the fasting versus fed state. Instead, this was selectively associated with the increase in plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (B-OH) levels during fasting, which suggests a link between neural function and energy substrates alternative to glucose. These results reveal a previously unexplored link between homeostatic brain plasticity and the physiological changes associated with the daily fast-fed cycle. "

877,25098542,"To investigate the cerebral glucose metabolism in subjects with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) by using brain [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET). Cross-sectional study in which 12 adults with various forms of X-ALD underwent clinical evaluation and brain MRI, followed by brain FDG-PET, neuropsychological assessment, and personality and psychopathology evaluation using the Symptom Checkist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) and the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III (MCMI-III). When compared to healthy control subjects (n = 27) by using Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 software, the patients with X-ALD-with or without brain MRI changes-showed a pattern of increased glucose metabolism in frontal lobes and reduced glucose metabolism in cerebellum and temporal lobe areas. On single case analysis by Scenium software, we found a similar pattern, with significant (p < 0.02) correlation between the degree of hypermetabolism in the frontal lobes of each patient and the corresponding X-ALD clinical scores. With respect to personality, we found that patients with X-ALD usually present with an obsessive-compulsive personality disorder on the MCMI-III, with significant (p < 0.05) correlation between glucose uptake in ventral striatum and severity of score on the obsessive-compulsive subscale. We examined cerebral glucose metabolism using FDG-PET in a cohort of patients with X-ALD and provided definite evidence that in X-ALD the analysis of brain glucose metabolism reveals abnormalities independent from morphologic and signal changes detected by MRI and related to clinical severity. Brain FDG-PET may be a useful neuroimaging technique for the characterization of X-ALD and possibly other leukodystrophies. "
878,27208686,"The pathomechanism of the ligamentum flavum (LF) hypertrophy in diabetic patients with lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LSCS) remains unclear. A cross-sectional study was undertaken to investigate the mechanism of LF hypertrophy in these patients. Twenty-four diabetic and 20 normoglycemic patients with LSCS were enrolled in the study. The structure of the LF in the study subjects was evaluated using histological and immunohistochemical methods, and the levels of sorbitol, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the fibrogenic factor, TGF-β1, in the LF were analyzed. In vitro experiments were performed using NIH3T3 fibroblasts to evaluate the effect of high-glucose conditions and an aldose reductase inhibitor on the cellular production of sorbitol, pro-inflammatory factors, and TGF-β1. We found that the LF of diabetic patients exhibited significantly higher levels of sorbitol and pro-inflammatory cytokines, TGF-β1 and of CD68-positive staining than that of the normoglycemic subjects. The diabetic LF was significantly thicker than that of the controls, and showed evidence of degeneration. The high glucose-cultured fibroblasts exhibited significantly higher levels of sorbitol, pro-inflammatory factors, and TGF-β1 compared to the low glucose-cultured cells, and these levels were dose-dependently reduced by treatment with the aldose reductase inhibitor. Taken together, our data suggests that increased sorbitol levels in the LF of diabetic patients results in increased production of pro-inflammatory and fibrogenic factor, which contribute to LF hypertrophy, and could increase the susceptibility of diabetic patients to LSCS. Furthermore, aldose reductase inhibition effectively reduced the levels of sorbitol and sorbitol-induced pro-inflammatory factor expression in high glucose-cultured fibroblasts. © 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

879,36734310,"In Japan, the increasing frequency of underweight among women of reproductive age and the accompanying increase in the rate of low birth weight (LBW) are social issues. The study aimed to establish a prospective registry system for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in Japan and to clarify the actual status of GDM according to the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria. Pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus and those in the normal glucose tolerance (NGT) group were enrolled in the Diabetes and Pregnancy Outcome for Mother and Baby study from October 2015. Pregnant women with positive glucose screening in early and mid-to-late pregnancy underwent a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test by gestational week 32. Gestational diabetes mellitus was diagnosed according to IADPSG criteria. Women with a positive glucose screening test at mid-to-late pregnancy but NGT were enrolled as references (NGT group). Treatment for gestational diabetes mellitus and maternal and neonatal pregnancy data were prospectively collected on outcomes. In total 1,795 singleton pregnancies (878 women with GDM and 824 NGT women) were analyzed. The risk of LBW and small-for-gestational age in the GDM group was significantly higher than in the NGT group. A similar relationship was found for LBW risk in the non-overweight/obese group but not in the overweight/obese group. We established a prospective GDM registry system in Japan. In the management of GDM in Japan, suppression of maternal weight gain may be associated with reduced fetal growth, especially in non-overweight/obese women with GDM; however, further investigation is required.

880,37649072,"Endometriosis is associated with systemic metabolic indicators, including body mass index (BMI), glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism, while the association between metabolic indexes and the occurrence and assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcome of endometriosis is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the characteristics of systemic metabolic indexes of endometriosis patients with infertility and their effects on pregnancy outcome after ART treatment. A retrospective cohort study involve 412 endometriosis patients and 1551 controls was conducted. Primary outcome was metabolic indexes, and secondary measures consisted of the influence of metabolic indexes on the number of retrieved oocytes and ART outcomes. Endometriosis patients had higher insulin (INS) [6.90(5.10-9.50) vs 6.50(4.80-8.90) μU/mL, P = 0.005]. A prediction model for endometriosis combining the number of previous pregnancies, CA125, fasting blood glucose (Glu) and INS, had a sensitivity of 73.9%, specificity of 67.8% and area under curve (AUC) of 0.77. There were no significant differences in ART outcomes and complications during pregnancy. The serum levels of Glu before pregnancy were associated with GDM both in endometriosis group (aOR 12.95, 95% CI 1.69-99.42, P = 0.014) and in control group (aOR 4.15, 95% CI 1.50-11.53, P = 0.006). We found serum Glu is related to the number of retrieved oocytes in control group, serum INS is related to the number of retrieved oocytes in endometriosis group, while serum Glu and INS before pregnancy are related to the occurrence of GDM in two groups. A prediction model based on metabolic indexes was established, representing a promising non-invasive method to predict endometriosis patients with known pregnancy history. "
881,26404120,"Recently, natural d-glucose was suggested as a potential biodegradable contrast agent. The feasibility of using d-glucose for dynamic perfusion imaging was explored to detect malignant brain tumors based on blood brain barrier breakdown. Mice were inoculated orthotopically with human U87-EGFRvIII glioma cells. Time-resolved glucose signal changes were detected using chemical exchange saturation transfer (glucoCEST) MRI. Dynamic glucose enhanced (DGE) MRI was used to measure tissue response to an intravenous bolus of d-glucose. DGE images of mouse brains bearing human glioma showed two times higher and persistent changes in tumor compared with contralateral brain. Area-under-curve (AUC) analysis of DGE delineated blood vessels and tumor and had contrast comparable to the AUC determined using dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI with GdDTPA, both showing a significantly higher AUC in tumor than in brain (P < 0.005). Both CEST and relaxation effects contribute to the signal change. DGE MRI is a feasible technique for studying brain tumor enhancement reflecting differences in tumor blood volume and permeability with respect to normal brain. We expect DGE will provide a low-risk and less expensive alternative to DCE MRI for imaging cancer in vulnerable populations, such as children and patients with renal impairment. "
882,26934145,"Metabolic alterations after burn injury have been well described in children; however, in adult patients, glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity are essentially unknown. We sought to characterize metabolic alterations and insulin resistance after burn injury and determine their magnitude and persistence at discharge. Prospective, cohort study. Tertiary burn centre. Nondiabetic adults with an acute burn involving greater than or equal to 20% total body surface area. An oral glucose tolerance test was administered at discharge. Glucose, insulin, and C-peptide levels were measured to derive surrogate measures of insulin resistance and β-cell function, including quantitative insulin sensitivity check index, homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function, homeostasis model assessment of insulin sensitivity, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and the composite whole-body insulin sensitivity index. Patients were grouped according to the degree of glucose tolerance: normal glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose/impaired glucose tolerance, or diabetes. Forty-five adults, 44 ± 15 years old and with 38% ± 14% total body surface area burned, underwent an oral glucose tolerance test at discharge. Median quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (0.348 [0.332-0.375]) and median homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (1.13 [0.69-1.45]) were abnormal, indicating insulin resistance and impaired insulin production at discharge. Two-thirds of patients (n = 28) met criteria for impaired fasting glucose/impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes. We have demonstrated that burn-injured adults remain hyperglycemic, are insulin resistant, and express defects in insulin secretion at discharge. Patients with lower burn severity (total body surface area, 20-30%) express similar metabolic alterations as patients with larger burns (total body surface area, ≥ 30%). Glucose tolerance testing at discharge offers an opportunity for early identification of burn patients who may be at high risk of prediabetes and diabetes. Our findings demonstrated that two-thirds of burn patients had some degree of glucose intolerance. With this in mind, surveillance of glucose intolerance post discharge should be considered. As hyperglycemia and insulin resistance are associated with poor outcomes, studies should focus on how long these profound alterations persist. "
883,35076697,"We evaluated blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) profiles in a subset of adults with type 1 diabetes from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC) study to characterize the frequency of glycemic excursions and contributing factors. CGM-derived metrics were compared for daytime and nighttime periods using blinded CGM for a minimum of 6.5 days (average 11.9 days) and correlated with HbA1c levels, routine use of diabetes devices, and other characteristics in 765 participants. Participants were 58.9 ± 6.5 years of age with diabetes duration 36.8 ± 4.9 years and HbA1c 7.8 ± 1.2%; 58% used insulin pumps, and 27% used personal, unblinded CGM. Compared with daytime, nighttime mean sensor glucose was lower, percent time in range 70-180 mg/dL (TIR) was similar, and hypoglycemia was more common. Over the entire recording period, only 9% of the 765 participants achieved >70% TIR and only 28% achieved <1% of observations of <54 mg/dL. Indeed, participants with the highest percentage of hypoglycemia had the lowest HbA1c levels. However, use of insulin pumps and CGM decreased the percent time at <54 mg/dL. In adults with long-standing type 1 diabetes, short-term blinded CGM profiles revealed frequent clinically significant hypoglycemia (<54 mg/dL) during the night and more time in hyperglycemia during the day. The small subset of participants using routine CGM and insulin pumps had fewer hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic excursions and lower HbA1c levels. Thus, strategies to lower meal-stimulated hyperglycemia during the day and prevent hypoglycemia at night are relevant clinical goals in older patients with type 1 diabetes. "
884,37653041,"In the tumor microenvironment, adipocytes function as an alternate fuel source for cancer cells. However, whether adipocytes influence macromolecular biosynthesis in cancer cells is unknown. Here we systematically characterized the bidirectional interaction between primary human adipocytes and ovarian cancer (OvCa) cells using multi-platform metabolomics, imaging mass spectrometry, isotope tracing and gene expression analysis. We report that, in OvCa cells co-cultured with adipocytes and in metastatic tumors, a part of the glucose from glycolysis is utilized for the biosynthesis of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P). Normoxic HIF1α protein regulates the altered flow of glucose-derived carbons in cancer cells, resulting in increased glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerol synthesis. The knockdown of HIF1α or G3P acyltransferase 3 (a regulatory enzyme of glycerophospholipid synthesis) reduced metastasis in xenograft models of OvCa. In summary, we show that, in an adipose-rich tumor microenvironment, cancer cells generate G3P as a precursor for critical membrane and signaling components, thereby promoting metastasis. Targeting biosynthetic processes specific to adipose-rich tumor microenvironments might be an effective strategy against metastasis. "
885,22107955,"GnRH is the main regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (H-P-G) axis. GnRH stimulates the pituitary gonadotroph to synthesize and secrete gonadotrophins (LH and FSH), and this effect of GnRH is dependent on the availability of glucose and other nutrients. Little is known about whether GnRH regulates glucose metabolism in the gonadotroph. This study examined the regulation of glucose transporters (Gluts) by GnRH in the LβT2 gonadotroph cell line. Using real-time PCR analysis, the expression of Glut1, -2, -4, and -8 was detected, but Glut1 mRNA expression level was more abundant than the mRNA expression levels of Glut2, -4, and -8. After the treatment of LβT2 cells with GnRH, Glut1 mRNA expression was markedly induced, but there was no GnRH-induction of Glut2, -4, or -8 mRNA expression in LβT2 cells. The effect of GnRH on Glut1 mRNA expression is partly mediated by ERK activation. GnRH increased GLUT1 protein and stimulated GLUT1 translocation to the cell surface of LβT2 cells. Glucose uptake assays were performed in LβT2 cells and showed that GnRH stimulates glucose uptake in the gonadotroph. Finally, exogenous treatment of mice with GnRH increased the expression of Glut1 but not the expression of Glut2, -4, or -8 in the pituitary. Therefore, regulation of glucose metabolism by GnRH via changes in Gluts expression and subcellular location in the pituitary gonadotroph reveals a novel response of the gonadotroph to GnRH. "
886,17848637,"In skeletal muscle of adults, sepsis reduces protein synthesis by depressing translation initiation and induces resistance to branched-chain amino acid stimulation. Normal neonates maintain a high basal muscle protein synthesis rate that is sensitive to amino acid stimulation. In the present study, we determined the effect of amino acids on protein synthesis in skeletal muscle and other tissues in septic neonates. Overnight-fasted neonatal pigs were infused with endotoxin (LPS, 0 and 10 microg.kg(-1).h(-1)), whereas glucose and insulin were maintained at fasting levels; amino acids were clamped at fasting or fed levels. In the presence of fasting insulin and amino acids, LPS reduced protein synthesis in longissimus dorsi (LD) and gastrocnemius muscles and increased protein synthesis in the diaphragm, but had no effect in masseter and heart muscles. Increasing amino acids to fed levels accelerated muscle protein synthesis in LD, gastrocnemius, masseter, and diaphragm. LPS stimulated protein synthesis in liver, lung, spleen, pancreas, and kidney in fasted animals. Raising amino acids to fed levels increased protein synthesis in liver of controls, but not LPS-treated animals. The increase in muscle protein synthesis in response to amino acids was associated with increased mTOR, 4E-BP1, and S6K1 phosphorylation and eIF4G-eIF4E association in control and LPS-infused animals. These findings suggest that amino acids stimulate skeletal muscle protein synthesis during acute endotoxemia via mTOR-dependent ribosomal assembly despite reduced basal protein synthesis rates in neonatal pigs. However, provision of amino acids does not further enhance the LPS-induced increase in liver protein synthesis. "
887,32799841,"Preterm infants born 30 to 33 weeks' gestation often require early support with intravenous fluids because of respiratory distress, hypoglycemia or feed intolerance. When full feeds are anticipated to be reached within the first week, risks associated with intravenous delivery mode and type must be carefully considered. Recommendations are for parenteral nutrition to be infused via central venous lines (because of the high osmolarity), however, given the risks associated with central lines, clinicians may opt for 10% glucose via peripheral venous catheter when the need is short-term. We therefore compare a low osmolarity peripheral intravenous parenteral nutrition (P-PN) solution with peripheral intravenous 10% glucose on growth rate in preterm infants born 30 to 33 weeks' gestation. In this parallel group, single centre, superiority, non-blinded, randomised controlled trial, 92 (P-PN 42, control 50) infants born 30 The rate of weight gain was significantly increased in P-PN infants compared with control (P-PN, n = 42, 18.7, SD 6.6 g/d vs control, n = 50, 14.8, SD 6.0 g/d; adjusted mean difference 3.9 g/d, 95% CI 1.3 to 6.6; P = 0.004), with the effect maintained to discharge home. Days to regain birthweight were significantly reduced and length gain significantly increased in P-PN infants. One infant in the P-PN group had a stage 3 extravasation which rapidly resolved. Blood urea nitrogen and triglyceride levels were significantly higher in the P-PN group in the first week of life, but there were no instances of abnormally high levels. There were no significant differences in any other clinical or biochemical outcomes.

888,32744096,"The objective of this study was to investigate whether juvenile Iberian pigs with diet-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cholestasis, and gut dysbiosis would develop histological and metabolic markers of neurodegeneration in the frontal cortex (FC) and whether supplementing probiotics would influence the response to the diet. Twenty-eight juvenile Iberian pigs were fed for 10 wk either a control (CON) or high-fructose high-fat (HFF) diet with or without a commercial probiotic mixture. Compared with CON, HFF-fed pigs had a decreased number of neurons and an increase in reactive astrocytes in FC tissue. There was also a decrease in one-carbon metabolites choline and betaine and a marked accumulation of bile acids, cholesteryl esters, and polyol pathway intermediates in FC of HFF-fed pigs, which were associated with markers of neurodegeneration and accentuated with the severity of NAFLD. Betaine depletion in FC tissue was negatively correlated with choline-derived phospholipids in colon content, whereas primary conjugated bile acids in FC were associated with cholestasis. Plasma kynurenine-to-tryptophan quotient, as a marker of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity, and intestinal dysbiosis were also correlated with neuronal loss and astrogliosis. Recognition memory test and FC levels of amyloid-β and phosphorylated Tau did not differ between diets, whereas probiotics increased amyloid-β and memory loss in HFF-fed pigs. In conclusion, our results show evidence of neurodegeneration in FC of juvenile Iberian pigs and establish a novel pediatric model to investigate the role of gut-liver-brain axis in diet-induced NAFLD.

Reduced wheel running occurs when mice are fed a high-fat diet but is normalized when mice consume standard chow. The two phenotypes are due to altered output from different IMP2 client mRNAs. The reduced fiber size of IMP2-deficient muscle is attributable, in part, to diminished autocrine Igf2 production; basal tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin and IGF1 receptors is diminished, and Akt1 activation is selectively reduced. Gsk3α is disinhibited, and S536-phosphorylated ε subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2B [eIF2Bε(S536)] is hyperphosphorylated. Protein synthesis is reduced despite unaltered mTOR complex 1 activity. The diet-dependent reduction in voluntary exercise is likely due to altered muscle metabolism, as contractile function is normal. IMP2-deficient muscle exhibits reduced fatty acid oxidation, due to a reduced abundance of mRNA of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), an IMP2 client, and PPARα protein. IMP2-deficient muscle fibers treated with a mitochondrial uncoupler to increase electron flux, as occurs with exercise, exhibit reduced oxygen consumption from fatty acids, with higher oxygen consumption from glucose. The greater dependence on muscle glucose metabolism during increased oxygen demand may promote central fatigue and thereby diminish voluntary activity. "
890,33972006,"Recent studies implicate maternal gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in differential methylation of infant DNA. Folate and vitamin B12 play a role in DNA methylation, and these vitamins may also influence GDM risk. The aims of this study were to determine folate and vitamin B12 status in obese pregnant women and investigate associations between folate and vitamin B12 status, maternal dysglycaemia and neonatal DNA methylation at cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites previously observed to be associated with dysglycaemia. Obese pregnant women who participated in the UK Pregnancies Better Eating and Activity Trial were included. Serum folate and vitamin B12 were measured at the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) visit. Cord blood DNA methylation was assessed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. Regression models with adjustment for confounders were used to examine associations. Of the 951 women included, 356 (37.4%) were vitamin B12 deficient, and 44 (4.6%) were folate deficient. Two-hundred and seventy-one women (28%) developed GDM. Folate and vitamin B12 concentrations were not associated with neonatal DNA methylation. Higher folate was positively associated with 1-h plasma glucose after OGTT (β = 0.031, 95% CI 0.001-0.061, p = 0.045). There was no relationship between vitamin B12 and glucose concentrations post OGTT or between folate or vitamin B12 and GDM. In summary, we found no evidence to link folate and vitamin B12 status with the differential methylation of neonatal DNA previously observed in association with dysglycaemia. We add to the evidence that folate status may be related to maternal glucose homoeostasis although replication in other maternal cohorts is required for validation. "
891,35819160,"The number of patients with diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) continues to increase, but available treatments are limited. This study aimed to examine the influence of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP)-NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)- N -methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor 2B (NR2B) pathway on type 2 DNP. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with a high-fat and high-sugar diet for 8 weeks. Then, rats were intraperitoneally injected with streptozotocin (STZ, 35 mg/kg) to induce type 2 diabetes mellitus in rats. Diabetic rats with <85% of their basic levels in mechanical withdrawal threshold and thermal withdrawal latency were classified as DNP rats on day 14 after STZ injection. DNP rats were treated with ROS scavenger N-tert-Butyl-α-phenylnitrone (PBN, 100 mg·kg -1 ·d -1 ) or TXNIP small interfering ribonucleic acid (10 μg/d) once daily for 14 days. The level of ROS, protein levels of NLRP3, TXNIP, cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinase-1 (caspase-1), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), NR2B phosphorylation at Tyr1472 (p-NR2B), total NR2B (t-NR2B), and distribution of NLRP3 in the spinal cord were examined. In vitro experiments, BV2 cells and PC12 cells were individually cultured and cocultured in a high-glucose environment (35 mmol/L D-glucose). The level of ROS and protein levels of NLRP3, TXNIP, caspase-1, and IL-1β in BV2 cells, and p-NR2B, t-NR2B in PC12 cells were detected. The level of ROS was detected by the flow cytometry approach. The protein levels were detected by the Western blot technique. The location of NLRP3 was observed by immunofluorescent staining. The interaction between TXNIP and NLRP3 was detected by coimmunoprecipitation assay. The level of spinal ROS increased in DNP rats. The mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia of DNP rats were alleviated after systemic administration of PBN. This administration decreased protein levels of NLRP3, TXNIP, caspase-1, IL-1β, and p-NR2B and the coupling of TXNIP to NLRP3 in spinal cords of DNP rats. Furthermore, knockdown of spinal TXNIP alleviated nociceptive hypersensitivity and decreased protein levels of NLRP3, TXNIP, caspase-1, IL-1β, and p-NR2B in DNP rats. The level of ROS and protein levels of NLRP3, TXNIP, caspase-1, IL-1β, the coupling of TXNIP to NLRP3, and the IL-1β secretion increased in BV2 cells, and the protein expression of p-NR2B increased in cocultured PC12 cells in a high-glucose environment. All of these in vitro effects were significantly blocked after treatment of PBN. Our findings suggest that spinal ROS can contribute to type 2 DNP through TXNIP-NLRP3-NR2B pathway. "
892,27482817,"Primary cilia extend from the plasma membrane of most vertebrate cells and mediate signaling pathways. Ciliary dysfunction underlies ciliopathies, which are genetic syndromes that manifest multiple clinical features, including renal cystic disease and obesity. THM1 (also termed TTC21B or IFT139) encodes a component of the intraflagellar transport-A complex and mutations in THM1 have been identified in 5% of individuals with ciliopathies. Consistent with this, deletion of murine Thm1 during late embryonic development results in cystic kidney disease. Here, we report that deletion of murine Thm1 during adulthood results in obesity, diabetes, hypertension and fatty liver disease, with gender differences in susceptibility to weight gain and metabolic dysfunction. Pair-feeding of Thm1 conditional knock-out mice relative to control littermates prevented the obesity and related disorders, indicating that hyperphagia caused the obese phenotype. Thm1 ablation resulted in increased localization of adenylyl cyclase III in primary cilia that were shortened, with bulbous distal tips on neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, an integrative center for signals that regulate feeding and activity. In pre-obese Thm1 conditional knock-out mice, expression of anorexogenic pro-opiomelanocortin (Pomc) was decreased by 50% in the arcuate nucleus, which likely caused the hyperphagia. Fasting of Thm1 conditional knock-out mice did not alter Pomc nor orexogenic agouti-related neuropeptide (Agrp) expression, suggesting impaired sensing of changes in peripheral signals. Together, these data indicate that the Thm1-mutant ciliary defect diminishes sensitivity to feeding signals, which alters appetite regulation and leads to hyperphagia, obesity and metabolic disease.

893,16636305,"Developmental changes in ovine myocardial glucose transporters and insulin signaling following hyperthermia-induced intrauterine fetal growth restriction (IUGR) were the focus of our study. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that the fetal ovine myocardium adapts during an IUGR gestation by increasing glucose transporter protein expression, plasma membrane-bound glucose transporter protein concentrations, and insulin signal transduction protein concentrations. Growth measurements and whole heart tissue were obtained at 55 days gestational age (dGA), 90 dGA, and 135 dGA (term = 145 dGA) in fetuses from control (C) and hyperthermic (HT) pregnant sheep. Additionally, in 135 dGA animals, arterial blood was obtained and Doppler ultrasound was used to determine umbilical artery systolic (S) and diastolic (D) flow velocity waveform profiles to calculate pulsatility (S - D/mean) and resistance (S - D/S) indices. Myocardial Glut-1, Glut-4, insulin signal transduction proteins involved in Glut-4 translocation, and glycogen content were measured. Compared to age-matched controls, HT 90-dGA fetal body weights and HT 135-dGA fetal weights and gross heart weights were lower. Heart weights as a percent of body weights were similar between C and HT sheep at 135 dGA. HT 135-dGA animals had (i) lower fetal arterial plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, (ii) lower arterial blood oxygen content and higher plasma lactate concentrations, (iii) higher myocardial Glut-4 plasma membrane (PM) protein and insulin receptor beta protein (IRbeta ) concentrations, (iv) higher myocardial glycogen content, and (v) higher umbilical artery Doppler pulsatility and resistance indices. The HT ovine fetal myocardium adapts to reduced circulating glucose and insulin concentrations by increasing plasma membrane Glut-4 and IRbeta protein concentrations. The increased myocardial Glut-4 PM and IRbeta protein concentrations likely contribute to or increase the intracellular delivery of glucose and, together with the increased lactate concentrations, enhance glycogen synthesis, which allows for maintained myocardial growth commensurate with fetal body growth.

894,38936927,"This study examined the effects of tocotrienols (TT) in conjunction with statin on glucose homeostasis, bone microstructure, gut microbiome, and systemic and liver inflammatory markers in obese C57BL/6J mice. Forty male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and assigned into four groups in a 2 (no statin vs. 120 mg statin/kg diet)×2 (no TT vs. 400 mg TT/kg diet) factorial design for 14 weeks. Statin and TT improved glucose tolerance only when each was given alone, and only statin supplementation decreased insulin resistance. Consistently, only statin supplementation decreased serum insulin levels and HOMA-IR. Pancreatic insulin was also increased with statin treatment. Statin and TT, alone or in combination, reduced the levels of serum IL-6, but only TT attenuated the increased serum leptin levels induced by a HFD. Statin supplementation increased bone area/total area and connectivity density at LV-4, while TT supplementation increased bone area/total area and trabecular number, but decreased trabecular separation at the distal femur. Statin supplementation, but not TT, reduced hepatic inflammatory cytokine gene expression. Neither TT supplementation nor statin supplementation statistically altered microbiome species evenness or richness. However, they altered the relative abundance of certain microbiome species. Most notably, both TT and statin supplementation increased the relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae UCG-006. TT and statin collectively benefit bone microstructure, glucose homeostasis, and microbial ecology in obese mice. Such changes may be, in part, associated with suppression of inflammation in the host. "
895,32946754,"Vagal afferent neuron (VAN) signaling sends information from the gut to the brain and is fundamental in the control of feeding behavior and metabolism [1]. Recent findings reveal that VAN signaling also plays a critical role in cognitive processes, including affective motivational behaviors and hippocampus (HPC)-dependent memory [2-5]. VANs, located in nodose ganglia, express receptors for various gut-derived peptide signals; however, the function of these receptors with regard to feeding behavior, metabolism, and memory control is poorly understood. We hypothesized that VAN-mediated processes are influenced by ghrelin, a stomach-derived orexigenic hormone, via communication to its receptor (GHSR) expressed on gut-innervating VANs. To examine this hypothesis, rats received nodose ganglia injections of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing short hairpin RNAs targeting GHSR (or a control AAV) for RNAi-mediated VAN-specific GHSR knockdown. Results reveal that VAN GHSR knockdown induced various feeding and metabolic disturbances, including increased meal frequency, impaired glucose tolerance, delayed gastric emptying, and increased body weight compared to controls. Additionally, VAN-specific GHSR knockdown impaired HPC-dependent contextual episodic memory and reduced HPC brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression, but did not affect anxiety-like behavior or general activity levels. A functional role for endogenous VAN GHSR signaling was further confirmed by results revealing that VAN signaling is required for the hyperphagic effects of ghrelin administered at dark onset, and that gut-restricted ghrelin-induced increases in VAN firing rate require intact VAN GHSR expression. Collective results reveal that VAN GHSR signaling is required for both normal feeding and metabolic function as well as HPC-dependent memory. "
896,31274599,"It is currently unknown whether acute exposure to n3 fatty acid-containing fish oil-based lipid emulsion Omegaven as opposed to the n6 fatty acid-containing soybean oil-based lipid emulsion Intralipid is more favorable in terms of insulin signaling and glucose uptake in the intact beating heart. Sprague-Dawley rat hearts were perfused in the working mode for 90 minutes in the presence of 11 mM glucose and 1.2 mM palmitate bound to albumin, the first 30 minutes without insulin followed by 60 minutes with insulin (50 mU/L). Hearts were randomly allocated to 100 µM Intralipid, 100 µM Omegaven, or no emulsion (insulin treatment alone) for 60 minutes. Glycolysis and glycogen synthesis were measured with the radioactive tracer [5-H]glucose, and glucose uptake was calculated. Phosphorylation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), protein kinase Akt, and phosphofructokinase (PFK)-2 was measured by immunoblotting. Glycolytic metabolites were determined by enzymatic assays. Mass spectrometry was used to establish acylcarnitine profiles. Nuclear factor κB (NFκB) nuclear translocation served as reactive oxygen species (ROS) biosensor. Insulin-mediated glucose uptake was decreased by Intralipid (4.9 ± 0.4 vs 3.7 ± 0.3 μmol/gram dry heart weight [gdw]·min; P = .047) due to both reduced glycolysis and glycogen synthesis. In contrast, Omegaven treatment did not affect insulin-mediated glycolysis or glycogen synthesis and thus preserved glucose uptake (5.1 ± 0.3 vs 4.9 ± 0.4 μmol/gdw·min; P = .94). While Intralipid did not affect PP2A phosphorylation status, Omegaven resulted in significantly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation and inhibition of PP2A. This was accompanied by increased selective threonine phosphorylation of Akt and the downstream target PFK-2 at S483. PFK-1 activity was increased when compared with Intralipid as measured by the ratio of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate (Omegaven 0.60 ± 0.11 versus Intralipid 0.47 ± 0.09; P = .023), consistent with increased formation of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate by PFK2, its main allosteric activator. Omegaven lead to accumulation of acylcarnitines and fostered a prooxidant response as evidenced by NFκB nuclear translocation and activation. Omegaven as opposed to Intralipid preserves glucose uptake via the PP2A-Akt-PFK pathway in intact beating hearts. n3 fatty acids decelerate β-oxidation causing accumulation of acylcarnitine species and a prooxidant response, which likely inhibits redox-sensitive PP2A and thus preserves insulin signaling and glucose uptake.

897,24875857,"Macroautophagy (autophagy hereafter) recycles intracellular components to sustain mitochondrial metabolism that promotes the growth, stress tolerance, and malignancy of lung cancers, suggesting that autophagy inhibition may have antitumor activity. To assess the functional significance of autophagy in both normal and tumor tissue, we conditionally deleted the essential autophagy gene, autophagy related 7 (Atg7), throughout adult mice. Here, we report that systemic ATG7 ablation caused susceptibility to infection and neurodegeneration that limited survival to 2 to 3 months. Moreover, upon fasting, autophagy-deficient mice suffered fatal hypoglycemia. Prior autophagy ablation did not alter the efficiency of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) initiation by activation of oncogenic Kras(G12D) and deletion of the Trp53 tumor suppressor. Acute autophagy ablation in mice with preexisting NSCLC, however, blocked tumor growth, promoted tumor cell death, and generated more benign disease (oncocytomas). This antitumor activity occurred before destruction of normal tissues, suggesting that acute autophagy inhibition may be therapeutically beneficial in cancer. We systemically ablated cellular self-cannibalization by autophagy in adult mice and determined that it is dispensable for short-term survival, but required to prevent fatal hypoglycemia and cachexia during fasting, delineating a new role for autophagy in metabolism. Importantly, acute, systemic autophagy ablation was selectively destructive to established tumors compared with normal tissues, thereby providing the preclinical evidence that strategies to inhibit autophagy may be therapeutically advantageous for RAS-driven cancers.

898,26626483,"Eukaryotes initiate autophagy to cope with the lack of external nutrients, which requires the activation of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1). However, the mechanisms underlying the starvation-induced Sirt1 activation for autophagy initiation remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a conventional glycolytic enzyme, is a critical mediator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-driven Sirt1 activation. Under glucose starvation, but not amino acid starvation, cytoplasmic GAPDH is phosphorylated on Ser122 by activated AMPK. This causes GAPDH to redistribute into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, GAPDH interacts directly with Sirt1, displacing Sirt1's repressor and causing Sirt1 to become activated. Preventing this shift of GAPDH abolishes Sirt1 activation and autophagy, while enhancing it, through overexpression of nuclear-localized GAPDH, increases Sirt1 activation and autophagy. GAPDH is thus a pivotal and central regulator of autophagy under glucose deficiency, undergoing AMPK-dependent phosphorylation and nuclear translocation to activate Sirt1 deacetylase activity. "
899,8230075,"This study aimed at assessing qualitatively and quantitatively the ability of Nigerian mothers to prepare salt-sugar solutions (SSS) (according to the Nigerian standard formula) under the usual home environment. Mothers were provided with the ingredients but not with measurement spoons nor containers. 274 mothers randomly selected from a peri-urban community participated in the study. Of the 192 (70.1%) who claimed knowledge on SSS preparation, only 47 (24.5%) gave a correct description of its constitution and 103 (54.2%) were willing to prepare the solution. Of the 103 who prepared the solution, 34 (33.0%) used the correct number of teaspoons of salt and of sugar. The composition of the solutions prepared by the mothers varied greatly with sodium levels ranging from 0-760 mmols/l (mean 225.8 +/- 155.3, median 177.3) and glucose, 0-262.6 mmols/l (mean 68.7 +/- 54.4, median 52.0). Only 7 mothers (6.8%) prepared solutions with acceptable sodium and glucose levels. It is concluded that salt-sugar solutions prepared by Nigerian mothers are not safe. There is a great need to review the oral rehydration therapy (ORT) promotion strategies and messages in order to avoid the dangers associated with improperly constituted solutions. In June-August 1989, in Nigeria, the College of Medicine at the University of Lagos conducted qualitative and quantitative assessments to determine mothers' ability to make salt-sugar solutions (SSS) under typical home conditions to manage diarrhea in their children. 234 (85.4%) of the 274 mothers knew about oral rehydration therapy (ORT) and 192 (70.1%) said that they knew how to prepare SSS. Just 47 (24.5%) of the mothers who knew the recipe for and how to prepare SSS could actually describe the correct recipe. Only 103 (37.1%) of the mothers claiming to know the recipe were willing to prepare SSS. Just 34 (33%) of these mothers used the right number of teaspoons of salt and sugar to prepare SSS. Most mothers (92.2%) used the correct amount of water (600 ml equal to the volume of 1 standard beer bottle or 2 bottles of soft drink). Considerable variability occurred in both the sodium and glucose levels of the SSS prepared by mothers (range = 0-760 mmols/l, mean = 225.8 mmols/l, median = 177.3 mmols/l, and range = 0-262.6 mmols.l, mean = 68.7 mmols/l, median = 52 mmols/l, respectively). High sodium content ( 100 mmols/l) and low glucose content ( 50 mmols/l) were the norm for SSS that mothers prepared (92% and 49.5%, respectively). Just 7 (6.8%) of the mothers made SSS within the acceptable range for sodium and glucose. These findings showed that SSS prepared at home in Nigeria is dangerous, indicating a need to reexamine ORT promotion strategies and messages to prevent the risks linked to incorrectly prepared solutions. The Nigerian Federal Ministry of Health could also target ORT messages to primary school pupils and teachers to expand SSS knowledge and correct preparation. Standard plastic measurement cups clearly marked and indicating salt and sugar levels could help achieve compliance. "
900,38798015,"The rise in asthma has been linked to different environmental and lifestyle factors including dietary habits. Whether dietary salt contributes to asthma incidence, remains controversial. We aimed to investigate the impact of higher salt intake on asthma incidence in humans and to evaluate underlying mechanisms using mouse models. Epidemiological research was conducted using the UK Biobank Resource. Data were obtained from 42,976 participants with a history of allergies. 24-h sodium excretion was estimated from spot urine, and its association with asthma incidence was assessed by Cox regression, adjusting for relevant covariates. For mechanistic studies, a mouse model of mite-induced allergic airway inflammation (AAI) fed with high-salt diet (HSD) or normal-salt chow was used to characterize disease development. The microbiome of lung and feces (as proxy for gut) was analyzed via 16S rRNA gene based metabarcoding approach. In humans, urinary sodium excretion was directly associated with asthma incidence among females but not among males. HSD-fed female mice displayed an aggravated AAI characterized by increased levels of total IgE, a T High dietary salt consumption correlates with asthma incidence in female adults with a history of allergies. Female mice revealed HSD-induced T-cell lung profiles accompanied by alterations of gut and lung microbiome. "
901,34853027,"We assessed whether Index60, a composite measure of fasting C-peptide, 60-min C-peptide, and 60-min glucose, could improve the metabolic staging of type 1 diabetes for progression to clinical disease (stage 3) among autoantibody-positive (Ab+) individuals with normal 2-h glucose values (<140 mg/dL). We analyzed 3,058 Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet Pathway to Prevention participants with 2-h glucose <140 mg/dL and Index60 <1.00 values from baseline oral glucose tolerance tests. Characteristics associated with type 1 diabetes (younger age, greater Ab+, higher HLA DR3-DQ2/DR4-DQ8 prevalence, and lower C-peptide) were compared among four mutually exclusive groups: top 2-h glucose quartile only (HI-2HGLU), top Index60 quartile only (HI-IND60), both top quartiles (HI-BOTH), and neither top quartile (LO-BOTH). Additionally, within the 2-h glucose distribution of <140 mg/dL and separately within the Index60 <1.00 distribution, comparisons were made between those above or below the medians. HI-IND60 and HI-BOTH were younger, with greater frequency of more than two Ab+, and lower C-peptide levels, than either HI-2HGLU or LO-BOTH (all P < 0.001). The cumulative incidence for stage 3 was greater for HI-IND60 and HI-BOTH than for either HI-2HGLU or LO-BOTH (all P < 0.001). Those with Index60 values above the median were younger and had higher frequency of two or more Ab+ (P < 0.001) and DR3-DQ2/DR4-DQ8 prevalence (P < 0.001) and lower area under the curve (AUC) C-peptide levels (P < 0.001) than those below. Those above the 2-h glucose median had higher AUC C-peptide levels (P < 0.001), but otherwise did not differ from those below. Index60 identifies individuals with characteristics of type 1 diabetes at appreciable risk for progression who would otherwise be missed by 2-h glucose staging criteria. "
902,25453769,"Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is one of the foremost neurological conditions leading to long-term abnormalities in premature infants. Since it is difficult to prevent initiation of this damage in utero, promoting the innate regenerative potential of the brain after birth may provide a more feasible, prospective therapy for PVL. Treatment with UDP-glucose (UDPG), an endogenous agonist of G protein-coupled receptor 17 (GPR17) that may enhance endogenous self-repair potentiality, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a neurotrophic factor associated with the growth and survival of nerve cells, and memantine, a noncompetitive antagonist of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors that block ischemia-induced glutamate signal transduction, has been reported to achieve functional, neurological improvement in neonatal rats with PVL. The aim of the present study was to further explore whether UDPG, GDNF and/or memantine could promote corresponding self-repair of the subventricular zone (SVZ) and white matter (WM) in neonatal rats with ischemia-induced PVL. SVZ or WM tissue samples and cultured glial progenitor cells derived from a 5 day-old neonatal rat model of PVL were utilized for studying response to UDPG, GDNF and memantine in vivo and in vitro, respectively. Labeling with 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine and immunofluorescent cell lineage markers after hypoxia-ischemia or oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) revealed that UDPG, GDNF and memantine each significantly increased glial progenitor cells and preoligodendrocytes (preOLs), as well as more differentiated immature and mature oligodendrocyte (OL), in both the SVZ and WM in vivo or in vitro. SVZ and WM glial cell apoptosis was also significantly reduced by UDPG, GDNF or memantine, both in vivo and in vitro. These results indicated that UDPG, GDNF or memantine may promote endogenous self-repair by stimulating proliferation of glial progenitor cells derived from both the SVZ and WM, activating their differentiation into more mature OLs, and raising the survival rate of these newly generated glial cells in neonatal rats with ischemic PVL.

903,36941464,"Long-non-coding RNA PVT1 (lncRNA PVT1) can be used as an oncogenic regulatory non-coding RNA (ncRNA) for many cancers. However, its function and mechanism in breast cancer (BRCA) are still not clearly elucidated. We attempt to explain the mechanism of PVT1's role in breast cancer from different perspectives. We analyzed the expression of PVT1 and its correlation with the breast cancer related clinical data in the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We used PVT1 overexpression and knockdown lentivirus to infect breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell line for cell function verification, in vitro using CCK-8 to measure proliferation, flow cytometry to measure apoptosis, transwell test to measure invasion and migration ability, detecting cell extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) to assess glycolysis metabolism and explore the biological functions of PVT1 in breast cancer cells. Transcriptome sequencing was used to analyze the changes of related genes in cells after overexpression of PVT1. In vivo we used a xenograft model to study the effect of PVT1 on breast cancer. PVT1 was up-regulated in breast cancer tissues and was positively correlated with the clinical stage of breast cancer patients. Overexpression of PVT1 in vitro promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted tumor growth in vivo. Knockdown of PVT1 led to the opposite biological consequence. Further bioinformatics analysis showed that PVT1 changes the glycolysis metabolism of tumors through regulation of glycolysis-related genes. In addition, the expression of miR-145-5p is negatively correlated with PVT1. We consider the possibility of PVT1 promoting cell proliferation and metastasis by regulating the aerobic glucose metabolism in breast cancer cells through sponging the miR-145-5p. Our results reveal a potential pathway for competing endogenous RNA to regulate breast cancer glucose metabolism. PVT1 regulates glycolysis related genes expression by competitively binding to endogenous miR-145-5p in breast cancer cells to change the metabolic phenotype. This may Provide new ideas for precise molecular therapy targets for breast cancer. "
904,1984003,"Previously, using positron emission tomography (PET), we showed that local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (lCMRglc) in children undergo dynamic maturational trends before reaching adult values. In order to develop an animal model that can be used to explore the biological significance of the different segments of the lCMRglc maturational curve, we measured lCMRglc in kittens at various stages of postnatal development and in adult cats using quantitative [14C]2-deoxyglucose autoradiography. In the kitten, very low lCMRglc levels (0.14 to 0.53 mumol min-1 g-1) were seen during the first 15 days of life, with phylogenetically older brain regions being generally more metabolically mature than newer structures. After 15 days of age, many brain regions (particularly telencephalic structures) underwent sharp increases of lCMRglc to reach, or exceed, adult rates by 60 days. This developmental period (15 to 60 days) corresponds to the time of rapid synaptic proliferation known to occur in the cat. At 90 and 120 days, a slight decline in lCMRglc was observed, but this was followed by a second, larger peak occurring at about 180 days, when sexual maturation occurs in the cat. Only after 180 days did lCMRglc decrease to reach final adult values (0.21 to 2.04 mumol min-1 g-1). In general, there was good correlation between the metabolic maturation of various neuroanatomical regions and the emergence of behaviors mediated by the specific region. At least in the kitten visual cortex, which has been extensively studied with respect to developmental plasticity, the ""critical period"" corresponded to that portion of the lCMRglc maturational curve surrounding the 60-day metabolic peak. These normal maturational lCMRglc data will serve as baseline values with which to compare anatomical and metabolic plasticity changes induced by age-related lesions in the cat. "
905,9362355,"The relationship between the impairment in hepatic and renal function in cirrhosis has not been well established. This study investigated urinary sodium excretion in comparison with quantitative parameters of liver function in 75 patients with various degrees of cirrhosis kept on a constant salt diet of 120 mmol/d for 5 days before the start of the study. The aminopyrine breath test (ABT), indocyanine green (ICG) elimination, galactose elimination capacity (GEC), and hepatic sorbitol elimination (HSE) served as quantitative parameters of liver function. Results for the quantitative tests were compared with those for the Child-Pugh score. Urinary sodium excretion showed a significant nonlinear relationship to ABT (r = .70; P < .0001). Less-significant correlations were observed for ICG (r = .60), the Child-Pugh score (r = -.57), GEC (r = .44), and HSE (r = .34). Because a number of significant correlations were observed between the different liver function tests, multivariate analysis was used to further elucidate the relationship between hepatic function and sodium excretion. Only one independent predictor of urinary sodium excretion could be identified, and that was the ABT (P < .02). More than half of the nonascitic patients showed a urinary sodium excretion of less than 80% of dietary sodium intake, indicating impaired renal sodium handling in preascitic cirrhosis. Based on the 95% confidence interval (CI) for ABT of nonascitic patients with normal (mean ABT 0.56% dose x kg/mmol CO2; 95% CI: 0.44 to 0.69) and reduced urinary sodium excretion (mean ABT 0.26% dose x kg/mmol CO2; 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.35), a threshold level of ABT of about 0.4 (% dose x kg/mmol CO2) for conservation of normal urinary sodium excretion in cirrhosis can be defined. This ABT value reflects an approximate 50% reduction in function compared with the mean of cirrhotic patients with normal liver and kidney function (0.81% dose x kg/mmol CO2). The presence of ascites was also associated with a reduction in ABT to below 0.4 (% dose x kg/mmol CO2), while, for all other parameters, either the cut-off point was close to the lower limit of normal or no cut-off level could be detected. In conclusion, the results of the present study provide further evidence that the impairment in urinary sodium excretion in cirrhosis is related to hepatic function. The data suggest a nonlinear relationship.

907,23769027,"Warm ischemia (WI)-related injury interferes with recovery of primary hepatocyte after collagenase digestion of surgically resected or non-heart-beating donor livers as human cell sources. We speculated that digestion is impaired due to reduced microcirculation, caused by microembolism after WI. We sought to improve hepatocyte recovery after WI using a rat model. Anesthetized 9-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a midline abdominal incision to insert a 22-gauge cannula into the portal vein. WI was initiated by ligating both the cannula and the hepatic artery. We compared Euro-Collins (EC) perfusion solution with 2 anticoagulants-heparin or citrate phosphate dextrose (CPD)-versus ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) combined with Ca(2+)- and Mg(2+)-free Hank's solution (CM-free Hank's solution). Use of CM-free Hank's solution yielded only 0.75 ± 0.15 × 10(8) and 0.82 ± 0.20 × 10(8) cells at 30 and 60 minutes WI respectively. However, CPD, but not heparin, added to the EC solution produced the best cell recovery (CPD: 2.15 ± 0.38 × 10(8); heparin: 1.63 ± 0.31 × 10(8)). During macroscopic observation, CPD added to EC solution also demonstrated best blood flushing. CPD added to EC solution achieved greater hepatocyte recovery than CM-free Hank's solution by restoring microcirculation during flushing of blood from liver tissue subjected to WI. "
908,24498035,"Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is associated with insulin resistance and diabetes, in particular after treatment in children and adults with pre-existing metabolic risk factors. Our aims were. i) to evaluate the effect on glucose metabolism of rhGH treatment and withdrawal in not confirmed GHD adolescents at the achievement of adult height; ii) to investigate the impact of GH receptor gene genomic deletion of exon 3 (d3GHR). We performed a longitudinal study (1 year) in a tertiary care center. 23 GHD adolescent were followed in the last year of rhGH treatment (T0), 6 (T6) and 12 (T12) months after rhGH withdrawal with fasting and post-OGTT evaluations. 40 healthy adolescents were used as controls. HOMA-IR, HOMA%β, insulinogenic (INS) and disposition (DI) indexes were calculated. GHR genotypes were determined by multiplex PCR. In the group as a whole, fasting insulin (p<0.05), HOMA-IR (p<0.05), insulin and glucose levels during OGTT (p<0.01) progressively decreased from T0 to T12 becoming similar to controls. During rhGH, a compensatory insulin secretion with a stable DI was recorded, and, then, HOMAβ and INS decreased at T6 and T12 (p<0.05). By evaluating the GHR genotype, nDel GHD showed a decrease from T0 to T12 in HOMA-IR, HOMAβ, INS (p<0.05) and DI. Del GHD showed a gradual increase in DI (p<0.05) and INS with a stable HOMA-IR and higher HDL-cholesterol (p<0.01). In not confirmed GHD adolescents the fasting deterioration in glucose homeostasis during rhGH is efficaciously coupled with a compensatory insulin secretion and activity at OGTT. The presence of at least one d3GHR allele is associated with lower glucose levels and higher HOMA-β and DI after rhGH withdrawal. Screening for the d3GHR in the pediatric age may help physicians to follow and phenotype GHD patients also by a metabolic point of view. "
909,14706055,"First-degree relatives of patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are often reported to be insulin resistant. We wanted to identify early metabolic abnormalities in this condition, and determine whether they are altered by regular physical training. We measured insulin sensitivity using the euglycaemic glucose clamp technique and insulin response to oral glucose in 10 unfit (did not participate in routine physical exercise) offspring of T2DM parents and 10 unfit control subjects, and compared them with six fit (routinely swam for 3 h/day 5 days/week) offspring of T2DM parents and six fit controls with no family history of T2DM. Unfit offspring had a higher plasma glucose response than the other three groups. The mean area under the glucose curve was also significantly higher in unfit offspring than in the other three groups (12.6 +/- 0.6 vs. 10.4 +/- 0.4, 9.6 +/- 0.5, and 9.5 +/- 0.7 mmol/l per hour for the unfit controls, fit offspring and fit controls, respectively; P < 0.05). The corresponding insulin response of unfit offspring was significantly higher at 60 min in the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) that that of fit offspring or fit controls. In addition, the mean area under the insulin curve was significantly greater in unfit offspring than in either fit offspring or fit controls (868 +/- 172 vs. 294 +/- 71, 287 +/- 43 mmol/l per hour, respectively; P < 0.05). Moreover, the glucose disposal rate (GDR), measured using a euglycaemic clamp, was significantly lower in unfit and fit offspring than in unfit and fit controls (5.6 +/- 0.3 vs. 8.6 +/- 0.3 mg/kg per minute; P < 0.01 and 9.3 +/- 0.9 vs. 12.1 +/- 0.8 mg/kg per minute, respectively; P < 0.015), whereas the GDR was similar in unfit controls and fit offspring (8.6 +/- 0.4 vs. 9.3 +/- 0.9 mg/kg per minute; P > 0.05). These results support the concept that early metabolic abnormalities, as reflected by a decreased GDR (insulin sensitivity) in the offspring of T2DM patients, may be improved by increased physical fitness.

910,28440755,"Vitamin D deficiency is a serious public health problem worldwide that affects not only skeletal health, but also a wide range of acute and chronic diseases. However, there is still skepticism because of the lack of randomized, controlled trials to support association studies on the benefits of vitamin D for non-skeletal health. This review was based on articles published during the 1980-2015 obtained from the Cochrane Central Register of controlled trials, MEDLINE and PubMed, and focuses on recent challenges with regard to the definition of vitamin D deficiency and how to achieve optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels from dietary sources, supplements, and sun exposure. The effect of vitamin D on epigenetic fetal programming and regulation of genes that may potentially explain why vitamin D could have such lifelong comprehensive health benefits is reviewed. Optimization of vitamin D levels in children and adults around the world has potential benefits to improve skeletal health and to reduce the risk of chronic diseases, including some types of cancer, autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and severe cardiovascular disorders such as atherothrombosis, neurocognitive disorders, and mortality.

911,24837831,"Cronobacter sakazakii is a foodborne pathogen, which causes a life-threatening form of meningitis, necrotizing colitis and meningoencephalitis in neonates and children. Epidemiological studies implicate dried infant formula as the principal source of C. sakazakii. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of sub-inhibitory concentrations (SIC) of trans-cinnamaldehyde (TC), an ingredient in cinnamon, for reducing C. sakazakii virulence in vitro using cell culture, microscopy and gene expression assays. TC significantly (p ≤ 0.05) suppressed C. sakazakii adhesion to and invasion of human and rat intestinal epithelial cells, and human brain microvascular endothelial cells. In addition, TC inhibited C. sakazakii survival and replication in human macrophages. We also observed that TC reduced the ability of C. sakazakii to cause cell death in rat intestinal cells, by inhibiting nitric oxide production. Results from gene expression studies revealed that TC significantly downregulated the virulence genes critical for motility, host tissue adhesion and invasion, macrophage survival, and LPS (Lipopolysaccharide) synthesis in C. sakazakii. The efficacy of TC in attenuating these major virulence factors in C. sakazakii underscores its potential use in the prevention and/or control of infection caused by this pathogen. "

913,35983957,"A quarter of the world's population is estimated to meet the criteria for metabolic syndrome (MetS), a cluster of cardiometabolic risk factors that promote development of coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes, leading to increased risk of premature death and significant health costs. In this study we investigate whether the genetics associated with MetS components mirror their phenotypic clustering. A multivariate approach that leverages genetic correlations of fasting glucose, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, and waist circumference was used, which revealed that these genetic correlations are best captured by a genetic one factor model. The common genetic factor genome-wide association study (GWAS) detects 235 associated loci, 174 more than the largest GWAS on MetS to date. Of these loci, 53 (22.5%) overlap with loci identified for two or more MetS components, indicating that MetS is a complex, heterogeneous disorder. Associated loci harbor genes that show increased expression in the brain, especially in GABAergic and dopaminergic neurons. A polygenic risk score drafted from the MetS factor GWAS predicts 5.9% of the variance in MetS. These results provide mechanistic insights into the genetics of MetS and suggestions for drug targets, especially fenofibrate, which has the promise of tackling multiple MetS components. "
914,32512641,"This study aimed to investigate the effect of high glucose (HG) level on the proliferation, migration and invasion of trophoblasts and determine the role of placental growth factor (PLGF) in the process. HTR8-S/Vneo was treated with different concentrations of d-glucose (0, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 μM) at different times (0, 6, 12 and 24 h). qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses were used to measure PLGF expression. The protein level of PLGF was measured by immunofluorescence. Cell proliferation was assessed with CCK-8 analysis. Wound healing and transwell assays were used to evaluate cell migration and invasion. Intercellular ROS was detected with DCFH-DA. After d-glucose treatment, the viability decreased in 25 and 30 μM groups. The HG group (25 μM) showed inhibited cell migration and invasion ability. The mRNA and protein levels of PLGF decreased under HG condition. Elevated ROS production was also detected in the HG group. Knocked-down PLGF expression enhanced increased ROS production and decreased cell migration and invasion, which reverted to the original levels after PLGF was overexpressed. High glucose treatment inhibited HTR8-S/Vneo viability, migration and invasion by downregulating PLGF expression. "
915,24388959,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) shows not only hyperandrogenemia, hirsutism and fertility problems, but also metabolic disturbances including obesity, cardiovascular events and type-2 diabetes. Accumulating evidence suggests some degree of inflammation associated with prominent aspects of PCOS. We aimed to investigate the association of genetic variants 3'UTR rs17468190 (G/T) of the inflammation-associated gene MEP1A (GenBank ID: NM_005588.2) with metabolic disturbances in PCOS and healthy control women. Genetic variants rs17468190 (G/T) of MEP1A gene were analyzed in 576 PCOS women and 206 controls by using the Taqman fluorogenic 5'-exonuclease assay. This polymorphism was tested for association with anthropometric, metabolic, hormonal, and functional parameters of PCOS. There was a borderline significant difference in genotype distribution between PCOS and control women (p=0.046). In overweight/obese PCOS patients, the variants rs17468190 (G/T) in the MEP1A gene are associated with glucose and insulin metabolism. In a dominant model, the GG genotype of the MEP1A gene was more strongly associated with insulin metabolism in overweight/obese PCOS women (body mass index, BMI>25 kg/m(2)), than in GT+TT genotypes. The MEP1A GG-carriers showed a significantly increased homeostatic model assessment - insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (p=0.003), elevation of fasting insulin (p=0.004) and stimulated insulin (30 min, p<0.001; 60 min, p=0.009; 120 min, p=0.009) as well as triglyceride (p=0.032) levels. MEP1A is a possible target gene for disease modification in PCOS. It might contribute to the abnormalities of glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity and serve as a diagnostic or therapeutic target gene for PCOS. "

The mixture of blood and solution in the ""waste"" syringe is usually reinfused into the baby. Reinfused red blood cells may be damaged by the infusion solution. It is hypothesised that an isotonic amino acid solution would cause no red blood cell agglutination and no more haemolysis than many commonly used solutions. Blood was obtained from the placentas of 15 normal term babies. Haemolysis was estimated by measuring plasma (free) haemoglobin after mock blood sampling. Agglutination was measured semiquantitatively by direct observation. A 0.25% normal saline solution caused 5.4% haemolysis, significantly more than all the other fluids tested. There was less haemolysis with 0. 25% normal saline when there was complete mixing of blood and solution within the ""waste"" syringe. Normal saline and isotonic sodium acetate solutions caused < 0.1% haemolysis, significantly less than all the other fluids tested. The isotonic amino acid solution caused 0.8% haemolysis, which is similar to that caused by the remaining solutions tested. Agglutination was seen with isotonic dextrose and with the two isotonic amino acid solutions containing cysteine. Isotonic amino acid solution (without added cysteine) caused no agglutination and the same or less haemolysis than many commonly used solutions and may offer advantages in nutrition and fluid balance.

917,31823095,"LncRNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) is reported to be highly expressed in myocardial I/R injury and closely related to autophagy. However, the exact biological role of MALAT1 and its underlying mechanism in myocardial I/R injury remain to be elucidated. We established incultured H9C2 cardiomyocytes an oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) model for 6 h and then reoxygen-glucose for 4 h. We measured cell damage and autophagy levels after OGD/R by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot. The relationships between miR-20b and MALAT1, beclin1 were confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. We found that the expression of MALAT1 and beclin1, cell damage levels (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, 222.4 ± 29.4 vs. 577.5 ± 27.4 U/L; creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (CK-MB), 1.0 ± 0.2 vs. 4.3 ± 0.4; cardiac troponin I (cTn-I), 1.0 ± 0.3 vs. 3.0 ± 0.3; p < 0.05), and autophagy levels were significantly increased after OGD/R model, while cell viability (100.0 vs. 54.2 ± 2.2%, p < 0.05) and the expression of miR-20b and P62 were reduced; the trend of all the above data was significantly reversed by MALAT1 siRNA. In addition, the luciferase reporter assay results confirmed that MALAT1 directly binds to miR-20b-5p and functions as a ceRNA for miR-20b-5p to regulate beclin1. As a result, MALAT1 overexpression antagonized while MALAT1 knockdown enhanced the inhibitory effects of miR-20b-5p on beclin1-related cardiomyocytes autophagy in OGD/R injury. LncRNA MALAT1 promotes OGD/R-induced cardiomyocytes injury through sponging miR-20b to enhance beclin1-mediated autophagy. "
918,36774100,"Myo-inositol (MI) is incorporated into numerous biomolecules, including phosphoinositides and inositol phosphates. Disturbance of inositol availability or metabolism is associated with various disorders, including neurological conditions and cancers, whereas supplemental MI has therapeutic potential in conditions such as depression, polycystic ovary syndrome, and congenital anomalies. Inositol status can be influenced by diet, synthesis, transport, utilization, and catabolism. We aimed to investigate potential genetic regulation of circulating MI status and to evaluate correlation of MI concentration with other metabolites. GC-MS was used to determine plasma MI concentration of >2000 healthy, young adults (aged 18-28 y) from the Trinity Student Study. Genotyping data were used to test association of plasma MI with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes, encoding inositol transporters and synthesizing enzymes, and test for genome-wide association. We evaluated potential correlation of plasma MI with d-chiro-inositol (DCI), glucose, and other metabolites by Spearman rank correlation. Mean plasma MI showed a small but significant difference between males and females (28.5 and 26.9 μM, respectively). Candidate gene analysis revealed several nominally significant associations with plasma MI, most notably for SLC5A11 (solute carrier family 5 member 11), encoding a sodium-coupled inositol transporter, also known as SMIT2 (sodium-dependent myo-inositol transporter 2). However, these did not survive correction for multiple testing. Subsequent testing for genome-wide association with plasma MI did not identify associations of genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10 Our findings suggest potential for modulation of plasma MI in young adults by variation in SLC5A11, which is worthy of further investigation.

919,34044736,"Screening strategies for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), particularly early GDM, have traditionally relied upon the use of clinical risk factors (CRFs). Although commonly used in nonpregnant patients, HbA1c screening is not widely used despite reports of abnormal HbA1c values being predictive of GDM development. The aims of this study are to assess the utility of universal HbA1c screening in predicting GDM and to compare universal screening to targeted CRF-based screening for the diagnosis of GDM. This is a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing universal HbA1c screening at ≤16 completed weeks gestation with a singleton pregnancy between December 2016 and April 2018 at a single urban tertiary care center. Patients with preexisting diabetes (HbA1c ≥6.5%) or patients who did not have glucose tolerance testing were excluded. Patients with HbA1c 5.7-6.4% underwent early two-step GDM screening. Positive screens were diagnosed with early GDM. Normal early screeners underwent repeat 3rd trimester screening. Clinical risk factors for early GDM screening at our institution prior to universal screening were history of GDM, body mass index (BMI) ≥40 kg/m One thousand nine hundred and fifteen patients met inclusion criteria. Two hundred and thirty-one (12.1%) patients had an elevated HbA1c ≥5.7%. Patients with elevated HbA1c were more likely to be older, Black, or obese compared with patients with normal HbA1c values. After adjusting for Black race, BMI, age, and public insurance, the odds of GDM development are 3.50 (95%CI 2.26-5.39) times higher among patients with HbA1c ≥5.7% compared to those with a normal HbA1c. Clinical risk factors for early glucose screening were present in 33% of patients with an elevated HbA1c. The AUC of CRF screening and HbA1c ≥5.7% was 0.72 and 0.75, respectively ( An elevated HbA1c is associated with an increased risk of GDM.

920,33687947,"Hepatic fat accumulation is associated with diabetes and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we characterize the metabolic response that high-fat availability elicits in livers before disease development. After a short term on a high-fat diet (HFD), otherwise healthy mice showed elevated hepatic glucose uptake and increased glucose contribution to serine and pyruvate carboxylase activity compared with control diet (CD) mice. This glucose phenotype occurred independently from transcriptional or proteomic programming, which identifies increased peroxisomal and lipid metabolism pathways. HFD-fed mice exhibited increased lactate production when challenged with glucose. Consistently, administration of an oral glucose bolus to healthy individuals revealed a correlation between waist circumference and lactate secretion in a human cohort.  "
921,27240736,"In vitro liver models have been important tools for more than 40 years for academic research and preclinical toxicity screening by the pharmaceutical industry. Hepatocytes, the highly metabolic parenchymal cells of the liver, are efficient at different metabolic chemistries depending on their relative spatial location along the sinusoid from the portal triad to the central vein. Although replicating hepatocyte metabolic zonation is vitally important for physiologically-relevant in vitro liver tissue and organ models, it is most often completely overlooked. Here, we demonstrate the creation of spatially-controlled zonation across multiple hepatocyte metabolism levels through the application of precise concentration gradients of exogenous hormone (insulin and glucagon) and chemical (3-methylcholanthrene) induction agents in a microfluidic device. Observed gradients in glycogen storage via periodic acid-Schiff staining, urea production via carbamoyl phosphatase synthetase I staining, and cell viability after exposure to allyl alcohol and acetaminophen demonstrated the in vitro creation of hepatocyte carbohydrate, nitrogen, alcohol degradation, and drug conjugation metabolic zonation. This type of advanced control system will be crucial for studies evaluating drug metabolism and toxicology using in vitro constructs. "
922,37410781,"The aim of this study was to examine the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes in women diagnosed with GDM by the World Health Organization (WHO) 1999 criteria, and in those retrospectively identified by the Norwegian-2017 and WHO-2013 criteria but not by WHO-1999 criteria. We also examine the effect of maternal overweight/obesity and ethnicity. We used pooled data from four Norwegian cohorts (2002-2013), encompassing 2970 mother-child pairs. Results from universally offered 75-g oral glucose tolerance tests measuring fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-hour glucose (2HG) were used to assign women into three diagnostic groups: Diagnosed and treated by WHO-1999 (FPG≥7.0 or (2HG ≥7.8 mmol/L), identified by WHO-2013 (FPG ≥5.1 or 2HG ≥8.5 mmol/L), and identified by Norwegian-2017 criteria (FPG ≥5.3 or 2HG ≥9.0 mmol/L). Perinatal outcomes included large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants, cesarean section, operative vaginal delivery, preterm birth and preeclampsia. Compared to the non-GDM group, women diagnosed with GDM by either of the three criteria had an increased risk of large-for-gestational-age infants (adjusted odds ratios (OR) 1.7-2.2). Those identified by the WHO-2013 and Norwegian-2017 criteria but not diagnosed and treated by WHO-1999 criteria had an additional increased risk of cesarean section (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.02,1.83 and 1.44, 95% CI 1.03,2.02, respectively) and operative vaginal delivery (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.1,1.7 and 1.5, 95% CI 1.1,2.0, respectively). The proportions of LGA neonates and cesarean section were higher for women with GDM in both normal-weight and overweight/obese women. Asians had a lower risk of delivering large-for-gestational-age infants than Europeans applying national birthweight references, but maternal glucose values were similarly positively associated with birthweight in all ethnic groups. Women who met the WHO-2013 and Norwegian-2017 criteria, but were not diagnosed by the WHO-1999 criteria and therefore not treated, had an increased risk of LGA, cesarean section and operative vaginal delivery compared to women without GDM.

923,36941297,"Homeostatic regulation of the maternal milieu during pregnancy is critical for maternal and fetal health. The placenta facilitates critical communication between maternal and fetal compartments, in part, through the production of extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs enable tissue synchrony via cell-cell and long-distance communication and are at their highest circulating concentration during pregnancy. While much work has been done investigating how physiological challenges in pregnancy affect the fetus, the role of placental communication in maternal health has not been well examined. We previously identified placental O-glycosyl transferase (OGT), a glucose-sensing enzyme, as a target of maternal stress where OGT levels and activity affected the O-glycosylation of proteins critical for EV cargo loading and secretion. Here, we hypothesized that placental OGT plays an essential role in maternal homeostatic regulation during pregnancy via its regulation of maternal circulating EV concentrations. Our studies found that changes to key metabolic factors over the circadian cycle, including glucocorticoids, insulin, and glucose, were significantly associated with changes in circulating EV concentration. Targeting placental OGT in mice, we found a novel significant positive relationship between placental OGT and maternal circulating EV concentration that was associated with improving maternal glucose tolerance during pregnancy. Finally, an intravenous elevation in EVs, matching the concentration of EVs during pregnancy, shifted non-pregnant female glucose sensitivity, blunted glucose variance, and improved synchrony of glucose uptake. These data suggest an important and novel role for circulating EVs as homeostatic regulators important in maternal health during pregnancy. "
924,34702819,"The circadian system cyclically regulates many physiological and behavioral processes within the day. Desynchronization between physiological and behavioral rhythms increases the risk of developing some, including metabolic, disorders. Here we investigate how the oscillatory nature of metabolic signals, resembling feeding-fasting cycles, sustains the cell-autonomous clock in peripheral tissues. By controlling the timing, period and frequency of glucose and insulin signals via microfluidics, we find a strong effect on Per2::Luc fibroblasts entrainment. We show that the circadian Per2 expression is better sustained via a 24 h period and 12 h:12 h frequency-encoded metabolic stimulation applied for 3 daily cycles, aligned to the cell-autonomous clock, entraining the expression of hundreds of genes mostly belonging to circadian rhythms and cell cycle pathways. On the contrary misaligned feeding-fasting cycles synchronize and amplify the expression of extracellular matrix-associated genes, aligned during the light phase. This study underlines the role of the synchronicity between life-style-associated metabolic signals and peripheral clocks on the circadian entrainment. "
925,25444511,"In this in-vitro study, the effect of prohibitin (PHB) on glucose metabolism in eutopic endometrial stromal cells from women with endometriosis was investigated. Endometrial stromal cells were isolated from endometrium in women with endometriosis, in women without endometriosis, or from endometrioma tissues. Glucose metabolic phenotype of stromal cells were examined in vitro. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to measure the mRNA expression of glycolysis-related genes. Glucose consumption and lactate production were examined after knockdown of PHB expression in women with endometriosis with siRNA. In endometrioma tissue, significantly increased glucose consumption, lactate production and aberrant expression of glycolysis-related enzymes were found in women with endometriosis compared with women who do not have endometriosis (P < 0.05 versus P < 0.001). In women with endometriosis, PHB mRNA and protein were under-expressed in endometrioma tissue; in women without endometriosis, PHB mRNA and protein were over-expressed. Knockdown of PHB expression in women with endometriosis increased glucose consumption, although it had no effect on lactate production. This study suggests that aberrant expression of glycolysis-related enzymes in endometrioma tissue is associated with enhanced glycolytic metabolism. The malignant-like feature may be partially caused by low-expression of PHB gene in endometriotic stromal cells. "

Seventy-five consecutive cirrhotics submitted to TIPS were randomized to receive either one of the above treatments or no-treatment. The main end-point was the occurrence of an episode of overt hepatic encephalopathy during the first month post-TIPS. Before the procedure and weekly thereafter the patients were evaluated by examining their mental status, asterixis, ammonia and trail-making-test Part-A (TMT-A). The three groups were comparable for age, sex, etiology, Child-Pugh-score, post-TIPS porto-systemic gradient, previous hepatic encephalopathy, basal values of ammonia and psychometric performance. Twenty-five patients developed hepatic encephalopathy (33%, CI 95%=22-45%). One-month incidence was similar in the three groups (P=0.97). Previous hepatic encephalopathy (Relative Hazard=3.79;1.27-11.31) and basal-TMT-A Z-score>1.5 (RH=3.55;1.24-10.2) were predictors of post-TIPS encephalopathy at multivariate analysis. A <5 mmHg porto-systemic gradient was also significantly related to the occurrence of encephalopathy.

927,34815287,"Anaemia in pregnancy remains a critical global health problem, affecting 46% of pregnant women in Africa and 49% in Asia. Oral iron therapy requires extended adherence to achieve correction of anaemia and replenishment of iron stores.

We aim to determine whether FCM given once during the second trimester of pregnancy compared with standard oral iron distributed through routine antenatal services is effective and safe for treatment of moderate to severe maternal anaemia in sub-Saharan Africa. The randomized controlled trial of the effect of intravenous iron on anaemia in Malawian pregnant women (REVAMP) is a two-arm confirmatory individually randomised trial set in Blantyre and Zomba districts in Malawi. The trial will randomise 862 women in the second trimester of pregnancy with a capillary haemoglobin concentration below 100.0 g/L. The study comprises two arms: (a) intravenous FCM (20 mg/kg up to 1000 mg) given once at randomisation, and (b) standard of care oral iron (65 mg elemental iron two times per day) for 90 days (or the duration of pregnancy, whichever is shorter) provided according to local healthcare practices. Both arms receive sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine as intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy. The primary outcome is the prevalence of anaemia (Hb <110.0 g/L) at 36 weeks' gestation. Secondary outcomes include birth weight, gestation duration and safety outcomes, including clinical malaria, serious perinatal events and postpartum haematologic and health-related outcomes in the mother and child.

Shunt occlusion resulted in a decrease in extrahepatic collateral blood flow and an increase in portal venous flow, as well as a dramatic improvement in hepatic function markers. In addition, B-RTO significantly decreased homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) of IR without a statistical decline of HOMA of β-cell function. The 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (75-OGTT) revealed that occlusion of PSS reduced both fasting immunoreactive insulin (IRI) levels and the area under the curve for IRI. However, no significant change in preprandial or postprandial plasma glucose levels was observed. Furthermore, according to the criteria of the American Diabetes Association, B-RTO led to an improved 75-OGTT profile in 58.3 % of patients who had impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus before the procedure. Shunt occlusion improves IR-related hyperinsulinemia through increased portal venous flow, ameliorated liver function, and consequent augmented hepatic insulin clearance in cirrhotic patients with PH.

929,36856950,"There is a risk of iodine deficiency among pregnant women in China. However, research on the iodine status of lactating women and infants is scarce. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the iodine status of lactating women and their infants and explore the relationship between breast milk iodine concentrations (BMICs) and urinary iodine concentrations (UICs). In total, 257 lactating women and their infants were recruited from the Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital East campus between May 2018 and May 2019. The BMIC and UIC were measured by inductively coupled plasma‒mass spectrometry (ICP‒MS). One-day 24-h dietary recall was used to determine the dietary intake of iodine. The mean dietary intake of iodine among the lactating women was 145.1 μg/day, and 97.83% (n = 225) of the lactating women had a dietary iodine intake below 240 μg/day. The median BMIC and UIC of the lactating women was 150.7 μg/L (interquartile range, IQR 102.9, 205.5) and 110.0 μg/L (IQR 65.8, 171.4), respectively, and the median UIC of the infants was 212.7 μg/L (IQR 142.1, 320.6). The BMIC of lactating women who consumed iodized salt was significantly higher than that of lactating women who did not consume iodized salt (p = 0.015). The infants' UIC values were significantly correlated with the BMIC values (r = 0.597 "
930,34130678,"Previous studies have indicated that women with a history of menstrual disorders have an increased risk of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. This has been attributed to the high proportion of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) among this group. The favorable effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on serum lipid profiles and glucose homeostasis in postmenopausal women is widely accepted. Whether HRT can also show positive effects on metabolic homeostasis in menopausal women with prior menstrual disorders (a putative PCOS phenotype) has not been reported yet. The aim of the study was to compare the effects of HRT on glucose and lipid metabolism in peri- and postmenopausal women with prior menstrual disorders and controls who did not have prior menstrual disorders. A retrospective multicenter study was conducted including 595 peri- and postmenopausal women who received HRT at four hospitals in the Zhejiang Province from May 31, 2010 to March 8, 2021. Participants were divided into the Normal menstruation group and the Menstrual disorders group according to their prior usual menstrual cycle pattern. Glucose and lipid metabolism indicators were assessed at baseline and after HRT. The results were compared between and within the groups, and data from peri- and postmenopausal women were analyzed separately. HRT significantly decreased fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance in perimenopausal users, and fasting plasma glucose levels in postmenopausal users with prior menstrual disorders, compared with baseline. Furthermore, HRT decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, fasting insulin, fasting plasma glucose and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance in both peri- and postmenopausal controls, compared with baseline. Nevertheless, no significant differences were observed in any of the glucose or lipid metabolism indicators at baseline and follow-up, as well as changes from baseline levels between menopausal women with and without prior menstrual disorders. HRT shows more obvious within-group improvements in glucose and lipid metabolism in controls, but there is no significant between-group difference. Further prospective studies are required for confirmation. "
931,26264971,"Obesity in pregnancy is associated with systemic inflammation, immunological changes and adverse maternal-fetal outcomes. Information on the association between maternal obesity and breast milk composition is scarce. This study describes changes and relationships between biochemical and immunological parameters of colostrum and serum of overweight and obese women. Colostrum and blood samples were collected from 25 normal weight, 24 overweight and 19 obese women for determination of glucose, total protein, triglycerides, cholesterol, immunoglobulins, complement proteins (C3 and C4), fat and calorie content and C-reactive protein (CRP). Glucose was higher in colostrum of obese women (p = .002). In normal weight and obese women, total protein content was higher in colostrum than in serum (p = .001). Serum triglycerides (p = .008) and cholesterol (p = .010) concentrations were significantly higher in overweight and obese women than in their normal weight counterparts, but in colostrum their concentrations were similar across the three groups. Secretory IgA (sIgA) in colostrum and IgA in serum concentrations were significantly higher (p = .001) in overweight and obese mothers, whereas IgG and IgM concentrations did not vary among the groups (p = .825). Serum C3 (p = .001) and C4 (p = .040) concentrations were higher in obese women. No differences in colostrum complement proteins were detected among the groups. Calorie content (p = .003) and fat (p = .005) concentrations in colostrum and serum CRP (p = .002) were higher in obese women. The results corroborate the hypothesis that colostrum of overweight and obese women undergoes biochemical and immunological changes that affect its composition, namely increasing glucose concentrations, calorie content, fat and sIgA concentrations.

932,33462796,"Iodine plays an important role in thyroid function. However, in daily practices, people lack the related details including the knowledge concerned iodine usage, attitudes towards it, and practice among pregnant women. The aim of the present study is to assess the iodine status of pregnant women in Shanghai, and their knowledge regarding iodine, with the goal of investigating the relationship between iodine and thyroid function during pregnancy. This is a cross-sectional study. We recruited 3 groups of participants including 145 pregnant women (12-16 weeks gestation), 101 pregnant women (24-28 weeks gestation), and 108 pregnant women (34-38 weeks gestation). Iodine status and dietary intake were calculated from 24-h urinary iodine concentration (UIC). Knowledge regarding iodine was collected through a questionnaire. We additionally examined TSH, FT3, FT4, and TPOAb of the participants. The median of UIC of the 354 pregnant women was 119.2 μg/L, and 68.9% had urinary iodine levels below 150 μg/L. The proportion of daily iodized salt consumption in pregnant women was only 78.0%. The median UIC of the pregnant women who had consumed iodized salt was significantly higher than that of the pregnant women without iodized salt intake (Z = - 5.087, P < 0.001). Pregnant women in weeks 34-38 with a high level of knowledge had significantly lower TSH levels than those with low knowledge level (P = 0.046). Among the 349 pregnant women, few were aware of the harm to the fetus (8.3%). Significant differences were found in the scores for the knowledge level of women with different educational levels (Z = - 5.413, P < 0.001). Pregnant women in Shanghai have mild iodine deficiency. Approaches to improve iodine status among pregnant women in Shanghai include raising their awareness of iodine intake and changing their dietary habits. Otherwise, the risk of iodine deficiency in pregnant women may continue to increase. "
933,32958248,"In recent years, the obese and overweight population has increased rapidly, which has become a worldwide public health problem. However, effective medication is lacking. Our previous study identified a novel peptide, PDBSN (GLSVADLAESIMKNL), that could significantly restrict adipocyte differentiation in vitro, but its in vivo function has not been determined. Thus, in this study, we encapsulated the peptide into liposomes attached with two ligands (visceral-adipose-tissue-targeting peptide and cell-penetrating peptide) to improve stability and specificity. We then tested the peptide's function in HFD (high-fat diet)-induced obese mice and found that PDBSN could reduce weight gain and improve insulin resistance as well as lipid homeostasis. These results suggest that PDBSN may be a potential candidate for anti-obesity drug discovery. "

However, the evaluation of such a commitment is not yet done. This study aims to examine knowledge of bakers about the national strategy of salt reduction and evaluate their commitment in implementing the specific recommendation related to salt reduction in bread. a quantitative exploratory study targeted bakeries (N=432) from all the administrative regions of Morocco. Data was collected using a questionnaire composed of three sections: knowledge of bakers related to national strategy of salt, current contribution of bakers in implementing the national strategy and future commitment towards implementing the national strategy. about 73% (n=317) bakers lack of knowledge about the recommendations on the progressive reduction of the salt content in bread. Radio and TV were the most used sources to obtain information by bakers (45.2% (n=52) and 35.6% (n=41) respectively). None of the bakers was informed about the process of gradual reduction of salt content in bread, and none of them was committed to it. A total of 60.32% (n=252) of bakeries do not respect the national recommendations of 10g of salt/Kg of flour while 89.6% (n=387) of bakers express their interest in getting committed to the process in the next 2 years. increasing the knowledge of bakers is highly recommended to guarantee their commitment toward contributing to the strategy of reducing salt in bread. Dissemination of messages via TV and radio could be appropriate. "
935,34475397,"The wake-active orexin system plays a central role in the dynamic regulation of glucose homeostasis. Here we show orexin receptor type 1 and 2 are predominantly expressed in dorsal raphe nucleus-dorsal and -ventral, respectively. Serotonergic neurons in ventral median raphe nucleus and raphe pallidus selectively express orexin receptor type 1. Inactivation of orexin receptor type 1 in serotonin transporter-expressing cells of mice reduced insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obesity, mainly by decreasing glucose utilization in brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Selective inactivation of orexin receptor type 2 improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in obese mice, mainly through a decrease in hepatic gluconeogenesis. Optogenetic activation of orexin neurons in lateral hypothalamus or orexinergic fibers innervating raphe pallidus impaired or improved glucose tolerance, respectively. Collectively, the present study assigns orexin signaling in serotonergic neurons critical, yet differential orexin receptor type 1- and 2-dependent functions in the regulation of systemic glucose homeostasis.

938,37204269,"Diet modulates the development of insulin resistance during aging. This includes tissue-specific alterations in insulin signaling and mitochondrial function, which ultimately affect glucose homeostasis. Exercise stimulates glucose clearance and mitochondrial lipid oxidation and also enhances insulin sensitivity (IS). It is not well known how exercise interacts with age and diet in the development of insulin resistance. To investigate this, oral glucose tolerance tests with tracers were conducted in mice ranging from 4 to 21 months of age, fed a low-fat diet (LFD) or high-fat diet (HFD) with or without life-long voluntary access to a running wheel (RW). We developed a computational model to derive glucose fluxes, which were commensurate with independent values from steady-state tracer infusions. Values for an IS index derived for peripheral tissues (IS-P) and one for the liver (IS-L) were steeply decreased by aging and an HFD. This preceded the age-dependent decline in the mitochondrial capacity to oxidize lipids. In young animals fed an LFD, RW access enhanced the IS-P concomitantly with the muscle β-oxidation capacity. Surprisingly, RW access completely prevented the age-dependent IS-L decrease; however this only occurred in animals fed an LFD. Therefore, this study indicates that endurance exercise can improve the age-dependent decline in organ-specific IS if paired with a healthy diet. Exercise is a known strategy to improve insulin sensitivity (IS), whereas aging and a lipid-rich diet decrease IS. Using a tracer-based oral glucose tolerance test, we investigated how exercise, age, and diet interact in the development of tissue-specific insulin resistance. Exercise (voluntary access to a running wheel) mainly improved IS in animals fed a low-fat diet. In these animals, exercise improved peripheral IS only at young age but fully prevented the age-dependent decline of hepatic IS. The prevention of age-dependent decline in IS by exercise is tissue-specific and blunted by a lipid-rich diet. "
939,37000695,"Metabolic zones were developed to characterize heterogeneity of individuals with islet autoantibodies. Baseline 2-h oral glucose tolerance test data from 6,620 TrialNet Pathway to Prevention Study (TNPTP) autoantibody-positive participants (relatives of individuals with type 1 diabetes) were used to form 25 zones from five area under the curve glucose (AUCGLU) rows and five area under the curve C-peptide (AUCPEP) columns. Zone phenotypes were developed from demographic, metabolic, autoantibody, HLA, and risk data. As AUCGLU increased, changes of glucose and C-peptide response curves (from mean glucose and mean C-peptide values at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min) were similar within the five AUCPEP columns. Among the zones, 5-year risk for type 1 diabetes was highly correlated with islet antigen 2 antibody prevalence (r = 0.96, P < 0.001). Disease risk decreased markedly in the highest AUCGLU row as AUCPEP increased (0.88-0.41; P < 0.001 from lowest AUCPEP column to highest AUCPEP column). AUCGLU correlated appreciably less with Index60 (an indicator of insulin secretion) in the highest AUCPEP column (r = 0.33) than in other columns (r ≥ 0.78). AUCGLU was positively related to ""fasting glucose × fasting insulin"" and to ""fasting glucose × fasting C-peptide"" (indicators of insulin resistance) before and after adjustments for Index60 (P < 0.001). Phenotypes of 25 zones formed from AUCGLU and AUCPEP were used to gain insights into type 1 diabetes heterogeneity. Zones were used to examine GCRC changes with increasing AUCGLU, associations between risk and autoantibody prevalence, the dependence of glucose as a predictor of risk according to C-peptide, and glucose heterogeneity from contributions of insulin secretion and insulin resistance.

Adult in-hospital cardiac arrest patients. The percentage of patients receiving epinephrine, vasopressin, amiodarone, lidocaine, atropine, bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, and dextrose each year were calculated in patients with shockable and nonshockable initial rhythms. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the annual adjusted odds of medication administration. An interrupted time series analysis was performed to assess change in atropine use after the 2010 American Heart Association guideline update. A total of 268,031 index in-hospital cardiac arrests were included. As compared to 2001, the adjusted odds ratio of receiving each medication in 2016 were epinephrine (adjusted odds ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.8), vasopressin (adjusted odds ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.1), amiodarone (adjusted odds ratio, 3.4; 95% CI, 2.9-4.0), lidocaine (adjusted odds ratio, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.2-0.2), atropine (adjusted odds ratio, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.06-0.08), bicarbonate (adjusted odds ratio, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.8-2.3), calcium (adjusted odds ratio, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.7-2.3), magnesium (adjusted odds ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.9-2.7; p < 0.0001), and dextrose (adjusted odds ratio, 2.8; 95% CI, 2.3-3.4). Following the 2010 American Heart Association guideline update, there was a downward step change in the intercept and slope change in atropine use (p < 0.0001). Prescribing patterns during in-hospital cardiac arrest have changed significantly over time. Changes to American Heart Association Advanced Cardiac Life Support guidelines have had a rapid and substantial effect on the use of a number of commonly used in-hospital cardiac arrest medications.

941,33568359,"Associations of pre-pregnancy impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and body mass index (BMI) with large for gestational age (LGA) and preterm birth (PTB) have been poorly understood. We aimed to investigate the associations of maternal BMI, separately and together with pre-pregnancy IFG, with LGA and PTB in Chinese population. We also aimed to quantify these associations by maternal age. This was a retrospective cohort study of women from the National Free Preconception Health Examination Project with singleton birth from 121 counties/districts in 21 cities of Guangdong Province, China, from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2017. Women were included if they did not have pre-existing chronic diseases (diabetes, hypertension, etc). Participants were divided into eight groups according to their BMI (underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m We included 634 030 women. The incidences of LGA, severe LGA, PTB and early PTB for the study population were 7.1%, 2.5%, 5.1% and 1.1%, respectively. Compared with normal weight mothers with normoglycemia, overweight and obese mothers irrespective of IFG had a higher risk of LGA (eg, obesity with IFG aIRR 1.85 (1.60-2.14)) and severe LGA (eg, obesity with IFG 2.19 (1.73-2.79)). The associations of BMI and pre-pregnancy fasting glucose status with LGA were similar found among women of all age groups. Underweight with normoglycemia had 6.0% higher risk of PTB (1.06 (1.03-1.09)) and 8.0% higher risk of early PTB (1.08 (1.02-1.17)), underweight with IFG had 14.0% higher risk of PTB (1.14 (1.02-1.27)), and obese mothers with IFG had 45.0% higher risk of PTB (1.45 (1.18-1.78)). The associations of BMI and pre-pregnancy fasting glucose status with PTB differed by maternal age. Overweight and obesity regardless of IFG were associated with an increased risk of LGA, and these associations were similarly observed among mothers of all age groups. Underweight regardless of IFG, and obesity with IFG were associated with an increased risk of PTB, but the associations differed by maternal age. Findings from this study may have implications for risk assessment and counselling before pregnancy. "
942,26740601,"An important goal in diabetes research is to understand the processes that trigger endogenous β-cell proliferation. Hyperglycemia induces β-cell replication, but the mechanism remains debated. A prime candidate is insulin, which acts locally through the insulin receptor. Having previously developed an in vivo mouse hyperglycemia model, we tested whether glucose induces β-cell proliferation through insulin signaling. By using mice lacking insulin signaling intermediate insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2), we confirmed that hyperglycemia-induced β-cell proliferation requires IRS2 both in vivo and ex vivo. Of note, insulin receptor activation was not required for glucose-induced proliferation, and insulin itself was not sufficient to drive replication. Glucose and insulin caused similar acute signaling in mouse islets, but chronic signaling differed markedly, with mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR) and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) activation by glucose and AKT activation by insulin. MTOR but not ERK activation was required for glucose-induced proliferation. Cyclin D2 was necessary for glucose-induced β-cell proliferation. Cyclin D2 expression was reduced when either IRS2 or MTOR signaling was lost, and restoring cyclin D2 expression rescued the proliferation defect. Human islets shared many of these regulatory pathways. Taken together, these results support a model in which IRS2, MTOR, and cyclin D2, but not the insulin receptor, mediate glucose-induced proliferation. "
943,25682160,"Implantation of a medical implant within the body inevitably triggers a host inflammatory response that negatively impacts its function and longevity. Nevertheless, the degree and severity of this response may be reduced by selecting appropriate materials, implant geometry, surface topography and surface treatment. Here we demonstrate a strategy to improve the biocompatibility of a chemically-driven closed-loop insulin delivery implant. A microfabricated microporous, poly(ethylene glycol)-grafted polydimethylsiloxane membrane was placed on top of the glucose-responsive insulin release plug of the implant. Implant biocompatibility was assessed in healthy rats while implant function was evaluated in a type 1 diabetic rat model. The microporous membrane with a small distance to the plug provided a geometric barrier to inflammatory cell migration and prevented leukocyte-mediated degradation of the plug for at least 30 days. Membrane-protected devices elicited a significantly milder inflammatory response and formation of a well-defined fibrous capsule at the device opening compared to unprotected devices. The device's glucose-responsiveness was nearly unchanged, although the insulin release rate decreased with decreasing pore size. The microporous membrane improved biocompatibility and prolonged in vivo efficacy of the implant by ∼3-fold. This work suggests the importance of implant design in modulating inflammatory response and thereby extending the functional duration of the implant. "
944,37402708,"The gestational weight gain (GWG) and hyperglycemia are two key factors affecting adverse pregnancy outcomes among women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We aimed to investigate the combinatorial effect of abnormal glucose metabolism and GWG on adverse outcomes in GDM. This retrospective cohort study included 2611 pregnant women with GDM in Women's Hospital School of Medicine Zhejiang University. Bases on the OGTT glucose levels, we categorized the GDM cohort into three subgroups: impaired fasting glucose (IFG) group, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) group, and combined impaired glucose (IFG&IGT) group. Among pregnant women with IGT, insufficient GWG (IGWG) was an independent protective factor for pregnancy-induced hypertension syndrome (PIH) (aOR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32-0.95), macrosomia (0.38, 0.19-0.74) and large for gestational age (0.45, 0.32-0.62), as well as an independent risk factor for low birth weight infants (2.29, 1.24-4.22) and small for gestational age (1.94, 1.17-3.19); and excessive GWG (EGWG) was related to increased risks of PIH (1.68, 1.12-2.52), preterm delivery (1.82, 1.28-2.58), postpartum hemorrhage (1.85, 1.05-3.28), cesarean delivery (1.84, 1.38-2.46) and low body weight infants (2.36, 1.33-4.20). Moreover, EGWG was positively associated with PIH (3.27, 1.09-9.80) in the IFG group. But there were no significant associations between either IGWG or EGWG and any pregnancy outcomes in women with combined IFG&IGT. The relationships between GWG and adverse outcomes were modified by abnormal glucose metabolism in women with GDM. Our results suggest that more specific GWG recommendations according to their metabolic state are needed for GDM. "
945,28498475,"In order to improve the sensitivity of cervical cancer cells to irradiation therapy, we targeted hexokinase 2 (HK2), the first rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, and explore its role in cervical cancer cells. We suppressed HK2 expression and/or function by shRNA and/or metformin and found HK2 inhibition enhanced cells apoptosis with accelerating expression of cleaved PARP and caspase-3. HK2 inhibition also induced much inferior proliferation of cervical cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo with diminishing expression of mTOR, MIB and MGMT. Moreover, HK2 inhibition altered the metabolic profile of cervical cancer cells to one less dependent on glycolysis with a reinforcement of mitochondrial function and an ablation of lactification ability. Importantly, cervical cancer cells contained HK2 inhibition displayed more sensitivity to irradiation. Further results indicated that HPV16 E7 oncoprotein altered the glucose homeostasis of cervical cancer cells into glycolysis by coordinately promoting HK2 expression and its downregulation of glycolysis. Taken together, our findings supported a mechanism whereby targeting HK2 inhibition contributed to suppress HPV16 E7-induced tumor glycolysis metabolism phenotype, inhibiting tumor growth, and induced apoptosis, blocking the cancer cell energy sources and ultimately enhanced the sensitivity of HPV(+) cervical cancer cells to irradiation therapy.

946,38233735,"Despite the widespread use of classical cholesterol-lowering drugs to mitigate the adverse impacts of dyslipidaemia on atherosclerosis, many patients still face a substantial residual risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). This risk is partially attributed to non-traditional pathophysiological pathways. Latest evidence suggests that sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are beneficial for patients suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or established CVD by reducing morbidity and mortality. However, the underlying mechanisms of this benefit have not been clearly elucidated. It has been hypothesized that one possible mechanism could be the attenuation of subclinical atherosclerosis (SA) progression. The objective of this narrative review is to examine the present evidence concerning the impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on markers of SA. The current evidence on the efficacy of SGLT2 on SA, endothelial function and arterial stiffness remains controversial. Findings from observational and randomized studies are quite heterogeneous; however, they converge that the antiatherosclerotic activity of SGLT2 inhibitors is not strong enough to be widely used for prevention of atherosclerosis progression in patients with or without T2DM. Further research is needed to investigate the underlying mechanisms and the possible beneficial impact of SGLT2i on primary and secondary CVD prevention through attenuation of premature atherosclerosis progression.

947,35490704,"Emerging evidence supports the superiority of balanced crystalloids such as Lactated Ringer's (LR) compared to normal saline but concerns for the development of hyperkalemia have limited its use. Although LR inherently contains potassium, there exists a paucity of evidence to suggest that LR could potentiate hyperkalemia. To address this, we evaluated the effect of LR on serum potassium in patients with reduced kidney function who are at risk of developing hyperkalemia. We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort-based observational clinical study that included 293 clinical encounters who were hospitalized with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of < 30 ml/min/1.73m Serum potassium prior to LR use was highly correlated and predictive of the serum potassium after LR use [P < 0.0001; Odds Ratio 6.77 (3.73 - 12.28)]. Sixteen encounters (5%) developed de-novo hyperkalemia following LR use. No significant positive correlation between the amount of LR administered and the development of hyperkalemia was found. LR use was not independently associated with the development of hyperkalemia in patients with reduced kidney function. "
948,37672386,"While mitochondria in different tissues have distinct preferences for energy sources, they are flexible in utilizing competing substrates for metabolism according to physiological and nutritional circumstances. However, the regulatory mechanisms and significance of metabolic flexibility are not completely understood. Here, we report that the deletion of  Cells are powered by mitochondria, a group of organelles that produce chemical energy in the form of molecules called ATP. This energy is derived from the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The number of mitochondria in a cell and the energy source they use to produce ATP varies depending on the type of cell. Mitochondria can also switch the molecules they use to produce energy when the cell is responding to stress or disease. The heart and the skeletal muscles – which allow movement – are two tissues that require large amounts of energy, but it remained unknown whether disrupting mitochondrial fuel selection affects how these tissues work. To answer these questions, Zheng, Li, Li et al. investigated the role of an enzyme found in mitochondria called Ptpmt1. Genetically deleting Ptpmt1 in the heart and skeletal muscle of mice showed that while the development of these organs was not affected, mitochondria in these cells switched from using carbohydrates to using fats as an energy source. Over time, this shift damaged both the mitochondria and the tissues, leading to muscle wasting, heart failure, and sudden death in the mice. This suggests that balanced use of carbohydrates and fats is essential for the muscles and heart. These findings imply that long-term use of medications that alter the fuel that mitochondria use may be detrimental to patients’ health and could cause heart dysfunction. This may be important for future drug development, as well as informing decisions about medication taken in the clinic. "
949,25199455,"Skeletal muscle accounts for ∼ 80% of postprandial glucose clearance, and skeletal muscle glucose clearance is crucial for maintaining insulin sensitivity and euglycemia. Insulin-stimulated glucose clearance/uptake entails recruitment of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane (PM) in a process that requires cortical F-actin remodeling; this process is dysregulated in Type 2 Diabetes. Recent studies have implicated PAK1 as a required element in GLUT4 recruitment in mouse skeletal muscle in vivo, although its underlying mechanism of action and requirement in glucose uptake remains undetermined. Toward this, we have employed the PAK1 inhibitor, IPA3, in studies using L6-GLUT4-myc muscle cells. IPA3 fully ablated insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the PM, corroborating the observation of ablated insulin-stimulated GLUT4 accumulation in the PM of skeletal muscle from PAK1(-/-) knockout mice. IPA3-treatment also abolished insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into skeletal myotubes. Mechanistically, live-cell imaging of myoblasts expressing the F-actin biosensor LifeAct-GFP treated with IPA3 showed blunting of the normal insulin-induced cortical actin remodeling. This blunting was underpinned by a loss of normal insulin-stimulated cofilin dephosphorylation in IPA3-treated myoblasts. These findings expand upon the existing model of actin remodeling in glucose uptake, by placing insulin-stimulated PAK1 signaling as a required upstream step to facilitate actin remodeling and subsequent cofilin dephosphorylation. Active, dephosphorylated cofilin then provides the G-actin substrate for continued F-actin remodeling to facilitate GLUT4 vesicle translocation for glucose uptake into the skeletal muscle cell. "

This change was mostly attributable to change in the late AUC C-peptide response (i.e., 60- to 120-min AUC C-peptide). Median Index60 values of DPT-1 (1.44) and TNPTP (1.05) progressors to T1D 1.5 years prediagnosis (time of transition from increasing to decreasing AUC C-peptide) were used as thresholds to identify individuals at high risk for T1D in the full cohort at baseline (5-year risk of 0.75-0.88 for those above thresholds). A transition from an increase to a decrease in AUC C-peptide ∼1.5 years prediagnosis was validated in two independent cohorts. The median Index60 value at that time point can be used as a pathophysiologic-based threshold for identifying individuals at high risk for T1D. "

953,8857019,"Insulin resistance in the offspring of parents with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is the best predictor of development of the disease and probably plays an important part in its pathogenesis. We studied the mechanism and degree to which exercise training improves insulin sensitivity in these subjects. Ten adult children of parents with NIDDM and eight normal subjects were studied before starting an aerobic exercise-training program, after one session of exercise, and after six weeks of exercise. Insulin sensitivity was measured by the hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique combined with indirect calorimetry, and the rate of glycogen synthesis in muscle and the intramuscular glucose-6-phosphate concentration were measured by carbon-13 and phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively. During the base-line study, the mean (+/-SE) rate of muscle glycogen synthesis was 63 +/- 9 percent lower in the offspring of diabetic parents than in the normal subjects (P < 0.001). The mean value increased 69 +/- 10 percent (P = 0.04) and 62 +/- 11 percent (P = 0.04) after the first exercise session and 102 +/- 11 percent (P = 0.02) and 97 +/- 9 percent (P = 0.008) after six weeks of exercise training in the offspring and the normal subjects, respectively. The increment in glucose-6-phosphate during hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamping was lower in the offspring than in the normal subjects (0.039 +/- 0.013 vs. 0.089 +/- 0.009 mmol per liter, P = 0.005), reflecting reduced glucose transport-phosphorylation, but this increment was normal in the offspring after the first exercise session and after exercise training. Basal and stimulated insulin secretion was higher in the offspring than the normal subjects and was not altered by the exercise training program. Exercise increases insulin sensitivity in both normal subjects and the insulin-resistant offspring of diabetic parents because of a twofold increase in insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis in muscle, due to an increase in insulin-stimulated glucose transport-phosphorylation.

We studied 32 offspring of type 2 diabetic parents and 32 control individuals by means of DXA, indirect calorimetry, insulin clamp and 1H MRS of the calf muscles, and differences between and within study groups were analysed before and after segregation by quartiles of fasting lipid oxidation. In comparison with control subjects, the offspring showed impaired insulin sensitivity, which was associated with higher fasting intramyocellular lipid content (Spearman's rho -0.35; p=0.04), but fasting lipid oxidation did not differ between groups (1.21+/-0.46 vs. 1.25+/-0.37 mg.kg(-1) lean body mass per min; p=0.70). Nevertheless, offspring in the lowest quartile of lipid oxidation had the most severe impairment of insulin sensitivity and a strong association was shown between lipid oxidation and insulin sensitivity within quartiles (Spearman's rho 0.47; p=0.01); this was not observed within the control group (Spearman's rho 0.13; p=0.47). Intramyocellular lipid content was not significantly different within quartiles of lipid oxidation in either of the groups. Insulin sensitivity improved across increasing quartiles of fasting lipid oxidation in the offspring group, but remained constant in the control group, supporting the hypothesis that impaired fat oxidation is a primary pathogenic factor of insulin resistance in people with a genetic background for type 2 diabetes. Despite their association with impaired insulin sensitivity, soleus and tibialis anterior intramyocellular lipid content remained constant across increasing quartiles of fasting lipid oxidation within both groups.

956,26666384,"To perform a systematic review of the effect of interaction between Melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) single nucleotide polymorphisms and diet on the development of obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Environmental factors, such as nutrient intakes or feeding behaviours, can modulate the association of polymorphism in the MC4R gene with obesity and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. A systematic literature search was conducted in the PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar databases, with a combination of the following keywords: Diet*, nutr*, melanocortin receptor, melanocortin 4 receptor and MC4R. To assess the quality of observational studies, we used a 12-item quality checklist, derived from the STREGA statement. A total of 14 articles were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Consumption of highly salty foods and adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern can modulate the association between MC4R polymorphisms and the risk of obesity or Type 2 diabetes. Despite the highly contradictory results of intervention studies, after short-term lifestyle interventions, children with variant alleles of MC4R single nucleotide polymorphisms can lose more body weight, compared with non-carriers, although they may have difficulty in maintaining this weight loss in the long-term. To interpret the results of studies on adults, we need further studies. The interaction between MC4R genes with dietary factors plays a significant role in the development of obesity or Type 2 diabetes phenotypes. Early detection of MC4R risk alleles in individuals and modification of their diet based on these results could be an efficient strategy to prevent obesity or diabetes in these subgroups. "
957,38637574,"Detailed knowledge regarding the associations between intake of different types of seafood and meat and the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), and insight into possible mechanisms are warranted. In this study we aimed to evaluate the associations between intake of different types of seafood and meat and the subsequent risk of T2D using the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), and furthermore, by using a mouse model to gain further insight into possible molecular mechanisms contributing to the associated metabolic changes. Women in MoBa who were free of pharmacologically treated diabetes at baseline (n = 60,777) were prospectively evaluated for incident T2D, identified on the basis of medication usages > 90 days after delivery, ascertained by the Norwegian Prescription Database. Dietary intake was obtained with a validated 255-item food frequency questionnaire which assessed habitual diet during the first 4-5 months of pregnancy. Metabolic phenotypes and plasma metabolome were investigated in female mice fed isocaloric diets with different types of seafood and meat mimicking the dietary intake in the human cohort. During maximum 10-year and mean (SD) 7.2 (1.6) years follow-up time, 681 (1.1%) women developed pharmacologically treated T2D. All statistical models identified a higher risk of T2D with increased shellfish intake, whereas no associations were observed for total seafood, fatty fish, total meat and red meat in the adjusted models. In mice, the shellfish-based western diet induced reduced glucose tolerance and insulin secretion compared to the diet based on lean fish, and we identified a number of metabolites elevated in plasma from shellfish-fed mice that correlated with glucose intolerance. Mice fed a western diet based on meat also exhibited reduced glucose tolerance in comparison to lean fish fed mice, whereas mice fed fatty fish, total seafood or red meat did not differ from lean fish fed mice. We observed a diet-specific metabolic signature in plasma demonstrating five distinct metabolite profiles in mice fed shellfish, fatty fish, total seafood/lean fish, a mixed diet and meat. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that different types of seafood have different outcome on T2D risk. In women, intake of shellfish was associated with higher risk of T2D. In female mice, a shellfish enriched diet reduced glucose tolerance and altered the abundance of several distinct plasma metabolites correlating with glucose tolerance. "
958,32955012,"It is well known that a family history of diabetes (FHD) is a definitive risk factor for type 2 diabetes. It has not been known whether sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) increases the prevalence of diabetes in those with an FHD. We assessed SDB severity in 7,477 study participants by oximetry corrected by objective sleep duration determined by wrist actigraphy. Glycated hemoglobin ≥6.5% and/or current medication for diabetes indicated the presence of diabetes. In addition to the overall prevalence, the prevalence of recent-onset diabetes during the nearly 5 years before the SDB measurements were made was investigated. Of the 7,477 participants (mean age: 57.9; range: 34.2-80.7; SD: 12.1 years; 67.7% females), 1,569 had an FHD. The prevalence of diabetes in FHD participants with moderate-to-severe SDB (MS-SDB) was higher than in those without SDB (MS-SDB vs without SDB: all, 29.3% vs 3.3% [P < .001]; females, 32.6% vs 1.9% [P < .001]; males, 26.2% vs 11.7% [P = .037]). However, multivariate analysis showed that MS-SDB was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of diabetes only in FHD-positive females (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: females, 7.43 [3.16-17.45]; males, 0.92 [0.37-2.31]). Among the FHD-positive participants, the prevalence of recent-onset diabetes was higher in those with MS-SDB than those without SDB, but only in females (MS-SDB vs without SDB: 21.4% vs 1.1%; P < 0.001). MS-SDB was associated with diabetes risk in females with an FHD, and future studies are needed on whether treatment of SDB in females with an FHD would prevent the onset of diabetes. "
959,21284459,"Premature, low-birth-weight infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus have a high risk of shunt obstruction and infection. Established risk factors for shunt failure include grade of the hemorrhage and age at shunt insertion. There is anecdotal evidence that the amount of red blood cells or protein levels in the CSF may affect shunt performance. However, this has not been analyzed specifically for this cohort of high-risk patients. Therefore, the authors performed this study to examine whether any statistical relationship exists between the CSF constituents and the rate of shunt malfunction or infection in this population. A retrospective cohort study was performed on premature infants born at Riley Hospital for Children from 2000 to 2009. Inclusion criteria were a CSF sample analyzed within 2 weeks prior to shunt insertion, low birth weight (< 1500 grams), prematurity (birth prior to 37 weeks estimated gestational age), and shunt insertion for posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Data points included the gestational age at birth and shunt insertion, weight at birth and shunt insertion, history of CNS infection prior to shunt insertion, shunt failure, shunt infection, and the levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, protein, and glucose in the CSF. Statistical analysis was performed to determine any association between shunt outcome and the CSF parameters. Fifty-eight patients met the study entry criteria. Ten patients (17.2%) had primary shunt failure within 3 months of insertion. Nine patients (15.5%) had shunt infection within 3 months. A previous CNS infection prior to shunt insertion was a statistical risk factor for shunt failure (p = 0.0290) but not for shunt infection. There was no statistical relationship between shunt malfunction or infection and the CSF levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, protein, or glucose before shunt insertion. Low-birth-weight premature infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus have a high rate of shunt failure and infection. The authors did not find any association of shunt failure or infection with CSF cell count, protein level, or glucose level. Therefore, it may not be useful to base the timing of shunt insertion on CSF parameters. "
960,24621463,"Diabetes mellitus, hypertension and metabolic syndrome are major risk factors for the occurrence of cardiovascular events. In this study, we used spontaneous hypertensive rat (SHR)/NDmcr-cp (cp/cp) (SHRcp) rats as a model for metabolic syndrome to examine the effects of dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibition on hypertension, glucose metabolism and endothelial dysfunction. First, we confirmed that SHRcp rats showed very severe obesity, hypertension and endothelial dysfunction phenotypes from 14 to 54 weeks of age. Next, we examined whether the DPP-4 inhibitor teneligliptin (10 mg kg(-1) per day per os for 12 weeks) could modify any of these phenotypes. Treatment with teneligliptin significantly improved hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, as evidenced by an oral glucose tolerance test and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance, respectively. Teneligliptin showed no effects on systolic blood pressure or heart rate. In regard to endothelial function, the vasodilator response to acetylcholine was significantly impaired in SHRcp rats when compared with WKY rats. Long-term treatment with teneligliptin significantly attenuated endothelial dysfunction through the upregulation of endothelium-derived nitric oxide synthase mRNA. These results demonstrate that long-term treatment with teneligliptin significantly improved endothelial dysfunction and glucose metabolism in a rat model of metabolic syndrome, suggesting that teneligliptin treatment might be beneficial for patients with hypertension and/or diabetes.

963,28593684,"Pregnant women are prone to iodine deficiency due to the increased need for iodine during gestation. Progress has recently occurred in establishing serum thyroglobulin (Tg) as an iodine status biomarker, but there is no accepted reference range for iodine sufficiency during pregnancy. An observational study was conducted in 164 pregnant women. At week 16 of gestation urinary iodine concentration (UIC), serum Tg, and thyroid functions were measured, and information on the type of iodine supplementation and smoking were recorded. The parameters of those who started iodine supplementation (≥150 μg/day) at least 4 weeks before pregnancy (n = 27), who started at the detection of pregnancy (n = 51), and who had no iodine supplementation (n = 74) were compared. Sufficient iodine supply was found in the studied population based on median UIC (162 μg/L). Iodine supplementation ≥150 μg/day resulted in higher median UIC regardless of its duration (nonusers: 130 μg/L vs. prepregnancy iodine starters: 240 μg/L, and pregnancy iodine starters: 205 μg/L, p < .001, and p = .023, respectively). Median Tg value of pregnancy starters was identical to that of nonusers (14.5 vs. 14.6 μg/L), whereas prepregnancy starters had lower median Tg (9.1 μg/L, p = .018). Serum Tg concentration at week 16 of pregnancy showed negative relationship (p = .010) with duration of iodine supplementation and positive relationship (p = .008) with smoking, a known interfering factor of iodine metabolism, by multiple regression analysis. Serum Tg at week 16 of pregnancy may be a promising biomarker of preconceptual and first trimester maternal iodine status, the critical early phase of foetal brain development. "
964,31170414,"Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is a widespread environmental toxin. In addition to being a human carcinogen, its effect on diabetes has started to gain recognition recently. Insulin is the key hormone regulating systemic glucose metabolism. The in vivo effect of iAs on insulin sensitivity has not been directly addressed. Here we use mouse models to dissect the dose-dependent effects of iAs on glucose metabolism in vivo. We performed hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, the gold standard analysis of systemic insulin sensitivity. We also performed dynamic metabolic testings and RNA-seq analysis. We found that a low-dose exposure (0.25 ppm iAs in drinking water) caused glucose intolerance in adult male C57BL/6 mice, likely by disrupting glucose-induced insulin secretion without affecting peripheral insulin sensitivity. However, a higher-dose exposure (2.5 ppm iAs) had diminished effects on glucose tolerance despite disrupted pancreatic insulin secretion. Insulin Clamp analysis showed that 2.5 ppm iAs actually enhanced systemic insulin sensitivity by simultaneously enhancing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscles and improved insulin-mediated suppression of endogenous glucose production. RNA-seq analysis of skeletal muscles revealed that 2.5 ppm iAs regulated expression of many genes involved in the metabolism of fatty acids, pyruvate, and amino acids. These findings suggest that iAs has opposite glycemic effects on distinct metabolic tissues at different dose thresholds. Such non-monotonic dose-response effects of iAs on glucose tolerance shed light on the complex interactions between iAs and the systemic glucose metabolism, which could potentially help reconcile some of the conflicting results in human epidemiological studies.

965,25054881,"Pyruvate carboxylase (PC) is an anaplerotic enzyme that regulates glucose-induced insulin secretion in pancreatic islets. Dysregulation of its expression is associated with type 2 diabetes. Herein we describe the molecular mechanism underlying the glucose-mediated transcriptional regulation of the PC gene. Incubation of the rat insulin cell line INS-1 832/13 with glucose resulted in a 2-fold increase in PC mRNA expression. Transient transfections of the rat PC promoter-luciferase reporter construct in the above cell line combined with mutational analysis indicated that the rat PC gene promoter contains the glucose-responsive element (GRE), comprising three canonical E-boxes (E1, E3 and E4) and one E-box-like element (E2) clustering between nucleotides -546 and -399, upstream of the transcription start site. Mutation of any of these E-boxes resulted in a marked reduction of glucose-mediated transcriptional induction of the reporter gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that the upstream stimulatory factors 1 and 2 (USF1 and USF2) bind to E1, the Specificity Protein-1 (Sp1) binds to E2, USF2 and the carbohydrate responsive element binding protein (ChREBP) binds to E4, while unknown factors binds to E3. High glucose promotes the recruitment of Sp1 to E2 and, USF2 and ChREBP to E4. Silencing the expression of Sp1, USF2 and ChREBP by their respective siRNAs in INS-1 832/13 cells blunted glucose-induced expression of endogenous PC. We conclude that the glucose-mediated transcriptional activation of the rat PC gene is regulated by at least these three transcription factors. "
966,37673783,"Mild Leydig cell insufficiency affects a substantial proportion of testicular cancer survivors. Previous studies have not shown a beneficial effect of testosterone replacement therapy, however, with a pronounced interindividual effect. Thus, biomarkers identifying the subgroups that might benefit are wanted. We aimed to determine if insulin-like factor 3 (INSL3), basal and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-stimulated testosterone can predict the effect of testosterone replacement therapy in testicular cancer survivors with mild Leydig cell insufficiency. We randomized adult testicular cancer survivors with mild Leydig cell insufficiency 1:1 to 12 months of transdermal testosterone replacement therapy (Tostran gel 2%) or placebo. INSL3, basal, and hCG-stimulated testosterone were measured at baseline. Outcomes (glucose, insulin, HbA1C, lipids, blood pressure, and body composition) were measured at baseline, 6 and 12 months. We applied a linear mixed-effect model comparing patients receiving testosterone with placebo in subgroups by biomarker. We included and randomized 69 patients between October 2016 and February 2018. Patients with INSL3 and hCG-stimulated testosterone concentrations below the median had a -1.7 kg (95% CI: -3.1, -0.4) and -2.0 kg (95% CI: -3.5, -0.6) change in fat mass after 12 months of testosterone replacement therapy compared with placebo. This was not the case in patients with INSL3 and hCG-stimulated testosterone above the median. We did not find any effect of these biomarkers on glucose, insulin, HbA1c, or lipids. Patients with INSL3 and hCG-stimulated testosterone concentrations below the median had decreased fat mass after 12 months of testosterone replacement therapy compared with placebo. It should be evaluated in larger trials if these biomarkers can be used as predictive markers identifying testicular cancer patients with mild Leydig cell insufficiency who might benefit from testosterone substitution.

967,25554688,"Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in infants and children for which there is no promising therapy at present. Previously, we reported induction of neuronal pentraxin 1 (NP1), a novel neuronal protein of the long-pentraxin family, following HI injury in neonatal brain. Here, we report that genetic deletion of NP1 expression prevents HI injury in neonatal brain. Elevated expression of NP1 was observed in neurons, not in astrocytes, of the ipsilateral cortical layers (I-IV) and in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 areas of WT brains following hypoxia-ischemia; brain areas that developed infarcts (at 24-48 h), showed significantly increased numbers of TUNEL-(+) cells and tissue loss (at 7 days). In contrast, NP1-KO mice showed no evidence of brain infarction and tissue loss after HI. The immunofluorescence staining of brain sections with mitochondrial protein COX IV and subcellular fractionation analysis showed increased accumulation of NP1 in mitochondria, pro-death protein Bax activation and NP1 co-localization with activated caspase-3 in WT, but not in the NP1-KO brains; corroborating NP1 interactions with the mitochondria-derived pro-death pathways. Disruption of NP1 translocation to mitochondria by NP1-siRNA in primary cortical cultures significantly reduced ischemic neuronal death. NP1 was immunoprecipitated with activated Bax [6A7] proteins; HI caused increased interactions of NP1 with Bax, thereby, facilitating Bax translocation to mitochondrial and neuronal death. To further delineate the specificity of NPs, we found that NP1 but not the NP2 induction is specifically involved in brain injury mechanisms and that knockdown of NP1 only results in neuroprotection. Furthermore, live in vivo T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including fractional anisotropy (FA) mapping showed no sign of delayed brain injury or tissue loss in the NP1-KO mice as compared to the WT at different post-HI periods (4-24 weeks) examined; indicating a long-term neuroprotective efficacy of NP1 gene deletion. Collectively, our results demonstrate a novel mechanism of neuronal death and predict that inhibition of NP1 expression is a promising strategy to prevent hypoxic-ischemic injury in immature brain. "
968,38347623,"Excessive energy intake in modern society has led to an epidemic surge in metabolic diseases, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, posing profound threats to women's reproductive health. However, the precise impact and underlying pathogenesis of energy excess on female reproduction remain unclear. We established an obese and hyperglycemic female mouse model induced by a high-fat and high-sucrose (HFHS) diet, then reproductive phenotypes of these mice were evaluated by examing sexual hormones, estrous cycles, and ovarian morphologies. Transcriptomic and precise metabolomic analyses of the ovaries were performed to compare the molecular and metabolic changes in HFHS mice. Finally, orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis was performed to compare the similarities of traits between HFHS mice and women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The HFHS mice displayed marked reproductive dysfunctions, including elevated serum testosterone and luteinizing hormone levels, irregular estrous cycles, and impaired folliculogenesis, mimicking the clinical manifestations of women with PCOS. Precise metabolomic overview suggested that HFHS diet disrupted amino acid metabolism in the ovaries of female mice. Additionally, transcriptional profiling revealed pronounced disturbances in ovarian steroid hormone biosynthesis and glucolipid metabolism in HFHS mice. Further multi-omics analyses unveiled prominent aberration in ovarian arginine biosynthesis pathway. Notably, comparisons between HFHS mice and a cohort of PCOS patients identified analogous reproductive and metabolic signatures. Our results provide direct in vivo evidence for the detrimental effects of overnutrition on female reproduction and offer insights into the metabolic underpinnings of PCOS. "
969,28359088,"Low plasma sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels are a hallmark in chronic metabolic diseases, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which represents a spectrum of disease ranging from hepatocellular steatosis through steatohepatitis to fibrosis and irreversible cirrhosis. The functional link between altered SHBG production and NAFLD development and progression remains unclear. We investigated the effects of overexpressing human SHBG in 2 mouse models of NAFLD: a genetically induced double transgenic mouse and a diet-induced model. Remarkably, SHBG overexpression in both NAFLD models significantly reduced liver fat accumulation by reducing key lipogenic enzymes. These findings were corroborated by modulating SHBG expression and by adding exogenous SHBG in HepG2 cells, suggesting the cell autonomous nature of the mechanism. Mechanistically, exogenous SHBG treatment downregulated key lipogenic enzymes by reducing PPARγ messenger RNA and protein levels through activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Taking together, we found that SHBG modulates hepatic lipogenesis. This is of importance because reduction of SHBG plasma levels in obese and type 2 diabetic subjects could be directly associated with NAFLD development through an increase in hepatic lipogenesis. Our results point to SHBG as a therapeutic target for preventing or arresting NAFLD development. "

The control group were swaddled, and received 0.2 ml of sterile water given by mouth using a syringe and a soother. The intervention group were swaddled, and received 0.2 ml of sucrose 24% given by mouth using a syringe and a soother. 40 infants were included in the study. There was no difference in mean gestational age at birth, mean birth weight or corrected gestational age at first examination between both groups.

To examine effects of hypoglycemia on oligodendrocytes and myelin formation, we studied cultured oligodendrocyte precursor cells and cerebellar slice cultures. We observed that with decreasing concentrations of glucose, oligodendrocyte precursor cell proliferation, maturation, and migration decreased. We also observed that hypoglycemia induced apoptotic cell death and activation of caspase-3 in oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Slice culture studies showed that glucose is required for myelinated fiber formation, as with reduction in the glucose concentration, the density of myelinated fibers decreased. Collectively, these data show that hypoglycemia inhibits oligodendrocyte development and myelination and that hypoglycemia triggers apoptotic cell death in oligodendrocyte precursor cells. "

All households in the villages agreed to participate in the study. Preintervention and postintervention serum folate levels were analyzed among study participants at baseline and after 4 months, respectively. Consumption of approximately 300 µg/d of folic acid using double fortified salt (folic acid plus iodine). Median serum folate concentrations were assessed at baseline and 4 months. Change in median serum folate levels between baseline and study end point as the primary outcome of the study. A total of 83 nonpregnant nonlactating women aged 20 to 44 years (mean [SD] age, 30.9 [5.1] years) were eligible for the study and provided serum samples for analysis at baseline and the end point of the intervention. The median serum folate concentration increased from 14.6 (IQR, 11.2-20.6) nmol/L at baseline to 54.4 (IQR, 43.5-54.4) nmol/L at end of study, a 3.7-fold increase from baseline to study end point. Two-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test showed the median difference in preintervention and postintervention serum folate concentrations to be highly significant (P < .001). The participants found the salt acceptable in color and taste. Use of folic acid-fortified iodized salt was associated with increased serum folate concentrations in women of reproductive age.

In addition, transwell assays and wound healing assays showed that CA inhibited the migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells. In vivo mouse models, CA inhibited the growth of osteosarcoma.

CA may inhibit the proliferation, migration, invasion and promote apoptosis of OS cells by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. CA may be a potentially effective anti-tumor drug.

976,36771243,"(1) Background: It was examined whether glucose-induced changes in the relative blood volume are suitable to identify subjects with and without type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) during hemodialysis. (2) Methods: The relative blood volume was continuously recorded during hemodialysis and perturbed by the infusion of glucose comparable to the dose used for intravenous glucose tolerance tests. Indices of glucose metabolism were determined by the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA). Body composition was measured by a bioimpedance analysis. The magnitude and the time course of hemodilution were described by a modified gamma variate model and five model parameters. (3) Results: A total of 34 subjects were studied, 14 with and 20 without T2D. The magnitude of the hemodilution and the selected model parameters correlated with measures of anthropometry, body mass index, absolute and relative fat mass, volume excess, baseline insulin concentration, and HOMA indices such as insulin resistance and glucose disposition in a continuous analysis, but were not different in a dichotomous analysis of patients with and without T2D. (4) Conclusions: Even though the parameters of the hemodilution curve were correlated with measures of impaired glucose metabolism and body composition, the distinction between subjects with and without T2D was not possible using glucose-induced changes in the relative blood volume during hemodialysis.

977,35442133,"Obesity is associated with the development of insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes for which exercise training (Ex) and dietary interventions (DI) are effective interventions that can improve IR. We therefore performed a systematic meta-analysis to compare the effect of Ex + DI compared with DI on IR and glucose homeostasis. PubMed and Cochrane Library were conducted up to May 2021. Meta-analyses were conducted to compare the effect of Ex + DI compared with DI on fasting glucose and insulin, IR and body weight. Standardized mean differences (SMDs), weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were computed using random or fixed effect models. Fifty studies involving 2864 participants with overweight or obesity were included in the meta-analysis. Ex + DI caused a larger decrease in fasting glucose ( Our results suggest that a combination of Ex and DI may be more effective than DI alone at improving IR and fasting glucose in individuals with overweight and obesity.

978,37728458,"Menstrual disorders in adolescent girls are a common clinical problem. They are often accompanied by lipid and glucose metabolism disturbances. The aim of the study was to investigate to what extent the metabolic profile of adolescent girls relates to the severity of their menstrual disorders. The study included 165 girls with menstrual disturbances and 49 regularly menstruating girls (REG) without clinical hyperandrogenism, matched for age and BMI. The subjects from the study group were divided into 2 subgroups: OLIGO - 111 girls with oligomenorrhea and SA - 54 girls with secondary amenorrhoea. In all girls, hormonal, lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism profiles were assessed. In the SA subgroup concentrations of total cholesterol (TC) and LDL were significantly higher than in the REG and OLIGO groups. Triglyceride (TG) concentration was also the highest in the SA group and significantly higher than in the REG group. The prevalence of lipid metabolism disorders was higher in the SA group (65%) vs. the REG (40%) and OLIGO (51%) groups. The subgroups did not differ significantly in terms of fasting and OGTT glucose and insulin as well as HOMA-IR. TyG index was significantly higher in the OLIGO and SA groups than in the REG group. BMI z-score correlated with TG, LDL, fasting and 120' OGTT glucose and insulin, HOMA-IR, and TyG and negatively with HDL. No relationship between hormonal concentration and metabolic disturbances was found. Adolescent girls with menstrual disorders are insulin resistant, regardless of PCOS diagnosis. The severity of menstrual disorders may be related to the incidence of lipid disorders in adolescent girls. Zaburzenia miesiączkowania u dorastających dziewcząt są istotnym problem klinicznym i często wiążą się z zaburzeniami gospodarki lipidowej i węglowodanowej. Celem pracy była ocena profilu metabolicznego u nastoletnich dziewcząt w zależności od ciężkości zaburzeń miesiączkowania. Badaniem objęto 165 dziewcząt z zaburzeniami miesiączkowania i 49 regularnie miesiączkujących dziewcząt bez cech hiperandrogenizmu (REG) dobranych pod względem wieku i BMI. Pacjentki grupy badanej podzielono na 2 podgrupy: OLIGO – 111 dziewcząt z oligomenorrhea i SA – 54 dziewczęta z wtórnym brakiem miesiączki. U wszystkich dziewcząt dokonano oceny gospodarki hormonalnej, lipidowej i węglowodanowej. U dziewcząt z grupy SA stężenia cholesterolu całkowitego (TC) i LDL (LDL) były istotnie wyższe niż w grupie REG i OLIGO. Stężenie triglicerydów (TG) było również najwyższe w SA i istotnie wyższe niż u dziewcząt regularnie miesiączkujących. Częstość występowania zaburzeń gospodarki lipidowej była wyższa w SA (65%) w porównaniu z REG (40%) i OLIGO (51%). Podgrupy nie różniły się istotnie pod względem stężenia glukozy i insuliny na czczo i w OGTT oraz HOMA-IR. Wskaźnik TyG był istotnie wyższy w OLIGO i SA niż w REG. BMI Z-score dodatnio korelowało z TG, LDL, glikemią i insuliną na czczo, stężeniem glukozy i insuliny w 120’ OGTT, HOMA-IR, TyG oraz ujemnie ze stężeniem HDL. Nie stwierdzono związku między stężeniem hormonów a zaburzeniami metabolicznymi. Dziewczęta z zaburzeniami miesiączkowania, niezależnie od diagnozy PCOS, charakteryzują się występowaniem insulinooporności. Ciężkość zaburzeń miesiączkowania może być związana z zaburzeniami gospodarki lipidowej. "
979,36999176,"Gliclazide was approved as a treatment for type 2 diabetes in an era before model-based drug development, and consequently, the recommended doses were not optimised with modern methods. To investigate various dosing regimens of gliclazide, we used publicly available data to characterise the dose-response relationship using pharmacometric models. A literature search identified 21 published gliclazide pharmacokinetic (PK) studies with full profiles. These were digitised, and a PK model was developed for immediate- (IR) and modified-release (MR) formulations. Data from a gliclazide dose-ranging study of postprandial glucose were used to characterise the concentration-response relationship using the integrated glucose-insulin model. Simulations from the full model showed that the maximum effect was 44% of the patients achieving HbA1c <7%, with 11% experiencing glucose <3 mmol/L and the most sensitive patients (i.e., 5% most extreme) experiencing 35 min of hypoglycaemia. Simulations revealed that the recommended IR dose (320 mg) was appropriate with no efficacy gain with increased dose. However, the recommended dose for the MR formulation may be increased to 270 mg, with more patients achieving HbA1c goals (i.e., HbA1c <7%) without a hypoglycaemic risk higher than the resulting risk from the recommended IR dose.

980,37300580,"Children with diabetes may display cognitive alterations although vascular disorders have not yet appeared. Variations in glucose levels together with relative insulin deficiency in treated type 1 diabetes have been reported to impact brain function indirectly through dysregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. We have recently shown that enhancement of glucocorticoid levels in children with type 1 diabetes is dependent not only on glucocorticoid secretion but also on glucocorticoid tissue concentrations, which is linked to 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) activity. Hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction and memory alteration were further dissected in a juvenile rat model of diabetes showing that excess 11β-HSD1 activity within the hippocampus is associated with hippocampal-dependent memory deficits. Here, to investigate the causal relationships between diabetes, 11β-HSD1 activity and hippocampus-dependent memory deficits, we evaluated the beneficial effect of 11β-HSD1 inhibition on hippocampal-related memory in juvenile diabetic rats. We also examined whether diabetes-associated enhancement of hippocampal 11β-HSD1 activity is due to an increase in brain glucose concentrations and/or a decrease in insulin signalling. Diabetes was induced in juvenile rats by daily i.p. injection of streptozotocin for 2 consecutive days. Inhibition of 11β-HSD1 was obtained by administrating the compound UE2316 twice daily by gavage for 3 weeks, after which hippocampal-dependent object location memory was assessed. Hippocampal 11β-HSD1 activity was estimated by the ratio of corticosterone/dehydrocorticosterone measured by LC/MS. Regulation of 11β-HSD1 activity in response to changes in glucose or insulin levels was determined ex vivo on acute brain hippocampal slices. The insulin regulation of 11β-HSD1 was further examined in vivo using virally mediated knockdown of insulin receptor expression specifically in the hippocampus. Our data show that inhibiting 11β-HSD1 activity prevents hippocampal-related memory deficits in diabetic juvenile rats. A significant increase (53.0±9.9%) in hippocampal 11β-HSD1 activity was found in hippocampal slices incubated in high glucose conditions (13.9 mmol/l) vs normal glucose conditions (2.8 mmol/l) without insulin. However, 11β-HSD1 activity was not affected by variations in insulin concentration either in the hippocampal slices or after a decrease in hippocampal insulin receptor expression. Together, these data demonstrate that an increase in 11β-HSD1 activity contributes to memory deficits observed in juvenile diabetic rats and that an excess of hippocampal 11β-HSD1 activity stems from high glucose levels rather than insulin deficiency. 11β-HSD1 might be a therapeutic target for treating cognitive impairments associated with diabetes.

981,29684832,"Sucrose combined with non-nutritive sucking provided better pain relief than sucrose or non-nutritive sucking alone in a single painful procedure. However, whether the combination of non-nutritive sucking with sucrose could obtain a significant difference in analgesic effect of the repeated procedural pain than any single intervention has not been established. To compare the effect of non-nutritive sucking and sucrose alone and in combination of repeated procedural pain in preterm infants. Randomized controlled trial. A level III neonatal intensive care unit of a university hospital in China. Preterm infants born before 37 weeks of gestation were randomly assigned to four groups: routine care group (routine comfort through gentle touch when infants cried; n = 21), non-nutritive sucking group (n = 22), sucrose group (0.2 ml/kg of 20%; n = 21), sucrose (0.2 ml/kg of 20%) plus non-nutritive sucking group (n = 22). Each preterm infant received three nonconsecutive routine heel sticks. Each heel stick included three phases: baseline (the last 1 min of the 30 min without stimuli), blood collection, recovery (1 min after blood collection). Three phases of 3 heel stick procedures were videotaped. Premature infant pain profile (PIPP) score, heart rate, oxygen saturation and percentage of crying time were assessed by five independent evaluators who were blinded to the purpose of the study at different phases across three heel sticks. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance, with repeated measures at different evaluation phases of heel stick. 86 preterm infants completed the protocol. During the blood collection and recovery phases, combination group, had lower PIPP score (4.4 ± 1.5; 3.0 ± 0.8), lower heart rate (138.6 ± 7.9; 137.4 ± 4.7), higher oxygen saturation (95.2 ± 1.6; 96.0 ± 1.2), and smaller percentage of crying time (11.5 ± 8.6; 4.6 ± 3.4), compared with the group has given non-nutritive sucking (9.3 ± 1.3, 6.8 ± 1.4; 154.2 ± 9.0, 148.0 ± 9.3; 92.9 ± 2.4, 94.1 ± 1.0; 44.2 ± 9.6, 31.2 ± 10.5; respectively) or sucrose (10.1 ± 2.0, 7.4 ± 1.6; 151.6 ± 9.6, 147.9 ± 6.9; 93.5 ± 1.7, 94.5 ± 1.2; 53.8 ± 16.7, 35.2 ± 13.9; respectively) or routine care (13.3 ± 1.6, 10.6 ± 1.9; 156.8 ± 7.2, 151.7 ± 7.9; 92.9 ± 2.1, 93.8 ± 1.6; 80.6 ± 7.6, 68.2 ± 9.9; respectively). Both non-nutritive sucking and sucrose were more effective in reducing preterm infants' PIPP score and percentage of crying time than routine care. There was no difference in PIPP score, heart rate, oxygen saturation and percentage of crying time between the non-nutritive sucking and sucrose groups. The combination of non-nutritive sucking with sucrose provided better pain relief during repeated painful procedures than when non-nutritive sucking or sucrose was used alone. The effect of non-nutritive sucking was similar to that of sucrose on repeated procedural pain. "
982,33228194,"The human placenta plays a key role in reproduction and serves as a major interface for maternofetal exchange of nutrients. Study of human placenta pathology presents a great experimental challenge because it is not easily accessible. In this paper, a 3D placenta-on-a-chip model is developed by bioengineering techniques to simulate the placental interface between maternal and fetal blood in vitro. In this model, trophoblasts cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells are cultured on the opposite sides of a porous polycarbonate membrane, which is sandwiched between two microfluidic channels. Glucose diffusion across this barrier is analyzed under shear flow conditions. Meanwhile, a numerical model of the 3D placenta-on-a-chip model is developed. Numerical results of concentration distributions and the convection-diffusion mass transport is compared to the results obtained from the experiments for validation. Finally, effects of flow rate and membrane porosity on glucose diffusion across the placental barrier are studied using the validated numerical model. The placental model developed here provides a potentially helpful tool to study a variety of other processes at the maternal-fetal interface, for example, effects of drugs or infections like malaria on transport of various substances across the placental barrier.

985,12070142,"Insulin-resistant states are characterized by hypertriglyceridemia, predominantly because of overproduction of hepatic very low density lipoprotein particles. The additional contribution of intestinal lipoprotein overproduction to the dyslipidemia of insulin-resistant states has not been previously appreciated. Here, we have investigated intestinal lipoprotein production in a fructose-fed hamster model of insulin resistance previously documented to have whole body and hepatic insulin resistance, and hepatic very low density lipoprotein overproduction. Chronic fructose feeding for 3 weeks induced significant oversecretion of apolipoprotein B48 (apoB48)-containing lipoproteins in the fasting state and during steady state fat feeding, based on (a) in vivo Triton WR1339 studies of apoB48 production as well as (b) ex vivo pulse-chase labeling of intestinal enterocytes from fasted and fed hamsters. ApoB48 particle overproduction was accompanied by increased intracellular apoB48 stability, enhanced lipid synthesis, higher abundance of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein mass, and a significant shift toward the secretion of larger chylomicron-like particles. ApoB48 particle overproduction was not observed with short-term fructose feeding or in vitro incubation of enterocytes with fructose. Secretion of intestinal apoB48 and triglyceride was closely linked to intestinal enterocyte de novo lipogenesis, which was up-regulated in fructose-fed hamsters. Inhibition of fatty acid synthesis by cerulenin, a fatty acid synthase inhibitor, resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in intestinal apoB48 secretion. Overall, these findings further suggest that intestinal overproduction of apoB48 lipoproteins should also be considered as a major contributor to the fasting and postprandial dyslipidemia observed in response to chronic fructose feeding and development of an insulin-resistant state.

986,33914231,"Adequate iodine intake is necessary for normal thyroid function. Iodine deficiency is associated with serious complications, but also iodine excess can lead to thyroid dysfunction, and iodine supplementation aimed to prevent iodine deficiency disorders has been associated with development of thyroid autoimmunity. The epidemiology of thyroid diseases has undergone profound changes since the implementation of iodoprophylaxis, notably by means of iodine-enriched salt, specifically resulting in decreased prevalence of goiter and neonatal hypothyroidism, improved cognitive function development in infancy, and reduced incidence of more aggressive forms of thyroid cancer. The main question we address with this review is the clinical relevance of the possible effect on autoimmunity exerted by the use of iodine-enriched salt to correct iodine deficiency. In animal models, exogenous iodine is able to trigger or exacerbate thyroid autoimmunity, but it is still not clear whether the observed immunological changes are due to a direct effect of iodine on immune response, or whether they represent a secondary response to a toxic effect of iodine on thyroid tissue. Previous iodine status of a population seems to influence the functional thyroid response to increased iodine intake and possibly the development of thyroid autoimmunity. Moreover, the prevalence of thyroid antibodies, regarded as hallmark of autoimmune thyroid disease, varies between populations under the influence of genetic and environmental factors, and the presence of thyroid antibodies does not always coincide with the presence of thyroid disease or its future development. In addition, the incidence of autoimmune diseases shows a general increasing trend in the last decades. For all these reasons, available data are quite heterogeneous and difficult to analyze and compare. In conclusion, available data from long-term population surveys show that a higher than adequate population iodine intake due to a poorly controlled program of iodine prophylaxis could induce thyroid dysfunction, including thyroid autoimmunity mostly represented by euthyroid or subclinical hypothyroid autoimmune thyroiditis. Close monitoring iodine prophylaxis is therefore advised to ensure that effects of both iodine deficiency and iodine excess are avoided. "
987,36250331,"Combination of Rivaroxaban plus Aspirin improved cardiovascular outcome in patients with stable cardiovascular disease. The aim was to determine if Rivaroxaban and acetylsalicylic acid alone or in combination may protect mitochondrial mitophagy in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) exposed to D-glucose. HCAEC were incubated under different conditions: 5 mmol/L glucose D-glucose (control), 30 mmol/L D-Glucose with and without 50 nmol/L Rivaroxaban (Rivaroxaban), 0.33 mmol/L ASA (ASA) or Rivaroxaban (12.5 nmol/L)+ASA (0.33 mmol/L; (Riva+ASA). HCAEC incubated with D-glucose showed an increased Factor Xa expression. The mitochondrial content of Pink-1 and Parkin were significantly reduced in high glucose-incubated HCAEC compared to control. Rivaroxaban+ASA significantly increased the mitochondrial content of Pink-1 and Parkin, and the mitochondrial membrane potential compared to D-Glucose group. Both ASA alone and Riva+ASA reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and tissue factor production induced by high glucose exposure. Under high glucose condition combining Rivaroxaban+ASA increased the mitochondrial content of Pink-1 and Parkin, restored mitochondria membrane potential and reduced ROS and tissue factor expression in HCAEC. It suggests potential effects induced by dual use of Rivaroxaban and ASA on the coronary endothelium subjected to high glucose condition. "
988,26012374,"A rare sugar, D-allulose (also called D-psicose), has recently been applied as a food supplement in view of controlling diabetes and obesity in Japan. D-allulose has been proven to have unique effects against hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in a number of studies using several species of rats and mice. However, the antiobesity effects of D-allulose have not yet been assessed in Lep(ob)/Lep(ob) (ob/ob) mice. Therefore, this study explored the dietary supplemental effects of this sugar in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Consequently, the subchronic ingestion of D-allulose in ob/ob mice for 15 wk significantly decreased the body and liver weights, and the loss of body weight was involved in the reduction of the total fat mass, including abdominal visceral fat, and not fat-free body mass, including muscle. Furthermore, D-allulose improved hepatic steatosis, as evaluated using hepatic histological studies and MRI. In the normal mice, none of these parameters were influenced by the single or long-term ingestion of D-allulose. These results indicate that dietary supplementation of D-allulose especially influences postprandial hyperglycemia and obesity-related hepatic steatosis, without exercise therapy or dietary restriction. Therefore, D-allulose may be useful as a supplement for preventing and improving obesity and obesity-related disorders. "
989,33689522,"The use of the ketogenic diet (KD) as an adjuvant therapy in high-grade gliomas (HGG) is supported by preclinical studies, but clinical data on its effects on metabolism are currently lacking. In this study, we describe the effects of a KD on glucose profile, ketonemia, energy metabolism, and nutritional status, in adults affected by HGG. This was a single-arm prospective study. An isocaloric 3:1 KD was administered for 1 mo. Glucose profile was assessed by using fasting glycemia, insulin, and glycated hemoglobin. To evaluate ketonemia changes, a hand-held ketone meter was used from home. Energy metabolism was assessed by indirect calorimetry. Nutritional status was evaluated through changes in body composition and in lipid and hepatic profile. No changes in fasting glycemia were observed; however, insulinemia dropped to half of baseline levels. The KD shifted the metabolism, rising ketonemia and decreasing glucose oxidation rate to a quarter of the initial values. Moreover, the KD was generally safe. One-month intervention with the KD was able to act upon key metabolic substrates potentially involved in HGG metabolism. The lack of a significant reduction in fasting glycemia should be investigated in future studies. "
990,27922722,"Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent unprovoked seizures. It is believed that with effective drug treatment, up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to become seizure-free and go into long-term remission shortly after starting drug therapy, the majority of which may be able to achieve remission with a single antiepileptic drug (AED).The correct choice of first-line antiepileptic therapy for individuals with newly diagnosed seizures is of great importance. It is important that the choice of AED for an individual is based on the highest-quality evidence available regarding the potential benefits and harms of various treatments. It is also important to compare the efficacy and tolerability of AEDs appropriate to given seizure types.Topiramate and carbamazepine are commonly used AEDs. Performing a synthesis of the evidence from existing trials will increase the precision of results of outcomes relating to efficacy and tolerability, and may help inform a choice between the two drugs. To assess the effects of topiramate monotherapy versus carbamazepine monotherapy for epilepsy in people with partial-onset seizures (simple or complex partial and secondarily generalised) or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types). We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (14 April 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (14 April 2016) and MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 14 April 2016). We imposed no language restrictions. We also contacted pharmaceutical companies and trial investigators. Randomised controlled trials in children or adults with partial-onset seizures or generalised-onset tonic-clonic seizures with or without other generalised seizure types with a comparison of monotherapy with either topiramate or carbamazepine. This was an individual participant data (IPD) review. Our primary outcome was 'time to withdrawal of allocated treatment', and our secondary outcomes were 'time to first seizure post randomisation', 'time to 6-month remission, 'time to 12-month remission' and incidence of adverse events. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain trial-specific estimates of hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and used the generic inverse variance method to obtain the overall pooled HRs and 95% CIs. IPD were available for 1151 of 1239 eligible individuals from two of three eligible studies (93% of the potential data). A small proportion of individuals recruited into these trials had 'unclassified seizures;' for analysis purposes, these individuals are grouped with those with generalised onset seizures. For remission outcomes, a HR < 1 indicated an advantage for carbamazepine, and for first seizure and withdrawal outcomes, a HR < 1 indicated an advantage for topiramate.The main overall results, given as pooled HR adjusted for seizure type (95% CI) were: for time to withdrawal of allocated treatment 1.16 (0.98 to 1.38); time to first seizure 1.11 (0.96 to 1.29); and time to 6-month remission 0.88 (0.76 to 1.01). There were no statistically significant differences between the drugs. A statistically significant advantage for carbamazepine was shown for time to 12-month remission: 0.84 (0.71 to 1.00).The results of this review are applicable mainly to individuals with partial-onset seizures; 85% of included individuals experienced seizures of this type at baseline. For individuals with partial-onset seizures, a statistically significant advantage for carbamazepine was shown for time to withdrawal of allocated treatment (HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.45) and time to 12-month remission (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.00). No statistically significant differences were apparent between the drugs for other outcomes and for the limited number of individuals with generalised-onset tonic-clonic seizures with or without other generalised seizure types or unclassified seizures.The most commonly reported adverse events with both drugs were drowsiness or fatigue, 'pins and needles' (tingling sensation), headache, gastrointestinal disturbance and anxiety or depression The rate of adverse events was similar across the two drugs.We judged the methodological quality of the included trials generally to be good; however, there was some evidence that the open-label design of the larger of the two trials may have influenced the withdrawal rate from the trial. Hence, we judged the evidence for the primary outcome of treatment withdrawal to be moderate for individuals with partial-onset seizures and low for individuals with generalised-onset seizures. For efficacy outcomes (first seizure, remission), we judged the evidence from this review to be high for individuals with partial-onset seizures and moderate for individuals with generalised-onset or unclassified seizures. For individuals with partial-onset seizures, there is evidence that carbamazepine is less likely to be withdrawn and that 12-month remission will be achieved earlier than with topiramate. No differences were found between the drugs in terms of the outcomes measured in the review for individuals with generalised tonic-clonic seizures with or without other seizure types or unclassified epilepsy; however, we encourage caution in the interpretation of these results due to the small numbers of participants with these seizure types.We recommend that future trials should be designed to the highest quality possible and take into consideration masking, choice of population, classification of seizure type, duration of follow-up, choice of outcomes and analysis, and presentation of results.

994,35192689,"Finding therapies that can protect and expand functional β-cell mass is a major goal of diabetes research. Here, we generated β-cell-specific conditional knockout and gain-of-function mouse models and used human islet transplant experiments to examine how manipulating Nrf2 levels affects β-cell survival, proliferation, and mass. Depletion of Nrf2 in β-cells results in decreased glucose-stimulated β-cell proliferation ex vivo and decreased adaptive β-cell proliferation and β-cell mass expansion after a high-fat diet in vivo. Nrf2 protects β-cells from apoptosis after a high-fat diet. Nrf2 loss of function decreases Pdx1 abundance and insulin content. Activating Nrf2 in a β-cell-specific manner increases β-cell proliferation and mass and improves glucose tolerance. Human islets transplanted under the kidney capsule of immunocompromised mice and treated systemically with bardoxolone methyl, an Nrf2 activator, display increased β-cell proliferation. Thus, by managing reactive oxygen species levels, Nrf2 regulates β-cell mass and is an exciting therapeutic target for expanding and protecting β-cell mass in diabetes. "
995,33164750,"We determined differential gene expression in response to high glucose in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from matched individuals with type 1 diabetes with and without retinopathy. Those genes exhibiting the largest difference in glucose response were assessed for association with diabetic retinopathy in a genome-wide association study meta-analysis. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) of the glucose response genes were tested for association with diabetic retinopathy. We detected an enrichment of the eQTLs from the glucose response genes among small association p-values and identified folliculin ( One of the side effects of diabetes is loss of vision from diabetic retinopathy, which is caused by injury to the light sensing tissue in the eye, the retina. Almost all individuals with diabetes develop diabetic retinopathy to some extent, and it is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in working-age adults in the United States. How long a person has been living with diabetes, the extent of increased blood sugars and genetics all contribute to the risk and severity of diabetic retinopathy. Unfortunately, virtually no genes associated with diabetic retinopathy have yet been identified. When a gene is activated, it produces messenger molecules known as mRNA that are used by cells as instructions to produce proteins. The analysis of mRNA molecules, as well as genes themselves, can reveal the role of certain genes in disease. The studies of all genes and their associated mRNAs are respectively called genomics and transcriptomics. Genomics reveals what genes are present, while transcriptomics shows how active genes are in different cells. Skol et al. developed methods to study genomics and transcriptomics together to help discover genes that cause diabetic retinopathy. Genes involved in how cells respond to high blood sugar were first identified using cells grown in the lab. By comparing the activity of these genes in people with and without retinopathy the study identified genes associated with an increased risk of retinopathy in diabetes. In people with retinopathy, the activity of the folliculin gene (FLCN) increased more in response to high blood sugar. This was further verified with independent groups of people and using computer models to estimate the effect of different versions of the folliculin gene. The methods used here could be applied to understand complex genetics in other diseases. The results provide new understanding of the effects of diabetes. They may also help in the development of new treatments for diabetic retinopathy, which are likely to improve on the current approach of using laser surgery or injections into the eye. "

There were no safety concerns in the hydroxychloroquine arm, including in annual ophthalmologic examinations. Preplanned secondary analyses showed a transient decrease in the glucose average area under the curve to oral glucose in the hydroxychloroquine-treated arm at month 6 and reduced titers of anti-GAD and anti-insulin autoantibodies and acquisition of positive autoantibodies in the hydroxychloroquine arm (P = 0.032). We conclude that hydroxychloroquine does not delay progression to stage 2 T1D in individuals with stage 1 disease. Drug treatment reduces the acquisition of additional autoantibodies and the titers of autoantibodies to GAD and insulin. "
997,25374274,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is affecting more than 382 million people worldwide. Although much progress has been made, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying disease mechanism is still lacking. Here we report a role for the β-cell primary cilium in type 2 diabetes susceptibility. We find impaired glucose handling in young Bbs4(-/-) mice before the onset of obesity. Basal body/ciliary perturbation in murine pancreatic islets leads to impaired first phase insulin release ex and in vivo. Insulin receptor is recruited to the cilium of stimulated β-cells and ciliary/basal body integrity is required for activation of downstream targets of insulin signalling. We also observe a reduction in the number of ciliated β-cells along with misregulated ciliary/basal body gene expression in pancreatic islets in a diabetic rat model. We suggest that ciliary function is implicated in insulin secretion and insulin signalling in the β-cell and that ciliary dysfunction could contribute to type 2 diabetes susceptibility. "
998,20368306,"Chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD) is associated with peritoneal calcification. Studies in vascular tissue suggest that ectopic calcification is not merely a passive but a regulated process resembling bone mineralization. We investigated whether peritoneal calcification is controlled by matrix Gla protein (MGP) secreted by peritoneal mesothelial cells. Human primary mesothelial cells (HPMC) were exposed to constituents of PD fluids and to cytokines relevant to peritoneal integrity. Messenger RNA was quantitated by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), protein abundance by Western blot and in vivo protein expression immunohistochemically. To demonstrate functional relevance, MGP was silenced in HPMC by siRNA transfection and calcium phosphate matrix deposition measured by o-cresolphthalein complexone method and von Kossa staining. MGP was consistently detected in the mesothelial cell layer of peritoneal tissue specimens from uraemic and non-uraemic patients, in HPMC and in culture medium. MGP mRNA and protein abundance was increased by glucose and IGF1 and decreased by TGFß1. Suppression of MGP increased matrix calcium and phosphorus deposition by 90 ± 6% and 100 ± 4% at 1 mM ambient Ca(2+) and phosphorus concentration. Deposition was not increased any further by higher medium Ca(2+)/phosphorus concentrations nor reduced by inhibition of the phosphate cotransporter Pit1. MGP is expressed by HPMC and regulated by glucose, IGF1 and TGFß1. It is a potent inhibitor of calcification in vitro and may thus play a role in the regulation of peritoneal calcium homeostasis. "
999,34059146,"High sodium intake was an established risk factor for stroke and cardiovascular diseases. The objective of this study was to investigate factors associated with high sodium intake based on 24-h urinary sodium excretion from the MyCoSS study. The cross-sectional survey was conducted among adults aged 18 years and above in Malaysia. A multi-stage stratified sampling was used to represent nationally. Twenty-four-hour urine was collected from a total of 900 respondents. Indirect ion-selective electrode (ISE) method was used to measure sodium intake. Descriptive and logistic regression analysis was applied to determine factors associated with high sodium intake based on 24-h urinary sodium excretion. A total of 798 respondents (76% response rate) completed the 24-h urine collection process. Logistic regression revealed that high sodium intake associated with obese [aOR 2.611 (95% CI 1.519, 4.488)], male [aOR 2.436 (95% CI 1.473, 4.030)], having a waist circumference of > 90cm for adult males [aOR 2.260 ( 95% CI 1.020, 5.009) and >80cm for adult females [aOR 1.210 (95% CI 0.556, 2.631)], being a young adult [aOR 1.977 (95% CI 1.094, 3.574)], and living in urban areas [aOR 1.701 (95% CI 1.094, 2.645)]. Adults who are obese, have a large waist circumference, of male gender, living in urban areas, and belonging to the young adult age group were found to have higher sodium intake than other demographic groups. Hence, reduction of salt consumption among these high-risk groups should be emphasised to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. "
1000,34001614,"The concept that gut microbiome-expressed functions regulate ponderal growth has important implications for infant and child health, as well as animal health. Using an intergenerational pig model of diet restriction (DR) that produces reduced weight gain, we developed a feature-selection algorithm to identify representative characteristics distinguishing DR fecal microbiomes from those of full-fed (FF) pigs as both groups consumed a common sequence of diets during their growth cycle. Gnotobiotic mice were then colonized with DR and FF microbiomes and subjected to controlled feeding with a pig diet. DR microbiomes have reduced representation of genes that degrade dominant components of late growth-phase diets, exhibit reduced production of butyrate, a key host-accessible energy source, and are causally linked to reduced hepatic fatty acid metabolism (β-oxidation) and the selection of alternative energy substrates. The approach described could aid in the development of guidelines for microbiome stewardship in diverse species, including farm animals, in order to support their healthy growth. "

1002,33619380,"Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of individuals with obesity do not suffer cardiometabolic comorbidities. The mechanisms that uncouple adiposity from its cardiometabolic complications are not fully understood. Here, we identify 62 loci of which the same allele is significantly associated with both higher adiposity and lower cardiometabolic risk. Functional analyses show that the 62 loci are enriched for genes expressed in adipose tissue, and for regulatory variants that influence nearby genes that affect adipocyte differentiation. Genes prioritized in each locus support a key role of fat distribution (FAM13A, IRS1 and PPARG) and adipocyte function (ALDH2, CCDC92, DNAH10, ESR1, FAM13A, MTOR, PIK3R1 and VEGFB). Several additional mechanisms are involved as well, such as insulin-glucose signalling (ADCY5, ARAP1, CREBBP, FAM13A, MTOR, PEPD, RAC1 and SH2B3), energy expenditure and fatty acid oxidation (IGF2BP2), browning of white adipose tissue (CSK, VEGFA, VEGFB and SLC22A3) and inflammation (SH2B3, DAGLB and ADCY9). Some of these genes may represent therapeutic targets to reduce cardiometabolic risk linked to excess adiposity. "
1003,38184738,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) poses an additional risk for the development of coronary artery disease and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE). In this study, we investigated the association between MetS and its components and MACCE after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The presence of MetS was calculated at baseline using the NCEP-ATP III criteria. The primary outcome was MACCE and its components were secondary outcomes. Unadjusted and adjusted Cox Regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the association between MetS or its components and MACCE and its components. A total of 13,459 ACS patients who underwent PCI (MetS: 7939 and non-MetS: 5520) with a mean age of 62.7 ± 11.0 years (male: 72.5%) were included and median follow-up time was 378 days. Patients with MetS had significantly higher MACCE risk (adjusted HR [aHR] 1.22, 95% CI 1.08-1.39). The only component of MACCE that exhibited a significantly higher incidence in MetS patients was myocardial infarction (aHR 1.43, 95% CI 1.15-1.76). MetS components that were significantly associated with a higher incidence of MACCE were hypertension and impaired fasting glucose. Having three MetS components did not increase MACCE (aHR 1.12, 95% CI 0.96-1.30) while having four (aHR 1.32, 95% CI 1.13-1.55) or five (aHR 1.42, 95% CI 1.15-1.75) MetS components was associated with a higher incidence of MACCE. MetS was associated with a higher risk of MACCE in ACS patients undergoing PCI. Among MACCE components, myocardial infarction was significantly higher in patients with MetS. Impaired fasting glucose and hypertension were associated with a higher risk of MACCE. Identifying these patterns can guide clinicians in choosing appropriate preventive measures. "

1005,20445127,"Fortunately, the majority of children conceived through assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) appear healthy; however, metabolic abnormalities, including elevated glucose and increased and altered adipose tissue deposition, have been reported in adolescents. To parse out factors that may be responsible, we investigated the effects of two different ARTs--in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)--as well as somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) on glucose clearance, body weight, and body composition of young adult mice. Female and male mice generated through ART weighed more than control (naturally conceived [STOCK]) mice at birth. No differences in body weight were observed in males up to 8 wk of age. ART females took longer than control mice to clear a glucose bolus, with glucose clearance most impaired in SCNT females. IVF females secreted more insulin and had a higher insulin peak 15 min after glucose injection compared with all other groups. Male mice exhibited no differences in glucose clearance, but IVF males required more insulin to do so. SCNT females weighed more than IVF, ICSI, and STOCK females, and they had higher fat content than ICSI females and higher leptin levels than all other groups. These results show that glucose parameters are altered in young adult mice conceived through techniques associated with ART before onset of obesity and may be responsible for its development later in life. The present study suggests that more investigation regarding the long-term effects of manipulations associated with ART is warranted. "
1006,32147586,"Hypoxia and cerebral ischemia (HI) events are capable of triggering important changes in brain metabolism, including glucose metabolism abnormalities, which may be related to the severity of the insult. Using positron emission microtomography (microPET) with [ Seven-day-old rats were subjected to an HI model, induced by permanent occlusion of the right common carotid artery and systemic hypoxia.  Brain glucose metabolism changes were observed in adult rats after neonatal HI insult, limited to the right brain hemisphere. However, not all HI animals exhibited significant cerebral hypometabolism. Hippocampal glucose metabolism was used to stratify HI animals into HI hypometabolic (HI-h) and HI non-hypometabolic (HI non-h) groups. The HI-h group had drastic MBN disturbance, cognitive deficit, and brain tissue loss, concomitantly. Conversely, HI non-h rats had normal brain glucose metabolism and brain tissue preserved, but also presented MBN changes and spatial memory impairment. Furthermore, data showed that brain glucose metabolism correlated with cognitive deficits and brain volume outcomes. Our findings demonstrated that long-term changes in MBN drive memory impairments in adult rats subjected to neonatal hypoxic ischemia, using in vivo imaging microPET-FDG. The MBN analyses identified glucose metabolism abnormalities in HI non-h animals, which were not detected by conventional  "
1007,29868913,"Data on saturated fatty acids (SFAs) in relation to metabolic function and glucose homeostasis remain controversial. Such data are lacking among pregnant women. We prospectively investigated objectively measured individual and subclasses of plasma phospholipid SFAs throughout pregnancy in relation to cardiometabolic markers and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk. Within the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Fetal Growth Studies-Singleton Cohort of 2802 singleton pregnancies, 107 GDM cases were ascertained via medical record review and matched to 214 non-GDM controls on age, race/ethnicity, and gestational week (GW) at blood collection. Individual plasma phospholipid SFA concentrations were repeatedly measured throughout pregnancy at GWs 10-14, 15-26, 23-31, and 33-39 and also grouped into subclasses of even- or odd-chain SFAs. From GW 10, even-chain SFA concentrations were significantly higher among women who later developed GDM, whereas odd-chain SFAs were significantly lower among GDM cases compared with controls. At GWs 10-14, the SFA palmitic acid (16:0) was positively associated with impaired insulin resistance and cardiometabolic markers and the risk of GDM [adjusted OR comparing the highest with the lowest quartile (aORQ4-Q1): 4.76; 95% CI: 1.72, 13.10; P-trend = 0.001]. In contrast, odd-chain SFAs were inversely related to the previously mentioned markers and GDM risk [aORQ4-Q1 for pentadecanoic acid (15:0): 0.32; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.92; P-trend = 0.025; for heptadecanoic acid (17:0): 0.20; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.58; P-trend = 0.003]. Women with high (median or greater) even-chain SFA concentrations and low (less than median) odd-chain SFAs had a 9.43-fold (95%: CI 3.26-, 27.30-fold) increased risk compared with women with low even-chain and high odd-chain SFA concentrations. Similar results were observed at GWs 15-26. The study provided one of the first lines of evidence suggesting that circulating concentrations of SFAs varying by SFA chain length, as early as GWs 10-14, were significantly and differentially associated with subsequent risk of GDM. Our findings highlight the importance of assessing objectively measured, individual, and subclasses of SFAs to investigate their distinct biological and pathophysiologic roles in glucose homeostasis and cardiometabolic outcomes.

1008,32956634,"In view of a growing need for new treatment options for human cystic echinococcosis (CE), we aimed to investigate the efficacy of mTOR pathway inhibitors against CE in vitro and in vivo. Among the seven mTOR inhibitors evaluated, tacrolimus (TAC) showed significant dose- and time-dependent killing of cultured protoscoleces and cysts in vitro. Notably, the oral administration of TAC (4 mg/kg/day) to CE mice model highly effectively reduced both the weight and number of parasitic cysts. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that TAC destroys the ultrastructure of cysts, both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, TAC had no significant effect on blood glucose, body weight, liver, or kidney functions in mice. We further observed that the ATP levels and glucose content of cysts reduced upon TAC treatment, indicating that inhibiting mTORC1 activity possibly affects glucose metabolism in the cysts of mice. Based on our experimental data, TAC emerged as a promising anti-cyst drug that efficiently inhibits the growth of cysts. "

Thus, increasing the number of available functional β-cells ex vivo for transplantation, or regenerating them in situ in diabetic patients, is a major focus of diabetes research. The transcription factor, Myc, discovered decades ago lies at the nexus of most, if not all, known proliferative pathways. Based on this, many studies in the 1990s and early 2000s explored the potential of harnessing Myc expression to expand β-cells for diabetes treatment. Nearly all these studies in β-cells used pathophysiological or supraphysiological levels of Myc and reported enhanced β-cell death, dedifferentiation, or the formation of insulinomas if cooverexpressed with Bcl-xL, an inhibitor of apoptosis. This obviously reduced the enthusiasm for Myc as a therapeutic target for β-cell regeneration. However, recent studies indicate that ""gentle"" induction of Myc expression enhances β-cell replication without induction of cell death or loss of insulin secretion, suggesting that appropriate levels of Myc could have therapeutic potential for β-cell regeneration. Furthermore, although it has been known for decades that Myc is induced by glucose in β-cells, very little is known about how this essential anabolic transcription factor perceives and responds to nutrients and increased insulin demand in vivo. Here we summarize the previous and recent knowledge of Myc in the β-cell, its potential for β-cell regeneration, and its physiological importance for neonatal and adaptive β-cell expansion. "

Information on BF practices was collected via surveys in the MARBLES (Markers of Autism Risk in Babies-Learning Early Signs) study. Developmental evaluations, including the Mullen Scales of Early Learning and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, were conducted by expert clinicians. Participants' neurodevelopmental outcome was classified by an algorithm into three groups: typical development, ASD, and non-typical development. The median duration of BF was 10.70 months (interquartile range of 12.07 months). There were no significant differences in the distribution of duration of BF among the three neurodevelopmental outcome categories. Children in this enriched-likelihood cohort who were breastfed for > 12 months had significantly higher scores on cognitive testing compared to those who were breastfed for 0-3 months. There was no significant difference in ASD symptomatology or ASD risk based on BF duration. "
1013,38664368,"Obesity is one of the diseases with severe health consequences and rapidly increasing worldwide prevalence. Understanding the complex network of food intake and energy balance regulation is an essential prerequisite for pharmacological intervention with obesity. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are among the main modulators of metabolism and energy balance. They, for instance, regulate appetite and satiety in certain hypothalamic neurons, as well as glucose and lipid metabolism and hormone secretion from adipocytes. Mutations in some GPCRs, such as the melanocortin receptor type 4 (MC4R), have been associated with early-onset obesity. Here, we identified the adhesion GPCR latrophilin 1 (ADGRL1/LPHN1) as a member of the regulating network governing food intake and the maintenance of energy balance. Deficiency of the highly conserved receptor in mice results in increased food consumption and severe obesity, accompanied by dysregulation of glucose homeostasis. Consistently, we identified a partially inactivating mutation in human ADGRL1/LPHN1 in a patient suffering from obesity. Therefore, we propose that LPHN1 dysfunction is a risk factor for obesity development. "

The HAPO Follow-Up Study included 4747 women who had a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at ~28 weeks' gestation. Of these, 4572 women who did not have chronic hypertension during their pregnancy or other excluding factors, had blood pressure evaluation 10-14 years after the birth of their HAPO child. Primary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 and/or DBP ≥ 90 or treatment for hypertension) at follow-up. Blood pressure during pregnancy was associated with all blood pressure outcomes at follow-up independent of glucose and insulin sensitivity during pregnancy. The sum of glucose z-scores was associated with blood pressure outcomes at follow-up but associations were attenuated in models that included pregnancy blood pressure measures. Associations with SBP were significant in adjusted models, while associations with DBP and hypertension were not. Insulin sensitivity during pregnancy was associated with all blood pressure outcomes at follow-up, and although attenuated after adjustments, remained statistically significant (hypertension OR 0.79, 95%CI 0.68-0.92; SBP beta -0.91, 95% CI -1.34 to -0.49; DBP beta -0.50, 95% CI -0.81 to -0.19). In conclusion, maternal glucose values at the pregnancy OGTT were not independently associated with maternal blood pressure outcomes 10-14 years postpartum; however, insulin sensitivity during pregnancy was associated independently of blood pressure, BMI, and other covariates measured during pregnancy.

1016,37794178,"Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) is commonly considered a master regulator of cellular oxidation, regulating the expression and function of Thioredoxin (Trx). Recent work has identified that TXNIP has a far wider range of additional roles: from regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, to cell cycle arrest and inflammation. Its expression is increased by stressors commonly found in neoplastic cells and the wider tumor microenvironment (TME), and, as such, TXNIP has been extensively studied in cancers. In this review, we evaluate the current literature regarding the regulation and the function of TXNIP, highlighting its emerging role in modulating signaling between different cell types within the TME. We then assess current and future translational opportunities and the associated challenges in this area. An improved understanding of the functions and mechanisms of TXNIP in cancers may enhance its suitability as a therapeutic target. "

In the nested subcohort, E+ women had a slightly increased HbA1c at the first GDM visit and a higher need for glucose-lowering medication (both p ≤ 0.014), but HbA1c at the end of pregnancy and other cardio-metabolic, mental health, obstetric and neonatal outcomes during pregnancy were similar. The pandemic was not associated with any clinically relevant worsening of cardio-metabolic, mental health, obstetrical and neonatal outcomes in our GDM cohort. This was possibly due to a continued hybrid follow-up, and the partial lockdown in Switzerland. "
1018,38195688,"This study demonstrates the effect and DNA methylation-related mechanisms of a high-salt diet and salt memory-induced hypertension and vasculopathy. Thirty Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into a control (CON) group (n = 6) and a modeling group (n = 24). A 12% NaCl solution (1 mL/100 g) was intragastrically administered for 60 consecutive days for modeling. An increase in blood pressure up to 140 mmHg was considered successful modeling. Twelve of fifteen successfully modeled rats were randomly selected and divided into a High Salt Diet (HSD) group and a High Salt Memory (HSM) group (n = 6). Rats in HSD group were intragastrically administered a 12% NaCl solution, while rats in HSM group were administered a 3% NaCl solution twice a day for 30 days. At the end of the intervention, blood pressure and the serum levels of ET-1, NO, TNF-α and IL-1β were measured. RRBS-heavy sulfite sequencing technology was selected for DNA methylation analysis. The systolic blood pressure of rats in the HSD group and HSM group was significantly higher than that in the CON group. Compared with those in the CON group, the serum levels of ET-1 in the HSM group and the serum levels of NO in the HSD group and HSM group were significantly increased. The methylation level of the CON group was lower than that of the HSD group and the HSM group, and there was no significant difference between the HSD group and the HSM group. The methylation level of Myoz3 was downregulated in the HSD group and HSM group. The methylation level of Fgd3 were upregulated in HSD group and downregulated in the HSM group. The methylation levels of AC095693.1, Adamts3, PDGFA and PDGFRα were downregulated in the HSD group and upregulated in the HSM group. According to the GO database, the differentially methylated genes were significantly enriched in the coordination of cell function, genetic development, and RNA transcription. There were three main metabolic pathways that were enriched in the differentially expressed genes between the groups: the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, and Hippo signaling pathway. Excessive salt intake may cause hypertension and vascular damage, and this damage may continue after the reduction of salt intake. Therefore, salt memory phenomenon exists, and this memory effect may be correlated with the levels of DNA methylation. "
1019,26546573,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) exhibits protective effects in various disease models including cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Nonetheless, mechanisms and identity of molecules responsible for neuroprotective effects of H2S remain incompletely defined. In the current study, we observed that thiosulfate, an oxidation product of H2S, mediates protective effects of an H2S donor compound sodium sulfide (Na2S) against neuronal I/R injury. We observed that thiosulfate in cell culture medium is not only required but also sufficient to mediate cytoprotective effects of Na2S against oxygen glucose deprivation and reoxygenation of human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y) and murine primary cortical neurons. Systemic administration of sodium thiosulfate (STS) improved survival and neurological function of mice subjected to global cerebral I/R injury. Beneficial effects of STS, as well as Na2S, were associated with marked increase of thiosulfate, but not H2S, in plasma and brain tissues. These results suggest that thiosulfate is a circulating ""carrier"" molecule of beneficial effects of H2S. Protective effects of thiosulfate were associated with inhibition of caspase-3 activity by persulfidation at Cys163 in caspase-3. We discovered that an SLC13 family protein, sodium sulfate cotransporter 2 (SLC13A4, NaS-2), facilitates transport of thiosulfate, but not sulfide, across the cell membrane, regulating intracellular concentrations and thus mediating cytoprotective effects of Na2S and STS. The protective effects of H2S are mediated by thiosulfate that is transported across cell membrane by NaS-2 and exerts antiapoptotic effects via persulfidation of caspase-3. Given the established safety track record, thiosulfate may be therapeutic against ischemic brain injury. "
1020,32332156,"Diabetes occurs due to a loss of functional β-cells, resulting from β-cell death and dysfunction. Lactogens protect rodent and human β-cells in vitro and in vivo against triggers of β-cell cytotoxicity relevant to diabetes, many of which converge onto a common pathway of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. However, whether lactogens modulate the ER stress pathway is unknown. This study examines whether lactogens can protect β-cells against ER stress and mitigate diabetes incidence in Akita (Ak) mice, a rodent model of ER stress-induced diabetes, akin to neonatal diabetes in humans. We show that lactogens protect INS-1 cells, primary rodent and human β-cells in vitro against two distinct ER stressors, tunicamycin and thapsigargin, through activation of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway. Lactogens mitigate expression of proapoptotic molecules in the ER stress pathway that are induced by chronic ER stress in INS-1 cells and rodent islets. Transgenic expression of placental lactogen in β-cells of Ak mice drastically reduces the severe hyperglycemia, diabetes incidence, hypoinsulinemia, β-cell death, and loss of β-cell mass observed in Ak littermates. These are the first studies in any cell type demonstrating that lactogens modulate the ER stress pathway, causing enhanced β-cell survival and reduced diabetes incidence in the face of chronic ER stress.

We sought to investigate whether this zinc-dependent improvement in glucose handling could potentially be harnessed to prevent the progression of pre-diabetes to diabetes. In this double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial, we determined participants' fasting blood glucose levels, (FBG) and Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) parameters (beta cell function, insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance) at baseline and after 6 months of zinc supplementation. The Bangladesh Institute of Health Sciences Hospital (BIHS) (Mirpur, Dhaka, Bangladesh) database was used to identify 224 patients with prediabetes, of whom 55 met the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate. The participants were randomized either to the intervention or control group using block randomization. The groups received either 30mg zinc sulphate dispersible tablet or placebo, once daily for six months. After six months, the intervention group significantly improved their FBG concentration compared to the placebo group (5.37±0.20mmol/L vs 5.69±0.26, p<0.001) as well as compared to their own baseline (5.37±0.20mmol/L vs 5.8±0.09, p<0.001). Beta cell function, insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance all showed a statistically significant improvement as well. To our knowledge this is the first trial to show an improvement in glucose handling using HOMA parameters in participants with prediabetes. Larger randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm these findings and to explore clinical endpoints. "

This was followed by a study of 21 subjects for 6 days at diabetes camp, randomized to either the closed-loop control group using the HCL system or to the group using the Medtronic MiniMed 530G with threshold suspend (control group). The overall mean sensor glucose percent time in range 70-180 mg/dL was similar between the groups (73.1% vs. 69.9%, control vs. HCL, respectively) (P = 0.580). Meter glucose values between 70 and 180 mg/dL were also similar between the groups (73.6% vs. 63.2%, control vs. HCL, respectively) (P = 0.086). The mean absolute relative difference of the 4S sensor was 10.8 ± 10.2%, when compared with plasma glucose values in the inpatient setting, and 12.6 ± 11.0% compared with capillary Bayer CONTOUR NEXT LINK glucose meter values during 6 days at camp. In the first clinical study of this fully integrated system using an investigational PID algorithm, the system did not demonstrate improved glucose control compared with sensor-augmented pump therapy alone. The system demonstrated good connectivity and improved sensor performance. "
1024,34348071,"Information about prognostic outcomes can be of great help for people with prediabetes and for physicians in the face of scientific controversy about the cutoff point for defining prediabetes. We aimed to estimate different prognostic outcomes in people with prediabetes. Prospective cohort of subjects with prediabetes according to American Diabetes Association guidelines. The probabilities of diabetes onset versus non-onset, the odds against diabetes onset, and the probability of reverting to normoglycemia according to different prediabetes categories were calculated. The odds against diabetes onset ranged from 29:1 in individuals with isolated FPG of 100-109 mg/dL to 1:1 in individuals with FPG 110-125 mg/dL plus HbA1c 6.0-6.4%. The probability of reversion to normoglycemia was 31.2% (95% CI 24.0-39.6) in those with isolated FPG 100-109 mg/dL and 6.2% (95% CI 1.4-10.0) in those with FPG 110-125 mg/dL plus HbA1c 6.0-6.4%. Of every 100 participants in the first group, 97 did not develop diabetes and 31 reverted to normoglycemia, while in the second group those figures were 52 and 6. Using odds of probabilities and absolute numbers might be useful for people with prediabetes and physicians to share decisions on potential interventions.Key pointsCommunicating knowledge on the course of the disease to make clinical decisions is not always done appropriately.Prediabetes is an example where risk communication is important because the prognosis of subjects with prediabetes is very heterogeneous.Depending on fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels, the odds of probabilities against diabetes onset ranged from 29: 1 to 1: 1.Depending on fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels, the number of subjects in 100 who revert to normoglycemia ranged from 31 to 6.Using probabilities and number absolutes on the prognosis of prediabetes may be useful for people with prediabetes and physicians to share decisions on potential interventions.

1025,34060177,"Hyperglycemia is considered a risk factor for the enhancement of local anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity. Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7), a kinase-coupled cation channel, has been implicated in a variety of neuropathological processes, including intracellular calcium disturbance and high glucose-induced neuropathy. In this study, we investigated whether TRPM7-related pathophysiology is involved in bupivacaine-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells and how hyperglycemia acts as a risk factor. For initial neurotoxicity evaluation, it was confirmed that cell damage and apoptosis induced by acute exposure to bupivacaine were dependent on its concentration and glucose preconditioning. High glucose preconditioning facilitated the bupivacaine-induced fast and temporary rise in intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca "

However, the structural features and bioactivities of PRP remain unclear. A novel neutral polysaccharide (named PRP-1) with a molecular weight of 23 kDa was extracted and purified from the flowers of P. rubra. PRP-1 was consisted of arabinose, galactose, glucose, xylose and mannose, with a molar ratio of 1.49: 27.89: 50.24: 13.02: 7.36. The structural characterization based on the methylation and 1D/2D nuclear magnetic resonance analyses indicated that PRP-1 was composed of →4)-Glcp-(1→, →4,6)-Glcp-(1→, →4)-Galp-(1→, →2)-Galp-(1→, t-Gal(p), →4)-Manp-(1→, →4,6)-Manp-(1→, t-Man(p), →2)-Xylp-(1→, and t-Xyl(p). Scanning electron microscopy revealed that PRP-1 possess a compact three-dimensional curling network structure in the terms of morphology.

In addition, PRP-1 showed ABTS, OH radicals scavenging and the Fe "
1027,17322896,"Type 2 diabetes is characterized by both peripheral insulin resistance and reduced insulin secretion by beta-cells. The reasons for beta-cell dysfunction in this disease are incompletely understood but may include the accumulation of toxic lipids within this cell type. We examined the role of Abca1, a cellular cholesterol transporter, in cholesterol homeostasis and insulin secretion in beta-cells. Mice with specific inactivation of Abca1 in beta-cells had markedly impaired glucose tolerance and defective insulin secretion but normal insulin sensitivity. Islets isolated from these mice showed altered cholesterol homeostasis and impaired insulin secretion in vitro. We found that rosiglitazone, an activator of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, which upregulates Abca1 in beta-cells, requires beta-cell Abca1 for its beneficial effects on glucose tolerance. These experiments establish a new role for Abca1 in beta-cell cholesterol homeostasis and insulin secretion, and suggest that cholesterol accumulation may contribute to beta-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes.

1028,35667728,"Diabetes poses serious health threats and economic burdens to patients, especially in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). This systematic review searches for non-pharmacological interventions for the prevention of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among patients who are non-diabetic and pre-diabetic from LMICs. LMICs. Adult population aged over 18 years without having diabetes. Primary outcome is to measure the change in the incidence of T2DM. The secondary outcome is to measure changes in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level, weight/body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose level and 2-hour glucose from baseline of the included randomised controlled trials. This review has been conducted following the standard systematic review guidelines. A total of six electronic databases including MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched in February 2021 using a comprehensive search strategy.Two sets of independent reviewers performed screening, risk of bias (ROB) assessment using the Cochrane ROB tool and data extraction. Narrative coalescence of selected articles was demonstrated using tables. No meta-analysis was performed due to the lack of homogenous intervention strategies and study settings. A total of five studies were included for the review with a combined population of 1734 from three countries. Three of the studies showed a significant reduction in T2DM incidence after the intervention of physical training and dietary modifications. Four of the studies also demonstrated a significant reduction of different secondary outcomes like weight, BMI, fasting and 2-hour plasma glucose and HbA1c. All the studies demonstrated a low ROB in most of the bias assessment domains with some unclear results in allocation concealments. Emphasising non-pharmacological interventions for T2DM prevention can improve health outcomes and lessen the economic burdens, which will be of paramount importance in LMICs. CRD42020191507. "
1029,24639549,"The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with a significant economic burden. We developed a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4)-targeted immune therapy to increase glucagon-like peptide 1 hormone levels and improve insulin sensitivity for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Immunization with the DPP4 vaccine in C57BL/6J mice successfully increased DPP4 titer, inhibited plasma DPP4 activity, and induced an increase in the plasma glucagon-like peptide 1 level. Moreover, this elevated titer was sustained for 3 mo. In mice fed a high-fat diet, DPP4 vaccination resulted in improved postprandial glucose excursions and insulin sensitivity and, in the diabetic KK-A(y) and db/db mice strains, DPP4 vaccination significantly reduced glucose excursions and increased both plasma insulin and pancreatic insulin content. Importantly, T cells were not activated following challenge with DPP4 itself, which suggests that this vaccine does not induce cell-mediated autoimmunity. Additionally, no significant immune-mediated damage was detected in cells and tissues where DPP4 is expressed. Thus, this DPP4 vaccine may provide a therapeutic alternative for patients with diabetes. "
1030,36752556,"Hyperglycaemia-mediated endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is involved in the occurrence and progression of cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients. Previous studies reported that AKT serine/threonine kinase 3 (AKT3) and Bric-a-brac/Tramtrack/Broad (BTB) and cap'n'collar (CNC) homology 1 (bach1) participates in endothelial injury and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. In the present study, we proposed that bach1 regulates AKT3 transcription, thus involved in hyperglycaemia-mediated EndMT in vascular endothelium. Our results indicated that hyperglycaemia/high glucose increased AKT3 expression and induced EndMT in aorta of diabetic rats and hyperglycaemic human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Moreover, inhibition of AKT3 expression reversed high glucose-mediated EndMT in HUVECs. Further, hyperglycaemia/high glucose augmented bach1 expression in aorta of diabetic rats and hyperglycaemic HUVECs. Furthermore, si-bach1 countered high glucose-induced AKT3 expression and EndMT in HUVECs. In addition, the effect of bach1 overexpression is similar to that of high glucose treatment, which was reversed by si-AKT3. ChIP assays found bach1 enriched in the promoter region of AKT3. Bach1 overexpression augmented AKT3 promoter activity, which lost after specific binding site mutation. Bach1 was involved in hyperglycaemia-induced EndMT via modulation of AKT3 transcription. "

Three Web-based 24-h recalls were completed, from which the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) was calculated. At each trimester (12.5 ± 0.7, 22.8 ± 1.0, and 33.6 ± 1.3 weeks of gestation), fasting glucose and insulin were measured to compute an insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR). Subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue thicknesses were estimated by ultrasound at the end of the first trimester.

1032,22315319,"Changes in cellular cholesterol affect insulin secretion, and β-cell-specific deletion or loss-of-function mutations in the cholesterol efflux transporter ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) result in impaired glucose tolerance and β-cell dysfunction. Upregulation of ABCA1 expression may therefore be beneficial for the maintenance of normal islet function in diabetes. Studies suggest that microRNA-33a (miR-33a) expression inversely correlates with ABCA1 expression in hepatocytes and macrophages. We examined whether miR-33a regulates ABCA1 expression in pancreatic islets, thereby affecting cholesterol accumulation and insulin secretion. Adenoviral miR-33a overexpression in human or mouse islets reduced ABCA1 expression, decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and increased cholesterol levels. The miR-33a-induced reduction in insulin secretion was rescued by cholesterol depletion by methyl-β-cyclodextrin or mevastatin. Inhibition of miR-33a expression in apolipoprotein E knockout islets and ABCA1 overexpression in β-cell-specific ABCA1 knockout islets rescued normal insulin secretion and reduced islet cholesterol. These findings confirm the critical role of β-cell ABCA1 in islet cholesterol homeostasis and β-cell function and highlight modulation of β-cell miR-33a expression as a means to influence insulin secretion.

1033,36283481,"Newborns exhibit substantial variation in fat mass accretion over gestation. These individual differences in newborn adiposity extend into infancy and childhood and relate to subsequent risk of obesity and metabolic dysregulation. Maternal glucose homeostasis in pregnancy has been proposed as an underlying mechanism; however, the timing in gestation when maternal glucose regulation influences the progression of fetal fat deposition remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the cross-sectional and longitudinal association of maternal insulin resistance in early, mid, and late pregnancy with fetal fat deposition in uncomplicated pregnancies. We hypothesized that maternal insulin resistance at early, mid, and late gestation is positively associated with fetal fat deposition, and that the magnitude of the association is greater for the mid and late gestation measures than for the early gestation measure. In a longitudinal study of 137 low-risk pregnancies, a fasting maternal blood sample was obtained and fetal ultrasonography was performed at ≈ 12, 20, and 30 weeks' gestation. Maternal insulin resistance was quantified using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (fasting insulin×fasting glucose/405). Estimated fetal adiposity was calculated by integrating measurements of cross-sectional arm and thigh percentage fat area and anterior abdominal wall thickness. The associations between maternal homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and estimated fetal adiposity and estimated fetal weight were determined by multiple linear regression adjusted for potential confounding factors including maternal age, parity, race and ethnicity, prepregnancy body mass index, gestational weight gain per week, fetal sex, and gestational age at assessments. Maternal homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance at ≈ 12, 20, and 30 weeks was 2.79±1.79 (±standard deviation), 2.78±1.54, and 3.76±2.30, respectively. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance at 20 weeks was positively associated with estimated fetal adiposity at 20 weeks (r=0.261; P=.005). Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance at 20 weeks (r=0.215; P=.011) and 30 weeks (r=0.285; P=.001) were also positively associated with estimated fetal adiposity at 30 weeks. These relationships remained significant after adjustment for confounding factors. There was no significant correlation between homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and estimated fetal weight at 20 and 30 weeks' gestation. In low-risk pregnancies, maternal insulin resistance at mid and late but not early pregnancy is significantly associated with fetal adiposity but not with fetal weight. Maternal insulin resistance in mid-gestation could provide a basis for risk identification and interventions that target child adiposity. "
1034,37200252,"Canada recently mandated front-of-pack (FOP) labelling regulations, where foods meeting and/or exceeding recommended thresholds for nutrients-of-concern (i.e., saturated fat, sodium, and sugars) must display a 'high-in' FOP nutrition symbol. However, there is limited research on the amounts and sources of foods consumed by Canadians that would require a FOP symbol. The objective was to examine the intakes of nutrients-of-concern from foods that would display a FOP symbol and to identify the top food categories contributing to intakes for each nutrient-of-concern. Using the first day 24-hour dietary recall from the nationally representative 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey-Nutrition (CCHS), Canadian adults' intakes of nutrients-of-concern from foods that would display a FOP symbol was examined. Foods were assigned to 1 of 62 categories to identify the top food categories contributing to intakes of energy and nutrient-of-concern that would display a FOP symbol for each nutrient-of-concern. Canadian adults (n = 13,495) consumed approximately 24% of total calories from foods that would display a FOP symbol. Foods that would display a FOP symbol for exceeding thresholds for nutrients-of-concern accounted for 16% of saturated fat, 30% of sodium, 25% of total sugar, and 39% of free sugar intakes among Canadian adults. The top food category contributing intakes of each nutrient-of-concern that would display a FOP symbol were nutrient-specific: Processed meat and meat substitutes for saturated fat; Breads for sodium; and Fruit juices & drinks for total and free sugars. Our findings show that Canadian FOP labelling regulations have the potential to influence the intakes of nutrients-of-concern for Canadian adults. Using the findings as baseline data, future studies are warranted to evaluate the impact of FOP labelling regulations. "
1035,38102439,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) in the brain. The deposition of Aβ is believed to initiate a detrimental cascade, including cerebral hypometabolism, accelerated brain atrophy, and cognitive problems-ultimately resulting in AD. However, the timing and causality of the cascade resulting in AD are not yet fully established. Therefore, we examined whether early Aβ accumulation affects cerebral glucose metabolism, atrophy rate, and age-related cognitive decline before the onset of neurodegenerative disease. Participants from the Metropolit 1953 Danish Male Birth Cohort underwent brain positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using the radiotracers [ Higher Aβ accumulation in AD-critical brain regions correlated with greater visual memory decline (p = 0.023). Aβ accumulation did not correlate with brain atrophy rates. Increased cerebral glucose metabolism in AD-susceptible regions correlated with worse verbal memory performance (p = 0.040). Aβ accumulation in known AD-related areas was associated with subtle cognitive deficits. The association was observed before hypometabolism or accelerated brain atrophy, suggesting that Aβ accumulation is involved early in age-related cognitive dysfunction. The association between hypermetabolism and worse memory performance may be due to early compensatory mechanisms adapting for malfunctioning neurons by increasing metabolism. "
1036,26507644,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a cytokine that increases glucose transport ex vivo in skeletal muscle. The aim of this work was to decipher the impact of whether conditional overexpression of HGF in vivo could improve glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in mouse skeletal muscle. Following tetracyclin administration, muscle HGF levels were augmented threefold in transgenic mice (SK-HGF) compared to control mice without altering plasma HGF levels. In conditions of normal diet, SK-HGF mice showed no differences in body weight, plasma triglycerides, blood glucose, plasma insulin and glucose tolerance compared to control mice. Importantly, obese SK-HGF mice exhibited improved whole-body glucose tolerance independently of changes in body weight or plasma triglyceride levels compared to control mice. This effect on glucose homeostasis was associated with significantly higher (∼80%) levels of phosphorylated protein kinase B in muscles from SK-HGF mice compared to control mice. In conclusion, muscle expression of HGF counteracts obesity-mediated muscle insulin resistance and improves glucose tolerance in mice. "
1037,23922793,"Normothermic machine perfusion has previously been demonstrated to restore damaged warm ischemic livers to transplantable condition in animal models. However, the mechanisms of recovery are unclear, preventing rational optimization of perfusion systems and slowing clinical translation of machine perfusion. In this study, organ recovery time and major perfusate shortcomings were evaluated using a comprehensive metabolic analysis of organ function in perfusion prior to successful transplantation. Two groups, Fresh livers and livers subjected to 1 hr of warm ischemia (WI) received perfusion for a total preservation time of 6 hrs, followed by successful transplantation. 24 metabolic fluxes were directly measured and 38 stoichiometrically-related fluxes were estimated via a mass balance model of the major pathways of energy metabolism. This analysis revealed stable metabolism in Fresh livers throughout perfusion while identifying two distinct metabolic states in WI livers, separated at t = 2 hrs, coinciding with recovery of oxygen uptake rates to Fresh liver values. This finding strongly suggests successful organ resuscitation within 2 hrs of perfusion. Overall perfused livers regulated metabolism of perfusate substrates according to their metabolic needs, despite supraphysiological levels of some metabolites. This study establishes the first integrative metabolic basis for the dynamics of recovery during perfusion treatment of marginal livers. Our initial findings support enhanced oxygen delivery for both timely recovery and long-term sustenance. These results are expected to lead the optimization of the treatment protocols and perfusion media from a metabolic perspective, facilitating translation to clinical use. "
1038,23274498,"Hyperglycemia together with hepatic and muscle insulin resistance are common features in critically ill patients, and these changes are associated with enhanced inflammatory response, increased susceptibility to infection, muscle wasting, and worsened prognosis. Tight blood glucose control by intensive insulin treatment may reduce the morbidity and mortality in intensive care units. Although some anesthetics have been shown to cause insulin resistance, it remains unknown how and in which tissues insulin resistance is induced by anesthetics. Moreover, the effects of propofol, a clinically relevant intravenous anesthetic, also used in the intensive care unit for sedation, on insulin sensitivity have not yet been investigated. Euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp study was performed in rats anesthetized with propofol and conscious unrestrained rats. To evaluate glucose uptake in tissues and hepatic glucose output [(3)H]glucose and 2-deoxy[(14)C]glucose were infused during the clamp study. Anesthesia with propofol induced a marked whole-body insulin resistance compared with conscious rats, as reflected by significantly decreased glucose infusion rate to maintain euglycemia. Insulin-stimulated tissue glucose uptake was decreased in skeletal muscle and heart, and hepatic glucose output was increased in propofol anesthetized rats. Anesthesia with propofol induces systemic insulin resistance along with decreases in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal and heart muscle and attenuation of the insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose output in rats.

1039,35067807,"Ischemic stroke is a nervous system disease with high rates of disability and mortality. MicroRNAs have been reported to modulate cerebral ischemia. The current study aimed to study the role of miR-361-3p in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Experimental results revealed that miR-361-3p level was downregulated in a middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced ischemic stroke mouse model and in oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells. After overexpressing miR-361-3p, the percentage of brain infarct volume and neurobehavioral scores in mice were significantly reduced, and the neuronal apoptosis was inhibited. Moreover, miR-361-3p overexpression could limit the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms of miR-361-3p and identified that miR-361-3p combined with NACC1 3'UTR to negatively modulate its expression. In addition, NACC1 interacts with the PINK1/Parkin pathway in neurons. NACC1 overexpression could rescue the impacts of miR-361-3p mimics on cell apoptosis, ROS production and the PINK1/Parkin pathway. In conclusion, miR-361-3p could improve ischemia brain injury by targeting NACC1 through the PINK1/Parkin pathway. Therefore, miR-361-3p may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the brain injury after I/R. "
1040,33935091,"Individuals at 80 years of age or above with exceptional memory are considered SuperAgers (SA), an operationalized definition of successful cognitive aging. SA showed increased thickness and altered functional connectivity in the anterior cingulate cortex as a neurobiological signature. However, their metabolic alterations are yet to be uncovered. Herein, a metabolic (FDG-PET), amyloid (PIB-PET), and functional (fMRI) analysis of SA were conducted. Ten SA, ten age-matched older adults (C80), and ten cognitively normal middle-aged (C50) adults underwent cognitive testing and multimodal neuroimaging examinations. Anterior and posterior regions of the cingulate cortex and hippocampal areas were primarily examined, then subregions of anterior cingulate were segregated. The SA group showed increased metabolic activity in the left and right subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sACC, p < 0.005 corrected, bilateral) and bilateral hippocampi (right: p < 0.0005 and left: p < 0.005, both corrected) as compared to that in the C80 group. Amyloid deposition was above threshold in 30% of SA and C80 (p > 0.05). The SA group also presented decreased connectivity between right sACC and posterior cingulate (p < 0.005, corrected) as compared to that of the C80 group. These results support the key role of sACC and hippocampus in SA, even in the presence of amyloid deposition. It also suggests that sACC may be used as a potential biomarker in older adults for exceptional memory ability. Further longitudinal studies measuring metabolic biomarkers may help elucidate the interaction between these areas in the cognitive aging process. "
1041,11830930,"The intrinsic factors involved in the temperature-dependent impairment of neuronal activity in hippocampal CA2-CA1 regions were investigated using optical recording techniques. At 32 degrees C, stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals in the hippocampal CA2 region evoked depolarizing optical responses that spread toward the CA1 region. The optical response was characterized by fast and slow components that were mainly related to the presynaptic action potentials and excitatory postsynaptic response, respectively. The increase of the temperature to 38 degrees C was associated with a reversible depression of the neuronal activity in the hippocampal brain preparations. The depression of neuronal activity was irreversible when the temperature was increased to 40 degrees C. In the presence of 22 mM glucose, the depression of the neuronal activity at 38 degrees C was significantly attenuated. Pyruvate (22 mM), but not lactate (22 mM), also improved the depression of neuronal activity induced by the temperature increase. Adenosine (200 microM) strongly depressed the excitatory postsynaptic response, but not presynaptic action potentials. 8-Cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine (8-CPT) (10 microM), an adenosine A1 receptor blocker, attenuated the adenosine-induced depression of the excitatory postsynaptic response. 8-CPT (10 microM) prevented the impairment of the excitatory postsynaptic response induced by the increase of the temperature to 38 degrees C. In contrast, the depression of presynaptic action potential at 38 degrees C was not prevented by 8-CPT (10 microM). N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, and methylcobalamin (10 microM), a vitamin B12 analogue, attenuated the inhibition of pre- and postsynaptic activities induced by the increase of the temperature to 38 degrees C. Glibenclamide, a KATP channel blocker, did not protect neuronal activity from the effects of the increase of the temperature. These results suggest that the heat-induced depression of neuronal activity is mediated by multiple factors, such as impairment of energy metabolism and increase in extracellular adenosine and nitric oxide (NO) levels in hippocampal neurons.

1042,24476988,"Exercise is a component of the clinical management for burn patients, to help reduce muscle wasting associated with prolonged hospitalization. In the present study the authors examined 2-deoxy-2-[18F] fluoro-D-glucose (18FDG) uptake in mice subjected to burn injury with and without exercise. Mice had their the dorsums shaven, were placed in molds, and the exposed area was immersed in 90°C water for 9 seconds followed by resuscitation with saline (2 ml) to produce a 30% full-thickness burn injury. Twenty-four hours later, the mice were subjected to treadmill exercise for 1 hour. Before exercise, mice were injected with ~50 μCi 18FDG. Mice were killed after running and a complete biodistribution was performed. Exercise produced a stimulation of 18FDG update by skeletal muscle and heart, while reducing 18FDG accumulation in brain. Burn injury had no significant effect on 18FDG update by skeletal muscle, but did increase 18FDG accumulation in heart, while reducing 18FDG accumulation in brain. However, exercise combined with a burn injury produced a significant increase in 18FDG uptake in the skeletal muscle compared with the burned mice, as great as that produced in the sham animals subjected to exercise. The combination of burn plus exercise appeared to prevent the stimulation of 18FDG uptake by the heart produced by burn injury alone. Exercise treatment did not correct the changes in 18FDG uptake in the brain produced by burn injury. Separately, exercise and burn injury significantly increased serum interleukin-6 levels, increases that were higher when exercise was combined with the burn injury. These findings suggest that exercise may exert some therapeutic effects in burn patients by tissue-specific modulation of glucose metabolism, and these changes may be related to interleukin-6. "
1043,22731806,"The 110,000 patients currently on the transplant waiting list reflect the critical shortage of viable donor organs. However, a large pool of unused organs, from donors after cardiac death (DCD) that are disqualified because of extensive ischemic injury, may prove transplantable after machine perfusion treatment, fundamentally impacting the availability of treatment for end-stage organ failure. Machine perfusion is an ex-vivo organ preservation and treatment procedure that has the capacity to quantitatively evaluate and resuscitate cadaveric organs for transplantation. To diagnose whether an organ was fresh or ischemic, an initial assessment of liver quality was conducted via dynamic discriminant analysis. Subsequently, to determine whether the organs were sufficiently viable for successful implantation, fitness indices for transplantation were calculated based on squared prediction errors (SPE) for fresh and ischemic livers. With just three perfusate metabolites, glucose, urea and lactate, the developed MPLSDA model distinguished livers as fresh or ischemic with 90% specificity. The SPE analyses revealed that fresh livers with SPE(F) < 10.03 and WI livers with SPE(WI) < 3.92 yield successful transplantation with 95% specificity. The statistical methods used here can discriminate between fresh and ischemic livers based on simple metabolic indicators measured during perfusion. The result is a predictive fitness index for transplantation of rat livers procured after cardiac death. The translational implications of this study are that any donor organ procured from controlled, but most especially from uncontrolled cardiac death donors, will be objectively assessed and its recovery monitored over time, minimizing the critical loss of otherwise viable organs.

1044,35639037,"Risk factors for Peyronie's disease (PD) are serum lipid abnormalities, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Oxidative stress and inflammation are key-players in the pathogenesis of arterial diseases, leading to insulin resistance (IR), which is a major determinant of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We studied the potential relationship between PD, IR, and NAFLD. Forty-nine male patients were enrolled, fulfilling the well-accepted diagnostic criteria of stable PD. Fifty male individuals without PD, well-matched for age and BMI, were selected as the control group. Comorbidities (T2DM and hypertension), as well as the lipid profile and the glucometabolic asset, were evaluated. The triglycerides/HDL ratio (TG/HDL-C ratio) with a cut-off of ≥3 and the triglycerides-glucose index (TyG) with an optimal cut-point of 8.5 were used for diagnosis of IR and NAFLD, respectively. NAFLD diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of bright liver at ultrasonography. Hypertension was found more frequently in PD patients than in no-PD subjects (P=0.017), independently of age (P=0.99). Both IR and NAFLD were significantly associated with the presence of PD in our population of men (P=0.043 and 0.0001, respectively), no matter how old (P=0.11 and 0.74, respectively). At logistic regression, NAFLD was the only predictor of the PD presence (p=0.021). The AUROC of TyG to predict PD was 0.7437 (sensitivity 67.35% and specificity 80%) with a percentage of correctly classified patients of 73.74%. Oxidative stress markers were significantly associated with NAFLD. Testosterone level was significantly low in the subjects with NAFLD in cross-sectional analyses. Both factors, i.e., oxidative stress and hypogonadism, are central to PD pathogenesis. In conclusion, NAFLD and IR are strongly associated with PD. The pathogenic link between these conditions and the underlying mechanisms are only hypothetical and thoroughly summarized in the discussion. "

We postulated that differences in metabolic reprogramming would shape the efficacy of CD8 T cells mounted against persistent viral infections. We found that the poorly functional PD-1(hi) T cell response against hepatitis B virus (HBV) had upregulated the glucose transporter, Glut1, an effect recapitulated by oxygen deprivation to mimic the intrahepatic environment. Glut1(hi) HBV-specific T cells were dependent on glucose supplies, unlike the more functional cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific T cells that could utilize oxidative phosphorylation in the absence of glucose. The inability of HBV-specific T cells to switch to oxidative phosphorylation was accompanied by increased mitochondrial size and lower mitochondrial potential, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Interleukin (IL)-12, which recovers HBV-specific T cell effector function, increased their mitochondrial potential and reduced their dependence on glycolysis. Our findings suggest that mitochondrial defects limit the metabolic plasticity of exhausted HBV-specific T cells. "
1047,34792626,"Upregulation of thrombin receptor protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) is verified to contribute to chronic kidney diseases, including diabetic nephropathy; however, the mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of PAR-1 on high glucose-induced proliferation of human glomerular mesangial cells (HMCs), and explored the mechanism of PAR-1 upregulation from alteration of microRNAs. We found that high glucose stimulated proliferation of the mesangial cells whereas PAR-1 inhibition with vorapaxar attenuated the cell proliferation. Moreover, high glucose upregulated PAR-1 in mRNA level and protein expression while did not affect the enzymatic activity of thrombin in HMCs after 48 h culture. Then high glucose induced PAR-1 elevation was likely due to the alteration of the transcription or post-transcriptional processing. It was found that miR-17 family members including miR-17-5p, -20a-5p, and -93-5p were significantly decreased among the eight detected microRNAs only in high glucose-cultured HMCs, but miR-129-5p, miR-181a-5p, and miR-181b-5p were markedly downregulated in both high glucose-cultured HMCs and equivalent osmotic press control compared with normal glucose culture. So miR-20a was selected to confirm the role of miR-17 family on PAR-1 upregulation, finding that miR-20a-5p overexpression reversed the upregulation of PAR-1 in mRNA and protein levels induced by high glucose in HMCs. In summary, our finding indicated that PAR-1 upregulation mediated proliferation of glomerular mesangial cells induced by high glucose, and deficiency of miR-17 family resulted in PAR-1 upregulation.

1048,34716786,"A 28-kDa polysaccharide-peptide (PGL) with antidepressant-like activities was isolated from spores of the mushroom Ganoderma lucidum. It was unadsorbed on DEAE-cellulose. Its internal amino acid sequences manifested pronounced similarity with proteins from the mushrooms Lentinula edodes and Agaricus bisporus. The monosaccharides present in 28-kDa PGL comprised predominantly of glucose (over 90%) and much fewer galactose, mannose residues, and other residues. PGL manifested antidepressant-like activities as follows. It enhanced viability and DNA content in corticosterone-injured PC12 cells(a cell line derived from a pheochromocytoma of the rat adrenal medulla with an embryonic origin from the neural crest containing a mixture of neuroblastic cells and eosinophilic cells) and reduced LDH release. A single acute PGL treatment shortened the duration of immobility of mice in both tail suspension and forced swimming tests. PGL treatment enhanced sucrose preference and shortened the duration of immobility in mice exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Chronic PGL treatment reversed the decline in mouse brain serotonin and norepinephrine levels but did not affect dopamine levels. PGL decreased serum corticosterone levels and increased BDNF mRNA and protein levels and increased synapsin I and PSD95 levels in the prefrontal cortex. This effect was completely blocked by pretreatment with the BDNF antagonist K252a, indicating that PGL increased synaptic proteins in a BDNF-dependent manner.Key points• An antidepressive polysaccharide-peptide PGL was isolated from G. lucidum spores.• PGL protected PC12 nerve cells from the toxicity of corticosterone.• PGL upregulated BDNF expression and influenced key factors in the prefrontal cortex.

1049,31978172,"There continues to be a significant shortage of donor livers for transplantation. One impediment is the discard rate of fatty, or steatotic, livers because of their poor post-transplant function. Steatotic livers are prone to significant ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and data regarding how best to improve the quality of steatotic livers is lacking. Herein, we use normothermic (37°C) machine perfusion in combination with metabolic and lipidomic profiling to elucidate deficiencies in metabolic pathways in steatotic livers, and to inform strategies for improving their function. During perfusion, energy cofactors increased in steatotic livers to a similar extent as non-steatotic livers, but there were significant deficits in anti-oxidant capacity, efficient energy utilization, and lipid metabolism. Steatotic livers appeared to oxidize fatty acids at a higher rate but favored ketone body production rather than energy regeneration via the tricyclic acid cycle. As a result, lactate clearance was slower and transaminase levels were higher in steatotic livers. Lipidomic profiling revealed ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids increased in non-steatotic livers to a greater extent than in steatotic livers. The novel use of metabolic and lipidomic profiling during ex situ normothermic machine perfusion has the potential to guide the resuscitation and rehabilitation of steatotic livers for transplantation.

1050,36203128,"Canada proposed the implementation of mandatory front-of-pack (FOP) labelling regulations, whereby foods meeting or exceeding thresholds for nutrients-of-concern (i.e., total sugars, saturated fat, sodium) must display a 'high-in' FOP symbol (FOP). The objective of the study was to evaluate the potential implications of the proposed regulations using Canadian generic and branded food composition databases. A generic food composition database of products consumed by Canadians, Canadian Nutrient File (CNF) 2015 (n = 3,677), and a branded food composition database of packaged foods and beverages, Food Label Information Program (FLIP) 2017 (n = 17,521), were used to evaluate the number and proportion of foods that would display a FOP symbol based on the details of the proposed FOP labelling regulations published in 2018. Overall, 35.5% (n = 1,306) of products in CNF 2015 and 63.9% (n = 11,193) of products in FLIP 2017 would display a FOP symbol for at least one nutrient-of-concern exceeding proposed thresholds. Soups, Combination Dishes, and Desserts categories in CNF 2015 and Combination dishes, Soups, and Meats categories in FLIP 2017 would have the highest proportion of products that would display a FOP symbol. Although displaying a FOP symbol for one nutrient was most common in both CNF 2015 (n = 992; 27.0%) and FLIP 2017 (n = 7,296, 41.6%), the number (i.e., 0-3) and type (i.e., saturated fat, sodium, total sugar) of nutrients displayed varied by food category. While the generic database, containing both packaged and unpackaged foods, revealed a low prevalence of foods that would display a FOP symbol, the branded database showed that the proposed FOP labelling regulations would identify over 60% of packaged foods with excess contents of nutrients-of-concern. Considering the high prevalence of packaged foods in Canada that would meet or exceed the thresholds of nutrients-of-concern, the proposed FOP labelling regulations should be implemented in a timely manner to help consumers easily identify foods high in nutrients-of-concern and encourage manufacturer-driven product reformulations.

1051,25745980,"Sodium valproate (VPA) is a potentially hepatotoxic antiepileptic drug. Risk of VPA-induced hepatotoxicity is increased in patients with mitochondrial diseases and especially in patients with POLG1 gene mutations. We used a HepG2 cell in vitro model to investigate the effect of VPA on mitochondrial activity. Cells were incubated in glucose medium and mitochondrial respiration-inducing medium supplemented with galactose and pyruvate. VPA treatments were carried out at concentrations of 0-2.0mM for 24-72 h. In both media, VPA caused decrease in oxygen consumption rates and mitochondrial membrane potential. VPA exposure led to depleted ATP levels in HepG2 cells incubated in galactose medium suggesting dysfunction in mitochondrial ATP production. In addition, VPA exposure for 72 h increased levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), but adversely decreased protein levels of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase SOD2, suggesting oxidative stress caused by impaired elimination of mitochondrial ROS and a novel pathomechanism related to VPA toxicity. Increased cell death and decrease in cell number was detected under both metabolic conditions. However, immunoblotting did not show any changes in the protein levels of the catalytic subunit A of mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ, the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I, II and IV, ATP synthase, E3 subunit dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase of pyruvate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and glutathione peroxidase. Our results show that VPA inhibits mitochondrial respiration and leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and increased cell death, thus suggesting an essential role of mitochondria in VPA-induced hepatotoxicity.

1052,36768138,"Inflammation is intimately involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease. Inhibition of SGLT-2 by a specific class of drugs, gliflozins, has been shown to reduce inflammation and attenuate the progression of diabetic nephropathy, in addition to its main effect of inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption. We used highly purified human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTCs) as an in vitro model to study the cellular response to a diabetic (high glucose) and inflammatory (cytokines) microenvironment and the effect of gliflozins. In this context, we investigated the influence of SGLT-2 inhibition by empa- and dapagliflozin (500 nM) on the expression of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, MCP-1, and ICAM-1). The results clearly indicate an anti-inflammatory effect of both gliflozins. Although induced expression of the four cytokines was only slightly attenuated, there was a clear effect on the expression of the adhesion molecule ICAM-1, a master regulator of cellular responses in inflammation and injury resolution. The induced expression of ICAM-1 mRNA was significantly reduced by approximately 13.5% by empagliflozin and also showed an inhibitory trend with dapagliflozin. However, induced ICAM-1 protein expression was significantly inhibited from 24.71 ± 1.0 ng/mL to 18.81 ± 3.9 (empagliflozin) and 19.62 ± 2.1 ng/mL (dapagliflozin). In conclusion, an additional anti-inflammatory effect of empa- and dapagliflozin in therapeutically observed concentrations was demonstrated in primary human PTCs in vitro. "
1053,36364925,"Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) is observed in the early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and may lead to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The purpose of our study was to investigate the association between metabolic, nutritional and inflammatory parameters and LVDD in CKD and non-CKD patients. Two groups of patients were recruited to the study: 93 men with CKD and eGFR lower than 60 mL/min/1.73 m We observed that elevated serum fibrinogen and glucose concentrations were associated with LVDD independently of CKD status. Serum fibrinogen concentrations increased with the advancement of LVDD. Low albumin concentrations in CKD were related with LVDD. In the control group, lower muscle mass presented as lean tissue index (LTI) and lean tissue mass (LTM), and overhydration were associated with LVDD. In the group of patients without kidney function decrease the OPG concentrations were significantly higher in those with LVDD, and they rose with the advancement of LVDD. Elevated inflammatory parameters, increased serum glucose concentrations and worse nutritional status are the states that may impair the diastolic function of the left ventricle in CKD and non-CKD patients. Serum OPG levels are elevated in patients without kidney function decrease and LVDD and its concentrations rise with the advancement of LVDD. "

1055,17785500,"In glycogen storage disease type 1 (GSD1), children present with severe hypoglycemia, whereas the propensity for hypoglycemia may decrease with age in these patients. It was the aim of this study to elucidate the mechanisms for milder hypoglycemia symptoms in young adult GSD1 patients. Four patients with GSD1 [body mass index (BMI) 23.2 +/- 6.3 kg/m, age 21.3 +/- 2.9 yr] and four healthy controls matched for BMI (23.1 +/- 3.0 kg/m) and age (24.0 +/- 3.1 yr) were studied. Combined (1)H/(31)P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMRS) was used to assess brain metabolism. Before and after administration of 1 mg glucagon, endogenous glucose production (EGP) was measured with d-[6,6-(2)H(2)]glucose and hepatic glucose metabolism was examined by (1)H/(13)C/(31)P NMRS. At baseline, GSD1 patients exhibited significantly lower rates of EGP (0.53 +/- 0.04 vs. 1.74 +/- 0.03 mg.kg(-1).min(-1); P < 0.01) but an increased intrahepatic glycogen (502 +/- 89 vs. 236 +/- 11 mmol/l; P = 0.05) and lipid content (16.3 +/- 1.1 vs. 1.4 +/- 0.4%; P < 0.001). After glucagon challenge, EGP did not change in GSD1 patients (0.53 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.59 +/- 0.24 mg.kg(-1).min(-1); P = not significant) but increased in healthy controls (1.74 +/- 0.03 vs. 3.95 +/- 1.34; P < 0.0001). In GSD1 patients, we found an exaggerated increase of intrahepatic phosphomonoesters (0.23 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.86 +/- 0.19 arbitrary units; P < 0.001), whereas inorganic phosphate decreased (0.36 +/- 0.08 vs. -0.43 +/- 0.17 arbitrary units; P < 0.01). Intracerebral ratios of glucose and lactate to creatine were higher in GSD1 patients (P < 0.05 vs. control). Therefore, hepatic defects of glucose metabolism persist in young adult GSD1 patients. Upregulation of the glucose and lactate transport at the blood-brain barrier could be responsible for the amelioration of hypoglycemic symptoms. "
1056,30650121,"The most common type of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is caused by a duplication of PMP22 leading to dysmyelination, axonal loss and progressive muscle weakness (CMT1A). Currently, no approved therapy is available for CMT1A patients. A novel polytherapeutic proof-of-principle approach using PXT3003, a low-dose combination of baclofen, naltrexone and sorbitol, slowed disease progression after long-term dosing in adult Pmp22 transgenic rats, a known animal model of CMT1A. Here, we report an early postnatal, short-term treatment with PXT3003 in CMT1A rats that delays disease onset into adulthood. CMT1A rats were treated from postnatal day 6 to 18 with PXT3003. Behavioural, electrophysiological, histological and molecular analyses were performed until 12 weeks of age. Daily oral treatment for approximately 2 weeks ameliorated motor deficits of CMT1A rats reaching wildtype levels. Histologically, PXT3003 corrected the disturbed axon calibre distribution with a shift towards large motor axons. Despite dramatic clinical amelioration, only distal motor latencies were improved and correlated with phenotype performance. On the molecular level, PXT3003 reduced Pmp22 mRNA overexpression and improved the misbalanced downstream PI3K-AKT / MEK-ERK signalling pathway. The improved differentiation status of Schwann cells may have enabled better long-term axonal support function. We conclude that short-term treatment with PXT3003 during early development may partially prevent the clinical and molecular manifestations of CMT1A. Since PXT3003 has a strong safety profile and is currently undergoing a phase III trial in CMT1A patients, our results suggest that PXT3003 therapy may be a bona fide translatable therapy option for children and young adolescent patients suffering from CMT1A.

1058,35678269,"Radix puerariae, a traditional Chinese herbal medication, has been used to treat patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Our previous studies demonstrated that puerarin, the active compound of radix puerariae, improves podocyte injury in type 1 DKD mice. However, the direct molecular target of puerarin and its underlying mechanisms in DKD remain unknown. In this study, we confirmed that puerarin also improved DKD in type 2 diabetic db/db mice. Through RNA-sequencing odf isolated glomeruli, we found that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were altered in the glomeruli of these diabetic mice but reversed by puerarin treatment were involved mostly in oxidative stress, inflammatory and fibrosis. Further analysis of these reversed DEGs revealed protein kinase A (PKA) was among the top pathways. By utilizing the drug affinity responsive target stability method combined with mass spectrometry analysis, we identified guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gi alpha-1 (Gnai1) as the direct binding partner of puerarin. Gnai1 is an inhibitor of cAMP production which is known to have protection against podocyte injury. In vitro, we showed that puerarin not only interacted with Gnai1 but also increased cAMP production in human podocytes and mouse diabetic kidney in vivo. Puerarin also enhanced CREB phosphorylation, a downstream transcription factor of cAMP/PKA. Overexpression of CREB reduced high glucose-induced podocyte apoptosis. Inhibition of PKA by Rp-cAMP also diminished the effects of puerarin on high glucose-induced podocyte apoptosis. We conclude that the renal protective effects of puerarin are likely through inhibiting Gnai1 to activate cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway in podocytes. "
1059,25526743,"Developing brain is highly susceptible to hypoxic-ischemic injury leading to severe neurological disabilities in surviving infants and children. Previously we reported induction of neuronal pentraxin 1 (NP1) in hypoxic-ischemic injury in neonatal brain and NP1 co-localization with the excitatory AMPA receptors GluR1 at the synaptic sites. However, how NP1 contributes to hypoxic-ischemic neuronal injury is not completely understood. Here we report that extracellular secretion of NP1 is required for ischemic neuronal death. Primary cortical neurons at days in vitro (DIV) 12 were subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD), an in vitro model of ischemic stroke, for different time periods (2-8 h). Oxygen glucose deprivation showed characteristic morphological changes of dying cells, OGD time-dependent induction of NP1 (2-4-fold) and increased neuronal death. In contrast, the NP1-KO cortical neurons were healthy and showed no sign of dying cells under similar conditions. NP1gene silencing by NP1-specific small interfering RNA (NP1-siRNA) protected cortical neurons from OGD-induced death. Conditioned media (CM) collected from OGD exposed WT cortical cultures caused neurotoxicity when added to a subset of DIV 12 normoxia control WT cortical cultures. In contrast, CM from OGD-exposed NP1-KO cultures did not induce cell toxicity in control WT cultures, suggesting a role for extracellular NP1 in neuronal death. However, NP1-KO neurons, which showed normal neuronal morphology and protection against OGD, sustained enhanced death following incubation with CM from WT OGD-exposed cultures. Western blot analysis of OGD exposed WT CM showed temporal increase of NP1 protein levels in the CM. Most strikingly, in contrast to NP1-KO CM, incubation of normal cortical cultures with CM from OGD exposed NP2-KO cultures showed neurotoxicity similar to that observed with CM from OGD exposed WT neuronal cultures. Western immunoblotting further confirmed the increased presence of NP1 protein in OGD-exposed NP2-KO CM. Live immunofluorescence analysis show intense cell surface clustering of NP1 with AMPA GluR1 receptors. Collectively, our results demonstrate that extracellular release of NP1 promote hypoxic-ischemic neuronal death possibly via surface clustering with GluR1 at synaptic sites and that NP1, not its family member NP2, is involved in the neuronal death mechanisms.

A retrospective cohort study involving 48,973 women with fasting blood glucose (FPG) below diagnostic thresholds and lipid screening in early pregnancy was performed. Data of pregnancy outcomes including gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDP), and neonatal outcomes were obtained for multivariable logistic analysis. As a result, higher FPG (≥75th, 4.68 mM) significantly increased risks of GDM (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 2.81; 95% CI, 2.60 to 3.05) and HDP (1.98; 1.81 to 2.16), and slightly increased risks of large for gestational age (LGA), macrosomia births and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) compared to women with low FPG (≤25th, 4.21 mM). High maternal triglyceride (mTG) level had higher risks of GDM and HDP in all maternal FPG strata. Further analysis showed that women of top quartile of glucose combined with upper 10 percentile triglyceride have higher risks for GDM (AOR, 5.97; 95% CI, 5.26 to 6.78; risk difference 30.8, 95% CI 29.2 to 32.3) and HDP (AOR, 2.56; 95% CI, 2.20 to 2.99, risk difference 11.3, 95% CI 9.9 to 12.7) when compared to those in women of the bottom strata after adjustment. Therefore, both the early-pregnancy FPG and mTG levels should be screened among overall population including the low-risk population to reduce the incidence of pregnancy complications. "

1063,26873963,"The mRen2 female rat is an estrogen- and salt-sensitive model of hypertension that reflects the higher pressure and salt sensitivity associated with menopause. We previously showed that the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) mediates estrogenic effects in this model. The current study hypothesized that GPER protects against vascular injury during salt loading. Intact mRen2 female rats were fed a normal (NS; 0.5% Na(+)) or high-salt diet (HS; 4% Na(+)) for 10 wk, which significantly increased systolic blood pressure (149 ± 5 vs. 224 ± 8 mmHg;P< 0.001). Treatment with the selective GPER agonist G-1 for 2 wk did not alter salt-sensitive hypertension (216 ± 4 mmHg;P> 0.05) or ex vivo vascular responses to angiotensin II or phenylephrine (P> 0.05). However, G-1 significantly attenuated salt-induced aortic remodeling assessed by media-to-lumen ratio (NS: 0.43; HS+veh: 0.89; HS+G-1: 0.61;P< 0.05). Aortic thickening was not accompanied by changes in collagen, elastin, or medial proliferation. However, HS induced increases in medial layer glycosaminoglycans (0.07 vs. 0.42 mm(2);P< 0.001) and lipid peroxidation (0.11 vs. 0.51 mm(2);P< 0.01), both of which were reduced by G-1 (0.20 mm(2)and 0.23 mm(2); both P< 0.05). We conclude that GPER's beneficial actions in the aorta of salt-loaded mRen2 females occur independently of changes in blood pressure and vasoreactivity. GPER-induced attenuation of aortic remodeling was associated with a reduction in oxidative stress and decreased accumulation of glycosaminoglycans. Endogenous activation of GPER may protect females from salt- and pressure-induced vascular damage. "

1065,36191374,"Postpartum depression (PPD) is a serious mental health concern of new mothers worldwide. In view of the particularity of puerpera, the research on pathogenesis and drug development of PPD are highly dependent on animal models. Although both maternal separation (MS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) modeling approaches have been used in PPD studies, the characteristics of the two rodent models have not been compared to explain which is more advantageous in PPD research. In this study, we applied 21-day MS and CUMS paradigms to induce mouse model of PPD and compared their differences in behavior, physiology and gut microbiota. As a result, the two models exhibited significant increases of immobility time in forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST), whereas sucrose preference index and pup weight were significantly decreased. Both displayed depression-like behaviors, and CUMS was more obvious, which demonstrated by the lower levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and higher hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis related mRNA expression (corticotropin releasing hormone, corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1) in CMUS group than that in MS group. The gut microbiota in MS and CUMS groups were significantly different in terms of the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria. In conclusion, MS model and CUMS model have different performance in behavior and physiology. The CUMS model showed more obvious parameter changes, which may be more suitable for PPD induced by various social environmental factors. "
1066,30714174,"Glycogen storage disease type-Ia (GSD-Ia), caused by a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphatase-α (G6Pase-α or G6PC), is characterized by impaired glucose homeostasis with a hallmark hypoglycemia, following a short fast. We have shown that G6pc-deficient (G6pc-/-) mice treated with recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors expressing either wild-type (WT) (rAAV-hG6PC-WT) or codon-optimized (co) (rAAV-co-hG6PC) human (h) G6Pase-α maintain glucose homeostasis if they restore ≥3% of normal hepatic G6Pase-α activity. The co vector, which has a higher potency, is currently being used in a phase I/II clinical trial for human GSD-Ia (NCT03517085). While routinely used in clinical therapies, co vectors may not always be optimal. Codon-optimization can impact RNA secondary structure, change RNA/DNA protein-binding sites, affect protein conformation and function, and alter posttranscriptional modifications that may reduce potency or efficacy. We therefore sought to develop alternative approaches to increase the potency of the G6PC gene transfer vectors. Using an evolutionary sequence analysis, we identified a Ser-298 to Cys-298 substitution naturally found in canine, mouse, rat, and several primate G6Pase-α isozymes, that when incorporated into the WT hG6Pase-α sequence, markedly enhanced enzymatic activity. Using G6pc-/- mice, we show that the efficacy of the rAAV-hG6PC-S298C vector was 3-fold higher than that of the rAAV-hG6PC-WT vector. The rAAV-hG6PC-S298C vector with increased efficacy, that minimizes the potential problems associated with codon-optimization, offers a valuable vector for clinical translation in human GSD-Ia. "
1067,37008938,"Insulin resistance (IR) with associated compensatory hyperinsulinemia (HI) are early abnormalities in the etiology of prediabetes (preT2D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). IR and HI also associate with increased erythrocytosis. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is commonly used to diagnose and monitor preT2D and T2D, but can be influenced by erythrocytosis independent of glycemia. We undertook bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) in individuals of European ancestry to investigate potential causal associations between increased fasting insulin adjusted for BMI (FI), erythrocytosis and its non-glycemic impact on HbA1c. We investigated the association between the triglyceride-glucose index (TGI), a surrogate measure of IR and HI, and glycation gap (difference between measured HbA1c and predicted HbA1c derived from linear regression of fasting glucose) in people with normoglycemia and preT2D. Inverse variance weighted MR (IVWMR) suggested that increased FI increases hemoglobin (Hb, b=0.54 ± 0.09, p=2.7 x 10 MR suggests increased FI increases erythrocytosis and might potentially decrease HbA1c by non-glycemic effects. Increased TGI, a surrogate measure of increased FI, associates with lower-than-expected HbA1c in people with preT2D. These findings merit confirmatory studies to evaluate their clinical significance.

1068,24662331,"Type 1 diabetes is caused by an aberrant response against pancreatic β cells. Intestinal K cells are glucose-responsive endocrine cells that might be engineered to secrete insulin. We generated diabetes-prone non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice that express insulin, via a transgene, in K cells. We assessed the effects on immunogenicity and diabetes development. Diabetes incidence and glucose homeostasis were assessed in NOD mice that expressed mouse preproinsulin II from a transgene in K cells and nontransgenic NOD mice (controls); pancreas and duodenum tissues were collected and analyzed by histology. We evaluated T cell responses to insulin, levels of circulating autoantibodies against insulin, and the percentage of circulating antigen-specific T cells. Inflammation of mesenteric and pancreatic lymph node cells was also evaluated. The transgenic mice tended to have lower blood levels of glucose than control mice, associated with increased plasma levels of immunoreactive insulin and proinsulin. Fewer transgenic mice developed diabetes than controls. In analyses of pancreas and intestine tissues from the transgenic mice, insulin-producing K cells were not affected by the immune response and the mice had reduced destruction of endogenous β cells. Fewer transgenic mice were positive for insulin autoantibodies compared with controls. Cells isolated from mesenteric lymph nodes of the transgenic mice had significantly lower rates of proliferation and T cells from transgenic mice tended to secrete lower levels of inflammatory cytokines than from controls. At 15 weeks, transgenic mice had fewer peripheral CD8(+) T cells specific for NRP-V7 than control mice. NOD mice with intestinal K cells engineered to express insulin have reduced blood levels of glucose, are less likely to develop diabetes, and have reduced immunity against pancreatic β cells compared with control NOD mice. This approach might be developed to treat patients with type 1 diabetes. "

1072,19059741,"Although associated factors are important for the occurrence of neural damage in neonatal hypoglycemia, they are not fully understood. Sixty patients with neonatal hypoglycemia were studied through a review of their medical records in Tottori University Hospital. The patients were classified into two main groups: Group I were patients who had mental retardation, developmental delay, cerebral palsy or epilepsy while Group II were those who were normal in their follow-up. Group I consisted of 12 patients while Group II consisted of 48 patients. The median gestational age was 38 weeks in Group I and 36.7 weeks in Group II. The frequencies of small for gestational age were similar in both groups. Blood glucose levels less than 15 mg/dl were more frequent in Group 1 (50.0%) than in Group 2 (14.6%) (P=0.015). Duration of hypoglycemia was longer in Group I (median, 14 h) than in Group II (median, 1.75 h) (p<0.001). The following factors were more frequent in Group I than in Group II: toxemia (33.3% and 8.3%, p=0.043), fetal distress (58.3% and 14.5%, p=0.004), an Apgar score of less than 5 at 1 min (33.3% and 6.4%, p=0.025), neonatal seizure (53.8% and 4.3%, p<0.001) and pathological jaundice (41.7% and 6.4%, p=0.006). Cranial CT or MRI revealed cerebral lesions in 8 of the 9 Group I patients in follow-up examinations. This study indicates that severe and prolonged neonatal hypoglycemia can cause cerebral lesions and other perinatal risk factors, such as hypoxia, neonatal seizure and pathological jaundice, would exacerbate hypoglycemic brain injuries.

1073,34145455,"The key gut microbial biomarkers for polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and how dysbiosis causes insulin resistance and PCOS remain unclear. To assess the characteristics of intestinal flora in PCOS and explore whether abnormal intestinal flora can affect insulin resistance and promote PCOS and whether chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) can activate intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR), improving glucose metabolism in PCOS. The intestinal flora of treatment-naïve PCOS patients and hormonally healthy controls was analyzed. Phenotype analysis, intestinal flora analysis, and global metabolomic profiling of caecal contents were performed on a letrozole-induced PCOS mouse model; similar analyses were conducted after 35 days of antibiotic treatment on the PCOS mouse model, and glucose tolerance testing was performed on the PCOS mouse model after a 35-day CDCA treatment. Mice receiving fecal microbiota transplants from PCOS patients or healthy controls were evaluated after 10 weeks. Bacteroides was significantly enriched in treatment-naïve PCOS patients. The enrichment in Bacteroides was reproduced in the PCOS mouse model. Gut microbiota removal ameliorated the PCOS phenotype and insulin resistance and increased relative FXR mRNA levels in the ileum and serum fibroblast growth factor 15 levels. PCOS stool-transplanted mice exhibited insulin resistance at 10 weeks but not PCOS. Treating the PCOS mouse model with CDCA improved glucose metabolism. Bacteroides is a key microbial biomarker in PCOS and shows diagnostic value. Gut dysbiosis can cause insulin resistance. FXR activation might play a beneficial rather than detrimental role in glucose metabolism in PCOS. "
1074,30668393,"Oxidative stress contributes to the pathogenesis of many human diseases. Cinnamon is a worldwide used spice, dietary supplement and traditional medicine, and is used for the therapy of oxidative stress related diseases. A well-established concept is that the functions of cinnamon preventing oxidative stress-induced diseases are attributed to the occurrence of cinnamaldehyde and its analogues. In our continuous searching of natural molecules with antioxidant capacity, we have found that cinnamaldehyde and its analogues in cinnamon are weak inhibitors of oxidative stress, and thus we speculate that there are novel and/or potent molecules inhibiting oxidative stress in cinnamon. A systemic phytochemical investigation of cinnamon using column chromatography was performed to identify the chemical constituents of cinnamon, and then their capacity of inhibiting oxidative stress and action of mechanism targeting Nrf2 pathway were investigated using diverse bioassay, including NAD(P)H: quinone reductase (QR) assay, immunoblot analysis, luciferase reporter gene assay, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Cinnamon improved the intracellular antioxidant capacity. A systemic phytochemical investigation of cinnamon gave the isolation of twenty-two chemical ingredients. The purified constituents were tested for their potential inhibitory effects against oxidative stress. Besides cinnamaldehyde analogues, a lignan pinoresinol (PRO) and a flavonol (-)-(2R,3R)-5,7-dimethoxy-3', 4'-methylenedioxy-flavan-3-ol (MFO) were firstly identified to be inhibitors of oxidative stress. Further study indicated that PRO and MFO activated Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response, and protected human lung epithelial cells against sodium arsenite [As(III)]-induced oxidative insults. The lignan PRO and the flavonoid MFO are two novel Nrf2 activators protecting tissues against oxidative insults, and these two constituents support the application of cinnamon as an agent against oxidative stress related diseases.

1075,36014937,"Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, different non-validated tests were proposed to simplify the diagnosis of gestational diabetes (GDM). Aim: To analyse the effects of replacing the two-step approach for Early-GDM and GDM diagnosis, with a fasting plasma glucose test. Material and Methods: This is a cohort study consisting of 3200 pregnant women: 400 with Early-GDM, 800 with GDM and 2000 with Non-GDM diagnosed using the two-step approach. Using fasting plasma glucose for Early-GDM and GDM diagnosis, according to the recommendations of Spain, Australia, Italy and the UK during the pandemic, the rates of missed and new Early-GDM and GDM were calculated and perinatal outcomes were analysed. Results: Using fasting plasma glucose in the first trimester >100 mg/dL for Early-GDM diagnosis, the rates of post-COVID missed and new Early-GDM were 79.5% and 3.2%, respectively. Using fasting plasma glucose at 24−28 weeks <84 or >92, 95 or 100 mg/dL for GDM diagnosis, the rates of missed GDM were 50.4%, 78%, 82.6% and 92.4%, respectively, and 8.6%, 5.6% and 2.3% women with Non-GDM were diagnosed with new GDM. Conclusion: Fasting plasma glucose is not a good test for the diagnosis of GDM either in the first trimester or at 24−28 weeks. "
1076,34789726,"TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a protein that induces apoptosis in cancer cells but not in normal ones, where its effects remain to be fully understood. Previous studies have shown that in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, TRAIL treatment reduced body weight gain, insulin resistance, and inflammation. TRAIL was also able to increase skeletal muscle free fatty acid oxidation. The aim of the present work was to evaluate TRAIL actions on skeletal muscle. Our in vitro data on C2C12 cells showed that TRAIL treatment significantly increased myogenin and MyHC and other hallmarks of myogenic differentiation, which were reduced by Dr5 (TRAIL receptor) silencing. In addition, TRAIL treatment significantly increased AKT phosphorylation, which was reduced by Dr5 silencing, as well as glucose uptake (alone and in combination with insulin). Our in vivo data showed that TRAIL increased myofiber size in HFD-fed mice as well as in db/db mice. This was associated with increased myogenin and PCG1α expression. In conclusion, TRAIL/DR5 pathway promotes AKT phosphorylation, skeletal muscle differentiation, and glucose uptake. These data shed light onto a pathway that might hold therapeutic potential not only for the metabolic disturbances but also for the muscle mass loss that are associated with diabetes. "

To examine the effects of coronary angioplasty on 13 asynergic vascular territories in 12 patients, positron emission tomography and two-dimensional echocardiography were performed before and within 72 h of revascularization. Ten patients underwent late echocardiography (67 +/- 19 days) and eight underwent a late positron emission tomographic study (68 +/- 19 days). The extent and severity of abnormalities of wall motion, perfusion and glucose metabolism were expressed as wall motion scores, perfusion defect scores and perfusion-metabolism mismatch scores. Angioplasty significantly increased mean stenosis cross-sectional area (from 0.95 +/- 0.9 to 2.7 +/- 1.4 mm2) and mean cross-sectional luminal diameter (from 0.9 +/- 0.6 to 1.9 +/- 0.5 mm) (both p less than 0.001). Perfusion defect scores in dependent vascular territories improved early after angioplasty (from 116 +/- 166 to 31 +/- 51, p less than 0.002) with no further improvement on the late follow-up study. The mean perfusion-metabolism mismatch score decreased from 159 +/- 175 to 65 +/- 117 early after angioplasty (p less than 0.01) and to 26 +/- 29 at late follow-up (p less than 0.001 vs. before angioplasty; p = NS vs. early after angioplasty). However, absolute rates of glucose utilization remained elevated early after revascularization, normalizing only at late follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) "
1079,35470010,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most serious complications of advanced diabetes, and increases patient mortality. Recently, epigenetics-mediated hyperglycemic memory in pathological process of DN has received attention. The purpose of this study was to determine the underlying mechanism by which sirt7 modulates hyperglycemic memory in DN. In glomerular endothelial cells (GECs) cultured in high glucose and glomeruli of DN patients and rats, an increase in p65 phosphorylation and endothelial adhesion molecule levels persisted after glucose normalization but was reversed by glucose normalization associated with death-associated protein kinase-3 (DAPK3) knockout or DAPK3 inhibitor. High glucose-mediated decrease in sirt7, the deacetylase modulating H3K18-acetylation (H3K18ac), was sustained after normoglycemia. Sirt7 overexpression accompanied by glucose normalization suppressed DAPK3 expression and inflammation in GECs. Moreover, sh-sirt7-induced inflammation was inhibited by si-DAPK3. Furthermore, sirt7 and H3K18ac were located at the DAPK3 promoter region. ELK1 was found to combine with sirt7. si-ELK1 supplemented with normoglycemia inhibited high glucose-induced DAPK3 expression and inflammation in GECs. ELK1 overexpression-mediated inflammation was inhibited by si-DAPK3. In addition, ELK1 and sirt7 were located at the same promoter region of DAPK3. ELK1 overexpression enhanced DAPK3 promoter activity, which disappeared after specific binding site mutation. In vivo, sirt7 overexpression decreased inflammation and improved renal function during insulin treatment of DN rats, whereas insulin alone did not work. Our data demonstrated high glucose-mediated mutual inhibition between sirt7 and ELK1 induced DAPK3 transcription and inflammation despite normoglycemia in GECs, thus forming a vicious cycle and participating in the occurrence of hyperglycemic memory in DN.

1080,21937637,"A coxsackievirus vector, vCVB(dm) (v stands for vector, CVB stands for group B coxsackievirus, and dm stands for double mutant), has been produced from a unique strain of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) containing 2 mutations that confer the property of highly selective pancreatropism. This vector has been tested as a delivery vehicle for glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), a peptide that enhances pancreatic regeneration following tissue damage. vCVB(dm) is a live vector comprising the entire plus-strand RNA genome with a multiple cloning site (MCS) inserted between the P1 and P2 gene regions. The MCS is flanked by sequences encoding the cleavage site for viral protease 2Apro that processes the polyprotein to release the incorporated gene. Our studies show that this vector selectively delivers GLP-1 to the pancreas where it is expressed in foci scattered throughout the acinar tissue for 4 or 5 days. Moreover, expression is associated with new beta cell clusters in juxtaposition to vector-infected cells. Inoculation of streptozotocin (STZ)-treated mice with vCVB(dm)GLP-1 was found to suppress development of hyperglycemia and increase insulin production relative to mice treated with STZ alone or with empty vector. This vector has the advantage of exclusively targeting pancreas and has potential use for short-term gene delivery to this tissue. The lack of viral integration provides a significant safety feature, making this vector a possible option for use as a therapeutic tool for pancreas-related diseases, including type 1 and 2 diabetes, pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer.

1081,32862552,"The aim was to determine whether commercial baby foods marketed within Europe (up to 36 months of age) have inappropriate formulation and high sugar content and to provide suggestions to update European regulations and recommendations as part of a nutrient profile model developed for this age group. The latter was produced following recommended World Health Organization (WHO) steps, including undertaking a rapid literature review. Packaging information from countries across the WHO European region was used to determine mean energy from total sugar by food category. The percentage of products containing added sugar and the percentage of savoury meal-type products containing pureed fruit were also calculated. A total of 2,634 baby foods from 10 countries were summarised: 768 sold in the United Kingdom, over 200 each from Denmark (319), Spain (241), Italy (430) and Malta (243) and between 99-200 from Hungary, Norway, Portugal, Estonia and Slovenia. On average, approximately a third of energy in baby foods in these European countries came from total sugar, and for most food categories, energy from sugar was higher than 10%. Use of added sugars was widespread across product categories, with concentrated fruit juice most commonly used. Savoury meal-type purees did not contain added sugars except in United Kingdom and Malta; however, fruit as an ingredient was found in 7% of savoury meals, most frequently seen in UK products. Clear proposals for reducing the high sugar content seen in commercial baby foods were produced. These suggestions, relating to both content and labelling, should be used to update regulations and promote product reformulation. "

PCOS mice were constructed with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and treated with EcN, FMT or IL-22 inhibitors. Clinically control and PCOS subjects were included for further analysis. Serum and follicular fluid supernatant levels of sex hormones, insulin, glucose, cholesterol, and inflammatory factors were detected by ELISA and biochemical reagents. The pathological changes of ovarian tissues were observed by HE staining. The JC-1 level and COX4 gene expression in granulosa cells was detected by ELISA and RT-qPCR. The expressions of progesterone receptor A (PR-A), LC3II/I, Beclin1, p62 and CytC were detected by western blot. The number of autophagosomes in granulosa cells was observed by electron microscopy. 16S rRNA and LC-MS/MS were used to analyze the changes of gut microbiota and metabolism. EcN promoted the recovery of sex hormone levels and ovarian tissue morphology, promoted the expression of IL-22, COX4 and PR-A in granulosa cells, and inhibited mitophagy in PCOS mice. EcN decreased the number of gut microbiota, and significantly increased the abundance of  EcN improved IL-22 level and mitochondrial damage of granulosa cells in PCOS mice by promoting the recovery of sex hormone levels and ovarian tissue morphology, inhibiting the amount of gut microbiota, and promoting amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism.

There were 30 cases of normal pregnant women and 30 cases of pregnant women with ICP recruited in the study, all of whom underwent cesarean delivery from Mar. 2017 to Jan. 2018. Placenta tissues, maternal blood and cord blood were collected in each case. Maternal blood and cord blood were sent for biochemical detection. miRNA of placenta tissues was extracted and qRT-PCR was used to measure the expression of miR-148b-3p in the placenta. Normal HTR-8 cells were transfected with miR-148b-3p inhibitor/mimics wrapped with lipofectaine3000. qRT-PCR was used to measure the expression of miR-148b-3p, and Western blot was used to measure the expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) after transfection.

1084,24280512,"While remote ischemic preconditioning (rIPC) protects the mature heart against ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, the effect on the neonatal heart is not known. The neonatal heart relies almost solely on carbohydrate metabolism, which is modified by rIPC in the mature heart. We hypothesized that rIPC combined with metabolic support with glucose-insulin (GI) infusion improves cardiac function and reduces infarct size after IR injury in neonatal piglets in-vivo. 32 newborn piglets were randomized into 4 groups: control, GI, GI+rIPC and rIPC. GI and GI+rIPC groups received GI infusion continuously from 40 min prior to ischemia. rIPC and GI+rIPC groups underwent four cycles of 5 min limb ischemia. Myocardial IR injury was induced by 40 min occlusion of the left anterior descending artery followed by 2 h reperfusion. Myocardial lactate concentrations were assessed in microdialysis samples analyzed by mass spectrometry. Infarct size was measured using triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Systolic recovery (dP/dt(max) as % of baseline) after 2 h reperfusion was 68.5±13.8% in control, 53.7±11.2% in rIPC (p<0.05), and improved in GI (83.6±18.8%, p<0.05) and GI+rIPC (87.0±15.7%, p<0.01). rIPC+GI protects the neonatal porcine heart against IR injury in-vivo. rIPC alone has detrimental metabolic and functional effects that are abrogated by simultaneous GI infusion.

1085,23028139,"The glucagon-like peptides (GLP-1 and GLP-2) are processed from the proglucagon polypeptide and secreted in equimolar amounts but have opposite effects on chylomicron (CM) production, with GLP-1 significantly reducing and GLP-2 increasing postprandial chylomicronemia. In the current study, we evaluated the apparent paradoxical roles of GLP-1 and GLP-2 under physiological conditions in the Syrian golden hamster, a model with close similarity to humans in terms of lipoprotein metabolism. A short (30-min) intravenous infusion of GLP-2 resulted in a marked increase in postprandial apolipoprotein B48 (apoB48) and triglyceride (TG) levels in the TG-rich lipoprotein (TRL) fraction, whereas GLP-1 infusion decreased lipid absorption and levels of TRL-TG and apoB48. GLP-1 and GLP-2 coinfusion resulted in net increased lipid absorption and an increase in TRL-TG and apoB48. However, prolonged (120-min) coinfusion of GLP-1 and GLP-2 decreased postprandial lipemia. Blocking dipeptidyl peptidase-4 activity resulted in decreased postprandial lipemia. Interestingly, fructose-fed, insulin-resistant hamsters showed a more pronounced response, including possible hypersensitivity to GLP-2 or reduced sensitivity to GLP-1. In conclusion, under normal physiological conditions, the actions of GLP-2 predominate; however, when GLP-1 activity is sustained, the hypolipidemic action of GLP-1 predominates. Pharmacological inhibition of GLP-1 degradation tips the balance toward an inhibitory effect on intestinal production of atherogenic CM particles. "
1086,33471939,"Inflammatory bowel disease affects approximately seven million people globally. Iron deficiency anaemia can occur as a common systemic manifestation, with a prevalence of up to 90%, which can significantly affect quality of life, both during periods of active disease or in remission. It is important that iron deficiency anaemia is treated effectively and not be assumed to be a normal finding of inflammatory bowel disease. The various routes of iron administration, doses and preparations present varying advantages and disadvantages, and a significant proportion of people experience adverse effects with current therapies. Currently, no consensus has been reached amongst physicians as to which treatment path is most beneficial. The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the interventions for the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia in people with inflammatory bowel disease. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two other databases on 21st November 2019. We also contacted experts in the field and searched references of trials for any additional trials. Randomised controlled trials investigating the effectiveness and safety of iron administration interventions compared to other iron administration interventions or placebo in the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia in inflammatory bowel disease. We considered both adults and children, with studies reporting outcomes of clinical, endoscopic, histologic or surgical remission as defined by study authors. Two review authors independently conducted data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment of included studies. We expressed dichotomous and continuous outcomes as risk ratios and mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE methodology. We included 11 studies (1670 randomised participants) that met the inclusion criteria. The studies compared intravenous iron sucrose vs oral iron sulphate (2 studies); oral iron sulphate vs oral iron hydroxide polymaltose complex (1 study); oral iron fumarate vs intravenous iron sucrose (1 study); intravenous ferric carboxymaltose vs intravenous iron sucrose (1 study); erythropoietin injection + intravenous iron sucrose vs intravenous iron sucrose + injection placebo (1 study); oral ferric maltol vs oral placebo (1 study); oral ferric maltol vs intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (1 study); intravenous ferric carboxymaltose vs oral iron sulphate (1 study); intravenous iron isomaltoside vs oral iron sulphate (1 study); erythropoietin injection vs oral placebo (1 study). All studies compared participants with CD and UC together, as well as considering a range of disease activity states. The primary outcome of number of responders, when defined, was stated to be an increase in haemoglobin of 20 g/L in all but two studies in which an increase in 10g/L was used. In one study comparing intravenous ferric carboxymaltose and intravenous iron sucrose, moderate-certainty evidence was found that intravenous ferric carboxymaltose was probably superior to intravenous iron sucrose, although there were responders in both groups (150/244 versus 118/239, RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.46, number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 9). In one study comparing oral ferric maltol to placebo, there was low-certainty evidence of superiority of the iron (36/64 versus 0/64, RR 73.00, 95% CI 4.58 to 1164.36). There were no other direct comparisons that found any difference in the primary outcomes, although certainty was low and very low for all outcomes, due to imprecision from sparse data and risk of bias varying between moderate and high risk. The reporting of secondary outcomes was inconsistent. The most common was the occurrence of serious adverse events or those requiring withdrawal of therapy. In no comparisons was there a difference seen between any of the intervention agents being studied, although the certainty was very low for all comparisons made, due to risk of bias and significant imprecision due to the low numbers of events. Time to remission, histological and biochemical outcomes were sparsely reported in the studies. None of the other secondary outcomes were reported in any of the studies. An analysis of all intravenous iron preparations to all oral iron preparations showed that intravenous administration may lead to more responders (368/554 versus 205/373, RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.31, NNTB = 11, low-certainty due to risk of bias and inconsistency). Withdrawals due to adverse events may be greater in oral iron preparations vs intravenous (15/554 versus 31/373, RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.74, low-certainty due to risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision). Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose probably leads to more people having resolution of IDA (iron deficiency anaemia) than intravenous iron sucrose. Oral ferric maltol may lead to more people having resolution of IDA than placebo. We are unable to draw conclusions on which of the other treatments is most effective in IDA with IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) due to low numbers of studies in each comparison area and clinical heterogeneity within the studies. Therefore, there are no other conclusions regarding the treatments that can be made and certainty of all findings are low or very low. Overall, intravenous iron delivery probably leads to greater response in patients compared with oral iron, with a NNTB (number needed to treat) of 11. Whilst no serious adverse events were specifically elicited with any of the treatments studied, the numbers of reported events were low and the certainty of these findings very low for all comparisons, so no conclusions can be drawn. There may be more withdrawals due to such events when oral is compared with intravenous iron delivery. Other outcomes were poorly reported and once again no conclusions can be made as to the impact of IDA on any of these outcomes. Given the widespread use of many of these treatments in practice and the only guideline that exists recommending the use of intravenous iron in favour of oral iron, research to investigate this key issue is clearly needed. Considering the current ongoing trials identified in this review, these are more focussed on the impact in specific patient groups (young people) or on other symptoms (such as fatigue). Therefore, there is a need for studies to be performed to fill this evidence gap. "
1087,27061726,"Exercise increases skeletal muscle energy turnover and one of the important substrates for the working muscle is glucose taken up from the blood. The GTPase Rac1 can be activated by muscle contraction and has been found to be necessary for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, although its role in exercise-stimulated glucose uptake is unknown. We show that Rac1 regulates the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in skeletal muscle during exercise. We find that Rac1 knockout mice display significantly reduced glucose uptake in skeletal muscle during exercise. Exercise increases skeletal muscle energy turnover and one of the important substrates for the working muscle is glucose taken up from the blood. Despite extensive efforts, the signalling mechanisms vital for glucose uptake during exercise are not yet fully understood, although the GTPase Rac1 is a candidate molecule. The present study investigated the role of Rac1 in muscle glucose uptake and substrate utilization during treadmill exercise in mice in vivo. Exercise-induced uptake of radiolabelled 2-deoxyglucose at 65% of maximum running capacity was blocked in soleus muscle and decreased by 80% and 60% in gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles, respectively, in muscle-specific inducible Rac1 knockout (mKO) mice compared to wild-type littermates. By developing an assay to quantify endogenous GLUT4 translocation, we observed that GLUT4 content at the sarcolemma in response to exercise was reduced in Rac1 mKO muscle. Our findings implicate Rac1 as a regulatory element critical for controlling glucose uptake during exercise via regulation of GLUT4 translocation. "
1088,28641978,"Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) is a secretory protein that can be cleaved to form an N-terminal and a C-terminal protein. Studies performed thus far have linked ANGPTL4 to several cancer-related and metabolic processes. Notably, several point mutations in the C-terminal ANGPTL4 (cANGPTL4) have been reported, although no studies have been performed that ascribed these mutations to cancer-related and metabolic processes. In this study, we compared the characteristics of tumors with and without wild-type (wt) cANGPTL4 and tumors with cANGPTL4 bearing the T266M mutation (T266M cANGPTL4). We found that T266M cANGPTL4 bound to integrin α5β1 with a reduced affinity compared to wt, leading to weaker activation of downstream signaling molecules. The mutant tumors exhibited impaired proliferation, anoikis resistance, and migratory capability and had reduced adenylate energy charge. Further investigations also revealed that cANGPTL4 regulated the expression of Glut2. These findings may explain the differences in the tumor characteristics and energy metabolism observed with the cANGPTL4 T266M mutation compared to tumors without the mutation. "
1089,36459457,"Serum soluble leptin receptor (sOb-R) may protect against future type 2 diabetes or serve as a marker for protective features, but how sOb-R is regulated is largely unknown. This work aimed to test how serum sOb-R is influenced by glucose, insulin, body fat, body mass index (BMI), food intake, and physical activity. We performed an epidemiological triangulation combining cross-sectional, interventional, and Mendelian randomization study designs. In 5 independent clinical studies (n = 24-823), sOb-R was quantified in serum or plasma by commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits using monoclonal antibodies. We performed mixed-model regression and 2-sample Mendelian randomization. In pooled, cross-sectional data, leveling by study, sOb-R was associated inversely with BMI (β [95% CI] -0.19 [-0.21 to -0.17]), body fat (-0.12 [-0.14 to -0.10), and fasting C-peptide (-2.04 [-2.46 to -1.62]). sOb-R decreased in response to acute hyperinsulinemia during euglycemic glucose clamp in 2 independent clinical studies (-0.5 [-0.7 to -0.4] and -0.5 [-0.6 to -0.3]), and immediately increased in response to intensive exercise (0.18 [0.04 to 0.31]) and food intake (0.20 [0.06 to 0.34]). In 2-sample Mendelian randomization, higher fasting insulin and higher BMI were causally linked to lower sOb-R levels (inverse variance weighted, -1.72 [-2.86 to -0.58], and -0.20 [-0.36 to -0.04], respectively). The relationship between hyperglycemia and sOb-R was inconsistent in cross-sectional studies and nonsignificant in intervention studies, and 2-sample Mendelian randomization suggested no causal effect of fasting glucose on sOb-R. BMI and insulin both causally decreased serum sOb-R levels. Conversely, intensive exercise and food intake acutely increased sOb-R. Our results suggest that sOb-R is involved in short-term regulation of leptin signaling, either directly or indirectly, and that hyperinsulinemia may reduce leptin signaling. "
1090,36545332,"First episode of psychosis (FEP) patients display a wide variety of metabolic disturbances at onset, which might underlie these patients' increased morbidity and early mortality. Glycemic abnormalities have been previously related to pharmacological agents; however, recent research highlights the impact of early life events. Birth weight (BW), an indirect marker of the fetal environment, has been related to glucose abnormalities in the general population over time. We aim to evaluate if BW correlates with glucose values in a sample of FEP patients treated with different antipsychotics. Two hundred and thirty-six patients were included and evaluated for clinical and metabolic variables at baseline and at 2, 6, 12, and 24 months of follow-up. Pearson correlations and linear mixed model analysis were conducted to analyze the data. Antipsychotic treatment was grouped due to its metabolic risk profile. In our sample of FEP patients, BW was negatively correlated with glucose values at 24 months of follow-up [r=-0.167, p=0.037]. BW showed a trend towards significance in the association with glucose values over the 24-month period (F=3.22; p=0.073) despite other confounders such as age, time, sex, body mass index, antipsychotic type, and chlorpromazine dosage. This finding suggests that BW is involved in the evolution of glucose values over time in a cohort of patients with an FEP, independently of the type of pharmacological agent used in treatment. Our results highlight the importance of early life events in the later metabolic outcome of patients. "
1091,36165813,"Adipose tissue is a very dynamic metabolic organ that plays an essential role in regulating whole-body glucose homeostasis. Dysfunctional adipose tissue hypertrophy with obesity is associated with fibrosis and type 2 diabetes. Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) is a transcription cofactor important in the Hippo signaling pathway. However, the role of YAP in adipose tissue and glucose homeostasis is unknown. To study the role of YAP with metabolic stress, we assessed how increased weight and insulin resistance impact YAP in humans and mouse models. To further investigate the in vivo role of YAP specifically in adipose tissue and glucose homeostasis, we developed adipose tissue-specific YAP knockout mice and placed them on either chow or high fat diet (HFD) for 12-14 weeks. To further study the direct role of YAP in adipocytes we used 3T3-L1 cells. We found that YAP protein levels increase in adipose tissue from humans with type 2 diabetes and mouse models of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. This suggests that YAP signaling may contribute to adipocyte dysfunction and insulin resistance under metabolic stress conditions. On an HFD, adipose tissue YAP knockout mice had improved glucose tolerance compared to littermate controls. Perigonadal fat pad weight was also decreased in knockout animals, with smaller adipocyte size. Adipose tissue fibrosis and gene expression associated with fibrosis was decreased in vivo and in vitro in 3T3-L1 cells treated with a YAP inhibitor or siRNA. We show that YAP is increased in adipose tissue with weight gain and insulin resistance. Disruption of YAP in adipocytes prevents glucose intolerance and adipose tissue fibrosis, suggesting that YAP plays an important role in regulating adipose tissue and glucose homeostasis with metabolic stress.

1092,38059537,"The mechanisms behind the diminished incretin effect in type 2 diabetes are uncertain, but impaired vagal transmission has been suggested. We aimed to investigate the association between the incretin effect and autonomic neuropathy, and the degree of dysglycaemia and duration of diabetes. For a cross-sectional study, we included participants with either longstanding type 2 diabetes, recent onset, untreated diabetes and controls without diabetes matched for age, sex and body mass index. Autonomic nerve function was assessed with cardiovascular reflex tests, heart rate variability and sudomotor function. Visceral afferent nerves in the gut were tested performing rapid rectal balloon distention. An oral glucose tolerance test and an intravenous isoglycaemic glucose infusion were performed to calculate the incretin effect and gastrointestinal-mediated glucose disposal (GIGD). Sixty-five participants were recruited. Participants with diabetes had rectal hyposensitivity for earliest sensation (3.7 ± 1.1 kPa in longstanding, 4.0 ± 1.3 in early), compared to controls (3.0 ± 0.9 kPa), p = .005. Rectal hyposensitivity for earliest sensation was not associated with the incretin effect (rho = -0.204, p = .106), but an association was found with GIGD (rho -0.341, p = .005). Incretin effect and GIGD were correlated with all glucose values, HbA1c and duration of diabetes. Rectal hyposensitivity was uncovered in both longstanding and early type 2 diabetes, and was not associated with the incretin effect, but with GIGD, implying a potential link between visceral neuropathy and gastrointestinal handling of glucose. Both the incretin effect and GIGD were associated with the degree of dysglycaemia and the duration of diabetes. Some of the data have previously been published and presented as a poster on the American Diabetes Association 83rd Scientific Sessions: Meling et al; 1658-P: Rectal Hyposensitivity, a Potential Marker of Enteric Autonomic Nerve Dysfunction, Is Significantly Associated with Gastrointestinally Mediated Glucose Disposal in Persons with Type 2 Diabetes.

1093,32400082,"Angiogenesis is critical for re-establishing the blood supply to the surviving myocardium after myocardial infarction (MI). Long non-coding RNA ANRIL (lncRNA-ANRIL) has been reported to regulate endothelial functions in cardiovascular diseases. This study was to determine the role of lncRNA-ANRIL in Akt regulation and cardiac functions after MI. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) to mimic in vivo ischaemia. The MI model in mice was induced by ligating left anterior descending coronary artery. OGD remarkably decreased lncRNA-ANRIL expression level, reduced the phosphorylated levels of Akt and eNOS proteins, and inhibited NO release and cell viability, which were duplicated by shRNA-mediated gene knockdown of lncRNA-ANRIL. Conversely, all these effects induced by OGD were abolished by adenovirus-mediated overexpression of lncRNA-ANRIL in HUVECs. Further, OGD impaired cell migrations and tube formations in HUVECs, which were reversed by lncRNA-ANRIL overexpression or Akt up-regulation. RNA immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that the affinity of lncRNA-ANRIL to Akt protein was increased in OGD-treated cells. In animal studies, adenovirus-mediated lncRNA-ANRIL overexpression increased the phosphorylated levels of Akt and eNOS, promoted post-ischaemic angiogenesis and improved heart functions in mice with MI surgery. LncRNA-ANRIL regulates Akt phosphorylation to improve endothelial functions, which promotes angiogenesis and improves cardiac functions in mice following MI. In this perspective, targeting lncRNA-ANRIL/Akt may be considered to develop a drug to treat angiogenesis-related diseases. "
1094,29467382,"Few p53 regulators participate in selective control of p53-mediated cellular metabolism. How p53-mediated aerobic and glycolytic pathways are negatively regulated remains largely unclear. Here, we identified two KRAB-type zinc-finger proteins, PITA (p53 inhibitor of TIGAR activation) and PISA (p53 inhibitor of SCO2 activation), as selective regulators of p53 in metabolic control. PITA and PISA interact with p53 and specifically suppress transcription of the glycolysis regulator TIGAR and the oxidation phosphorylation regulator SCO2, respectively. Importantly, PITA transgenic mice exhibited increased 6-phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1) activity and an elevated glycolytic rate, whereas PISA transgenic mice had decreased cytochrome c oxidase activity and reduced mitochondrial respiration. In response to glucose starvation, PITA dissociates from p53, resulting in activation of p53 and induction of TIGAR, which inhibited aerobic glycolysis. Prolonged starvation leads to PISA dissociation from p53 and induction of SCO2 and p53-promoted mitochondrial respiration. The dynamic regulation of PITA and PISA upon metabolic stress is dependent on ATM kinase-mediated phosphorylation of PITA and PISA. Furthermore, in human colorectal cancers, the elevated expression of PITA and PISA correlates with cancer progression. Depletion of PITA or PISA in colorectal cancer cells reduced the cell proliferation, migration and invasion. These results identify PITA and PISA as selective regulators of p53-mediated glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration and provide novel insights into the role of p53 network in cell metabolic control.

1095,34428182,"Insulin and IGF-1 are essential for adipocyte differentiation and function. Mice lacking insulin and IGF-1 receptors in fat (FIGIR-KO, fat-specific IGF-1 receptor and insulin receptor-KO) exhibit complete loss of white and brown adipose tissue (WAT and BAT), glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, hepatosteatosis, and cold intolerance. To determine the role of FOXO transcription factors in the altered adipose phenotype, we generated FIGIR-KO mice with fat-specific KO of fat-expressed Foxos [Foxo1, Foxo3, Foxo4] (F-Quint-KO). Unlike FIGIR-KO mice, F-Quint-KO mice had normal BAT, glucose tolerance, insulin-regulated hepatic glucose production, and cold tolerance. However, loss of FOXOs only partially rescued subcutaneous WAT and hepatosteatosis, did not rescue perigonadal WAT or systemic insulin resistance, and led to even more marked hyperinsulinemia. Thus, FOXOs play different roles in insulin/IGF-1 action in different adipose depots, being most important in BAT, followed by subcutaneous WAT and then by visceral WAT. Disruption of FOXOs in fat also led to a reversal of insulin resistance in liver, but not in skeletal muscle, and an exacerbation of hyperinsulinemia. Thus, adipose FOXOs play a unique role in regulating crosstalk between adipose depots, liver, and β cells. "
1096,27981781,"Previous research has shown that diet is associated with low-grade systemic inflammation among adults. However, no study has yet been conducted to explore the association between inflammatory potential of diet and low-grade systemic inflammation among adolescents whose dietary behavior may be different from adults. We examine the predictive ability of 24-h recall-derived dietary inflammatory index (DII) scores on inflammation among 532 European adolescents in the HELENA cross-sectional study. The DII is a literature-derived dietary index developed to predict inflammation. The DII was calculated per 1000 calories and was tested against C-reactive protein, ILs-1,2,4,10, TNF-α, ICAM, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM), and IFN-γ. All inflammatory markers had nonnormal distributions and therefore were log transformed. Analyses were performed using multivariable linear regression, adjusting for age, sex, city, BMI, smoking, and physical activity. Pro-inflammatory diet (higher DII scores) was associated with increased levels of various inflammatory markers: TNF-α, IL-1, 2, IFN-γ,  and vascular cell adhesion molecule (b These results reinforce the fact that diet, as a whole, plays an important role in modifying inflammation in adolescents.

1097,38744825,"Energetic stress compels cells to evolve adaptive mechanisms to adjust their metabolism. Inhibition of mTOR kinase complex 1 (mTORC1) is essential for cell survival during glucose starvation. How mTORC1 controls cell viability during glucose starvation is not well understood. Here we show that the mTORC1 effectors eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding proteins 1/2 (4EBP1/2) confer protection to mammalian cells and budding yeast under glucose starvation. Mechanistically, 4EBP1/2 promote NADPH homeostasis by preventing NADPH-consuming fatty acid synthesis via translational repression of Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase 1 (ACC1), thereby mitigating oxidative stress. This has important relevance for cancer, as oncogene-transformed cells and glioma cells exploit the 4EBP1/2 regulation of ACC1 expression and redox balance to combat energetic stress, thereby supporting transformation and tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, high EIF4EBP1 expression is associated with poor outcomes in several cancer types. Our data reveal that the mTORC1-4EBP1/2 axis provokes a metabolic switch essential for survival during glucose starvation which is exploited by transformed and tumor cells. "

1100,34229177,"Our previous research demonstrated that compound licochalcone E can reduce glucose tolerance and lipid metabolism in diabetic rats, although its mechanism remains unknown. Here, we used palmitic acid (PA) to establish a PA-treated HepG2 model, and then examined glucose uptake, glucose consumption, and blood lipids to evaluate the effects of licochalcone E within the safe dose range in the model. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect the expression levels of key genes associated with liver gluconeogenesis; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was deployed to evaluate the concentration of inflammatory factors; and laser confocal microscopy and western blot were used to determine the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway-related proteins, respectively. Finally, molecular simulations were exploited to validate the interaction between licochalcone E and the NLRP3 inflammasome. The results demonstrated that licochalcone E showed no toxicity in the dose range of 2.5-40 μM. In this dose range, licochalcone E substantially increased the uptake and consumption of glucose in the insulin resistance model and dose-dependently reduced the concentration of total cholesterol. The PCR results indicated that licochalcone E dose-dependently reduced the expression of Glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) genes and increased the expression of Glucose Transporter 4 (Glut4) in PA-treated HepG2. Moreover, the ELISA results revealed that licochalcone E significantly reduced the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-18. Confocal microscopy results showed that licochalcone E dramatically reduced the generation of ROS and the expressions of NLRP3 and its downstream caspase-1 in PA-treated HepG2 model. Western blot results further indicated that licochalcone E significantly reduced the expression of NLRP3, caspase-1 and IL-1β in the model. Additionally, molecular simulations demonstrated that licochalcone E has good binding affinity for the NLPR3 inflammasome. We concluded that licochalcone E has the potential to be used as an insulin sensitizer by reducing the release of ROS and inflammatory factors following inhibition of the NLPR3 signaling pathway. "
1101,28857179,"Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS) is a common epilepsy syndrome that is often poorly controlled by antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment. Comparative AED effectiveness studies in this condition are lacking. We report retention, efficacy, and tolerability in a cohort of patients with MTLE-HS. Clinical data were collected from a European database of patients with epilepsy. We estimated retention, 12-month seizure freedom, and adverse drug reaction (ADR) rates for the 10 most commonly used AEDs in patients with MTLE-HS. Seven hundred sixty-seven patients with a total of 3,249 AED trials were included. The highest 12-month retention rates were observed with carbamazepine (85.9%), valproate (85%), and clobazam (79%). Twelve-month seizure freedom rates varied from 1.2% for gabapentin and vigabatrin to 11% for carbamazepine. Response rates were highest for AEDs that were prescribed as initial treatment and lowest for AEDs that were used in a third or higher instance. ADRs were reported in 47.6% of patients, with the highest rates observed with oxcarbazepine (35.7%), topiramate (30.9%), and pregabalin (27.4%), and the lowest rates with clobazam (6.5%), gabapentin (8.9%), and lamotrigine (16.6%). The most commonly reported ADRs were lethargy and drowsiness, dizziness, vertigo and ataxia, and blurred vision and diplopia. Our results did not demonstrate any clear advantage of newer versus older AEDs. Our results provide useful insights into AED retention, efficacy, and ADR rates in patients with MTLE-HS. "
1102,18211968,"GH replacement in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) children has well-defined benefits and risks and is used extensively worldwide. Its use in PWS adults has been limited by documentation of benefits and risks, as determined by larger multisite studies. Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of GH in GH-deficient genotype-positive PWS adults. We conducted a 12-month open-label multicenter trial with 6-month dose-optimization and 6-month stable treatment periods. The study was conducted at outpatient treatment facilities at four U.S. academic medical centers. Lean and obese PWS adults with diverse cognitive skills, behavioral traits, and living arrangements were recruited from clinical populations. Human recombinant GH (Genotropin) was initiated at 0.2 mg/d with monthly 0.2-mg increments to a maximum 1.0 mg/d, as tolerated. Lean body mass and percent fat were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Lean body mass increased from 42.65 +/- 2.25 (se) to 45.47 +/- 2.31 kg (P < or = 0.0001), and percent fat decreased from 42.84 +/- 1.12 to 39.95 +/- 1.34% (P = 0.025) at a median final dose of 0.6 mg/d in 30 study subjects who completed 6-12 months of GH. Mean fasting glucose of 85.3 +/- 3.4 mg/dl, hemoglobin A1c of 5.5 +/- 0.2%, fasting insulin of 5.3 +/- 0.6 microU/ml, area under the curve for insulin of 60.4 +/- 7.5 microU/ml, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance of 1.1 +/- 0.2 were normal at baseline in 38 study initiators, including five diabetics, and remained in normal range. Total T(3) increased 26.7% from 127.0 +/- 7.8 to 150.5 +/- 7.8 ng/dl (P = 0.021) with normalization in all subjects, including six (20%) with baseline T(3) values at least 2 sd below the mean. Mildly progressive ankle edema was the most serious treatment-emergent adverse event (five patients). This multicenter study demonstrates that GH improves body composition, normalizes T(3), and is well tolerated without glucose impairment in PWS genotype adults. "
1103,23571713,"We recently discovered that chronic high fructose intake by lactating rats prevented adaptive increases in rates of active intestinal Ca(2+) transport and in levels of 1,25-(OH)2D3, the active form of vitamin D. Since sufficient Ca(2+) absorption is essential for skeletal growth, our discovery may explain findings that excessive consumption of sweeteners compromises bone integrity in children. We tested the hypothesis that 1,25-(OH)2D3 mediates the inhibitory effect of excessive fructose intake on active Ca(2+) transport. First, compared with those fed glucose or starch, growing rats fed fructose for 4 wk had a marked reduction in intestinal Ca(2+) transport rate as well as in expression of intestinal and renal Ca(2+) transporters that was tightly associated with decreases in circulating levels of 1,25-(OH)2D3, bone length, and total bone ash weight but not with serum parathyroid hormone (PTH). Dietary fructose increased the expression of 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) and decreased that of 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), suggesting that fructose might enhance the renal catabolism and impair the synthesis, respectively, of 1,25-(OH)2D3. Serum FGF23, which is secreted by osteocytes and inhibits CYP27B1 expression, was upregulated, suggesting a potential role of bone in mediating the fructose effects on 1,25-(OH)2D3 synthesis. Second, 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment rescued the fructose effect and normalized intestinal and renal Ca(2+) transporter expression. The mechanism underlying the deleterious effect of excessive fructose intake on intestinal and renal Ca(2+) transporters is a reduction in serum levels of 1,25-(OH)2D3. This finding is significant because of the large amounts of fructose now consumed by Americans increasingly vulnerable to Ca(2+) and vitamin D deficiency. "
1104,33516079,"This study aimed to assess the association between grip strength and glucose regulation in a cross-sectional setting. Using data from the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study, 924 men and 953 women were studied at a mean age of 61.6 years. Grip strength was assessed in the dominant hand using a Newtest Grip Force dynamometer. A standard 2-h 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was used to define glucose regulation. The participants were classified into four groups: normoglycaemia, prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance), newly diagnosed diabetes and previously known diabetes. The association between grip strength and glucose regulation was assessed using multiple linear regression models. Prediabetes was diagnosed in 32.2% and diabetes in 8.4% using the OGTT. A total of 7.8% of the individuals had previously known diabetes. Compared to individuals with normoglycaemia, grip strength was lower for those with newly diagnosed diabetes (-1.8 kg, 95% CI -3.2 to -0.5) as well as those with previously known diabetes (-1.8 kg, 95% CI -3.2 to -0.4) after adjusting for covariates (age, sex, body mass index, physical activity, education and smoking). No difference in grip strength was found when comparing those with prediabetes and normoglycaemia. In adults, grip strength was lower among those with known and newly diagnosed diabetes compared to those with normoglycaemia. Together with previous findings on associations between grip strength and chronic diseases, these results support the use of grip strength as an overall health marker in adults. "
1105,27686967,"New onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is a metabolic disorder that affects 40% of patients on immunosuppressive agent (IA) treatment, such as rapamycin (also known as sirolimus). IAs negatively modulate insulin action in peripheral tissues including skeletal muscle, liver and white fat. However, the effects of IAs on insulin sensitivity and thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) have not been investigated. We have analyzed the impact of rapamycin on insulin signaling, thermogenic gene-expression and mitochondrial respiration in BAT. Treatment of brown adipocytes with rapamycin for 16h significantly decreased insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein expression and insulin-mediated protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation. Consequently, both insulin-induced glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation to the plasma membrane and glucose uptake were decreased. Early activation of the N-terminal Janus activated kinase (JNK) was also observed, thereby increasing IRS1 Ser 307 phosphorylation. These effects of rapamycin on insulin signaling in brown adipocytes were partly prevented by a JNK inhibitor. In vivo treatment of rats with rapamycin for three weeks abolished insulin-mediated Akt phosphorylation in BAT. Rapamycin also inhibited norepinephrine (NE)-induced lipolysis, the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) and uncoupling protein (UCP)-1 in brown adipocytes. Importantly, basal mitochondrial respiration, proton leak and maximal respiratory capacity were significantly decreased in brown adipocytes treated with rapamycin. In conclusion, we demonstrate, for the first time the important role of brown adipocytes as target cells of rapamycin, suggesting that insulin resistance in BAT might play a major role in NODAT development.

1106,38180308,"The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of combined lead (Pb) and two types of microplastic (MP) (polyvinyl chloride [PVC] and polyethylene [PE]) exposure on glucose metabolism and investigate the role of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway in mediating these effects in mice. Adult C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into four groups: control, Pb (100 mg/L), MPs (containing 10 mg/L PE and PVC), and Pb + MPs, each of which was treated with drinking water. Treatments were conducted for 6 weeks. Co-exposure to Pb + MPs exhibited increase glycosylated serum protein levels, insulin resistance, and damaged glucose tolerance compared with the control mice. Additionally, treatment with Pb + MPs caused more severe damage to hepatocytes than when exposed to them alone concomitantly, exposed to Pb + MPs exhibited improved the levels of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and malondialdehyde, but reduced superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase assay in livers. Furthermore, they increase the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and phosphorylated p-NF-κB protein levels but reduced the protein levels of heme oxygenase-1 and Nrf2, as well as increased Keap1 mRNA and Nrf2 mRNA. Co-exposure to Pb + MP impacts glucose metabolism via the Nrf2 /NF-κB pathway. "
1107,29044175,"Pompe disease is caused by an inborn defect of lysosomal acid α-glucosidase (GAA) and is characterized by lysosomal glycogen accumulation primarily in the skeletal muscle and heart. Patients with the severe type of the disease, infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD), show generalized muscle weakness and heart failure in early infancy. They cannot survive over two years. Enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) improves the survival rate, but its effect on skeletal muscle is insufficient compared to other organs. Moreover, the patho-mechanism of skeletal muscle damage in IOPD is still unclear. Here we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with IOPD and differentiated them into myocytes. Differentiated myocytes showed lysosomal glycogen accumulation, which was dose-dependently rescued by rhGAA. We further demonstrated that mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity was impaired in IOPD iPSC-derived myocytes. Comprehensive metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses suggested the disturbance of mTORC1-related signaling, including deteriorated energy status and suppressed mitochondrial oxidative function. In summary, we successfully established an in vitro skeletal muscle model of IOPD using patient-specific iPSCs. Disturbed mTORC1 signaling may contribute to the pathogenesis of skeletal muscle damage in IOPD, and may be a potential therapeutic target for Pompe disease. "
1108,35349915,"Cell-cell fusion of cytotrophoblasts into the syncytiotrophoblast layer is a key process in placental development. Syncytin, an endogenous retroviral envelope protein, is expressed in placental trophoblasts and specifically mediates syncytiotrophoblast layer formation. Syncytin deficiency has been observed in fetal growth-restricted placentas. Abnormal fetal growth, especially fetal growth restriction, is associated with the decreased expression of glucose transporters. Here, we aimed to determine the role of syncytin in fetal growth restriction in placental glucose transport capacity. To better explore the function of syncytin in fetal growth-restricted placenta, we generated an inducible knockout mouse model of syncytin-a gene. The expression levels of glucose transporters in BeWo cells were measured before and after HERV-W knockdown. Syncytin-A disruption was associated with significant abnormalities in placental and fetal development in mice. Syncytin-A destruction causes extensive abnormalities in the maternal-fetal exchange structures in the labyrinth, including an extremely reduced number and dramatically irregular distribution of fetal vessels. Moreover, glucose transporter 1, glucose transporters 3, and connexin 26 expression levels decreased after E14.5. Consistently, low glucose transporter 1, glucose transporter 3, and connexin 26 levels were observed in HERV-W-silenced BeWo cells. Syncytin-A is crucial for both syncytiotrophoblast layer development and morphogenesis, suggesting that syncytin-A disruption leads to fetal growth restriction associated with abnormalities in the maternal-fetal exchange barrier and decreased glucose transport.

1109,31270323,"β-Arrestins are major regulators of G protein-coupled receptor-mediated signaling processes. Their potential roles in regulating adipocyte function in vivo remain unexplored. Here we report the novel finding that mice lacking β-arrestin-2 (barr2) selectively in adipocytes show significantly reduced adiposity and striking metabolic improvements when consuming excess calories. We demonstrate that these beneficial metabolic effects are due to enhanced signaling through adipocyte β3-adrenergic receptors (β3-ARs), indicating that barr2 represents a potent negative regulator of adipocyte β3-AR activity in vivo. Interestingly, essentially all beneficial metabolic effects caused by adipocyte barr2 deficiency are absent in adipocyte barr2-PRDM16 double KO mice, indicating that the metabolic improvements caused by the lack of barr2 in adipocytes are mediated by the browning/beiging of white adipose tissue. Our data support the novel concept that 'G protein-biased' β3-AR agonists that do not promote β3-AR/barr2 interactions may prove useful for the treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders. "
1110,26652733,"Glucocorticoid hormones play essential roles in the regulation of gluconeogenesis in the liver, an adaptive response that is required for the maintenance of circulating glucose levels during fasting. Glucocorticoids do this by cooperating with glucagon, which is secreted from pancreatic islets to activate the cAMP-signaling pathway in hepatocytes. The cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2) is a coactivator known to be specific to CREB and plays a central role in the glucagon-mediated activation of gluconeogenesis in the early phase of fasting. We show here that CRTC2 also functions as a coactivator for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). CRTC2 strongly enhances GR-induced transcriptional activity of glucocorticoid-responsive genes. CRTC2 physically interacts with the ligand-binding domain of the GR through a region spanning amino acids 561-693. Further, CRTC2 is required for the glucocorticoid-associated cooperative mRNA expression of the glucose-6-phosphatase, a rate-limiting enzyme for hepatic gluconeogenesis, by facilitating the attraction of GR and itself to its promoter region already occupied by CREB. CRTC2 is required for the maintenance of blood glucose levels during fasting in mice by enhancing the GR transcriptional activity on both the G6p and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pepck) genes. Finally, CRTC2 modulates the transcriptional activity of the progesterone receptor, indicating that it may influence the transcriptional activity of other steroid/nuclear receptors. Taken together, these results reveal that CRTC2 plays an essential role in the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis through coordinated regulation of the glucocorticoid/GR- and glucagon/CREB-signaling pathways on the key genes G6P and PEPCK.

1111,38265287,"Delayed Golgi export of proinsulin has recently been identified as an underlying mechanism leading to insulin granule loss and β-cell secretory defects in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Because acidification of the Golgi lumen is critical for proinsulin sorting and delivery into the budding secretory granule, we reasoned that dysregulation of Golgi pH may contribute to proinsulin trafficking defects. In this report, we examined pH regulation of the Golgi and identified a partial alkalinization of the Golgi lumen in a diabetes model. To further explore this, we generated a β-cell specific knockout (KO) of the v0a2 subunit of the v-ATPase pump, which anchors the v-ATPase to the Golgi membrane. Although loss of v0a2 partially neutralized Golgi pH and was accompanied by distension of the Golgi cisternae, proinsulin export from the Golgi and insulin granule formation were not affected. Furthermore, β-cell function was well preserved. β-cell v0a2 KO mice exhibited normal glucose tolerance in both sexes, no genotypic difference to diet-induced obesity, and normal insulin secretory responses. Collectively, our data demonstrate the v0a2 subunit contributes to β-cell Golgi pH regulation but suggest that additional disturbances to Golgi structure and function contribute to proinsulin trafficking defects in diabetes.

1112,35748295,"Mendelian randomization (MR) suggests that postprandial hyperinsulinemia (unadjusted for plasma glucose) increases BMI, but its impact on cardiometabolic disease, a leading cause for mortality and morbidity in people with obesity, is not established. Fat distribution i.e., increased centripetal and/or reduced femoro-gluteal adiposity, is causally associated with and better predicts cardiometabolic disease than BMI. We therefore undertook bidirectional MR to assess the effect of corrected insulin response (CIR) (insulin 30 min after a glucose challenge adjusted for plasma glucose) on BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), leg fat, type 2 diabetes (T2D), triglyceride (TG), HDL, liver fat, hypertension (HTN), and coronary artery disease (CAD) in people of European descent. Inverse variance-weighted MR suggests a potential causal association between increased CIR and increased BMI (b = 0.048 ± 0.02, P = 0.03), increased leg fat (b = 0.029 ± 0.012, P = 0.01), reduced T2D (b = -0.73 ± 0.15, P = 6 × 10-7, odds ratio [OR] 0.48 [95% CI 0.36-0.64]), reduced TG (b = -0.07 ± 0.02, P = 0.003), and increased HDL (b = 0.04 ± 0.01, P = 0.006) with some evidence of horizontal pleiotropy. CIR had neutral effects on WHR (b = 0.009 ± 0.02, P = 0.69), liver fat (b = -0.08 ± 0.04, P = 0.06), HTN (b = -0.001 ± 0.004, P = 0.7, OR 1.00 [95% CI 0.99-1.01]), and CAD (b = -0.002 ± 0.002, P = 0.48, OR 0.99 [95% CI 0.81-1.21]). T2D decreased CIR (b -0.22 ± 0.04, P = 1.3 × 10-7), with no evidence that BMI, TG, HDL, liver fat, HTN, and CAD modulate CIR. In conclusion, we did not find evidence that increased CIR increases cardiometabolic disease. It might increase BMI with favorable fat distribution, reduce T2D, and improve lipids. "
1113,35713293,"Testosterone decline and deficiency in males have aroused increased attention in male health management, which might have a close relationship with insulin resistance (IR). We utilized a novel and practical IR indicator, the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, to investigate the association between the TyG index and serum testosterone in US adult males. This was a cross-sectional study based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013-2014 and 2015-2016. The TyG index was calculated from fasting plasma glucose and serum triglyceride, and serum testosterone was measured by isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in NHANES. A total of 2186 male participants aged more than 20 years old were included, and the mean TyG index was 8.72 ± 0.71. Participants with a higher TyG index showed a lower level of total testosterone (β = -45.83, 95% CI: -58.50, -33.15, p < 0.0001) and a higher risk of testosterone deficiency (OR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.46, 2.21, p < 0.0001) after we adjusted for all potential cofounders. Males in TyG index tertile 3 had a 113% (95% CI: 1.50, 3.02, p < 0.0001) higher risk of testosterone deficiency than those in tertile 1. Subgroup analysis stratified by diabetes condition indicated that the TyG index might be a good predictor of testosterone decline or deficiency in either people with or without diabetes. However, ROC cure analysis indicated that a larger area under the curve was found in the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (0.71, 95% CI: 0.68,0.74) than in the TyG index (0.67, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.70). Males with a higher TyG index tended to have a higher risk of testosterone decline or even testosterone deficiency. However, the predictability of the TyG index for testosterone deficiency was not better than that of HOMA-IR. More well-designed studies are still needed to validate this relationship. "
1114,11912545,"A novel animal model of insulin resistance, the fructose-fed Syrian golden hamster has been previously documented to exhibit considerable hepatic very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) overproduction concomitant with the development of whole body insulin resistance. Here, we investigated whether hepatic lipoprotein overproduction can be ameliorated by treatment with a hydroxymethyl glutaryl conenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, atorvastatin, using a series of ex vivo experiments. Hamsters were fed a fructose-enriched diet for 14 days to induce a state of insulin resistance, and then continued on a fructose-enriched diet supplemented with or without 40 mg/kg atorvastatin per day for 14 days. Fructose feeding in the first 2 weeks caused a significant increase in plasma total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. There was a significant decline in plasma triglyceride levels following supplementation with the inhibitor (50% to 59%; P <.05). Experiments with primary hepatocytes revealed a decreased VLDL-apolipoprotein B (apoB) production (37.4% +/- 10.4%; P <.05) in hamsters treated with atorvastatin. Interestingly, atorvastatin treatment partially attenuated (by 23%) the elevated hepatic level of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) induced by fructose feeding. There was molecular evidence of improved hepatic insulin sensitivity with atorvastatin treatment based on assessment of the phosphorylation status of the insulin receptor and the expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B. The improvement in insulin signaling was not mediated by a change in hepatic triglyceride accumulation as no significant difference was observed in liver triglyceride levels. Taken together, these data suggest that statins can ameliorate the VLDL-apoB overproduction state observed in a fructose-fed, insulin-resistant hamster model, and may potentially contribute to an enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity.

1116,30205382,"Recently, we observed an increase in O-GlcNAc (O-linked-ß-N-acetylglucosamine) modification, and signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins 3 (STAT3) expression in primary retinal vascular endothelial cells (RVECs) under high glucose conditions and tissues altered by diabetic retinopathy (DR). In this study, we focused on the correlations between O-GlcNAcylation and STAT3 phosphorylation, and their potential effects with regards to DR. Expression of O-GlcNAcylation and STAT3 were detected in DR-affected tissues and primary RVECs. The relationship between O-GlcNAcylation and STAT3 was further delineated by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Effects of O-GlcNAcylation on human RVEC apoptosis and involved protein expression were assayed with flow cytometry and Western blot. Global O-GlcNAcylation and pSTAT3 levels were significantly elevated in diabetic rat retina and primary RVECs under high glucose conditions. In vitro assays demonstrated that the Tyr705 site was sensitive to high glucose. While O-GlcNAcylation inhibited p727STAT3 expression, augmented O-GlcNAcylation could balance p705STAT3 expression within relatively high levels corresponding to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) changes. Immunoprecipitation revealed that STAT3 was modified by O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation simultaneously. Next, we observed that overexpression of O-GlcNAcylation could relieve human RVEC apoptosis related to the JAK2-Tyr705STAT3-VEGF pathway. O-GlcNAcylation could relieve RVECs apoptosis through the STAT3 pathway in DR, and O-GlcNAcylation combined with STAT3 phosphorylation might open up new insights into the mechanisms of DR and other diabetic complications.

1117,36777355,"Gut microbiota of pregnant women change with the gestational week. On the one hand, they participate in the metabolic adaptation of pregnant women. On the other hand, the abnormal composition of gut microbiota of pregnant women is more likely to suffer from gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Therefore, gut microbiota targeted treatment through dietary supplements is particularly important for prevention or treatment. Prebiotic supplements containing galactooligosaccharides (GOS) may be an intervention method, but the effect is still unclear. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of prebiotic intervention in healthy pregnant women during pregnancy, and to explore the possible effects of intervention on pregnant women and the influence on gut microbiota as preliminaries. After recruitment in first trimester, 52 pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive GOS intervention or placebo containing fructooligosaccharides. 16S rRNA sequencing technology was used to detect the composition, diversity and differential flora of gut microbiota. Lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism and inflammatory factors during pregnancy were also analyzed. The adverse symptoms of GOS intervention are mild and relatively safe. For pregnant women, there was no significant difference in the GDM incidence rates and gestational weight gain (GWG) in the GOS group compared with placebo (P > 0.05). Compared with the placebo group, the levels of FPG, TG, TC, HDL-C LDL-C, and IL-6 had no significant difference in GOS group (P > 0.05). For newborns, there was no significant difference between GOS group and placebo group in the following variables including gestational week, birth weight, birth length, head circumference, chest circumference, sex, and delivery mode (P > 0.05). And compared with the placebo group, the GOS group had a higher abundance of  GOS prebiotics appear to be safe and acceptable for the enrolled pregnancies. Although GOS intervention did not show the robust benefits on glucose and lipid metabolism. However, the intervention had a certain impact on the compostion of gut microbiota. GOS can be considered as a dietary supplement during pregnancy, and further clinical studies are needed to explore this in the future. "
1118,36210016,"Socioeconomic status has been related to poorer eating behaviors, potentially due to feeling of lower status relative to peers. Despite experimental evidence that temporarily feeling of lower status can contribute to greater caloric intake, it remains unclear how feeling of lower social status relate to eating behavior in daily life. This study aimed to test whether lower subjective social status (SSS)-the feeling of having relatively lower social status-in American society and relative to college peers were related to daily food selection. A sample of 131 young adults (Mage = 20.3, SD = 0.8; 60% female; 46% Latinos; 34% European American; 15% Asian American; 5% of other ethnicities) reported their SSS in society and in college and completed 15 daily reports regarding the number of daily servings they had of fruits, vegetables, fried foods, fast foods, desserts, and sugary drinks. Multilevel models with days nested within individuals were used to test whether low SSS in society or college related to daily food intake. Next, we examined whether associations were driven by young adults' perceived stress and daily stressors. Analyses controlled for age, gender, ethnicity, family and personal income, and parents' education to test the unique associations between subjective status and food intake. Whereas SSS in society was not related to food intake, young adults with lower SSS in their college consumed fewer daily servings of healthy foods and more daily servings of high-fat/high-sugar foods. Although lower college SSS was related to greater perceived stress, perceived stress and daily stressors were consistently unrelated to daily food intake. Findings suggested that lower SSS in local environments (e.g., college) may impact young adults' daily food choices through processes beyond heightened stress. "
1119,36724092,"Calcium ion movements between cellular stores and the cytosol govern muscle contraction, the most energy-consuming function in mammals, which confers skeletal myofibers a pivotal role in glycemia regulation. Chronic myoplasmic calcium elevation (""calcium stress""), found in malignant hyperthermia-susceptible (MHS) patients and multiple myopathies, has been suggested to underlie the progression from hyperglycemia to insulin resistance. What drives such progression remains elusive. We find that muscle cells derived from MHS patients have increased content of an activated fragment of GSK3β - a specialized kinase that inhibits glycogen synthase, impairing glucose utilization and delineating a path to hyperglycemia. We also find decreased content of junctophilin1, an essential structural protein that colocalizes in the couplon with the voltage-sensing Ca "
1120,33173969,"Autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) are two major protein degradation pathways involved in brain ischemia. Autophagy can compensate for UPS impairment‑induced cellular dysfunction. HECT, UBA and WWE domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (Huwe1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, serves critical roles in nervous system plasticity, regeneration and disease. However, the role of Huwe1 in autophagy in brain ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the crosstalk between autophagy and the UPS in brain ischemia. The present study established an oxygen‑glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) model in rat primary cortex neurons in vitro. Lentiviral interference was used to silence the expression of Huwe1. An autophagy promoter (rapamycin), an autophagy inhibitor (wortmannin) and a JNK pathway inhibitor (SP600125) were also used in the current study. Cellular autophagy‑related proteins, including Beclin‑1, autophagy related (ATG) 7, ATG5, ATG3 and microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 α, and apoptosis‑related proteins, such as P53, cleaved caspase 3, Bax and Bcl2, were detected via western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Neuronal apoptosis was evaluated using a TUNEL assay. The results demonstrated that silencing Huwe1 increased the expression levels of autophagy‑related proteins at 24 h after OGD/R. Treatment with a JNK inhibitor or cotreatment with Huwe1 shRNA significantly increased autophagy. Rapamycin increased apoptosis under OGD/R conditions. However, treatment with Huwe1 shRNA decreased the number of TUNEL‑positive cells at 24 h after OGD/R. Cotreatment with Huwe1 shRNA and wortmannin alleviated neuronal apoptosis under OGD/R conditions compared with cotreatment with DMSO. Collectively, the present results suggested that silencing Huwe1 was accompanied by a compensatory induction of autophagy under OGD/R conditions. Furthermore, the JNK pathway may be a key mediator of the interaction between Huwe1 and autophagy in response to UPS impairment. "
1121,11598116,"A fructose-fed hamster model of insulin resistance was previously documented to exhibit marked hepatic very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) overproduction. Here, we investigated whether VLDL overproduction was associated with down-regulation of hepatic insulin signaling and insulin resistance. Hepatocytes isolated from fructose-fed hamsters exhibited significantly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity as well as insulin-stimulated Akt-Ser473 and Akt-Thr308 phosphorylation were also significantly reduced with fructose feeding. Interestingly, the protein mass and activity of protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP-1B) were significantly higher in fructose-fed hamster hepatocytes. Chronic ex vivo exposure of control hamster hepatocytes to high insulin also appeared to attenuate insulin signaling and increase PTP-1B. Elevation in PTP-1B coincided with marked suppression of ER-60, a cysteine protease postulated to play a role in intracellular apoB degradation, and an increase in the synthesis and secretion of apoB. Sodium orthovanadate, a general phosphatase inhibitor, partially restored insulin receptor phosphorylation and significantly reduced apoB secretion. In summary, we hypothesize that fructose feeding induces hepatic insulin resistance at least in part via an increase in expression of PTP-1B. Induction of hepatic insulin resistance may then contribute to reduced apoB degradation and enhanced VLDL particle assembly and secretion. "
1122,29090554,"To observe the anti-hyperglycemic effect of Puerariae Lobatae Radix in hepatocyte insulin resistance(IR) models, and investigate its preliminary molecular mechanism. IR-HepG2 cell model was stably established with 1×10-9 mol•L⁻¹ insulin plus 3.75×10-6 mol•L-1 dexamethasone treatment for 48 h according to optimized protocol in our research group. After IR-HepG2 cells were treated with different concentrations(5%,10% and 15%) of Puerariae Lobatae Radix-containing serum, cell viability was detected by CCK-8 assay; the glucose consumptions in IR-HepG2 cells were separately detected at different time points (12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 30, 36 h) by using glucose oxidase method; intracellular glycogen content was detected by anthrone method; and the protein expression levels of leptin receptor (Ob-R), insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS2), glucose transporter 1(GLUT1) and GLUT2 were detected by Western blot assay. The results showed that Puerariae Lobatae Radix-containing serum (5%, 10% and 15%) had no significant effect on IR-HepG2 cell viability; 5% and 10% Puerariae Lobatae Radix-containing serum significantly increased glucose consumption of IR-HepG2 cells (P<0.01) at 18, 21 and 24 h; 15% Puerariae Lobatae Radix-containing serum elevated the glucose consumption of IR-HepG2 cells at 15 h (P<0.05), and significantly elevated the glucose consumption at 18, 21, 24 and 30 h (P<0.01) in a dose-dependent manner. The optimized time of anti-hyperglycemic effect was defined as 24 h, and further study showed that Puerariae Lobatae Radix-containing serum could increase intracellular glycogen content after 24 h treatment (P<0.01), and up-regulate IRS2, Ob-R, GLUT1 and GLUT2 protein expression levels. Our results indicated that Puerariae Lobatae Radix-containing serum could achieve the anti-hyperglycemic effect through important PI3K/PDK signaling pathway partially by up-regulating the expression levels of Ob-R and IRS2, GLUT1 and GLUT2 in IR-HepG2 cells, accelerating the glucose transport into hepatocytes and increasing hepatic glycogen synthesis to enhance the anti-hyperglycemic effect of IR-HepG2 cells.

1123,36190111,"Idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) represents the prodromal stage of α-synucleinopathies. Reliable biomarkers are needed to predict phenoconversion. The aim was to derive and validate a brain glucose metabolism pattern related to phenoconversion in iRBD (iRBDconvRP) using spatial covariance analysis (Scaled Subprofile Model and Principal Component Analysis [SSM-PCA]). Seventy-six consecutive iRBD patients (70 ± 6 years, 15 women) were enrolled in two centers and prospectively evaluated to assess phenoconversion (30 converters, 73 ± 6 years, 14 Parkinson's disease and 16 dementia with Lewy bodies, follow-up time: 21 ± 14 months; 46 nonconverters, 69 ± 6 years, follow-up time: 33 ± 19 months). All patients underwent [ First, we derived and validated two distinct center-specific iRBDconvRP that were comparable and significantly able to predict phenoconversion. Then, SSM-PCA was applied to the whole set, identifying the iRBDconvRP. The iRBDconvRP included positive voxel weights in cerebellum; brainstem; anterior cingulate cortex; lentiform nucleus; and middle, mesial temporal, and postcentral areas. Negative voxel weights were found in posterior cingulate, precuneus, middle frontal gyrus, and parietal areas. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.85 (sensitivity: 87%, specificity: 72%), discriminating converters from nonconverters. The iRBDconvRP significantly predicted phenoconversion (hazard ratio: 7.42, 95% confidence interval: 2.6-21.4).

1124,26075842,"Studying the biology of the human placenta represents a major experimental challenge. Although conventional cell culture techniques have been used to study different types of placenta-derived cells, current in vitro models have limitations in recapitulating organ-specific structure and key physiological functions of the placenta. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to leverage microfluidic and microfabrication technologies to develop a microengineered biomimetic model that replicates the architecture and function of the placenta. A ""Placenta-on-a-Chip"" microdevice was created by using a set of soft elastomer-based microfabrication techniques known as soft lithography. This microsystem consisted of two polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic channels separated by a thin extracellular matrix (ECM) membrane. To reproduce the placental barrier in this model, human trophoblasts (JEG-3) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were seeded onto the opposite sides of the ECM membrane and cultured under dynamic flow conditions to form confluent epithelial and endothelial layers in close apposition. We tested the physiological function of the microengineered placental barrier by measuring glucose transport across the trophoblast-endothelial interface over time. The permeability of the barrier study was analyzed and compared to that obtained from acellular devices and additional control groups that contained epithelial or endothelial layers alone. Our microfluidic cell culture system provided a tightly controlled fluidic environment conducive to the proliferation and maintenance of JEG-3 trophoblasts and HUVECs on the ECM scaffold. Prolonged culture in this model produced confluent cellular monolayers on the intervening membrane that together formed the placental barrier. This in vivo-like microarchitecture was also critical for creating a physiologically relevant effective barrier to glucose transport. Quantitative investigation of barrier function was conducted by calculating permeability coefficients and metabolic rates in varying conditions of barrier structure. The rates of glucose transport and metabolism were consistent with previously reported in vivo observations. The ""Placenta-on-a-Chip"" microdevice described herein provides new opportunities to simulate and analyze critical physiological responses of the placental barrier. This system may be used to address the major limitations of existing placenta model systems and serve to enable research platforms for reproductive biology and medicine. "
1125,35750246,"Lifestyle factors like time of eating and stress exposure may impact physiology to promote excess weight gain. To understand behavioral and physiological mechanisms underlying these potential effects, we compared appetite and gut hormone responses to a series of meal and stress challenges beginning in the morning and the afternoon, in adults with normal-weight and obesity. Thirty-two adults (16 with normal-weight, 16 with obesity) underwent the same test protocol on different days, each following an 8 h fast. On one day the protocol began in the morning (AM condition); on the other day it began in the late afternoon (PM condition). On each day they first received a standardized liquid meal (9:00am/4:00pm), then a stress test (Socially-Evaluated Cold Pressor Test, 11:10am/6:10pm), then an ad libitum buffet meal (11:40am/6:40pm). Appetite and stress ratings were obtained, and blood was drawn for measures of ghrelin, PYY, GLP-1, insulin, glucose, cortisol and leptin. Acetaminophen was administered as a tracer to assess gastric emptying of the liquid meal. Across all three challenges, AUC cortisol was lower in the PM vs. AM condition (all p<.001), and AUC insulin and leptin were higher in the obesity vs. normal-weight group (all p<.001). For the standardized liquid meal only, AUC hunger, desire to eat and ghrelin were greater in the PM vs. AM condition (all p<0.05), and AUC ghrelin was lower in the obesity vs. normal-weight group, even when controlling for baseline values (p<0.05). AUC glucose was higher in the evening for the normal-weight group only (condition x group interaction p<0.05). Post-liquid meal gastric emptying as indexed by AUC acetaminophen was slower in the PM vs. AM (p<.01). For the stress test, AUC cortisol was lower in the PM than the AM condition even when controlling for baseline values (p<.05). AUC leptin was lower in the evening in the obesity group only (condition x group interaction p<0.01). PYY showed an acute decrease post-stressor in the normal-weight but not the obesity group (p<.05). Post-stress ad libitum buffet meal intake was similar in the evening and morning conditions, and higher in the obesity group (p<0.05). Only among the obesity group in the evening condition, higher stressor-associated stress and cortisol were associated with greater meal-associated appetite (p<0.05). Normal-weight individuals and those with obesity may be at risk of evening overeating as a result of differential appetite and gut hormone responses following meal intake and stress exposure. "
1126,38369233,"To develop a predictive model for thiamine responsive disorders (TRDs) among infants and young children hospitalized with signs or symptoms suggestive of thiamine deficiency disorders (TDDs) based on response to therapeutic thiamine in a high-risk setting. Children aged 21 days to <18 months hospitalized with signs or symptoms suggestive of TDD in northern Lao People's Democratic Republic were treated with parenteral thiamine (100 mg daily) for ≥3 days in addition to routine care. Physical examinations and recovery assessments were conducted frequently for 72 hours after thiamine was initiated. Individual case reports were independently reviewed by three pediatricians who assigned a TRD status (TRD or non-TRD), which served as the dependent variable in logistic regression models to identify predictors of TRD. Model performance was quantified by empirical area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. A total of 449 children (median [Q1, Q3] 2.9 [1.7, 5.7] months old; 70.3% exclusively/predominantly breastfed) were enrolled; 60.8% had a TRD. Among 52 candidate variables, those most predictive of TRD were exclusive/predominant breastfeeding, hoarse voice/loss of voice, cyanosis, no eye contact, and no diarrhea in the previous 2 weeks. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (95% CI) was 0.82 (0.78, 0.86). In this study, the majority of children with signs or symptoms of TDD responded favorably to thiamine. While five specific features were predictive of TRD, the high prevalence of TRD suggests that thiamine should be administered to all infants and children presenting with any signs or symptoms consistent with TDD in similar high-risk settings. The usefulness of the predictive model in other contexts warrants further exploration and refinement. Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03626337. "
1127,36693416,"The growing amount of evidence suggests the existence of a bidirectional relation between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as these two conditions exacerbate each other, causing a significant healthcare and socioeconomic burden. The alterations in innate and adaptive cellular immunity, adipose tissue, alveolar and endothelial dysfunction, hypercoagulation, the propensity to an increased viral load, and chronic diabetic complications are all associated with glucometabolic perturbations of T2DM patients that predispose them to severe forms of COVID-19 and mortality. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection negatively impacts glucose homeostasis due to its effects on insulin sensitivity and β-cell function, further aggravating the preexisting glucometabolic perturbations in individuals with T2DM. Thus, the most effective ways are urgently needed for countering these glucometabolic disturbances occurring during acute COVID-19 illness in T2DM patients. The novel classes of antidiabetic medications (dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4is), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) are considered candidate drugs for this purpose. This review article summarizes current knowledge regarding glucometabolic disturbances during acute COVID-19 illness in T2DM patients and the potential ways to tackle them using novel antidiabetic medications. Recent observational data suggest that preadmission use of GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2is are associated with decreased patient mortality, while DPP-4is is associated with increased in-hospital mortality of T2DM patients with COVID-19. Although these results provide further evidence for the widespread use of these two classes of medications in this COVID-19 era, dedicated randomized controlled trials analyzing the effects of in-hospital use of novel antidiabetic agents in T2DM patients with COVID-19 are needed.

1128,31915893,"We aimed to assess associations between cord blood metabolic markers and fetal overgrowth, and whether cord markers mediated the impact of maternal adiposity on neonatal anthropometric outcomes among children born to Indigenous and Non-Indigenous Australian women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and pregestational type 2 diabetes mellitus. From the Pregnancy and Neonatal Outcomes in Remote Australia (PANDORA) study, an observational cohort of 1135 mother-baby pairs, venous cord blood was available for 645 singleton babies (49% Indigenous Australian) of women with NGT (n = 129), GDM (n = 419) and type 2 diabetes (n = 97). Cord glucose, triacylglycerol, HDL-cholesterol, C-reactive protein (CRP) and C-peptide were measured. Multivariable logistic and linear regression were used to assess the associations between cord blood metabolic markers and the outcomes of birthweight z score, sum of skinfold thickness (SSF), being large for gestational age (LGA) and percentage of body fat. Pathway analysis assessed whether cord markers mediated the associations between maternal and neonatal adiposity. Elevated cord C-peptide was significantly associated with increasing birthweight z score (β 0.57 [95% CI 0.42, 0.71]), SSF (β 0.83 [95% CI 0.41, 1.25]), percentage of body fat (β 1.20 [95% CI 0.69, 1.71]) and risk for LGA [OR 3.14 [95% CI 2.11, 4.68]), after adjusting for age, ethnicity and diabetes type. Cord triacylglycerol was negatively associated with birthweight z score for Indigenous Australian women only. No associations between cord glucose, HDL-cholesterol and CRP >0.3 mg/l (2.9 nmol/l) with neonatal outcomes were observed. C-peptide mediated 18% (95% CI 13, 36) of the association of maternal BMI with LGA and 11% (95% CI 8, 17) of the association with per cent neonatal fat. Cord blood C-peptide is an important mediator of the association between maternal and infant adiposity, across the spectrum of maternal glucose tolerance. "

We first investigated the effect of different concentrations of insulin on the osteoblast cell proliferation and cell differentiation at various time points by MTT analysis, cell cycle analysis, and expression detection of differentiation genes. Then, we used 200 ng/mL of insulin to treat the osteoblast cell at different time points for identifying the common differentially expressed mRNAs among various time points by RNA sequencing. Thirdly, we performed the gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis to explore the biological function of these common differentially expressed mRNAs. The results showed that insulin promoted the cell proliferation and differentiation of osteoblast cell. In RNA sequencing, a total of 31 common differentially expressed mRNAs were identified between different time points. Mt1, Tmem135, Avp, and Dlg2 were found to be associated with the new bone formation. In addition, three important signalling pathways, namely, lysosome, glutamatergic synapse, and chemokine signalling pathways, were found in the KEGG enrichment analysis. Our work demonstrated that insulin could promote the osteoblast cell proliferation and cell differentiation, which may play a key role in bone formation. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Our result showed that insulin could promote the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblast at both cellular and molecular levels, which may promote the new bone formation in the osteoblasts.

1130,35749380,"Glomerular damage indicated by proteinuria is a main symptom in diabetic nephropathy. Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists (MRAs) are beneficial irrespective of aldosterone availability. Thus, we hypothesized an alternatively activated MR to promote glomerular damage in proteinuric diabetic nephropathy. Specifically, we aimed first to demonstrate the presence of steroid hormones serving as alternative MR targets in type II diabetic patients with proteinuric kidney disease, second whether MR selectivity was modified, third to characterize MR and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression and activity in glomerular cell types exposed to eu- and hyperglycemic conditions, fourth to characterize the pro-fibrotic potential of primary human renal mesangial cells (HRMC) upon stimulation with aldosterone and cortisol, and fifth to specify the involvement of the MR and/or GR in pro-fibrotic signaling. Urinary steroid hormone profiles of patients with diabetic kidney disease were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and compared to an age and gender matched healthy control group taken out of a population study. In both cohorts, the activity of the MR pre-receptor enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD11B2), which inactivates cortisol to prevent it from binding to the MR, was assessed to define a change in MR selectivity. Expression of HSD11B2, MR and GR was quantified in HRMC and primary human renal glomerular endothelial cells (HRGEC). Activity of MR and GR was explored in HRMC by measuring the MR/GR down-stream signal SGK1 and the pro-fibrotic genes TGFB1, FN1 and COL1A1 in normal and high glucose conditions with the MR/GR agonists aldosterone/cortisol and the MR/GR antagonists spironolactone/RU486. Patients with diabetic kidney disease excreted more tetrahydroaldosterone than the control group reaching significance in men. The excretion of MR-agonistic steroid hormones was only increased for 18-hydroxytetrahydrocorticosterone in diabetic women. The excretion of most glucocorticoids was higher in the diabetic cohort. Higher apparent systemic HSD11B2 activity suggested less activation of the MR by cortisol in diabetic patients. Both cell types, HRMC and HRGEC, lacked expression of HSD11B2. Hyperglycemic conditions did not change MR and GR expression and activity. Stimulation with both aldosterone and cortisol promoted upregulation of pro-fibrotic genes in HRMC. This effect of MR and/or GR activation was more pronounced in high glucose conditions and partially inhibited by MRAs and GR antagonists. In patients with diabetic kidney disease alternative MR activation is conceivable as cortisol and cortisone metabolites are increased. Systemic availability of active metabolites is counteracted via an increased HSD11B2 activity. As this cortisol deactivation is absent in HRMC and HRGEC, cortisol binding to the MR is enabled. Both, cortisol and aldosterone stimulation led to an increased expression of pro-fibrotic genes in HRMC. This mechanism was related to the MR as well as the GR and more marked in high glucose conditions linking the benefit of MRAs in diabetic kidney disease to these findings. "
1131,33547205,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with insulin resistance and has been described as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Whether OSA adversely impacts pancreatic islet β-cell function remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the association of OSA and short sleep duration with β-cell function in overweight/obese adults with prediabetes or recently diagnosed, treatment-naive type 2 diabetes. Two hundred twenty-one adults (57.5% men, age 54.5 ± 8.7 years, BMI 35.1 ± 5.5 kg/m Mean ± SD objective sleep duration by actigraphy was 6.6 ± 1.0 h/night. OSA, defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of five or more events per hour, was present in 89% of the participants (20% mild, 28% moderate, 41% severe). Higher AHI was associated with higher HbA In this baseline cross-sectional analysis of the RISE clinical trial of adults with prediabetes or recently diagnosed, untreated type 2 diabetes, the prevalence of OSA was high. Although some measures of OSA severity were associated with HbA "
1132,32134933,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in women worldwide. The cardiovascular risk profile deteriorates after women enter menopause. By definition, women diagnosed with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) experience menopause before 40 years of age, which may render these women even more susceptible to develop CVD later in life. However, prospective long-term follow up data of well phenotyped women with POI are scarce. In the current study we compare the CVD profile and risk of middle aged women previously diagnosed with POI, to a population based reference group matched for age and BMI. We compared 123 women (age 49.0 (± 4.3) years) and diagnosed with POI 8.1 (IQR: 6.8-9.6) years earlier, with 123 population controls (age 49.4 (± 3.9) years). All women underwent an extensive standardized cardiovascular screening. We assessed CVD risk factors including waist circumference, BMI, blood pressure, lipid profile, pulse wave velocity (PWV), and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome (MetS) and carotid intima media thickness (cIMT), in both women with POI and controls. We calculated the 10-year CVD Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and the American Heart Association's suggested cardiovascular health score (CHS). Waist circumference (90.0 (IQR: 83.0-98.0) versus 80.7 (IQR: 75.1-86.8), p < 0.01), waist-to-hip ratio (0.90 (IQR: 0.85-0.93) versus 0.79 (IQR: 0.75-0.83), p < 0.01), systolic blood pressure (124 (IQR 112-135) versus 120 (IQR109-131), p < 0.04) and diastolic blood pressure (81 (IQR: 76-89) versus 78 (IQR: 71-86), p < 0.01), prevalence of hypertension (45 (37%) versus 21 (17%), p < 0.01) and MetS (19 (16%) versus 4 (3%), p < 0.01) were all significantly increased in women with POI compared to healthy controls. Other risk factors, however, such as lipids, glucose levels and prevalence of diabetes were similar comparing women with POI versus controls. The arterial stiffness assessed by PWV was also similar in both populations (8.1 (IQR: 7.1-9.4) versus 7.9 (IQR: 7.1-8.4), p = 0.21). In addition, cIMT was lower in women with POI compared to controls (550 μm (500-615) versus 684 μm (618-737), p < 0.01). The calculated 10-year CVD risk was 5.9% (IQR: 3.7-10.6) versus 6.0% (IQR: 3.9-9.0) (p = 0.31) and current CHS was 6.1 (1.9) versus 6.5 (1.6) (p = 0.07), respectively in POI versus controls. Middle age women with POI presented with more unfavorable cardiovascular risk factors (increased waist circumference and a higher prevalence of hypertension and MetS) compared to age and BMI matched population controls. In contrast, the current study reveals a lower cIMT and similar 10-year cardiovascular disease risk and cardiovascular health score. In summary, neither signs of premature atherosclerosis nor a worse cardiovascular disease risk or health score were observed among middle age women with POI compared to population controls. Longer-term follow-up studies of women of more advanced age are warranted to establish whether women with POI are truly at increased risk of developing CVD events later in life.

There are many different safe therapies used for diabetes and also number of natural supplements that can be used to manage diabetes. We assessed the effect of oral propolis supplementation on blood glucose, insulin resistance and antioxidant status in type 2 diabetes. We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial for 8-week. Sixty two patients with type 2 diabetes (30-55 years of age) were randomly assigned in two group, propolis (n = 31) and placebo (n = 31). Patients were given doses of 500 mg, three times a day (1500 mg), of propolis or placebo three time a day.

1135,32794058,"Exertional-heat stress adversely disrupts gastrointestinal (GI) barrier integrity, whereby subsequent microbial translocation (MT) can result in potentially serious health consequences. To date, the influence of aerobic fitness on GI barrier integrity and MT following exertional-heat stress is poorly characterised. Ten untrained (UT; VO UT experienced greater thermoregulatory, cardiovascular and perceptual strain (p < 0.05) than HT during the EHST. Serum DSAT responses were similar between the two groups (p = 0.59), although Δ I-FABP was greater (p = 0.04) in the UT (1.14 ± 1.36 ng·ml When exercising at the same absolute workload, UT individuals are more susceptible to small intestinal epithelial injury and MT than HT individuals. These responses appear partially attributable to greater thermoregulatory, cardiovascular, and perceptual strain. "
1136,26002813,"The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of organic iodine (3,5-diiodotyrosine, DIT) and inorganic iodine (potassium iodine, KI) on thyroid function and oxidative stress in iodine-excess Wistar rats. Seventy-two Wistar rats were randomly divided into eight groups: normal control (NC), thyroid tablet-induced hyperthyroidism model (HM), low DIT (L-DIT), medium DIT (M-DIT), high DIT (H-DIT), low KI (L-KI), medium KI (M-KI), and high KI (H-KI). All rats were fed ad libitum for 30 days. Morphological changes in the thyroid, absolute and relative weights of the thyroid, thyroid function markers free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4), urinary iodine level, and oxidative stress indicators were measured. Compared to the HM groups, the FT3 and FT4 levels decreased in the L-DIT groups; the thyroid weight and thyroid weight/body weight values decreased markedly in the L-DIT and M-DIT groups; serum superoxide dismutase/malondialdehyde increased markedly; glutathione peroxidase activity increased markedly in the L-DIT groups; and malondialdehyde levels decreased significantly in the M-DIT groups. However, the FT3 and FT4 levels decreased and glutathione peroxidase levels increased significantly in the DIT groups compared to their corresponding KI groups. Additionally, urinary iodine levels increased significantly in both DIT and KI groups, while the highest urinary iodine excretion was showed in the DIT groups among groups. When the addition of iodine with the same doses in iodine-excess rats, although neither DIT nor KI normalized iodine levels in the iodine-excess rats, the DIT did less damage than did KI to thyroid follicular cells. Therefore, DIT rather than KI had a protective effect by balancing the antioxidant system when exposed to supraphysiological iodine. These suggest that DIT may be used as a new alternative iodized salt in the universal salt iodization to avoid the potential damage of surplus KI. "
1137,24771405,"LYR motif-containing 1 (LYRM1) was recently discovered to be involved in adipose tissue homeostasis and obesity-associated insulin resistance. We previously demonstrated that LYRM1 overexpression might contribute to insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, knockdown of LYRM1 enhanced insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial function in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We investigated whether knockdown of LYRM1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes could rescue insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by the cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-hydrazone (FCCP), a mitochondrion uncoupler, to further ascertain the mechanism by which LYRM1 is involved in obesity-associated insulin resistance. Incubation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with 1 µM FCCP for 12 h decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, reduced intracellular ATP synthesis, increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, impaired insulin-stimulated Glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation, and diminished insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and serine phosphorylation of Protein Kinase B (Akt). Knockdown of LYRM1 restored insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, rescued intracellular ATP synthesis, reduced intracellular ROS production, restored insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, and rescued insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and serine phosphorylation of Akt in FCCP-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. This study indicates that FCCP-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance are ameliorated by knockdown of LYRM1. "
1138,38438106,"Interleukin (IL)-6 has anti- and pro-inflammatory functions, controlled by IL-6 classic and trans-signaling, respectively. Differences in the downstream signaling mechanism between IL-6 classic and trans-signaling have not been identified. Here, we report that IL-6 activates glycolysis to regulate the inflammatory response. IL-6 regulates glucose metabolism by forming a complex containing signal-transducing activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), hexokinase 2 (HK2), and voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1). The IL-6 classic signaling directs glucose flux to oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), while IL-6 trans-signaling directs glucose flux to anaerobic glycolysis. Classic IL-6 signaling promotes STAT3 translocation into mitochondria to interact with pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK1), leading to pyruvate dehydrogenase α (PDHA) dissociation from PDK1. As a result, PDHA is dephosphorylated, and STAT3 is phosphorylated at Ser727. By contrast, IL-6 trans-signaling promotes the interaction of sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), leading to the dissociation of STAT3 from SIRT2. As a result, LDHA is deacetylated, and STAT3 is acetylated and phosphorylated at Tyr705. IL-6 classic signaling promotes the differentiation of regulatory T cells via the PDK1/STAT3/PDHA axis, whereas IL-6 trans-signaling promotes the differentiation of Th17 cells via the SIRT2/STAT3/LDHA axis. Conclusion: IL-6 classic signaling generates anti-inflammatory functions by shifting energy metabolism to OxPhos, while IL-6 trans-signaling generates pro-inflammatory functions by shifting energy metabolism to anaerobic glycolysis.

1141,37364105,"The molecular events governing skeletal muscle glucose uptake have pharmacological potential for managing insulin resistance in conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and cancer. With no current pharmacological treatments to target skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity, there is an unmet need to identify the molecular mechanisms that control insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. Here, the Rho guanine dissociation inhibitor α (RhoGDIα) is identified as a point of control in the regulation of insulin sensitivity. In skeletal muscle cells, RhoGDIα interacted with, and thereby inhibited, the Rho GTPase Rac1. In response to insulin, RhoGDIα was phosphorylated at S101 and Rac1 dissociated from RhoGDIα to facilitate skeletal muscle GLUT4 translocation. Accordingly, siRNA-mediated RhoGDIα depletion increased Rac1 activity and elevated GLUT4 translocation. Consistent with RhoGDIα's inhibitory effect, rAAV-mediated RhoGDIα overexpression in mouse muscle decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and was detrimental to whole-body glucose tolerance. Aligning with RhoGDIα's negative role in insulin sensitivity, RhoGDIα protein content was elevated in skeletal muscle from insulin-resistant patients with type 2 diabetes. These data identify RhoGDIα as a clinically relevant controller of skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity and whole-body glucose homeostasis, mechanistically by modulating Rac1 activity. "
1142,35220425,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with increased risk of pregnancy complications and adverse perinatal outcomes. GDM often reoccurs and is associated with increased risk of subsequent diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). To improve our understanding of the aetiological factors and molecular processes driving the occurrence of GDM, including the extent to which these overlap with T2D pathophysiology, the GENetics of Diabetes In Pregnancy Consortium assembled genome-wide association studies of diverse ancestry in a total of 5485 women with GDM and 347 856 without GDM. Through multi-ancestry meta-analysis, we identified five loci with genome-wide significant association (P < 5 × 10-8) with GDM, mapping to/near MTNR1B (P = 4.3 × 10-54), TCF7L2 (P = 4.0 × 10-16), CDKAL1 (P = 1.6 × 10-14), CDKN2A-CDKN2B (P = 4.1 × 10-9) and HKDC1 (P = 2.9 × 10-8). Multiple lines of evidence pointed to the shared pathophysiology of GDM and T2D: (i) four of the five GDM loci (not HKDC1) have been previously reported at genome-wide significance for T2D; (ii) significant enrichment for associations with GDM at previously reported T2D loci; (iii) strong genetic correlation between GDM and T2D and (iv) enrichment of GDM associations mapping to genomic annotations in diabetes-relevant tissues and transcription factor binding sites. Mendelian randomization analyses demonstrated significant causal association (5% false discovery rate) of higher body mass index on increased GDM risk. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that GDM and T2D are part of the same underlying pathology but that, as exemplified by the HKDC1 locus, there are genetic determinants of GDM that are specific to glucose regulation in pregnancy.

1144,26200703,"Hyperglycemia is a common metabolic problem in extremely low-birth-weight preterm infants. Neonatal hyperglycemia is associated with increased mortality and brain injury. Glucose-mediated oxidative injury may be responsible. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is a nuclear enzyme involved in DNA repair and cell survival. However, PARP-1 overactivation leads to cell death. NF-κB is coactivated with PARP-1 and regulates microglial activation. The effects of recurrent hyperglycemia on PARP-1/NF-κB expression and microglial activation are not well understood. Rat pups were subjected to recurrent hypoinsulinemic hyperglycemia of 2 h duration twice daily from postnatal (P) day 3-P12 and killed on P13. mRNA and protein expression of PARP-1/NF-κB and their downstream effectors were determined in the cerebral cortex. Microgliosis was determined using CD11 immunohistochemistry. Recurrent hyperglycemia increased PARP-1 expression confined to the nucleus and without causing PARP-1 overactivation and cell death. NF-κB mRNA expression was increased, while IκB mRNA expression was decreased. inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) mRNA expressions were decreased. Hyperglycemia significantly increased the number of microglia. Recurrent hyperglycemia in neonatal rats is associated with upregulation of PARP-1 and NF-κB expression and subsequent microgliosis but not neuronal cell death in the cerebral cortex. "
1145,31797544,"Pandemic vitamin D deficiency is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Vitamin D supplementation has been reported to have improved glucose homeostasis. However, its mechanism to improve insulin sensitivity remains unclear. Male C57BL/6J mice are fed with/without vitamin D control (CD) or Western (WD) diets for 15 weeks. The vitamin-D-deficient lean (CDVDD) and obese (WDVDD) mice are further subdivided into two groups. One group is re-supplemented with vitamin D for 6 weeks and hepatic insulin signaling is examined. Both CD and WD mice with vitamin D deficiency developed insulin resistance. Vitamin D supplementation in CDVDD mice significantly improved insulin sensitivity, hepatic inflammation, and antioxidative capacity. The hepatic insulin signals like pAKT, pFOXO1, and pGSK3β are increased and the downstream Pepck, G6pase, and Pgc1α are reduced. Furthermore, the lipogenic genes Srebp1c, Acc, and Fasn are decreased, indicating that hepatic lipid accumulation is inhibited. The results demonstrate that vitamin D deficiency induces insulin resistance. Its supplementation has significant beneficial effects on pathophysiological mechanisms in type 2 diabetes but only in lean and not in the obese phenotype. The increased subacute inflammation and insulin resistance in obesity cannot be significantly alleviated by vitamin D supplementation. This needs to be taken into consideration in the design of new clinical trials. "
1146,36264350,"Recent studies have indicated that Sodium-GLucose co-Transporter 2 Inhibitors (SGLT2Is) may increase insulin sensitivity (IS); however, these results are heterogeneous and need to be systematically assessed. We searched MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Ovid, and ProQuest using a predefined search query. Randomized clinical trials on SGLT2Is with a passive control group or metformin controlled group were included. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Meta-analysis was performed separately on studies with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) population and studies with non-T2DM population and also for passive- and active-controlled studies using standardized mean difference (SMD) as the measure of the effect size. Subgroup analysis was performed according to different types of SGLT2Is. Meta-regression analysis was performed according to the dose and duration of intervention. Twenty-two studies (6 on non-T2DM population) with a total of 1421 (243 non-T2DM) patients were included. Six studies (3 on T2DM and 3 on non-T2DM) were controlled by metformin, and others were passively controlled. SGLT2Is could significantly increase IS in T2DM patients (SMD = 0.72 [0.32-1.12]). SGLT2Is could reduce insulin resistance in non-T2DM population, but this was not significant. SGLT2Is were not inferior to metformin in reducing insulin resistance. Subgroup analysis indicated that dapagliflozin could significantly increase IS, but empagliflozin was not associated with significant improvement in IS. Meta-regression analysis indicated no effect for dose but duration of SGLT2I administration on IS. SGLT2Is, particularly dapagliflozin, could increase IS. These results need to be consolidated by further studies. "
1147,19181572,"To evaluate Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs) and psychomotor development of infants of diabetic mothers (IDMs) in relation to clinical and metabolic data during pregnancy and delivery. VEPs and psychomotor development (Brunet-Lézine) were analysed in 40 two-month-old IDMs (21 males, 19 females), 24 from mothers with type-1 diabetes, 13 gestational diabetes, and 3 type-2 diabetes. Normative VEP data were obtained from 63 age matched controls. VEP latencies were significantly longer in IDMs than in controls (O1 wave IV=197.9+/-35.5 vs 155.3+/-30.3; P<0.001; O2 wave IV=200.2+/-33.8 vs 155.6+/-29.0; P<0.001).

In IDMs with type-1 diabetes delayed VEPs were related to increased weight during pregnancy (r 0.516; P 0.009), 1st trimester fasting blood glucose (r 0.458; P 0.037), insulin requirement during the 2nd (r 0.441; P 0.035) and 3rd trimester (r 0.422; P 0.039); in IDMs with gestational diabetes, VEP latency showed negative relation to Apgar scores (r -0.748; P 0.008). IDMs have delayed VEPs, which may possibly be related to poor metabolic control in pre-gestational diabetes, and to delivery complications in gestational diabetes. IDMs show subtle neurophysiologic changes detectable by VEPs. "
1148,25100541,"Burn trauma to the extremities can produce marked systemic effects in mice. Burn injury to the dorsal surface of mice is also associated with changes in glucose metabolism ([18F] 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose [18FDG] uptake) by brown adipose tissue (BAT) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB activity in several tissues including skeletal muscle. This study examined the effect of a single hind limb burn in mice on 18FDG uptake by NF-κB activity in vivo, and blood flow was determined by laser Doppler techniques. Male NF-κB luciferase reporter mice (28-30 g) were anesthetized, both legs were shaven, and the right leg was subjected to scald injury by immersion in 90°C water for 5 seconds. Sham-treated animals were used as controls. Each burned and sham mouse was resuscitated with saline (2 mL, i.p.). The individual animals were placed in wire bottom cages with no food and free access to water. After 24 hours, the animals were imaged with laser Doppler for measuring blood flow in the hind limb. The animals were then unanesthetized with 50 μCi of FDG or luciferin (1.0 mg, i.v.) via tail vein. Five minutes after luciferin injection, NF-κB mice were studied by bioluminescence imaging with a charge-coupled device camera. One hour after 18FDG injection, the animals were killed with carbon dioxide overdose, and 18FDG biodistribution was measured. Tissues were also analyzed for NF-κB luciferase activity. The scalding procedure used here produced a full-thickness burn injury to the leg with sharp margins. 18FDG uptake by the burned leg was lower than that in the contralateral limb. Similarly, luciferase activity and blood flow in the burned leg were lower than those in the contralateral leg. 18FDG uptake by BAT and heart increased, whereas that by brain decreased. In conclusion, the present study suggests that burn injury to a single leg decreased FDG uptake by skeletal muscle but increased 18FDG uptake by BAT. The injury to the leg reduced NF-κB expression compared with the contralateral leg and the uninjured skeletal muscle of the sham but activated NF-κB expression in a number of other organs. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that burn trauma to the extremities can produce marked systemic effects, including activation of NF-κB expression and activation of 18FDG uptake by BAT.

1149,36126044,"The capacity of the intestinal microbiota to degrade otherwise indigestible diet components is known to greatly improve the recovery of energy from food. This has led to the hypothesis that increased digestive efficiency may underlie the contribution of the microbiota to obesity. OligoMM12-colonized gnotobiotic mice have a consistently higher fat mass than germ-free (GF) or fully colonized counterparts. We therefore investigated their food intake, digestion efficiency, energy expenditure, and respiratory quotient using a novel isolator-housed metabolic cage system, which allows long-term measurements without contamination risk. This demonstrated that microbiota-released calories are perfectly balanced by decreased food intake in fully colonized versus gnotobiotic OligoMM12 and GF mice fed a standard chow diet, i.e., microbiota-released calories can in fact be well integrated into appetite control. We also observed no significant difference in energy expenditure after normalization by lean mass between the different microbiota groups, suggesting that cumulative small differences in energy balance, or altered energy storage, must underlie fat accumulation in OligoMM12 mice. Consistent with altered energy storage, major differences were observed in the type of respiratory substrates used in metabolism over the circadian cycle: In GF mice, the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was consistently lower than that of fully colonized mice at all times of day, indicative of more reliance on fat and less on glucose metabolism. Intriguingly, the RER of OligoMM12-colonized gnotobiotic mice phenocopied fully colonized mice during the dark (active/eating) phase but phenocopied GF mice during the light (fasting/resting) phase. Further, OligoMM12-colonized mice showed a GF-like drop in liver glycogen storage during the light phase and both liver and plasma metabolomes of OligoMM12 mice clustered closely with GF mice. This implies the existence of microbiota functions that are required to maintain normal host metabolism during the resting/fasting phase of circadian cycle and which are absent in the OligoMM12 consortium.

1150,35870144,"Gestational diabetes (GDM) presents an increased cardio-metabolic risk and is diagnosed with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Reactive hypoglycaemia (RH) during the OGTT in pregnancy is associated with adverse outcomes. Although postpartum OGTT after GDM is recommended, the occurrence and implications of RH are unknown. We investigated the prevalence, metabolic implications and longitudinal evolution of RH at 6-8 weeks postpartum in women with a history of GDM. Between 2011 and 2021, we consecutively followed 1237 women with previous GDM undergoing an OGTT at 6-8 weeks postpartum. RH was defined as 2-h glucose <3.9 mmoL/L after the OGTT. Metabolic outcomes were compared in women with and without RH (RH+/RH-). We also included a subcohort of 191 women with data on insulin sensitivity/secretion indices (MATSUDA, HOMA-IR, insulin-adjusted-secretion ISSI-2). The postpartum prevalence of RH was 12%. RH+ women had a more favourable metabolic profile including a 2-5-times lower prevalence of glucose intolerance and metabolic syndrome at 6-8 weeks postpartum compared to RH- (all p ≤ 0.034). In the subcohort, women with RH+ had higher insulin sensitivity, higher ISSI-2 and an earlier glucose peak after OGTT (p ≤ 0.049) compared to RH- women at the same time point. Insulin resistance increased and ISSI-2 decreased over the first year postpartum in both groups. These changes were associated with a 50% reduction in overall RH prevalence at 1-year postpartum. Some of the favourable profiles of RH+ persisted at 1-year postpartum, without group differences in the longitudinal metabolic changes. At 6-8 weeks postpartum, RH was frequent in women after GDM and associated with a better metabolic profile including increased insulin sensitivity and higher insulin-adjusted-secretory capacity. RH might be a marker of favourable metabolic prognosis in women with a history of GDM. "
1151,23274913,"NYGGF4, also known as phosphotyrosine interaction domain containing 1(PID1), is a recently discovered gene which is involved in obesity-related insulin resistance (IR) and mitochondrial dysfunction. We aimed to further elucidate the effects and mechanisms underlying NYGGF4-induced IR by investigating the effect of overexpressing mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), which is essential for mitochondrial DNA transcription and replication, on NYGGF4-induced IR and mitochondrial abnormalities in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Overexpression of TFAM increased the mitochondrial copy number and ATP content in both control 3T3-L1 adipocytes and NYGGF4-overexpressing adipocytes. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was enhanced in NYGGF4-overexpressing adipocytes and reduced in TFAM-overexpressing adipocytes; co-overexpression of TFAM significantly attenuated ROS production in NYGGF4-overexpressing adipocytes. However, overexpression of TFAM did not affect the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) in control 3T3-L1 adipocytes or NYGGF4-overexpressing adipocytes. In addition, co-overexpression of TFAM-enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by increasing Glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation to the PM in NYGGF4-overexpressing adipocytes. Overexpression of NYGGF4 significantly inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and serine phosphorylation of Akt, whereas overexpression of TFAM strongly induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Akt in NYGGF4-overexpressing adipocytes. This study demonstrates that NYGGF4 plays a role in IR by impairing mitochondrial function, and that overexpression of TFAM can restore mitochondrial function to normal levels in NYGGF4-overexpressing adipocytes via activation of the IRS-1/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

1152,36965679,"Although previous studies have reported an association between maternal serum perfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) exposure and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk, results have been inconsistent. Few studies have focused on the combined effects of emerging and legacy PFASs on glucose homeostasis while humans are always exposed to multiple PFASs simultaneously. Moreover, the potential pathways by which PFAS exposure induces GDM are unclear. A total of 295 GDM cases and 295 controls were enrolled from a prospective cohort of 2700 pregnant women in Shanghai, China. In total, 16 PFASs were determined in maternal spot serum samples in early pregnancy. We used conditional logistic regression, multiple linear regression, and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) to examine individual and joint effects of PFAS exposure on GDM risk and oral glucose tolerance test outcomes. The mediating effects of maternal serum biochemical parameters, including thyroid and liver function were further assessed. Maternal perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure was associated with an increased risk of GDM (odds ratio (OR) = 1.68; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.10, 2.57), consistent with higher concentrations in GDM cases than controls. Based on mediation analysis, an increase in the free triiodothyronine to free thyroxine ratio partially explained the effect of this association. For continuous glycemic outcomes, positive associations were observed between several PFASs and 1-h and 2-h glucose levels. In BKMR, PFAS mixture exposure showed a positive trend with GDM incidence, although the CIs were wide. These associations were more pronounced among women with normal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI). Mixed PFAS congeners may affect glucose homeostasis by increasing 1-h glucose levels, with perfluorononanoic acid found to be a main contributor. Exposure to PFASs was associated with increased risk of GDM and disturbance in glucose homeostasis, especially in normal weight women. The PFAS-associated disruption of maternal thyroid function may alter glucose homeostasis. "

1155,38142481,"Hyperglycemia is associated with lipid disorders in patients with diabetes. Ceramides are metabolites involved in sphingolipid metabolism that accumulate during lipid disorders and exert deleterious effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. However, the effects of ceramide on glucagon-mediated hepatic gluconeogenesis remain largely unknown. This study was designed to investigate the impact of ceramides on gluconeogenesis in the context of the hepatic glucagon response, with the aim of finding new pharmacological interventions for hyperglycemia in diabetes. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to quantify ceramide content in the serum of patients with diabetes. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from male C57BL/6J mice to study the effects of ceramide on hepatic glucose production. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to view cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)- regulated transcription co-activator 2 (CRTC2) nuclear translocation in hepatocytes. Serine palmitoyl-transferase, long chain base subunit 2 (Sptlc2) knockdown mice were generated using an adeno-associated virus containing shRNA, and hepatic glucose production was assessed glucagon tolerance and pyruvate tolerance tests in mice fed a normal chow diet and high-fat diet. Increased ceramide levels were observed in the serum of patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. De novo ceramide synthesis was activated in mice with metabolic disorders. Ceramide enhanced hepatic glucose production in primary hepatocytes. In contrast, genetic silencing of Sptlc2 prevented this process. Mechanistically, ceramides de-phosphorylate CRTC2 (Ser 171) and facilitate its translocation into the nucleus for CREB activation, thereby augmenting the hepatic glucagon response. Hepatic Sptlc2 silencing blocked ceramide generation in the liver and thus restrained the hepatic glucagon response in mice fed a normal chow diet and high-fat diet. These data indicate that ceramide serves as an intracellular messenger that augments hepatic glucose production by regulating CRTC2/CREB activity in the context of the hepatic glucagon response, suggesting that CRTC2 phosphorylation might be a potential node for pharmacological interventions to restrain the hyperglycemic response during fasting in diabetes.

The aim was to evaluate if testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) improves metabolic health in this subgroup of TC survivors. This was a single-center, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. The main eligibility criterion was LH above the age-adjusted upper limit of normal in combination with free testosterone in the lower half of the age-adjusted normal range (mild Leydig cell insufficiency) >1 year after TC treatment. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to 12 months transdermal TRT (Tostran, gel, 2%) or placebo with a maximum daily dose of 40 mg. The primary outcome was difference in Δ2 hour glucose measured with oral glucose tolerance test between groups assessed at 12 months. Outcomes were assessed after 6-, 12- and 3 months post-treatment. The study was registered at www. gov (NCT02991209) and ended June 2019. Between October 2016 and February 2018, 140 patients were screened for eligibility and 69 were randomized to testosterone (n = 35, 51%) or placebo (n = 34, 49%). TRT was not associated with a statistically significant difference in Δ2 hour glucose compared to placebo after 12 months of treatment (0.04 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.53, 0.60)). There was no statistically significant difference in Δ2 hour insulin between the groups after 12 months of treatment (28.23 pmol/L (95% CI: -34.40, 90.86)). Similarly, TRT was not associated with significant improvement in components of metabolic syndrome. TRT was associated with a decrease in fat mass after 12 months compared to placebo (-1.35 kg, (95% CI: -2.53, -0.18)). In TC survivors with mild Leydig cell insufficiency, TRT was not associated with improvement of metabolic health. These findings do no not support routine use of TRT in these patients. "

However, there is limited evidence on how Canadian FOPL (CAN-FOPL) regulations compare to other FOPL systems and dietary guidelines.

1160,30637773,"Hepatocellular adenoma/carcinoma (HCA/HCC) is a long-term complication of glycogen storage disease type-Ia (GSD-Ia), which is caused by a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphatase-α (G6Pase-α or G6PC), a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis. Currently, there is no therapy to address HCA/HCC in GSD-Ia. We have previously shown that a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector-mediated G6PC gene transfer to 2-week-old G6pc-/- mice prevents HCA development. However, it remains unclear whether G6PC gene transfer at the tumor developing stage of GSD-Ia can prevent tumor initiation or abrogate the pre-existing tumors. Using liver-specific G6pc-knockout (L-G6pc-/-) mice that develop HCA/HCC, we now show that treating the mice at the tumor-developing stage with rAAV-G6PC restores hepatic G6Pase-α expression, normalizes glucose homeostasis, and prevents de novo HCA/HCC development. The rAAV-G6PC treatment also normalizes defective hepatic autophagy and corrects metabolic abnormalities in the nontumor liver tissues of both tumor-free and tumor-bearing mice. However, gene therapy cannot restore G6Pase-α expression in the HCA/HCC lesions and fails to abrogate any pre-existing tumors. We show that the expression of 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-1 that mediates local glucocorticoid activation is downregulated in HCA/HCC lesions, leading to impairment in glucocorticoid signaling critical for gluconeogenesis activation. This suggests that local glucocorticoid action downregulation in the HCA/HCC lesions may suppress gene therapy mediated G6Pase-α restoration. Collectively, our data show that rAAV-mediated gene therapy can prevent de novo HCA/HCC development in L-G6pc-/- mice at the tumor developing stage, but it cannot reduce any pre-existing tumor burden.

Patients with frequent hypoglycaemia were recruited from hospital-based diabetes clinics. The treatment for each hypoglycaemic episode, defined as capillary glucose <4.0 mmol/l, was randomly assigned to one of three protocols: 0.2 g/kg, 0.3 g/kg, or 15 g, using Dextro(TM) glucose tablets (Dextro Energy, Krefeld, Germany). Each participant received each treatment in random order for up to 15 hypoglycaemic episodes. Capillary glucose was re-tested 10 min after treatment, with a repeat dose if still < 4 mmol/l. The study recruited 34 participants aged 22-71 years, whose mean (sd) BMI was 25.2 (3.1) kg/m(2) and HbA1c 63 (10.4) mmol/mol [7.9 (0.9)%]. Two people withdrew because they did not like the taste of the Dextro tablets and one was excluded because they used their own glucose preparation. Unadjusted for clustering within participants, the mean (sd) capillary glucose after 10 min was 4.67 (1.25) mmol/l for 0.3 g/kg (141 episodes), 4.29 (0.94) mmol/l for 0.2 g/kg (132 episodes), and 4.37(0.99) mmol/l for 15 g (136 episodes). Capillary glucose, adjusted for clusters and baseline, was higher after 10 min for 0.3 g/kg glucose compared with 15 g glucose; a difference of 0.26 (95% CI 0.04-0.48) mmol/l (P = 0.02), but not for 0.2 g/kg; -0.07 (95% CI -0.29-0.16) mmol/l (P = 0.56).

1163,32857135,"TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has attracted attention not only as an anti-cancer agent, but also as a potential treatment for diabetes. Animal studies have shown that TRAIL delivery ameliorated glucose control in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It is currently unknown whether TRAIL positive effects are maintained in more severe forms of type 2 diabetes, and whether they include renoprotection. Our study aimed at evaluating TRAIL effects in a severe form of type 2 diabetes with nephropathy. A total of 20 db/db mice were treated with saline or TRAIL twice per week for 12 weeks. In parallel, renal tubular epithelial cells were cultured with TGF-β1 in the presence and absence of TRAIL, with and without silencing TRAIL-specific receptor (DR5) and leptin receptor. TRAIL did not improve glucose control, but it significantly reduced circulating interleukin (IL)-6 and resistin. In the kidney, TRAIL treatment significantly ameliorated glomerular and tubular morphology with an improvement in kidney function, but no effect on proteinuria. Our in vitro studies on TGF-β1-treated cells, showed that by binding to DR5, TRAIL rescued normal tubular cell morphology, increasing E-cadherin and reducing α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) expression, with no effects on cell viability. Interestingly, both in vivo and in vitro, TRAIL reduced the accumulation of the autophagy substrate p62. Our data confirm TRAIL protective effects against organ damage and shed light on to promising anti-fibrotic actions, which are independent of glucose control. TRAIL anti-fibrotic actions might be due to the rescue of autophagy in diabetes. "
1164,32364497,"Most glucose is processed in muscle, for energy or glycogen stores. Malignant Hyperthermia Susceptibility (MHS) exemplifies muscle conditions that increase [Ca Animals and humans move by contracting the skeletal muscles attached to their bones. These muscles take up a type of sugar called glucose from food and use it to fuel contractions or store it for later in the form of glycogen. If muscles fail to use glucose it can lead to excessive sugar levels in the blood and a condition called diabetes. Within muscle cells are stores of calcium that signal the muscle to contract. Changes in calcium levels enhance the uptake of glucose that fuel these contractions. However, variations in calcium have also been linked to diabetes, and it remained unclear when and how these ‘signals’ become harmful. People with a condition called malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS for short) have genetic mutations that allow calcium to leak out from these stores. This condition may result in excessive contractions causing the muscle to over-heat, become rigid and break down, which can lead to death if left untreated. A clinical study in 2019 found that out of hundreds of patients who had MHS, nearly half had high blood sugar and were likely to develop diabetes. Now, Tammineni et al. – including some of the researchers involved in the 2019 study – have set out to find why calcium leaks lead to elevated blood sugar levels. The experiments showed that enzymes that help convert glycogen to glucose are more active in patients with MHS, and found in different locations inside muscle cells. Whereas the enzymes that change glucose into glycogen are less active. This slows down the conversion of glucose into glycogen for storage and speeds up the breakdown of glycogen into glucose. Patients with MHS also had fewer molecules that transport glucose into muscle cells and stored less glycogen. These changes imply that less glucose is being removed from the blood. Next, Tammineni et al. used a microscopy technique that is able to distinguish finely separated objects with a precision not reached before in living muscle. This revealed that when the activity of the enzyme that breaks down glycogen increased, it moved next to the calcium store. This effect was also observed in the muscle cells of MHS patients that leaked calcium from their stores. Taken together, these observations may explain why patients with MHS have high levels of sugar in their blood. These findings suggest that MHS may start decades before developing diabetes and blood sugar levels in these patients should be regularly monitored. Future studies should investigate whether drugs that block calcium from leaking may help prevent high blood sugar in patients with MHS or other conditions that cause a similar calcium leak. "

We discovered 120 RG loci represented by 150 distinct signals, including 13 with sex-dimorphic effects, two cross-ancestry and seven rare frequency signals. Of these, 44 loci are new for glycemic traits. Regulatory, glycosylation and metagenomic annotations highlight ileum and colon tissues, indicating an underappreciated role of the gastrointestinal tract in controlling blood glucose. Functional follow-up and molecular dynamics simulations of lower frequency coding variants in glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R), a type 2 diabetes treatment target, reveal that optimal selection of GLP-1R agonist therapy will benefit from tailored genetic stratification. We also provide evidence from Mendelian randomization that lung function is modulated by blood glucose and that pulmonary dysfunction is a diabetes complication. Our investigation yields new insights into the biology of glucose regulation, diabetes complications and pathways for treatment stratification. "

The aim of this study is to assess the availability, formulation, labeling, and price of low-sodium salts currently available to consumers worldwide. Low-sodium salts were identified through a systematic literature review, Google search, online shopping site searches, and inquiry of key informants. The keywords ""salt substitute,"" ""low-sodium salt,"" ""potassium salt,"" ""mineral salt,"" and ""sodium reduced salt"" in six official languages of the United Nations were used for the search.

The proportion of sodium chloride varied from 0% (sodium-free) to 88% (as percent of weight; regular salt is 100% sodium chloride). Potassium chloride was the most frequent component with levels ranging from 0% to 100% (potassium chloride salt). A total of 43 (49%) low-sodium salts had labels with the potential health risks, and 33 (38%) had labels with the potential health benefits. The median price of low-sodium salts in high-income, upper-middle-income, and lower-middle-income countries was US $15.00/kg (IQR 6.4-22.5), US $2.70/kg (IQR 1.7-5.5), and US $2.90/kg (IQR 0.50-22.2), respectively.

1167,31513598,"We aimed to investigate which clinical and metabolic tests offer optimal accuracy and acceptability to help diagnose diabetes among a large sample of people with serious mental illness in receipt of antipsychotic medication. A prospective observational study design of biochemical and clinical factors was used. Biochemical measures were fasting glucose, insulin and lipids, oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT), hemoglobin A1c, and insulin resistance assessed with the homeostatic model (HOMA-IR) were determined in a consecutive cohort of 798 adult psychiatric inpatients receiving antipsychotics. Clinical variables were gender, age, global assessment of functioning (GAF), mental health clinicians' global impression (CGI), duration of severe mental illness, height, weight, BMI and waist/hip ratio. In addition, we calculated the risk using combined clinical predictors using the Leicester Practice Risk Score (LPRS) and the Topics Diabetes Risk Score (TDRS). Diabetes was defined by older criteria (impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or OGTT) as well as2010 criteria (IFG or OGTT or Glycated haemoglobin (HBA1c)) at conventional cut-offs. Using the older criteria, 7.8% had diabetes (men: 6.3%; women: 10.3%). Using the new criteria, 10.2% had diabetes (men: 8.2%, women: 13.2%), representing a 30.7% increase (p = 0.02) in the prevalence of diabetes. Regarding biochemical predictors, conventional OGTT, IFG, and HbA1c thresholds used to identify newly defined diabetes missed 25%, 50% and 75% of people with diabetes, respectively. The conventional HBA1c cut-point of ≥6.5% (48 mmol/mol) missed 7 of 10 newly defined cases of diabetes while a cut-point of ≥5.7% improved sensitivity from 44.4% to up to 85%. Specific algorithm approaches offered reasonable accuracy. Unfortunately no single clinical factor was able to accurately rule-in a diagnosis of diabetes. Three clinical factors were able to rule-out diabetes with good accuracy namely: BMI, waist/hip ratio and height. A BMI < 30 had a 92% negative predictive value in ruling-out diabetes. Of those not diabetic, 20% had a BMI ≥ 30. However, for complete diagnosis a specific biochemical protocol is still necessary. Patients with SMI maintained on antipsychotic medication cannot be reliably screened for diabetes using clinical variables alone. Accurate assessment requires a two-step algorithm consisting of HBA1c ≥5.7% followed by both FG and OGTT which does not require all patients to have OGTT and FG. "

The purpose of this study was to utilize the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp to determine whether 1) HCR rats remain protected from OVX-induced IR when the time following OVX is extended to 27 wk and 2) tissue-specific glucose uptake differences are responsible for the protection in HCR rats under sedentary conditions. Female HCR and LCR rats (n = 40; aged ∼ 22 wk) randomly received either OVX or sham (SHM) surgeries and then underwent the clamp 27 wk following surgeries. [3-(3)H]glucose was used to determine glucose clearance, whereas 2-[(14)C]deoxyglucose (2-DG) was used to assess glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, brown adipose tissue (BAT), subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT), and visceral WAT. OVX decreased the glucose infusion rate and glucose clearance in both lines, but HCR had better insulin sensitivity than LCR (P < 0.05). In both lines, OVX significantly reduced glucose uptake in soleus and gastrocnemius muscles; however, HCR showed ∼ 40% greater gastrocnemius glucose uptake compared with LCR (P < 0.05). HCR also exhibited greater glucose uptake in BAT and visceral WAT compared with LCR (P < 0.05), yet these tissues were not affected by OVX in either line. In conclusion, OVX impairs insulin sensitivity in both HCR and LCR rats, likely driven by impairments in insulin-mediated skeletal muscle glucose uptake. HCR rats have greater skeletal muscle, BAT, and WAT insulin-mediated glucose uptake, which may aid in protection against OVX-associated insulin resistance. "

SGA newborns had lower glucose (SGA versus AGA, median [interquartile range]: 3.6 mmol/L [2.9-4.1 mmol/L] vs 3.9 mmol/L [3.6-4.6 mmol/L]) and insulin levels (31.3 pmol/L [20.8-47.9 pmol/L] vs 62.5 pmol/L [53.5-154.9]) than AGA infants, and they had higher glucose/insulin ratios (13.9 mg/dL/uIU/mL [8.6-19.1 mg/dL/uIU/mL] vs 8.2 mg/dL/uIU/mL [4.6-14.1 mg/dL/uIU/mL]). SGA infants also had higher levels of IGFBP-1 (5.1 nmol/L [4.4-6.7 nmol/L] vs 2.9 nmol/l [1.4-4.2 nmol/L]), free fatty acids (0.72 mEq/L [0.43-1.00 mEq/L] vs 0.33 mEq/L [0.26-0.54 mEq/L]) and beta-hydroxy butyrate (0.41 mEq/L [0.15-0.91 mEq/L] vs 0.09 mEq/L [0.05-0.13 mEq/L]). Sex-hormone binding globulin levels were not significantly different between the 2 groups. In early postnatal life, SGA infants display an increased insulin sensitivity with respect to glucose disposal but not with respect to suppression of lipolysis, ketogenesis, and hepatic production of IGFBP-1. It will be important to determine how these differential sensitivities to insulin vary with increasing age. "

Fifteen subjects with T2D (female, 5; male, 10; age, 65 ± 6.2 years [mean ± standard deviation]; body mass index, 27.3 ± 4.9 kg/m Compared with baseline, NW significantly improved the fasting glucose level (103.5 ± 18.5 vs 168.7 ± 37.7 mg/dL, P = .01), SBP (121.8 ± 12.2 vs 133 ± 14.4 mm Hg, P = .02), physical fitness (759.88 ± 69 vs 615.5 ± 62.6 m, P < .001), and both mental health (54.5 ± 4.4 vs 45.7 ± 5.6, P < .01) and physical health (49.8 ± 4.7 vs 40.3 ± 5.9, P < .01). The levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (6.15% ± 0.8% vs 6.4% ± 1%, P = .46), total cholesterol (162.2 ± 31.2 vs 175.5 ± 28.8 mg/dL, P = .13), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (95.2 ± 24.2 vs 106.3 ± 32.3 mg/dL, P = .43), and triglycerides (135.5 ± 60.8 vs 127.6 ± 57.4 mg/dL, P = 0.26) improved without reaching significance. NW training improved the glycemic levels, SBP, physical fitness, and perception of quality of life in older adults with T2D. NW represents a suitable complementary strategy to improve the global health status in this population. "
1171,21099302,"Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic and inflammatory disease characterized by deteriorating islet function and increased levels of inflammatory cytokines. The inflammatory milieu induced in type 2 diabetes exacerbates islet dysfunction and insulin resistance, and therapies that target inflammation can improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Inflammation in type 2 diabetes may be the result of the stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), one of the many mediators of inflammation. TLRs can be activated by both exogenous and endogenous ligands, and are responsible for activating NFκB and interferon- inducible inflammatory gene expression. We examined the role of the TIR-domain containing adaptor-inducing interferon-β (TRIF or TICAM-1), a major signaling molecule for TLR3 and TLR4, in b-cell function and glucose homeostasis by examining mice lacking TRIF (Trif⁻(/)⁻), TLR3 (Tlr3⁻(/)⁻) or TLR4 (Tlr4⁻(/)⁻). Male, 10-week old Trif⁻(/)⁻ mice exhibit a moderate but significant increase in fasting blood glucose compared to C57BL/6 controls (12.0 ± 0.9 vs. 9.7 ± 0.4 mM; p < 0.05) as well as impaired glucose tolerance revealed by IPGTT (AUC: 2850 ± 236 vs. 2050 ± 108; p < 0.005) whereas Tlr3⁻(/)⁻ and Tlr4⁻(/)⁻ mice have normal glucose tolerance. Interestingly, Trif⁻(/)⁻ mice have normal insulin sensitivity yet have increased plasma insulin levels (180 ± 22 vs. 89 ± 24 pM; p < 0.05). Islets isolated from Trif⁻(/)⁻ mice have impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, with a diminished first-phase insulin response to glucose. Immunohistological analysis revealed that age-matched Trif⁻(/)⁻ and control mice have normal islet morphology, although Trif⁻(/)⁻ mice have increased b-cell mass (3.5 ± 0.9 vs. 1.7 ± 0.2 mg; p < 0.05). In summary, mice lacking TRIF have hyperglycemia associated with b-cell dysfunction that may be partly compensated for by increased b-cell mass. These studies suggest a role for TLR signaling in glucose homeostasis, and raise the possibility that TRIF signaling is required for normal b-cell function. "
1172,30978357,"The mechanisms of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, liver disease progression, and hepatocarcinogenesis are only partially understood. We performed genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses of HCV-infected cells and chimeric mice to learn more about these processes. Huh7.5.1 We quantified 21,950 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and 8297 proteins in HCV-infected cells. Upon HCV infection of hepatocyte-like cells and chimeric mice, we observed significant changes in levels of mRNAs and proteins involved in metabolism and hepatocarcinogenesis. HCV infection of hepatocyte-like cells significantly increased levels of the mRNAs, but not proteins, that regulate the innate immune response; we believe this was due to the inhibition of translation in these cells. HCV infection of hepatocyte-like cells increased glucose consumption and metabolism and the STAT3 signaling pathway and reduced peroxisome function. Peroxisomes mediate β-oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids; we found intracellular accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids in HCV-infected cells, which is also observed in patients with fatty liver disease. Cells in livers from HCV-infected mice had significant reductions in levels of the mRNAs and proteins associated with peroxisome function, indicating perturbation of peroxisomes. We found that defects in peroxisome function were associated with outcomes and features of HCV-associated cirrhosis, fatty liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma in patients. We performed combined transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome analyses of liver tissues from HCV-infected hepatocyte-like cells and HCV-infected mice. We found that HCV infection increases glucose metabolism and the STAT3 signaling pathway and thereby reduces peroxisome function; alterations in the expression levels of peroxisome genes were associated with outcomes of patients with liver diseases. These findings provide insights into liver disease pathogenesis and might be used to identify new therapeutic targets. "

We included prospective cohort studies that assessed fructose consumption and incident gout or hyperuricemia. 2 independent reviewers extracted relevant data and assessed study quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We pooled natural-log transformed risk ratios (RRs) using the generic inverse variance method. Interstudy heterogeneity was assessed (Cochran Q statistic) and quantified (I 2 studies involving 125 299 participants and 1533 cases of incident gout assessed the association between fructose consumption and incident gout over an average of 17 years of follow-up. No eligible studies assessed incident hyperuricemia as an outcome.

1174,28848152,"This study aimed to screen microRNAs and their corresponding target genes that are associated with vascular injury in type two diabetes mellitus (T2DM), investigate the effects of differentially expressed miRNAs and their target genes on high glucose-induced vascular injury and establish the mechanism underlying these effects. A high-throughput digital gene expression (DGE) sequencing was performed to sequence microRNAs (miRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and determine their differential expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) incubated with serum samples from patients with T2DM and healthy volunteers. The HUVECs were transfected with si-TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor α) and a miR-149-5p inhibitor or mimic in vitro and then treated with normal or high glucose. The relative content of nitric oxide (NO) in the cells was detected using the Griess Reagent System. The mRNA and protein expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were determined by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. The content of endothelin-1 (ET-1), von Willebrand factor (vWF), and intercellular adhesion molecular-1 (ICAM-1) were detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry using the Annexin V/PI apoptosis detection kit. The mRNA and protein expression levels of ER stress (ERS) markers were determined by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Based on the high-energy sequencing and in vitro pre-experiment studies, we determined that miR-149-5p and TNF-α were a differentially expressed mRNA/miRNA pair in T2DM with vascular injury. The luciferase reporter assay results demonstrated that miR-149-5p could directly target TNF-α. The upregulation of miR-149-5p reduced the high glucose-induced dysfunction in the HUVECs by significantly decreasing the levels of ET-1, vWF, and ICAM-1 and increasing the level of NO and the expression of eNOS. Additionally, we found that miR-149-5p can improve cell injury and reduce apoptosis by restoring the ameliorated high glucose-induced expression of ERS markers. TNF-α and miR-149-5p were differentially expressed in T2DM vascular endothelial injury. The over-expression of miR-149-5p ameliorates the high glucose-induced injury in the HUVECs by regulating the expression of TNF-α and ERS markers. "

1176,35348391,"A composite metric for the quality of glycemia from continuous glucose monitor (CGM) tracings could be useful for assisting with basic clinical interpretation of CGM data. We assembled a data set of 14-day CGM tracings from 225 insulin-treated adults with diabetes. Using a balanced incomplete block design, 330 clinicians who were highly experienced with CGM analysis and interpretation ranked the CGM tracings from best to worst quality of glycemia. We used principal component analysis and multiple regressions to develop a model to predict the clinician ranking based on seven standard metrics in an Ambulatory Glucose Profile: very low-glucose and low-glucose hypoglycemia; very high-glucose and high-glucose hyperglycemia; time in range; mean glucose; and coefficient of variation. The analysis showed that clinician rankings depend on two components, one related to hypoglycemia that gives more weight to very low-glucose than to low-glucose and the other related to hyperglycemia that likewise gives greater weight to very high-glucose than to high-glucose. These two components should be calculated and displayed separately, but they can also be combined into a single Glycemia Risk Index (GRI) that corresponds closely to the clinician rankings of the overall quality of glycemia (r = 0.95). The GRI can be displayed graphically on a GRI Grid with the hypoglycemia component on the horizontal axis and the hyperglycemia component on the vertical axis. Diagonal lines divide the graph into five zones (quintiles) corresponding to the best (0th to 20th percentile) to worst (81st to 100th percentile) overall quality of glycemia. The GRI Grid enables users to track sequential changes within an individual over time and compare groups of individuals. The GRI is a single-number summary of the quality of glycemia. Its hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia components provide actionable scores and a graphical display (the GRI Grid) that can be used by clinicians and researchers to determine the glycemic effects of prescribed and investigational treatments.

1177,35304655,"Previous studies show that consuming foods preserved by salting increases the risk of gastric cancer, while results on the association between total salt or added salt and gastric cancer are less consistent and vary with the exposure considered. This study aimed to quantify the association between dietary salt exposure and gastric cancer, using an individual participant data meta-analysis of studies participating in the Stomach cancer Pooling (StoP) Project. Data from 25 studies (10,283 cases and 24,643 controls) from the StoP Project with information on salt taste preference (tasteless, normal, salty), use of table salt (never, sometimes, always), total sodium intake (tertiles of grams/day), and high-salt and salt-preserved foods intake (tertiles of grams/day) were used. A two-stage approach based on random-effects models was used to pool study-specific adjusted (sex, age, and gastric cancer risk factors) odds ratios (aORs), and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Gastric cancer risk was higher for salty taste preference (aOR 1.59, 95% CI 1.25-2.03), always using table salt (aOR 1.33, 95% CI 1.16-1.54), and for the highest tertile of high-salt and salt-preserved foods intake (aOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.01-1.51) vs. the lowest tertile. No significant association was observed for the highest vs. the lowest tertile of total sodium intake (aOR 1.08, 95% CI 0.82-1.43). The results obtained were consistent across anatomic sites, strata of Helicobacter pylori infection, and sociodemographic, lifestyle and study characteristics. Salty taste preference, always using table salt, and a greater high-salt and salt-preserved foods intake increased the risk of gastric cancer, though the association was less robust with total sodium intake.

1178,31197173,"Despite existing reports on differential DNA methylation in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity, our understanding of its functional relevance remains limited. Here we show the effect of differential methylation in the early phases of T2D pathology by a blood-based epigenome-wide association study of 4808 non-diabetic Europeans in the discovery phase and 11,750 individuals in the replication. We identify CpGs in LETM1, RBM20, IRS2, MAN2A2 and the 1q25.3 region associated with fasting insulin, and in FCRL6, SLAMF1, APOBEC3H and the 15q26.1 region with fasting glucose. In silico cross-omics analyses highlight the role of differential methylation in the crosstalk between the adaptive immune system and glucose homeostasis. The differential methylation explains at least 16.9% of the association between obesity and insulin. Our study sheds light on the biological interactions between genetic variants driving differential methylation and gene expression in the early pathogenesis of T2D. "

Households reporting their purchasing to a market research company (average weekly n=22 091), March 2014 to March 2019. A two-tiered tax levied on soft drinks manufacturers, announced in March 2016 and implemented in April 2018. Drinks with ≥8 g sugar/100 mL (high tier) are taxed at £0.24/L, drinks with ≥5 to <8 g sugar/100 mL (low tier) are taxed at £0.18/L. Absolute and relative differences in the volume of, and amount of sugar in, soft drinks categories, all soft drinks combined, alcohol and confectionery purchased per household per week 1 year after implementation. In March 2019, compared with the counterfactual, purchased volume of high tier drinks decreased by 140.8 mL (95% CI 104.3 to 177.3 mL) per household per week, equivalent to 37.8% (28.0% to 47.6%), and sugar purchased in these drinks decreased by 16.2 g (13.5 to 18.8 g), or 42.6% (35.6% to 49.6%). Purchases of low tier drinks decreased by 170.5 mL (154.5 to 186.5 mL) or 85.8% (77.8% to 93.9%), with an 11.5 g (9.1 to 13.9 g) reduction in sugar in these drinks, equivalent to 87.8% (69.2% to 106.4%). When all soft drinks were combined irrespective of levy tier or eligibility, the volume of drinks purchased increased by 188.8 mL (30.7 to 346.9 mL) per household per week, or 2.6% (0.4% to 4.7%), but sugar decreased by 8.0 g (2.4 to 13.6 g), or 2.7% (0.8% to 4.5%). Purchases of confectionery and alcoholic drinks did not increase. Compared with trends before the SDIL was announced, 1 year after implementation, volume of all soft drinks purchased combined increased by 189 mL, or 2.6% per household per week. The amount of sugar in those drinks was 8 g, or 2.7%, lower per household per week. Further studies should determine whether and how apparently small effect sizes translate into health outcomes.

1181,28971844,"Hyperglycemia-induced production of endothelin (ET)-1 is a hallmark of endothelial dysfunction in diabetes. Although the detrimental vascular effects of increased ET-1 are well known, the molecular mechanisms regulating endothelial synthesis of ET-1 in the setting of diabetes remain largely unidentified. Here, we show that adapter molecule TRAF3 interacting protein 2 (TRAF3IP2) mediates high glucose-induced ET-1 production in endothelial cells and ET-1-mediated endothelial cell inflammation. Specifically, we found that high glucose upregulated TRAF3IP2 in human aortic endothelial cells, which subsequently led to activation of JNK and IKKβ. shRNA-mediated silencing of TRAF3IP2, JNK1, or IKKβ abrogated high-glucose-induced ET-converting enzyme 1 expression and ET-1 production. Likewise, overexpression of TRAF3IP2, in the absence of high glucose, led to activation of JNK and IKKβ as well as increased ET-1 production. Furthermore, ET-1 transcriptionally upregulated TRAF3IP2, and this upregulation was prevented by pharmacological inhibition of ET-1 receptor B using BQ-788, or inhibition of NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species using gp91ds-tat and GKT137831. Notably, we found that knockdown of TRAF3IP2 abolished ET-1-induced proinflammatory and adhesion molecule (IL-1β, TNF-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin) expression and monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. Finally, we report that TRAF3IP2 is upregulated and colocalized with CD31, an endothelial marker, in the aorta of diabetic mice. Collectively, findings from the present study identify endothelial TRAF3IP2 as a potential new therapeutic target to suppress ET-1 production and associated vascular complications in diabetes. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study provides the first evidence that the adapter molecule TRAF3 interacting protein 2 mediates high glucose-induced production of endothelin-1 by endothelial cells as well as endothelin-1-mediated endothelial cell inflammation. The findings presented herein suggest that TRAF3 interacting protein 2 may be an important therapeutic target in diabetic vasculopathy characterized by excess endothelin-1 production. "

1185,30595373,"Mitochondria (MT), the major site of cellular energy production, are under dual genetic control by 37 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes and numerous nuclear genes (MT-nDNA). In the CHARGEmtDNA+ Consortium, we studied genetic associations of mtDNA and MT-nDNA associations with body mass index (BMI), waist-hip-ratio (WHR), glucose, insulin, HOMA-B, HOMA-IR, and HbA1c. This 45-cohort collaboration comprised 70,775 (insulin) to 170,202 (BMI) pan-ancestry individuals. Validation and imputation of mtDNA variants was followed by single-variant and gene-based association testing. We report two significant common variants, one in MT-ATP6 associated (p ≤ 5E-04) with WHR and one in the D-loop with glucose. Five rare variants in MT-ATP6, MT-ND5, and MT-ND6 associated with BMI, WHR, or insulin. Gene-based meta-analysis identified MT-ND3 associated with BMI (p ≤ 1E-03). We considered 2,282 MT-nDNA candidate gene associations compiled from online summary results for our traits (20 unique studies with 31 dataset consortia's genome-wide associations [GWASs]). Of these, 109 genes associated (p ≤ 1E-06) with at least 1 of our 7 traits. We assessed regulatory features of variants in the 109 genes, cis- and trans-gene expression regulation, and performed enrichment and protein-protein interactions analyses. Of the identified mtDNA and MT-nDNA genes, 79 associated with adipose measures, 49 with glucose/insulin, 13 with risk for type 2 diabetes, and 18 with cardiovascular disease, indicating for pleiotropic effects with health implications. Additionally, 21 genes related to cholesterol, suggesting additional important roles for the genes identified. Our results suggest that mtDNA and MT-nDNA genes and variants reported make important contributions to glucose and insulin metabolism, adipocyte regulation, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. "
1186,36799940,"Human epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) plays a crucial role in the development and progression of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure. Microscopically, EAT is composed of adipocytes, nerve tissues, inflammatory, stromovascular, and immune cells. Epicardial adipose tissue is a white adipose tissue, albeit it also has brown fat-like or beige fat-like features. No muscle fascia divides EAT and myocardium; this allows a direct interaction and crosstalk between the epicardial fat and the myocardium. Thus, it might be a therapeutic target for pharmaceutical compounds acting on G-protein-coupled receptors, such as those for glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), glucagon (GCG), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), whose selective stimulation with innovative drugs has demonstrated beneficial cardiovascular effects. The precise mechanism of these novel drugs and their tissue and cellular target(s) need to be better understood. We evaluate whether human EAT expresses GIP, GCG, and GLP-1 receptors and whether their presence is related to EAT transcriptome. We also investigated protein expression and cell-type localization specifically for GIP receptor (GIPR) and glucagon receptor (GCGR). Epicardial adipose tissue samples were collected from 33 patients affected by cardiovascular diseases undergoing open heart surgery (90.9% males, age 67.2 ± 10.5 years mean ± SD). Microarray and immunohistochemistry analyses were performed. Microarray analysis showed that GIPR and GCGR messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs) are expressed in EAT, beyond confirming the previously found GLP-1 [3776 ± 1377 arbitrary unit (A.U.), 17.77 ± 14.91 A.U., and 3.41 ± 2.27 A.U., respectively]. The immunohistochemical analysis consistently indicates that GIPR and GCGR are expressed in EAT, mainly in macrophages, isolated, and in crown-like structures. In contrast, only some mature adipocytes of different sizes showed cytoplasmic immunostaining, similar to endothelial cells and pericytes in the capillaries and pre-capillary vascular structures. Notably, EAT GIPR is statistically associated with the low expression of genes involved in free fatty acid (FFA) oxidation and transport and those promoting FFA biosynthesis and adipogenesis (P < 0.01). Epicardial adipose tissue GCGR, in turn, is related to genes involved in FFA transport, mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, and white-to-brown adipocyte differentiation, in addition to genes involved in the reduction of fatty acid biosynthesis and adipogenesis (P < 0.01). Having reported the expression of the GLP-1 receptor previously, here, we showed that GIPR and GCGR similarly present at mRNA and protein levels in human EAT, particularly in macrophages and partially adipocytes, suggesting these G-protein-coupled receptors as pharmacological targets on the ongoing innovative drugs, which seem cardiometabolically healthy well beyond their effects on glucose and body weight. Human epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is a unique and multifunctional fat compartment of the heart. Microscopically, EAT is composed of adipocytes, nerve tissues, inflammatory, stromovascular, and immune cells. Epicardial adipose tissue is a white adipose tissue, albeit it also has brown fat-like or beige fat-like features. No muscle fascia divides EAT and myocardium; this allows a direct interaction and crosstalk between the epicardial fat and the myocardium. Due to its distinctive transcriptome and functional proximity to the heart, EAT can play a key role in the development and progression of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure. Clinically, EAT, given its rapid metabolism and simple measurability, can be considered a novel therapeutic target, owing to its responsiveness to drugs with pleiotropic and clear beneficial cardiovascular effects such as the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists.Human EAT is found to express the genes encoding the receptors of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR), glucagon receptor (GCGR), and GLP-1. The immunohistochemistry indicates that GIP and GCG receptor proteins are present in EAT samples. Epicardial adipose tissue GIPR is inversely associated with genes involved in free fatty acid (FFA) oxidation and transport and with genes promoting FFA biosynthesis and adipogenesis. Epicardial adipose tissue GCGR is correlated with genes promoting FFA transport and activation for mitochondrial beta-oxidation and white-to-brown adipocyte differentiation and with genes reducing FFA biosynthesis and adipogenesis.As the myocardium relies mostly on FFAs as fuel and is in direct contiguity with EAT, these findings may have a great importance for the modulation of the myocardial activity and performance. Given the emerging use and cardiovascular effects of GLP-1R agonists, dual GIPR/GLP-1R agonists, and GLP-1R/GIPR/GCGR triagonists, we believe that pharmacologically targeting and potentially modulating organ-specific fat depots through G-protein–coupled receptors may produce beneficial cardiovascular and metabolic effects.

1187,35850749,"This study aims to examine the associations of food portion size (PS) with markers of insulin resistance (IR) and clustered of metabolic risk score in European adolescents. A total of 495 adolescents (53.5% females) from the Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence (HELENA) study were included. The association between PS from food groups and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index, VO2 max, and metabolic risk score was assessed by multilinear regression analysis adjusting for several confounders. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to determine the mean differences of food PS from food groups by HOMA-IR cutoff categories by using maternal education as a covariable. Larger PS from vegetables in both gender and milk, yoghurt, and milk beverages in males were associated with higher VO2 max, while larger PS from margarines and vegetable oils were associated with lower VO2 max (p < 0.05). Males who consumed larger PS from fish and fish products; meat substitutes, nuts, and pulses; cakes, pies, and biscuits; and sugar, honey, jams, and chocolate have a higher metabolic risk score (p < 0.05). Males with lower HOMA-IR cutoff values consumed larger PS from vegetables, milk, yoghurt, and milk beverages (p < 0.05). Females with lower HOMA-IR cutoff values consumed larger PS from breakfast cereals, while those with higher HOMA-IR cutoff values consumed larger PS from butter and animal fats (p = 0.018). The results show that larger PS from dairy products, cereals, and high energy dense foods are a significant determinant of IR and VO2 max, and larger PS from food with higher content of sugar were associated with higher metabolic risk score.

Comparison treatments included water/placebo/no intervention, non-nutritive sucking (NNS), glucose, breastfeeding, breast milk, music, acupuncture, facilitated tucking, and skin-to-skin care. We used standard Cochrane methods. We reported mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the fixed-effect model for continuous outcome measures. We assessed heterogeneity by the I We included 55 trials (6273 infants): 29 included term neonates, 22 included preterm neonates, and four included both. Heel lance was investigated in 50 trials; 15 investigated other minor painful procedures in addition to lancing. Sucrose vs control The evidence suggests that sucrose probably results in a reduction in PIPP scores compared to the control group at 30 seconds (MD -1.74 (95% CI -2.11 to -1.37); I Sucrose compared to control probably results in a reduction of PIPP scores 30 and 60 seconds after single heel lances (moderate-certainty evidence). Evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sucrose compared to NNS, breastfeeding, laser acupuncture, facilitated tucking, and the effect of sucrose + NNS compared to NNS in reducing pain. Sucrose compared to glucose, expressed breast milk, and skin-to-skin care shows little to no difference in pain scores. Sucrose combined with other nonpharmacologic interventions should be used with caution, given the uncertainty of evidence. "
1189,37537394,"There is a growing need for markers that could help indicate the decline in beta cell function and recognise the need and efficacy of intervention in type 1 diabetes. Measurements of suitably selected serum markers could potentially provide a non-invasive and easily applicable solution to this challenge. Accordingly, we evaluated a broad panel of proteins previously associated with type 1 diabetes in serum from newly diagnosed individuals during the first year from diagnosis. To uncover associations with beta cell function, comparisons were made between these targeted proteomics measurements and changes in fasting C-peptide levels. To further distinguish proteins linked with the disease status, comparisons were made with measurements of the protein targets in age- and sex-matched autoantibody-negative unaffected family members (UFMs). Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry analyses of serum, targeting 85 type 1 diabetes-associated proteins, were made. Sera from individuals diagnosed under 18 years (n=86) were drawn within 6 weeks of diagnosis and at 3, 6 and 12 months afterwards (288 samples in total). The SRM data were compared with fasting C-peptide/glucose data, which was interpreted as a measure of beta cell function. The protein data were further compared with cross-sectional SRM measurements from UFMs (n=194). Eleven proteins had statistically significant associations with fasting C-peptide/glucose. Of these, apolipoprotein L1 and glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3) displayed the strongest positive and inverse associations, respectively. Changes in GPX3 levels during the first year after diagnosis indicated future fasting C-peptide/glucose levels. In addition, differences in the levels of 13 proteins were observed between the individuals with type 1 diabetes and the matched UFMs. These included GPX3, transthyretin, prothrombin, apolipoprotein C1 and members of the IGF family. The association of several targeted proteins with fasting C-peptide/glucose levels in the first year after diagnosis suggests their connection with the underlying changes accompanying alterations in beta cell function in type 1 diabetes. Moreover, the direction of change in GPX3 during the first year was indicative of subsequent fasting C-peptide/glucose levels, and supports further investigation of this and other serum protein measurements in future studies of beta cell function in type 1 diabetes.

1190,33579912,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a deadly cancer in which cancer stem cells (CSCs) sustain tumor growth and contribute to therapeutic resistance. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) has recently emerged as a promising target in GBM. Using two orthogonal-acting inhibitors of PRMT5 (GSK591 or LLY-283), we show that pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 suppresses the growth of a cohort of 46 patient-derived GBM stem cell cultures, with the proneural subtype showing greater sensitivity. We show that PRMT5 inhibition causes widespread disruption of splicing across the transcriptome, particularly affecting cell cycle gene products. We identify a GBM splicing signature that correlates with the degree of response to PRMT5 inhibition. Importantly, we demonstrate that LLY-283 is brain-penetrant and significantly prolongs the survival of mice with orthotopic patient-derived xenografts. Collectively, our findings provide a rationale for the clinical development of brain penetrant PRMT5 inhibitors as treatment for GBM. "
1191,37797333,"To evaluate the association of maternal delivery history with a brachial plexus birth injury risk in subsequent deliveries and to estimate the effect of subsequent delivery method on brachial plexus birth injury risk. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all live-birth deliveries occurring in California-licensed hospitals from 1996 to 2012. The primary outcome was recurrent brachial plexus birth injury in a subsequent pregnancy. The exposure was delivery history (parity, shoulder dystocia in a previous delivery, or previously delivering a neonate with brachial plexus birth injury). Multiple logistic regression was used to model adjusted associations of delivery history with brachial plexus birth injury in a subsequent pregnancy. The adjusted risk and adjusted risk difference for brachial plexus birth injury between vaginal and cesarean deliveries in subsequent pregnancies were determined, stratified by delivery history, and the number of cesarean deliveries needed to prevent one brachial plexus birth injury was determined. Of 6,286,324 neonates delivered by 4,104,825 individuals, 7,762 (0.12%) were diagnosed with a brachial plexus birth injury. Higher parity was associated with a 5.7% decrease in brachial plexus birth injury risk with each subsequent delivery (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.94, 95% CI 0.92-0.97). Shoulder dystocia or brachial plexus birth injury in a previous delivery was associated with fivefold (0.58% vs 0.11%, aOR 5.39, 95% CI 4.10-7.08) and 17-fold (1.58% vs 0.11%, aOR 17.22, 95% CI 13.31-22.27) increases in brachial plexus birth injury risk, respectively. Among individuals with a history of delivering a neonate with a brachial plexus birth injury, cesarean delivery was associated with a 73.0% decrease in brachial plexus birth injury risk (0.60% vs 2.21%, aOR 0.27, 95% CI 0.13-0.55) compared with an 87.9% decrease in brachial plexus birth injury risk (0.02% vs 0.15%, aOR 0.12, 95% CI 0.10-0.15) in individuals without this history. Among individuals with a history of brachial plexus birth injury, 48.1 cesarean deliveries are needed to prevent one brachial plexus birth injury. Parity, previous shoulder dystocia, and previously delivering a neonate with brachial plexus birth injury are associated with future brachial plexus birth injury risk. These factors are identifiable prenatally and can inform discussions with pregnant individuals regarding brachial plexus birth injury risk and planned mode of delivery. "
1192,25982221,"Organisms are surrounded throughout life by chemically complex odors. How individuals process an odorant within a mixture or a mixture as a whole is a key question in neuroethology and chemical senses. This question is addressed here by using newborn rabbits, which can be rapidly conditioned to a new stimulus by single association with the mammary pheromone. After conditioning to ethyl maltol (odorant B), pups behaviorally respond to B and an A'B' mixture (68/32 ratio) but not to ethyl isobutyrate (odorant A) or an AB mixture (30/70 ratio). This suggests elemental and configural perception of A'B' and AB, respectively. We then explored the neural substrates underlying the processing of these mixtures with the hypothesis that processing varies according to perception. Pups were pseudoconditioned or conditioned to B on postnatal day 3 before exposure to B, A'B' or AB on day 4. Fos expression was not similar between groups (mainly in the olfactory bulb and posterior piriform cortex) suggesting a differential processing of the stimuli that might reflect either stimulus complexity or conditioning effect. Thus, the ratio of components in A'B' vs AB leads to differential activation of the olfactory system which may contribute to elemental and configural percepts of these mixtures. In addition, together with recent behavioral data, this highlights that configural perception occurs even in relatively immature animals, emphasizing the value of the newborn rabbit for exploration of odor mixture processing from molecules to brain and behavior. "
1193,35285471,"Animals, including humans, detect odours and use this information to behave efficiently in the environment. Frequently, odours consist of complex mixtures of odorants rather than single odorants, and mixtures are often perceived as configural wholes, i.e. as odour objects (e.g. food, partners). The biological rules governing this 'configural perception' (as opposed to the elemental perception of mixtures through their components) remain weakly understood. Here, we first review examples of configural mixture processing in diverse species involving species-specific biological signals. Then, we present the original hypothesis that at least certain mixtures can be processed configurally across species. Indeed, experiments conducted in human adults, newborn rabbits and, more recently, in rodents and honeybees show that these species process some mixtures in a remarkably similar fashion. Strikingly, a mixture AB (A, ethyl isobutyrate; B, ethyl maltol) induces configural processing in humans, who perceive a mixture odour quality (pineapple) distinct from the component qualities (A, strawberry; B, caramel). The same mixture is weakly configurally processed in rabbit neonates, which perceive a particular odour for the mixture in addition to the component odours. Mice and honeybees also perceive the AB mixture configurally, as they respond differently to the mixture compared with its components. Based on these results and others, including neurophysiological approaches, we propose that certain mixtures are convergently perceived across various species of vertebrates/invertebrates, possibly as a result of a similar anatomical organization of their olfactory systems and the common necessity to simplify the environment's chemical complexity in order to display adaptive behaviours.

1194,36920087,"Previous studies showed that inhibiting lymphocyte costimulation reduces declining β-cell function in individuals newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. We tested whether abatacept would delay or prevent progression of type 1 diabetes from normal glucose tolerance (NGT) to abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT) or to diabetes and the effects of treatment on immune and metabolic responses. We conducted a phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked trial of abatacept in antibody-positive participants with NGT who received monthly abatacept/placebo infusions for 12 months. The end point was AGT or diabetes, assessed by oral glucose tolerance tests. A total of 101 participants received abatacept and 111 placebo. Of these, 81 (35 abatacept and 46 placebo) met the end point of AGT or type 1 diabetes diagnosis (hazard ratio 0.702; 95% CI 0.452, 1.09; P = 0.11) The C-peptide responses to oral glucose tolerance tests were higher in the abatacept arm (P < 0.03). Abatacept reduced the frequency of inducible T-cell costimulatory (ICOS)+ PD1+ T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells during treatment (P < 0.0001), increased naive CD4+ T cells, and also reduced the frequency of CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) from the baseline (P = 0.0067). Twelve months after treatment, the frequency of ICOS+ Tfh, naive CD4+ T cells, and Tregs returned to baseline. Although abatacept treatment for 1 year did not significantly delay progression to glucose intolerance in at-risk individuals, it impacted immune cell subsets and preserved insulin secretion, suggesting that costimulation blockade may modify progression of type 1 diabetes.

1195,29554902,"Insufficient sleep duration and obstructive sleep apnea, two common causes of sleep deficiency in adults, can result in excessive sleepiness, a well-recognized cause of motor vehicle crashes, although their contribution to crash risk in the general population remains uncertain. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relation of sleep apnea, sleep duration, and excessive sleepiness to crash risk in a community-dwelling population. This was a prospective observational cohort study nested within the Sleep Heart Health Study, a community-based study of the health consequences of sleep apnea. The participants were 1745 men and 1456 women aged 40-89 years. Sleep apnea was measured by home polysomnography and questionnaires were used to assess usual sleep duration and daytime sleepiness. A follow-up questionnaire 2 years after baseline ascertained driving habits and motor vehicle crash history. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the relation of sleep apnea and sleep duration at baseline to the occurrence of motor vehicle crashes during the year preceding the follow-up visit, adjusting for relevant covariates. The population-attributable fraction of motor vehicle crashes was estimated from the sample proportion of motor vehicle crashes and the adjusted odds ratios for motor vehicle crash within each exposure category. Among 3201 evaluable participants, 222 (6.9%) reported at least one motor vehicle crash during the prior year. A higher apnea-hypopnea index (p < 0.01), fewer hours of sleep (p = 0.04), and self-reported excessive sleepiness (p < 0.01) were each significantly associated with crash risk. Severe sleep apnea was associated with a 123% increased crash risk, compared to no sleep apnea. Sleeping 6 hours per night was associated with a 33% increased crash risk, compared to sleeping 7 or 8 hours per night. These associations were present even in those who did not report excessive sleepiness. The population-attributable fraction of motor vehicle crashes was 10% due to sleep apnea and 9% due to sleep duration less than 7 hours. Sleep deficiency due to either sleep apnea or insufficient sleep duration is strongly associated with motor vehicle crashes in the general population, independent of self-reported excessive sleepiness.

1196,37056444,"Vegan diets are currently attracting a great deal of attention. However, avoiding animal-based foods restricts the diet and is associated with risks, the extent and medical implications of which are at present not sufficiently understood. Elimination diets represent the usual therapeutic long-term management in the presence of food allergy. In order to understand the risks of vegan diets and to discuss these critically from the perspective of food allergies, the expertise of a nutritionist/dietitian with expertise in this area is indispensable. This position paper deals with the incentives behind and the benefits of a plant-based diet. The knowledge required to cover macro- and micronutrient dietary requirements is presented. Using the avoidance of cow's milk as an example, the challenges of adequately meeting nutritional needs are identified and (so-called) milk alternatives are evaluated from an allergy and nutritional point of view. Finally, other plant-based (substitute) products are evaluated from the same perspective, as significant protein sources in vegan diets (e.g., legumes, nuts, and seeds) are at the same time potential and potent triggers of allergic reactions. However, the allergic potential of many substitute products cannot be fully assessed at present due to gaps in research. Wheat as the most important trigger for anaphylaxis in adults is also evaluated. Finally, the increase in ultra-processed products in the (vegan) food sector and their potential consequences for the immune system are discussed. "
