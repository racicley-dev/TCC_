0,1,"Medical cannabis (MC) is available upon certification for one of several qualifying conditions in Florida, USA. Previous studies suggested that some people seek cannabis for medical conditions/symptoms beyond those legally permitted. However, data remain limited on patient motives for seeking MC and their experiences around its impact on their health. We aimed to compare reported qualifying conditions for MC certification with the most frequently self-reported reasons for using MC while assessing the alignment between the two and understanding the perceived impacts of MC on self-reported conditions and symptoms. We conducted a cross-sectional study using survey data from the Medical Marijuana and Me (M A total of 632 participants completed the survey, of whom 396 (62.66%) were female and 471 (74.53%) were non-Hispanic white. The median (IQR) age was 45 (35, 58). The most frequently reported qualifying conditions were post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) ( Qualifying conditions and self-reported reasons for using MC aligned for most respondents. Yet, a notable proportion of respondents sought MC for broader treatment effects beyond those delineated by the officially recognized qualifying conditions in Florida, USA. Most patients perceived positive effects, including those with limited available evidence on efficacy. In Florida, USA, medical cannabis (MC) is accessible for certified individuals with specific health conditions. Previous research found that many people seek MC for conditions beyond the officially approved ones. We aimed to understand the alignment between qualifying conditions per statute, the reasons patients reported for using MC, and the perceived impacts on health conditions and symptoms. In a 2022 survey of 632 MC users, the top reported qualifying conditions were post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), medical condition comparable to listed conditions, and chronic nonmalignant pain. The top ten self-reported reasons for using MC were anxiety, chronic pain, depression, PTSD, headaches/migraine, fibromyalgia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, high blood pressure, and cancer. Many patients reported multiple reasons for MC use, including typically one reason that matched their reported qualifying condition. Most respondents noted improvements in anxiety, depression, chronic pain, insomnia, PTSD, headaches/migraine, ADHD, bipolar disorder, and fibromyalgia. These findings suggest that in addition to the officially recognized qualifying conditions, people often use MC for a broader range of conditions and symptoms, some of which are not included in the current statute and/or without evidence of efficacy.

1,2,"Patients with chronic health conditions not responding to conventional treatment can access medicinal cannabis (MC) prescriptions from clinicians in Australia. We aimed to assess overall health-related quality of life (HRQL), pain, fatigue, sleep, anxiety, and depression in a large real-world sample of patients accessing prescribed medicinal cannabis. We hypothesized that all patient-reported outcomes (PROs) would improve from baseline to 3-months. The QUEST Initiative is a large prospective multicenter study of patients with any chronic health condition newly prescribed medicinal cannabis between November 2020 and December 2021. Eligible patients were identified by 120 clinicians at medical centers across six Australian states. Consenting participants completed the EuroQol Group EQ-5D-5L health status questionnaire; European Organization for Research & Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaire (QLQ-C30); Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Short Forms in Fatigue and Sleep Disturbance, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) before starting therapy, at 2-weeks titration, then monthly for 3-months. Of the 2762 consenting participants, 2327 completed baseline and at least one follow-up questionnaire. Ages ranged between 18-97 years (mean 51y; SD = 15.4), 62.8% were female. The most commonly treated conditions were chronic pain (n = 1598/2327; 68.7%), insomnia (n = 534/2327; 22.9%), generalized anxiety (n = 508/2327; 21.5%), and mixed anxiety and depression (n = 259/2327; 11%). Across the whole cohort both EQ-5D-5L utility scores and QLQ-C30 summary scores showed clinically meaningful improvement in HRQL from baseline to mean follow-up with d = 0.54 (95%CI:0.47 to 0.59) and d = 0.64 (95%CI:0.58 to 0.70) respectively; and clinically meaningful improvement in fatigue (d = 0.54; 95%CI:0.48 to 0.59). There was clinically meaningful reduction of pain for those with chronic pain (d = 0.65; 95%CI:0.57 to 0.72); significant improvements for those with moderate to extremely severe anxiety (X2 = 383; df = 4; p<0.001) and depression (X2 = 395; df = 4; p<0.001); and no changes in sleep disturbance. We observed statistically significant, clinically meaningful improvements in overall HRQL and fatigue over the first 3-months in patients with chronic health conditions accessing prescribed medical cannabis. Anxiety, depression, and pain also improved over time, particularly for those with corresponding health conditions. The study continues to follow-up patients until 12-months to determine whether improvements in PROs are maintained long-term.

2,3,"Cancer patients are using medical cannabis (MC) to address symptoms; however, little data exist to guide clinicians when counseling patients. We seek to define the patterns of MC use among cancer patients, as well as efficacy and safety of MC. Cancer patients attending oncology office visits at Beaumont Hospital, Michigan from July to December 2018 were anonymously surveyed. The survey included data regarding demographics, diagnosis, treatment, symptom burden, and MC use. Patients who reported MC use since their cancer diagnosis completed a section on patterns of use, efficacy, and safety. The response rate was 188 of 327 (57.5%). MC use was reported by 46 of 188 (24.5%). A median composite baseline symptom score ranging from 8 (best) to 32 (worst) was higher in patients using MC versus nonusers; 17.5 versus 14.4 (P<0.001). Pain was the symptom with the highest frequency of improvement 34/42 (81%), followed by appetite 34/44 (77.3%), and anxiety 32/44 (73%). MC improved the ability to tolerate treatment in 24/44 (54.5%). Cloudy thinking is the symptom that worsened the most 7/42 (16.7%), with decreased energy being experienced by 4/41 (9.8%) of the users. MC was utilized by a significant portion of cancer patients in this sample, across age, diagnosis, stage, and treatment. Patients with a higher severity of baseline symptoms were more likely to use MC and report a favorable efficacy profile of MC. Minimal toxicity was reported in this cohort. Prospective studies are needed to define the efficacy and safety of MC. ",0.2776073561109915,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109508
3,4,"To survey the pattern and benefits of medical cannabis use (MCU) in a cross section of persons with multiple sclerosis (PWMS). One hundred and fifteen subjects completed a 36-question survey online or on paper which queried aspects of their use of cannabis, including frequency of use, effect on symptoms, and changes in their use of prescription medications, as well asa number of key demographic variables such as age, gender, disease duration and clinical course, etc. All subjects were treated at a multiple sclerosis (MS) clinic in Connecticut and enrolled in the Connecticut Medical Marijuana Program (CTMMP). Self-reported benefit from cannabis use for two or more symptoms of MS was associated with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) vs progressive (PMS) (OR 3.043, 95% CI 1.026-9.028, p=0.038) and less benefit for two or more symptoms for those who required a wheelchair vs. those who ambulated without assistance (OR .246, 95% CI .195-.797, p=0.016). General benefit from cannabis use was reported for mood disorders (p<0.001), insomnia (p<0.001), sensory symptoms, including pain (p<0.001), and muscle cramps and spasms (p<0.001). Furthermore, benefit was also significantly associated with symptom severity in the case of insomnia (OR 9.735, 95% CI 2.751-34.445, p<0.001), and cramps and spasms (OR 5.234, 95% CI 1.261-21.729, p=0.014). A significant proportion of respondents had stopped or reduced prescription medications (86% vs. 55%, p<0.001) as a function of finding cannabis more effective than prescription medications. These included opioids, benzodiazepines, muscle relaxers and other pain medications. MCU among PWMS can lead to the reduction or discontinuation of several categories of prescription medications for symptoms of MS. Persons reporting the most benefit from MCU tended to have a milder form of MS with less disability, in contrast to previous studies. This study confirms the benefit of cannabis in several common MS symptoms, extending these findings to show that benefit can be related to baseline severity of some symptoms.

4,5,"Medical cannabis (MC) is increasingly being used for treatment of chronic pain symptoms. Among patients there is also a growing preference for the use of MC to manage sleep problems. The aim of the current study was to examine the associations between use of whole plant cannabis and sleep problems among chronic pain patients. A total of 128 individuals with chronic pain over the age of 50 years were recruited from the Rambam Institute for Pain Medicine in Haifa, Israel. Of them, 66 were MC users and 62 were non-users. Regression models tested the differences in sleep problems between the two groups. Furthermore, Pearson correlations between MC use measures (dose, length and frequency of use, number of strains used, tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol levels) and sleep problems were assessed among MC users. After adjustment for age, sex, pain level and use of sleep and anti-depressant medications, MC use was associated with less problems with waking up at night compared with non-MC use. No group differences were found for problems with falling asleep or waking up early without managing to fall back asleep. Frequent MC use was associated with more problems waking up at night and falling asleep. MC use may have an overall positive effect on maintaining sleep throughout the night in chronic pain patients. At the same time, tolerance towards potential sleep-inducing properties of MC may occur with frequent use. More research based on randomised control trials and other longitudinal designs is warranted. ",0.2850867857874516,10.1016/j.ctim.2019.102207
5,6,"The use of cannabis as a medicine is becoming increasingly prevalent. Given the diverse range of conditions being treated with medical cannabis, as well as the vast array of products and dose forms available, clinical evidence incorporating patient-reported outcomes may help determine safety and efficacy. To assess whether patients using medical cannabis report improvements in health-related quality of life over time. This retrospective case series study was conducted at a network of specialist medical clinics (Emerald Clinics) located across Australia. Participants were patients who received treatment for any indication at any point between December 2018 and May 2022. Patients were followed up every mean (SD) 44.6 (30.1) days. Data for up to 15 follow-ups were reported. Statistical analysis was conducted from August to September 2022. Medical cannabis. Product types and cannabinoid content varied over time in accordance with the treating physician's clinical judgement. The main outcome measure was health-related quality of life as assessed using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire. In this case series of 3148 patients, 1688 (53.6%) were female; 820 (30.2%) were employed; and the mean (SD) age was 55.9 (18.7) years at baseline before treatment. Chronic noncancer pain was the most common indication for treatment (68.6% [2160 of 3148]), followed by cancer pain (6.0% [190 of 3148]), insomnia (4.8% [152 of 3148]), and anxiety (4.2% [132 of 3148]). After commencing treatment with medical cannabis, patients reported significant improvements relative to baseline on all 8 domains of the SF-36, and these improvements were mostly sustained over time. After controlling for potential confounders in a regression model, treatment with medical cannabis was associated with an improvement of 6.60 (95% CI, 4.57-8.63) points to 18.31 (95% CI, 15.86-20.77) points in SF-36 scores, depending on the domain (all P < .001). Effect sizes (Cohen d) ranged from 0.21 to 0.72. A total of 2919 adverse events were reported, including 2 that were considered serious. In this case series study, patients using medical cannabis reported improvements in health-related quality of life, which were mostly sustained over time. Adverse events were rarely serious but common, highlighting the need for caution with prescribing medical cannabis. ",0.3022131663765877,10.1080/13543784.2019.1561859
