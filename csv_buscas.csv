Amiodarone hydrochloride is an antiarrhythmic drug used to treat supraventricular tachycardia. However, there are currently no commercial pediatric forms available to treat young patients. Various oral formulations were previously reported in the literature, but the concentration was lower than the doses prescribed in clinical practice (a loading dose of 500 mg/m2/day for 7-10 days followed by a maintenance dose of 250 mg/m2/day). The objective of this study was to develop an oral liquid formulation of amiodarone hydrochloride at an optimal concentration for use in children and to evaluate its physicochemical and microbiological stability. No commercial suspension vehicle was used, allowing the choice of excipients. Compounding was performed using hydroxypropylmethylcellulose as thickener, potassium sorbate preservative, citric acid/sodium citrate buffer, sodium saccharin as a , and a strawberry flavoring agent. A concentration of 40 mg/mL was selected based on a 5-year compilation of prescribed doses. Analyses performed were the following: visual and microscopic inspection, testing for antimicrobial preservation, osmolality and pH measurements, quantification of amiodarone hydrochloride by a stability-indicating liquid chromatography method, and a microbiological count. At least 95% of the initial amiodarone hydrochloride remained stable during the 60-day study period under refrigeration. All other tested parameters remained stable at 5 °C. A targeted log reduction of the microorganism inoculum by day 14 and no microbial growth by day 28 were demonstrated in the test for antimicrobial preservation. The stability of 40 mg/mL amiodarone hydrochloride oral suspension was maintained under refrigeration for 60 days before opening bottles and for 1 month after opening bottles. 
38664350	The effect of fluoride varnish application on colour change due to paediatric drug usage in polyacid-modified composite resin: an in vitro study.	Colour stability is important in the long-term aesthetic success of restorative materials and is affected by both internal and external factors. Internal discolourations are due to the properties of the restorative materials. External discolourations can be associated with frequent consumption of food and beverages and the use of suspensions or syrups containing colourants/additives. Fluoride varnish application has an important place in preventive dentistry. The purpose of the research was to examine the protective effect of fluoride varnish application on the colour change on polyacid-modified composite resin restorative materials caused by the use of various paediatric drugs. Two hundred ten discs were prepared from polyacid-modified composite resin material and divided into two groups: flouride varnish was applied to one group and flouride varnish was not applied to the other group. The groups were further divided into seven subgroups and the samples were kept in artificial saliva, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, cefuroxime axetil, clarithromycin, paracetamol, ibuprofen, and iron supplement drug solutions. The colour change values of the discs were measured using a spectrophotometer device before immersion in the drug solutions and on the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th days after the immersion. The obtained data were calculated and statistically evaluated using IBM SPSS V23 software. It was found that the application of fluoride varnish in the iron supplement drug group prevented the colour change of the polyacid-modified composite resins for 28 days. In the amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, cefuroxime axetil, and paracetamol groups, the fluoride varnish did not prevent colour change in the polyacid-modified composite resin restorative materials at the end of the 14th day. It is thought that fluoride varnish application may be beneficial as a preservative in the colour change of polyacid-modified composite resins due to the use of various paediatric drugs, and this protective feature may be effective for a specific period of time. 
39477275	Protocol for a community-based, household-randomised, dose-response trial to assess the acceptability, nutritional effects and safety of double-fortified salt containing iodine and folic acid compared with iodised salt among non-pregnant Ethiopian women of reproductive age (DFS-IoFA).	The prevalence of neural tube defects (NTDs) is higher in Ethiopia than most other countries, and ~84% of Ethiopian women of reproductive age (WRA) have folate insufficiency, a major risk factor for NTDs. Salt fortification with folic acid is a potential strategy to improve women's folate status, but data are needed on the acceptability, nutritional impact and safety of folic acid fortification of iodised salt. The study is designed as a community-based, household-randomised, dose-response trial. A total of 360 non-pregnant WRA 18-49 years of age will be randomly assigned to one of three intervention arms: (1) iodised salt fortified with 30 ppm folic acid to provide ~200 µg folic acid/day; (2) iodised salt fortified with 90 ppm folic acid to provide ~600 µg folic acid/day; or (3) iodised salt (comparator). The preweighed salts will be delivered to participants' homes biweekly for 26 weeks; unused salt will be collected and weighed. Fasting, venous blood samples will be collected at baseline, end line and a randomly assigned intermediate time point for assessment of folate, iodine, vitamin B The study has been approved by the Ethiopian Public Health Institute's Institutional Review Board, and the protocol has been registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (registration number NCT06223854). Study results will be published in open access scientific journals and disseminated nationally in Ethiopia. NCT06223854. 
39480129	Baseline factors associated with myopia progression and axial elongation over 30 months in children 5 to 12 years of age.	This study aimed to identify baseline factors associated with greater myopia progression and axial elongation in children with myopia. This study performed a post hoc analysis of data from a 30-month randomized trial of atropine 0.01% versus placebo in children 5 to <13 years old with baseline spherical equivalent refractive error (SER) of -1.00 to -6.00 D, astigmatism of ≤1.50 D, and anisometropia of <1.00 D SER. Data from atropine 0.01% and placebo groups were pooled given outcomes were similar. Baseline factors of age, SER, axial length, race, sex, parental myopia, and iris color were evaluated for association with changes in SER and with changes in axial length at 30 months (24 months on treatment and then 6 months off) using backward model selection. Among 187 randomized participants, 175 (94%) completed 30 months of follow-up. The mean change in SER was greater among younger children (-0.19 D per 1 year younger; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.25 to -0.14 D; p<0.001) and children with higher myopia (-0.14 D per 1 D more myopia at baseline; 95% CI, -0.23 to -0.05 D; p=0.002). The mean change in axial length was also greater among younger children (0.13 mm per 1 year younger; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.15 mm; p<0.001) and children with higher baseline myopia (0.04 mm per 1 D more myopia; 95% CI, 0.002 to 0.08; p=0.04). Younger children with higher myopia had greater myopic progression and axial elongation over 30 months than older children with lower myopia. Developing effective treatments to slow the faster myopic progression in younger children should be a target of further research.

39418882	Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier in depressed mice induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress.	Recent studies have suggested potential impairment of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in depression. However, due to the limited research and variability in animal models, further investigation using diverse and stable models is necessary. A male mouse model of depression was established using the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) protocol. Following model establishment, depression-like behaviors were assessed using the sucrose preference test, tail suspension test, and forced swimming test. Morphological changes in the hippocampus were examined through hematoxylin-eosin staining. BBB permeability was evaluated using the Evans blue leakage test, fluorescein sodium (NaF) leakage test, and serum S100B content assessment. Gene and protein expression levels of BBB-related proteins in the hippocampus were determined via real-time PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence assays. CUMS exposure induced depression-like behaviors, including reduced body weight gain, diminished sucrose preference, and prolonged immobility in both the tail suspension test and forced swimming test. While no significant pathological changes were observed in the hippocampus of either group, increased BBB permeability was noted in the CUMS group, as evidenced by enhanced NaF leakage into the brain parenchyma and elevated serum S100B levels. Gene expression analysis revealed downregulation of angiogenesis-related genes and tight junction proteins in the CUMS group. Additionally, protein levels of tight junction proteins Claudin-5 and ZO-1 were lower in the CUMS group compared to controls. This study is limited to a male mouse model, and the BBB in females is worth exploring in the future. Increased BBB permeability and decreased expression of tight junction proteins Claudin5 and ZO-1 were observed in mice with CUMS-induced depression. 
39380924	Surface Roughness Examination of Glass Ionomer Restorative Cements Treated with Acidic and Basic Pediatric Medications: An 	Consumption of different types of beverages and liquid drugs can affect of the surface properties of restorative material. This may lead to an increased probability of dental caries and periodontal inflammation. This study evaluated and compared the effect of amoxicillin suspension (AMS) and azithromycin suspension (AZS) on the surface roughness (SR) of silver-reinforced glass ionomer (SGI) and nano resin-modified glass ionomer (NGI). Thirty disks (2 mm height × 4 mm diameter) of each glass ionomer (GI) type were prepared and subdivided into three groups ( This study demonstrated, for the first time, the effect of a basic drug (AZS) on the SR of GIs. Intra- and inter-group comparisons showed significant changes ( The SR of NGIs and SGIs can be significantly affected by the use of AMS and AZS suspensions. SGI demonstrated higher SR deterioration than NGI after immersion cycles in AMS. 
39462428	The role of the oral microbiota in the causal effect of adjunctive antibiotics on clinical outcomes in stage III-IV periodontitis patients.	Periodontitis, a prevalent chronic inflammatory disease, offers insights into the broader landscape of chronic inflammatory conditions. The progression and treatment outcomes of periodontitis are closely related to the oral microbiota's composition. Adjunctive systemic Amoxicillin 500 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg, often prescribed thrice daily for 7 days to enhance periodontal therapy's efficacy, have lasting effects on the oral microbiome. However, the precise mechanism through which the oral microbiome influences clinical outcomes in periodontitis patients remains debated. This investigation explores the pivotal role of the oral microbiome's composition in mediating the outcomes of adjunctive systemic antibiotic treatment. Subgingival plaque samples from 10 periodontally healthy and 163 periodontitis patients from a randomized clinical trial on periodontal therapy were analyzed. Patients received either adjunctive amoxicillin/metronidazole or a placebo after mechanical periodontal treatment. Microbial samples were collected at various intervals up to 26 months post-therapy. Using topic models, we identified microbial communities associated with normobiotic and dysbiotic states, validated with 86 external and 40 internal samples. Logistic regression models evaluated the association between these microbial communities and clinical periodontitis parameters. A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) determined the mediating role of oral microbiota in the causal path of antibiotic treatment effects on clinical outcomes. We identified clear distinctions between dysbiotic and normobiotic microbial communities, differentiating healthy from periodontitis subjects. Dysbiotic states consistently associated with below median %Pocket Probing Depth ≥ 5 mm (OR = 1.26, 95% CI [1.14-1.42]) and %Bleeding on Probing (OR = 1.09, 95% CI [1.00-1.18]). Factors like microbial response to treatment, smoking, and age were predictors of clinical attachment loss progression, whereas sex and antibiotic treatment were not. Further, we showed that the oral microbial treatment response plays a crucial role in the causal effect of antibiotic treatment on clinical treatment outcomes. The shift towards a normobiotic subgingival microbiome, primarily induced by adjunctive antibiotics, underscores the potential for microbiome-targeted interventions to enhance therapeutic efficacy in chronic inflammatory conditions. This study reaffirms the importance of understanding the oral microbiome's role in periodontal health and paves the way for future research exploring personalized treatment strategies based on individual microbiome profiles.

34387136	Amoxicillin chewable tablets intended for pediatric use: formulation development, stability evaluation and taste assessment.	To cover the unpleasant taste of amoxicillin (250 mg), maize starch (baby food) and milk chocolate were co-formulated. The raw materials and the final formulations were characterized by means of Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier-Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. To evaluate the taste masking two different groups of volunteers were used, according to the Ethical Research Committee of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The optimization of excipients' content in the tablet was determined by experimental design methodology (crossed D-optimal). Due to the matrix complexity, amoxicillin was extracted using liquid extraction and analyzed isocratically by HPLC. The developed chromatographic method was validated (%Recovery 98.7-101.3, %RSD = 1.3, LOD and LOQ 0.15 and 0.45 μg mL

39210755	Bismuth-based quadruple therapy versus standard triple therapy for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori in Belgium: a multicentre, non-blinded randomized, prospective study.	Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection predisposes to malignant and non-malignant diseases warranting eradication. In Belgium, resistance rates for clarithromycin demonstrate regional variations making the use of standard triple therapy (STT) borderline acceptable. According to a recent Belgian survey, STT and bismuth-based quadruple therapy (BQT), are equally frequent prescribed as first line treatment for treatment naïve Hp positive patients. This study aims to evaluate the eradication rates (ER) of BQT versus STT. Multicentre, non-blinded randomized, prospective study comparing ER in treatment-naïve Hp positive patients. ER were compared by intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analysis. Overall 250 patients were included (STT 126, BQT 124). Seventeen patients were lost to follow-up (6,8%). No significant difference in ER between BQT and STT was observed in ITT (73% vs 68%, p= 0,54) neither in PP analysis (81% vs 75%, p= 0,33). Side effects and endoscopic findings were comparable between groups. Post-hoc analysis showed no differences according to gender or site allocation. The numerical advantage of BQT did not translate in a significant improvement of ER when compared with STT. These results question the cost-effectiveness of BQT, while confirming the suboptimal eradication rates on STT. A nationwide monitoring of resistance patterns, maximal investments in treatment adherence as well as a detailed follow-up of the changing treatment landscape are mandatory to continuously optimise Hp ER in Belgium.

37490085	Identifying Children Likely to Benefit From Antibiotics for Acute Sinusitis: A Randomized Clinical Trial.	The large overlap between symptoms of acute sinusitis and viral upper respiratory tract infection suggests that certain subgroups of children being diagnosed with acute sinusitis, and subsequently treated with antibiotics, derive little benefit from antibiotic use. To assess if antibiotic therapy could be appropriately withheld in prespecified subgroups. Randomized clinical trial including 515 children aged 2 to 11 years diagnosed with acute sinusitis based on clinical criteria. The trial was conducted between February 2016 and April 2022 at primary care offices affiliated with 6 US institutions and was designed to evaluate whether symptom burden differed in subgroups defined by nasopharyngeal Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis on bacterial culture and by the presence of colored nasal discharge. Oral amoxicillin (90 mg/kg/d) and clavulanate (6.4 mg/kg/d) (n = 254) or placebo (n = 256) for 10 days. The primary outcome was symptom burden based on daily symptom scores on a validated scale (range, 0-40) during the 10 days after diagnosis. Secondary outcomes included treatment failure, adverse events including clinically significant diarrhea, and resource use by families. Most of the 510 included children were aged 2 to 5 years (64%), male (54%), White (52%), and not Hispanic (89%). The mean symptom scores were significantly lower in children in the amoxicillin and clavulanate group (9.04 [95% CI, 8.71 to 9.37]) compared with those in the placebo group (10.60 [95% CI, 10.27 to 10.93]) (between-group difference, -1.69 [95% CI, -2.07 to -1.31]). The length of time to symptom resolution was significantly lower for children in the antibiotic group (7.0 days) than in the placebo group (9.0 days) (P = .003). Children without nasopharyngeal pathogens detected did not benefit from antibiotic treatment as much as those with pathogens detected; the between-group difference in mean symptom scores was -0.88 (95% CI, -1.63 to -0.12) in those without pathogens detected compared with -1.95 (95% CI, -2.40 to -1.51) in those with pathogens detected. Efficacy did not differ significantly according to whether colored nasal discharge was present (the between-group difference was -1.62 [95% CI, -2.09 to -1.16] for colored nasal discharge vs -1.70 [95% CI, -2.38 to -1.03] for clear nasal discharge; P = .52 for the interaction between treatment group and the presence of colored nasal discharge). In children with acute sinusitis, antibiotic treatment had minimal benefit for those without nasopharyngeal bacterial pathogens on presentation, and its effects did not depend on the color of nasal discharge. Testing for specific bacteria on presentation may represent a strategy to reduce antibiotic use in this condition. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02554383. 
39472910	Comparison of 4.54% hypertonic saline and 20% mannitol for brain relaxation during auditory brainstem implantation in pediatric patients: a single-center retrospective observational cohort study.	Mannitol is frequently utilized to achieve intracranial brain relaxation during the retrosigmoid approach for auditory brainstem implantation (ABI). Hypertonic saline (HS) is an alternative for reducing intracranial pressure; however, its application during ABI surgery remains under-investigated. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety between HS and mannitol for maintaining brain relaxation. This single-center retrospective cohort study included pediatric patients undergoing ABI surgery from September 2020 to January 2022 who received only 4.54% HS or 20% mannitol for brain relaxation. The analysis involved initial doses, subsequent doses, and dosing intervals of the two hyperosmolar solutions, as well as the time elapsed from meningeal opening to the first ABI electrode placement attempt. Additionally, the analysis encompassed electrolyte testing, hemodynamic variables, urine output, blood transfusion, second surgeries, adverse events, intensive care unit length of stay, and 30-day mortality. We analyzed 68 consecutive pediatric patients; 26 and 42 in the HS and mannitol groups, respectively. The HS group exhibited a reduced rate of supplementary use (7.7% vs. 31%) and lower total urine volume. Perioperative outcomes, mortality, and length of intensive care unit stay did not exhibit significant between-group differences, despite transient increases in blood sodium and chloride observed within 2 h after HS infusion. In pediatric ABI surgery, as an osmotherapy for cerebral relaxation, 4.54% HS demonstrated a lower likelihood of necessitating additional supplementation than 20% mannitol. Furthermore, the diuretic effect of HS was weak and the increase in electrolyte levels during surgery was temporary and slight.

The mean change in axial length was also greater among younger children (0.13 mm per 1 year younger; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.15 mm; p<0.001) and children with higher baseline myopia (0.04 mm per 1 D more myopia; 95% CI, 0.002 to 0.08; p=0.04). Younger children with higher myopia had greater myopic progression and axial elongation over 30 months than older children with lower myopia. Developing effective treatments to slow the faster myopic progression in younger children should be a target of further research.

BBB permeability was evaluated using the Evans blue leakage test, fluorescein sodium (NaF) leakage test, and serum S100B content assessment. Gene and protein expression levels of BBB-related proteins in the hippocampus were determined via real-time PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence assays. CUMS exposure induced depression-like behaviors, including reduced body weight gain, diminished sucrose preference, and prolonged immobility in both the tail suspension test and forced swimming test. While no significant pathological changes were observed in the hippocampus of either group, increased BBB permeability was noted in the CUMS group, as evidenced by enhanced NaF leakage into the brain parenchyma and elevated serum S100B levels. Gene expression analysis revealed downregulation of angiogenesis-related genes and tight junction proteins in the CUMS group. Additionally, protein levels of tight junction proteins Claudin-5 and ZO-1 were lower in the CUMS group compared to controls. This study is limited to a male mouse model, and the BBB in females is worth exploring in the future. Increased BBB permeability and decreased expression of tight junction proteins Claudin5 and ZO-1 were observed in mice with CUMS-induced depression. 
39092463	Leftover of Amoxicillin Suspension After Use by Children in the Netherlands.	In clinical practice, a discrepancy may exist between the prescribed amount of a drug and the commercially available pack sizes in the pharmacy, potentially contributing to drug waste. This study aimed-as an example of this phenomena-to quantify leftover of amoxicillin suspension prescribed to children, due to discrepancies between physician-prescribed and pharmacy-dispensed amounts. We performed a retrospective cohort study including amoxicillin suspension dispensations for patients aged 0-12 years between 2017 and 2019 utilizing the Dutch PHARMO database. Leftover amount of amoxicillin was estimated by assessing the discrepancy between the prescribed and dispensed amounts. Extrapolated amoxicillin weight and economic spillage estimates for the Netherlands were determined. The impact of two theoretical interventions on leftover amount was assessed: (1) introducing vials with half the volume of the current 100 and 30 mL vials and (2) a combination of the first intervention with a maximum of 10% round-down by the dispensing pharmacy of the prescribed dose. We included 79 512 amoxicillin suspension dispensations for 62 252 patients. The mean leftover amount of amoxicillin suspension per dispensing was 27%. The yearly amount of amoxicillin leftover was 49.8 kg in the study cohort, equivalent to yearly 633 kg and €621 000 when extrapolated to the Netherlands. Employing the first theoretical intervention reduced the mean leftover per dispensing to 20%, reducing the yearly leftover to 31.6 kg amoxicillin in the study cohort, and to 400 kg and €400 000 extrapolated. The second theoretical intervention further reduced leftover to 17%, reducing the yearly leftover to 24.3 kg amoxicillin in the study cohort, and to 300 kg and €300 000 extrapolated. Approximately a quarter of amoxicillin suspension remains as leftover per dispensing. Applying different theoretical intervention shows the potential for a significant reduction of amoxicillin leftover. 
39477340	Antibiotic prescribing practices according to the AWaRe classification among children under 5 of age attending public primary care centres in four West African countries: a cross-sectional study (AIRE project, 2021-2022).	To describe antibiotic prescribing practices using the WHO AWaRe ( Cross-sectional study. The AIRE project implemented the systematic use of pulse oximetry into integrated management of childhood illness consultations in West African countries (Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali and Niger). We described antibiotic prescriptions for outpatient children at 16 PHCs and for severe cases referred at district hospitals. Between 14 June 2021 and 19 June 2022, 15 854 outpatients were included: 968 neonates and young infants (0-28 days) and 14 886 children (2-59 months). Among them, 78 (8.1%) neonates and young infants and 385 (2.6%) children were hospitalised. We evaluated 58 hospitalised neonates and young infants and 275 hospitalised children, respectively. Frequency of antibiotic prescriptions according to the AWaRe classification recommended by WHO. At the PHC level, proportions of neonates and young infants with ≥1 antibiotic prescription were 83%, 62%, 71% and 59% in Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali and Niger, respectively.

35900460	Profiles of sugar fermenting bacteria of the oral cavity among children with dental caries attending stomatology services at Ruhengeri referral hospital in Musanze District, Northern Rwanda.	Dental caries remains a public health threat of concern among children. About 2.3 billion people are affected by dental caries, of which 530 million are children globally. This study was carried out to identify sugar fermenting bacteria in the oral cavity and their antibiotic susceptibility pattern, assess the association with sugar fermenter bacteria and dental caries and evaluate dental caries outcomes among children. This was a cross-sectional study conducted between October 2021 and February 2022 at Ruhengeri Referral Hospital. About 136 oral swab samples were collected from children with and without dental caries at 1:1 ratio. The samples were put in Stuart sterile container and transported to INES-clinical microbiology laboratory for microbial identification. Logistic regression analysis of demographic characteristics was performed to study the relationship between demographic variables and dental caries. Chi-square test was performed for the association between variables. About 67.6% were male, while children of age 7-9 years (64.7%) dominated the age groups. Lactobacilli spp (15.29%) and Streptococcus mutans (12.94%) were the most predominant microorganisms observed in the oral cavity among children with dental caries. The S. mutans (x Sugar consumption favours the growth of sugar fermenter bacteria that cause dental caries among children. Dental caries is associated with adverse oral health outcomes among children. Oral health education is recommended for children. Parents are advised to reduce the consumption of sugary food for their children for oral health safety. 
39261762	Antimicrobial resistance profile and associated factors of hospital-acquired gram-negative bacterial pathogens among hospitalized patients in northeast Ethiopia.	Antimicrobial resistance is a major global public health issue. Infections caused by resistant species are associated with higher mortality rates, longer hospital stays, medication failure, and rising medical costs. The World Health Organisation has declared multidrug resistance-associated infections as an epidemic of public health concern. This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance profile and associated factors of hospital-acquired Gram-negative bacterial pathogens among hospitalized patients in Northeast Ethiopia. A health facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among hospitalized patients from March 2021 to February 2022. About 810 clinical specimens were collected, transported, and processed from admitted patients following the standard bacteriological procedures. The clinical samples were inoculated onto blood agar, MacConkey agar, and chocolate agar. Furthermore, the species identification was done using gram reactions, colony morphology, and color and biochemical tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, and carbapenemase production were performed as per the clinical laboratory standard institute guidelines. For analysis, the information was entered into Epi-data and exported to SPSS. A P value of < 0.05 with a 95% confidence interval was considered as a statistically significant association. Out of 810 clinical specimens, 285/810 (35.2%) developed bacterial infections. From the isolated bacteria, E. coli was the predominant bacteria accounting for 78/285 (27.4%) followed by K. pneumoniae, 69/285(24.42%), whereas P. vulgaris accounted for the least, 7/285 (2.5%). Overall, 132/285 (46.3%) and 99/285 (34.7%) of culture-positive patients were infected by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and carbapenemase-producing bacteria. The overall multidrug resistance rate of the isolated bacteria was 89.4%. The highest antibiotic resistance rates were detected for doxycycline (92.9%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (83.9%), and ampicillin (93%). The least antibiotic resistance rate was observed for meropenem at 41.1% and amikacin at 1.7%, respectively. In the study area, significant health concerns include a range of hospital-acquired bacterial infections associated with elevated rates of multidrug resistance, Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), and carbapenemase-producing bacterial pathogens. Consequently, it is recommended to conduct drug-susceptibility testing of isolates and molecular detection at a national level to optimize antibiotic usage for treating prevalent bacterial infections in this area. 
38903630	Predictors of time to recovery from uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition among children in eastern Ethiopia.	Managing severe acute malnutrition (SAM) involves an outpatient therapeutic program (OTP), targeting more than 80% of SAM children where the quality of primary healthcare remains poor. Treatment success and recovery from SAM remain poor and could be affected by many factors, where such evidence is limited in East Hararghe. This study assessed the predictors of time to recovery from SAM in eastern Ethiopia. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 402 records of SAM children under 5 years of age enrolled on OTP at 12 health posts retrieved from 2020 to 2021. We used the Kaplan-Meir estimate along with the  A total of 402 records were reviewed, and the cure rate from SAM was 89.6% [95% confidence interval (CI), 87-93]. Moreover, a death rate of 0.7%, a default rate of 9.5%, and a non-responder rate of 0.2% were obtained with a median length of stay of 7 weeks. The median time to recovery was significantly shorter for children from shorter distances from OTP sites with edema, amoxicillin, ( Recovery from SAM was found to be acceptable in comparison with the Sphere Standards and is predicted by edema, diarrhea, distance from the OTP site, amoxicillin, and RUTF adequacy. These allow for focused interventions that address the identified factors for better recovery from SAM. 
39342399	Appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing among patients treated for dental diseases in Mekelle city, Northern Ethiopia: a cross sectional study.	Local operative treatments are generally preferred for most dental diseases, with antibiotics only recommended as an adjunct in specific cases. Misuse and overuse of antibiotics has been shown to significantly contribute to the development of resistant bacteria. However, the antibiotic prescribing practices of dentists in Ethiopia have not been thoroughly studied. This study aimed to assess the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing for patients with dental diseases at dental clinics in Mekelle City, Northern Ethiopia. A cross sectional study was conducted in April and May 2020 among patients visiting dental clinics in Mekelle City. Data were collected through patient medical record reviews and dentist interviews. The appropriateness of antibiotic prescription was evaluated based on guidelines from the American Dental Association and the European Society of Endodontology. Data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics, version 29. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed, and the results were presented as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Two hundred and thirty-one patients with dental diseases participated in the study. The mean age was 30.6 years with a standard deviation of 16.1. Most participants had dental pulp related disease. 89% of patients were prescribed antibiotics, with amoxicillin being the most common. Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing was identified in 175 (75.8%) of the study participants. The most common inappropriate prescribing was unnecessary antibiotic prescribing for dental conditions without systemic signs, assessed in 141 (80.1%) participants. Patients diagnosed with pulp related disease without systemic signs and those who had tooth extractions were significantly associated with inappropriate antibiotic prescription (p value < 0.001). The study findings show that antibiotics are over-prescribed for dental conditions in this resource constrained setting, especially in patients who have had tooth extractions. Dentists need training on appropriate antibiotic use and antimicrobial stewardship interventions should be implemented in dental setting to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions and prevent antibiotic resistance development. 
38801992	Evaluation of glomerular hemodynamic changes by sodium-glucose-transporter 2 inhibition in type 2 diabetic rats using in vivo imaging.	The mechanisms responsible for glomerular hemodynamic regulation with sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in kidney disease due to type 2 diabetes remain unclear. Therefore, we investigated changes in glomerular hemodynamic function using an animal model of type 2 diabetes, treated with an SGLT2 inhibitor alone or in combination with a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor using male Zucker lean (ZL) and Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Afferent and efferent arteriolar diameter and single-nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) were evaluated in ZDF rats measured at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after the administration of a SGLT2 inhibitor (luseogliflozin). Additionally, we assessed these changes under the administration of the adenosine A1 receptor (A1aR) antagonist (8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine), along with coadministration of luseogliflozin and an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), telmisartan. ZDF rats had significantly increased SNGFR, and afferent and efferent arteriolar diameters compared to ZL rats, indicating glomerular hyperfiltration. Administration of luseogliflozin significantly reduced afferent vasodilatation and glomerular hyperfiltration, with no impact on efferent arteriolar diameter. Urinary adenosine levels were increased significantly in the SGLT2 inhibitor group compared to the vehicle group. A1aR antagonism blocked the effect of luseogliflozin on kidney function. Co-administration of the SGLT2 inhibitor and ARB decreased the abnormal expansion of glomerular afferent arterioles, whereas the efferent arteriolar diameter was not affected. Thus, regulation of afferent arteriolar vascular tone via the A1aR pathway is associated with glomerular hyperfiltration in type 2 diabetic kidney disease. 
39252036	"I don't need my kid to be high": prioritizing harm reduction when using cannabis during pregnancy.	Cannabis is the most common illicit substance used in pregnancy. As use continues to increase, understanding peoples' behaviors surrounding cannabis use during pregnancy is needed to improve maternal and child health outcomes. The aim of this study was to better understand pregnant individuals' perceptions and knowledge of cannabis use and use patterns as well as the social and environmental factors that may influence their use. We conducted interviews with 19 participants between December 2022 and March 2023. Individuals self-identified as BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color), were over 21 years of age, spoke English or Spanish, resided in California, and had used cannabis during pregnancy in the last 0-2 years. Using qualitative, constructivist grounded theory methods, we analyzed the contexts that contributed to participants' lived experiences surrounding cannabis use behaviors during pregnancy. Participants reported making conscious decisions to responsibly manage their cannabis use during pregnancy to minimize potential harm to the fetus. Participants prioritized making what they perceived to be safer adjustments to their use of cannabis: (1) changing the amount of cannabis used, (2) changing the types of cannabis products used, and (3) changing sources of cannabis procurement. Our findings show that pregnant individuals are seeking information about safe cannabis use beyond medical supervision and are open to altering their cannabis consumption patterns. However, they are unable to find trustworthy and evidence-based harm reduction practices which can be implemented to mitigate harm to their unborn children. A harm reduction approach is needed in the field of maternal cannabis use to promote positive maternal and fetal health outcomes. More data is needed on comprehensive harm reduction approaches to cannabis use during pregnancy. This requires implementation of education on these topics in healthcare settings presented by prenatal care clinicians. 
39098600	Piloting Home Produce Delivery to Improve Food Security, Budget, and Diet in Families with Children: A Mixed-Methods Study.	Few children in food insecure (FI) households meet dietary recommendations for fruit and vegetables ("produce"). Barriers include affordability, accessibility, and desirability. Home produce delivery may reduce FI, increase produce consumption, and decrease budget tradeoffs. Evaluate the acceptability and potential impact of delivering produce through home visiting programs on FI, diet, and budget tradeoffs. In this prospective pre/post mixed methods study, 51 parents engaged in home visiting programs were enrolled. Participants completed pre- and post-program surveys on FI (18-item Food Security Scale), produce consumption, and budget tradeoffs. Pre- and post-surveys were compared using McNemar's test and weighted kappas. Interview guides were based on Social Cognitive Theory and a previously published framework. Interviews were conducted in English or Spanish; thematic analysis was completed. Twenty-nine (56.9%) participants completed both surveys. Most were female (96.3%) and Hispanic (79.3%) (Table 1). Food security improved in the post-period, with more participants reporting high food security (pre: 6.9%, post: 31.0%) and fewer reporting very low food security (pre: 20.7%, post: 6.9%, p<0.01) (Table 2). Budgetary tradeoffs decreased in the post-program period (pre: 71.4%, post: 48.1%, p=0.03). Fifteen participants were interviewed. Themes included 1) saved money, 2) increased fruit and vegetable consumption, and 3) interest in future participation. This pilot study found that an intervention for delivery of produce through home visiting programs was acceptable to participants and resulted in potential improvements in FI and household budgets. This supports future studies to further explore the impact of this novel intervention. In this prospective mixed-methods pilot, home delivered produce was acceptable and feasible with potentially improved food security and household budgets; evidence of potential change in produce consumption was mixed. Changes in budget tradeoffs is a novel outcome in food programs. 
38591640	Antibiotics for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in children with neurodisability: Systematic review.	Determine the optimal antibiotic choice for lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in children with neurodisability. Embase, Ovid Emcare and MEDLINE were searched for studies from inception to January 2023. All studies, except case reports, focusing on the antibiotic treatment of LRTI in children, with neurodisabilities were included. Outcomes included length of stay, intensive care admission and mortality. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria (5115 patients). All the studies were of low quality. The shortest length of stay was with anaerobic and gram-positive cover. Five studies used anaerobic, gram-positive and gram-negative cover (e.g., amoxicillin-clavulanic acid), which was frequently adequate. In one large study, it was better than gram-positive and gram-negative cover alone (e.g. ceftriaxone). Those unresponsive or more unwell at presentation improved faster on Pseudomonas aeruginosa cover (e.g., piperacillin-tazobactam). In this context, anaerobic, gram-positive and gram-negative cover is just as effective as P. aeruginosa cover, supporting empiric treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. If there is a failure to improve, broadening to include P. aeruginosa could be considered. This is consistent with a consensus statement on the treatment of LRTI in children with neurodisability. An accepted definition for what constitutes LRTI in this cohort is required before designing prospective randomised trials.
