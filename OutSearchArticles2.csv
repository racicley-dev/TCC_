0,1,"Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) persistence is suboptimal in the United States. In the Deep South, a region with high rates of new HIV diagnosis, patterns of PrEP discontinuation remain unexplored. We evaluated data from a clinic-based PrEP program in Jackson, Mississippi and included patients initiating PrEP between August 2018 and April 2021. We considered patients to have a gap in PrEP coverage if they had at least 30 days without an active PrEP prescription; those who restarted PrEP after 30 days were classified as 'stopped and restarted' and those who never obtained a new PrEP prescription were classified as 'stopped and did not restart'. Patients without a gap in coverage were considered 'continuously on PrEP'. We estimated median time to first PrEP discontinuation and examined factors associated with time to first PrEP discontinuation. Of 171 patients who received an initial 90-day PrEP prescription; 75% were assigned male at birth and 74% identified as Black. The median time to first discontinuation was 90 days (95% CI 90-114). Twenty-two percent were continuously on PrEP, 28% stopped and restarted (median time off PrEP = 102 days), and 50% stopped and did not restart. Associations with early PrEP stoppage were notable for patients assigned sex female vs male (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.6, 95% CI 1.0-2.5) and those living over 25 miles from clinic vs. 0-10 miles (aHR 1.89, 95% CI 1.2-3.0). Most patients never refilled an initial PrEP prescription though many patients re-started PrEP. Interventions to improve persistence and facilitate re-starts are needed.

1,2,"We conducted a records-based cohort study of patients who initiated pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) at a large federally qualified health center in Los Angeles, CA to characterize patterns of PrEP use, identify correlates of PrEP discontinuation, and calculate HIV incidence. Of 3121 individuals initiating PrEP between 2014 and 2017, 42% (n = 1314) were active (i.e., had a current PrEP prescription) in April 2018. HIV incidence was 0.1/100 person-years among active PrEP patients, compared to 2.1/100 person-years among patients who discontinued. Compared to patients accessing PrEP through government programs with no prescription copay, risk of discontinuation was higher among those with private insurance (ARR = 1.4, 95% CI 1.2, 1.7), or no insurance (ARR = 4.5, 95% CI 3.2, 6.4). Sixty-three percent of active PrEP patients had gaps between PrEP prescriptions, averaging one gap per year (median length = 65 days). Increasing access to free or low-cost PrEP can improve PrEP continuity. Llevamos a cabo un estudio de cohorte basada en registros de pacientes quienes iniciaron profilaxis preexposición (PrEP) en un centro de salud grande y federalmente calificado en Los Ángeles, CA para caracterizar patrones del uso de PrEP, identificar correlaciones de la discontinuación de PrEP y calcular la incidencia de VIH. De los 3,121 individuos quienes iniciaron PrEP entre los años 2014–2017, 42% (n=1,314) fueron activos (i.e. actualmente tenían una receta para PrEP ",0.21996473043217601,10.1097/QAI.0000000000002403
2,3,"HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective method of reducing HIV incidence. Questions remain regarding PrEP's efficacy and outcomes in real-world clinical settings. We conducted a retrospective review to assess PrEP outcomes in an academic clinic setting and focused on retention in care, reasons for discontinuation, and receipt of appropriate preventive care (immunizations, HIV testing, and STI testing). One hundred thirty-four patients were seen between 2010 and 2016 over 309 visits. One hundred sixteen patients (87%) started daily PrEP and of those, 88 (76%) attended at least one 6-month follow-up visit. Over 60% of PrEP patients completed all recommended STI screening after starting PrEP. Only 40% of patients had all appropriate immunizations at baseline; 78% had all appropriate immunizations at study completion. This study demonstrated high rates of both retention and of attaining recommended preventive care in a clinical setting outside of the rigors of clinical trials.

3,4,"Optimal adherence to oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention involves aligning consistent PrEP use with periods of risk to achieve prevention-effective adherence. Prevention-effective adherence is predicated on individuals discontinuing PrEP during periods without expected risk. For stable, serodiscordant couples, antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence by the HIV-positive partner markedly decreases HIV transmission risk, potentially obviating the need for continued PrEP use; yet little is known about actual lived experiences of discontinuing PrEP. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with HIV-uninfected PrEP users in serodiscordant couples taking part in the Partners Demonstration Project at IDI-Kasangati, Kampala, Uganda. Open-ended interviews elicited information on the partnered relationship; understandings of PrEP; prevention strategies; and experiences of PrEP discontinuation. An inductive, thematic, content-analytic approach was used to analyze study data. Uninfected partners experienced PrEP as a valued resource for preventing HIV acquisition. Despite ongoing ART use by HIV-positive partners for a period of time consistent with viral suppression, discontinuation of PrEP was experienced as a loss of protection and a corresponding increase in risk of HIV acquisition. Uninfected partners responded with strategies aimed at offsetting this subjective sense of increased risk, specifically: (1) changing sexual practices; (2) prioritizing fidelity in the relationship; (3) increasing reliance on condoms; and (4) seeking evidence of partners' ART adherence. These experiences highlight the challenges PrEP users in serodiscordant couples face in discontinuing PrEP for prevention-effective adherence. Flexible interventions that support individuals during this transition may increase comfort with discontinuing PrEP when alternative prevention strategies provide protection, such as a partner's consistent adherence to ART.

4,5,"Despite the efficacy of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), retention in care in the United States remains suboptimal. The goal of this study was to explore factors that lead to suboptimal retention in PrEP care for men who have sex with men (MSM) in real-world clinical settings in the United States. Trained interviewers conducted semi-structured interviews with MSM (N = 49) from three clinics who had been engaged in PrEP care in the Midwest (n = 15), South (n = 15), and Northeast (n = 19) geographic regions and had experienced a lapse in PrEP use. Factors that emerged as related to suboptimal retention in PrEP care included structural factors such as transportation and out-of-pocket costs; social factors such as misinformation on media and in personal networks; clinical factors such as frequency and timing of appointments; and behavioral factors such as changes in sexual behavior and low perceived risk for HIV. Participants suggested reducing the out-of-pocket costs of medications and lab visits, having flexible appointment times, culturally responsive services, and comprehensive patient navigation to help retention in care. These findings leveraged real-world experiences and opinions of patients to inform gaps in current services and how to make changes to optimize PrEP care.

5,6,"PrEP persistence, or PrEP use over time, has been shown to be short, with most PrEP users stopping within 6-12 months. Furthermore, those most vulnerable to HIV often use PrEP for shorter periods. This qualitative study explores patient, provider, and contextual factors that influence PrEP persistence. In interviews with 25 PrEP users and 18 PrEP providers in San Francisco's safety net clinics, we analyze the perceived benefits and difficulties of taking PrEP, including structural barriers. We identify different steps in receipt of PrEP care (clinic visits and lab tests, pharmacy interactions, and medication adherence), and describe barriers and facilitators for providers and patients at each step. Our findings suggest that drop-in visits, streamlined testing, standing orders for labs, and 90-day PrEP prescriptions are highly desirable for many PrEP users. Also important are the proactive provision of adherence support and counseling, and referrals for housing, substance use, and mental health services. Se ha demostrado que la persistencia de PrEP, o el uso de PrEP a lo largo del tiempo, es corto, y la mayoría de los usuarios de PrEP lo deja de tomar dentro de 6-12 meses. Además, muchas veces las personas más vulnerables al VIH usan PrEP por períodos más cortos. Este estudio cualitativo explora pacientes, proveedores y factores contextuales que influyen en la persistencia de PrEP. En entrevistas con 25 usuarios de PrEP y 18 proveedores de PrEP en las clínicas de redes de seguridad de San Francisco, analizamos los beneficios y las dificultades percibidos de tomar PrEP, incluidas las barreras estructurales. Identificamos diferentes pasos en la recepción de la atención de PrEP (visitas a clínicas y pruebas de laboratorio, interacciones de farmacia y adherencia a medicamentos) y describimos las barreras y facilitadores para proveedores y pacientes en cada paso. Nuestros hallazgos sugieren que las visitas directas, las pruebas simplificadas, las órdenes permanentes para los laboratorios y las recetas de PrEP de 90 días son muy deseables para muchos usuarios de PrEP. También es importante la provisión proactiva de apoyo y asesoramiento de adherencia, y referencias para vivienda, uso de sustancias y servicios de salud mental. ",0.2654075154754576,
