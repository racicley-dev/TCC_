0,0,0,37490085,"The large overlap between symptoms of acute sinusitis and viral upper respiratory tract infection suggests that certain subgroups of children being diagnosed with acute sinusitis, and subsequently treated with antibiotics, derive little benefit from antibiotic use. To assess if antibiotic therapy could be appropriately withheld in prespecified subgroups. Randomized clinical trial including 515 children aged 2 to 11 years diagnosed with acute sinusitis based on clinical criteria. The trial was conducted between February 2016 and April 2022 at primary care offices affiliated with 6 US institutions and was designed to evaluate whether symptom burden differed in subgroups defined by nasopharyngeal Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis on bacterial culture and by the presence of colored nasal discharge. Oral amoxicillin (90 mg/kg/d) and clavulanate (6.4 mg/kg/d) (n = 254) or placebo (n = 256) for 10 days. The primary outcome was symptom burden based on daily symptom scores on a validated scale (range, 0-40) during the 10 days after diagnosis. Secondary outcomes included treatment failure, adverse events including clinically significant diarrhea, and resource use by families. Most of the 510 included children were aged 2 to 5 years (64%), male (54%), White (52%), and not Hispanic (89%). The mean symptom scores were significantly lower in children in the amoxicillin and clavulanate group (9.04 [95% CI, 8.71 to 9.37]) compared with those in the placebo group (10.60 [95% CI, 10.27 to 10.93]) (between-group difference, -1.69 [95% CI, -2.07 to -1.31]). The length of time to symptom resolution was significantly lower for children in the antibiotic group (7.0 days) than in the placebo group (9.0 days) (P = .003). Children without nasopharyngeal pathogens detected did not benefit from antibiotic treatment as much as those with pathogens detected; the between-group difference in mean symptom scores was -0.88 (95% CI, -1.63 to -0.12) in those without pathogens detected compared with -1.95 (95% CI, -2.40 to -1.51) in those with pathogens detected. Efficacy did not differ significantly according to whether colored nasal discharge was present (the between-group difference was -1.62 [95% CI, -2.09 to -1.16] for colored nasal discharge vs -1.70 [95% CI, -2.38 to -1.03] for clear nasal discharge; P = .52 for the interaction between treatment group and the presence of colored nasal discharge). In children with acute sinusitis, antibiotic treatment had minimal benefit for those without nasopharyngeal bacterial pathogens on presentation, and its effects did not depend on the color of nasal discharge. Testing for specific bacteria on presentation may represent a strategy to reduce antibiotic use in this condition. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02554383.

1,1,1,14726904,"Treatment guidelines developed by the Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) were originally published in 2000. These guidelines were designed to: (1) educate clinicians and patients (or patients’ families) about the differences between viral and bacterial rhinosinusitis; (2) reduce the use of antibiotics for nonbacterial nasal/sinus disease; (3) provide recommendations for the diagnosis and optimal treatment of ABRS; (4) promote the use of appropriate antibiotic therapy when bacterial infection is likely; and (5) describe the current understanding of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics and how they relate to the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy. The original guidelines are updated here to include the most recent information on management principles, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, and therapeutic options. An estimated 20 million cases of ABRS occur annually in the United States. According to National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) data, sinusitis is the fifth most common diagnosis for which an antibiotic is prescribed. Sinusitis accounted for 9% and 21% of all pediatric and adult antibiotic prescriptions, respectively, written in 2002. The primary diagnosis of sinusitis results in expenditures of approximately $3.5 billion per year in the United States. ABRS is most often preceded by a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI). Allergy, trauma, dental infection, or other factors that lead to inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses may also predispose individuals to developing ABRS. Patients with a “common cold” (viral URI) usually report some combination of the following symptoms: sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, hyposmia/anosmia, facial pressure, postnasal drip, sore throat, cough, ear fullness, fever, and myalgia. A change in the color or the characteristic of the nasal discharge is not a specific sign of a bacterial infection. Bacterial superinfection may occur at any time during the course of a viral URI. The risk that bacterial superinfection has occurred is greater if the illness is still present after 10 days. Because there may be cases that fall out of the “norm” of this typical progression, practicing clinicians need to rely on their clinical judgment when using these guidelines. In general, however, a diagnosis of ABRS may be made in adults or children with symptoms of a viral URI that have not improved after 10 days or worsen after 5 to 7 days. There may be some or all of the following signs and symptoms: nasal drainage, nasal congestion, facial pressure/pain (especially when unilateral and focused in the region of a particular sinus), postnasal drainage, hyposmia/anosmia, fever, cough, fatigue, maxillary dental pain, and ear pressure/fullness. Physical examination provides limited information in the diagnosis of ABRS. While sometimes helpful, plain film radiographs, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging scans are not necessary for cases of ABRS. The most common bacterial species isolated from the maxillary sinuses of patients with ABRS are  The increasing prevalence of penicillin nonsusceptibility and resistance to other drug classes among  These guidelines apply to both adults and children. When selecting antibiotic therapy for ABRS, the clinician should consider the severity of the disease, the rate of progression of the disease, and recent antibiotic exposure. The guidelines now divide patients with ABRS into two general categories: (1) those with mild symptoms who have not received antibiotics within the past 4 to 6 weeks, and (2) those with mild disease who have received antibiotics within the past 4 to 6 weeks or those with moderate disease regardless of recent antibiotic exposure. The difference in severity of disease does not imply infection with a resistant pathogen. Rather, this terminology indicates the relative degree of acceptance of possible treatment failure and the likelihood of spontaneous resolution of symptoms—patients with more severe symptoms are less likely to resolve their disease spontaneously. The primary goal of antibiotic therapy is to eradicate bacteria from the site of infection, which, in turn, helps (1) return the sinuses back to health; (2) decrease the duration of symptoms to allow patients to resume daily activities more quickly; (3) prevent severe complications such as meningitis and brain abscess; and (4) decrease the development of chronic disease. Severe or life-threatening infections with or without complications are rare, and are not addressed in these guidelines. Prior antibiotic use is a major risk factor associated with the development of infection with antimicrobial-resistant strains. Because recent antimicrobial exposure increases the risk of carriage of and infection due to resistant organisms, antimicrobial therapy should be based upon the patient’s history of recent antibiotic use. The panel’s guidelines, therefore, stratify patients according to antibiotic exposure in the previous 4 to 6 weeks. Lack of response to therapy at ≥72 hours is an arbitrary time established to define treatment failures. Clinicians should monitor the response to antibiotic therapy, which may include instructing the patient to call the office or clinic if symptoms persist or worsen over the next few days. The predicted bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of antibiotics in adults and children has been determined according to mathematical modeling of ABRS developed by Michael Poole, MD, PhD, based on pathogen distribution, resolution rates without treatment, and in vitro microbiologic activity. Antibiotics can be placed into the following relative rank order of predicted clinical efficacy for adults: 90% to 92% = respiratory fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), ceftriaxone, high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (4 g/250 mg/day), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (1.75 g/250 mg/day); 83% to 88% = high-dose amoxicillin (4 g/day), amoxicillin (1.5 g/day), cefpodoxime proxetil, cefixime (based on  ",Antimicrobial treatment guidelines for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis,"Anon JB, Jacobs MR, Poole MD, Ambrose PG, Benninger MS, Hadley JA, Craig WA; Sinus And Allergy Health Partnership.",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2004 Jan;130(1 Suppl):1-45. doi: 10.1016/j.otohns.2003.12.003.,Anon JB,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,2004,2004/01/17,PMC7118847,,10.1016/j.otohns.2003.12.003
2,2,2,35884010,"The aim of the current study is to observe how different pediatric drugs and tooth brushing affect the color stability of different esthetic restorative materials. Three restorative materials (composite, compomer, and glass ionomer cement (GIC)) were each used to produce 72 specimens (10 mm × 2 mm). The specimens were divided into six groups and immersed in distilled water and five different pediatric drugs (amoxicillin, ibuprofen, ventolin, paracetamol, and multivitamins). Each group was divided into two subgroups (brushed and non-brushed). Over the course of two weeks, the specimens were agitated for one minute every eight hours. Color changes in all the specimens were evaluated using a spectrophotometer at 1 and 2 weeks. GIC showed a change in color that was significantly greater than that in all the other materials in each solution, except for those in amoxicillin. After a period of 1 to 2 weeks, the most noticeable change in color was detected in the amoxicillin composite and amoxicillin GIC unbrushed groups, and after 2 weeks, a significant difference was found in the ventolin GIC unbrushed group. The color stability of the restorative materials used in pediatric dentistry can be influenced by using popular liquid pediatric medications. GIC was the least color-stable material when subjected to liquid medications.

The present in vitro study evaluated the effects of commonly used pediatric medications on the color stability of a conventional and a bulk-fill composite resin. For this study, 80 disc-shaped specimens of each composite were prepared in molds with a diameter of 6 mm and thicknesses of 2 or 4 mm (n = 40 per thickness per material). A spectrophotometer was used to evaluate the baseline color of the specimens in the International Commission on Illumination L*a*b* color space. Each specimen was immersed separately in a container holding 1 of 8 liquid medications (n = 5 per thickness per medication): amoxicillin/clavulanate, clarithromycin, cephalexin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, levetiracetam, multivitamin, or albuterol. After the container was shaken for 2 minutes, the specimen was removed from the medication and stored in artificial saliva. The cycle was repeated every 8 hours for 1 week. The color measurements were repeated after 1 week of immersion cycles, and the overall color change (ΔE*) was calculated; a value of ΔE* > 3.3 was considered clinically perceptible. The data were analyzed with 1-way and 2-way analyses of variance as well as the Levene test and Games-Howell post hoc test (P < 0.05). All specimens displayed clinically perceptible color changes after exposure to medications commonly used by children. The mean color change in the 4-mm bulk-fill composite resin group was significantly greater than that in all other groups (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in color change based on the immersion drug for either of the composites (P > 0.05).

We investigated how prenatal environmental factors (chronic stress, bisphenol A (BPA), amoxicillin, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) affect AMELX and AMBN production of ameloblasts. Fifteen pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four experimental groups and a control group. Chronic-stress group rats were exposed to a 12:12 light/light cycle (LL) from day E18 until delivery. BPA group rats were orally administered 5 μg/kg BPA daily from day E1 until delivery. Amoxicillin group rats were injected 100 mg/kg amoxicillin daily from day E18 until delivery. LPS-infection group rats were injected 125 μg/kg bacterial LPS once on day E18. Seven pups from the control group and ten pups from the experimental groups were euthanized on P10. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Gomori's one-step trichrome staining (GT) and incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to AMELX and AMBN, to evaluate staining intensity at ameloblast stages.

6,6,6,27147292,"♦ OBJECTIVES: Assess the stability of several antibiotics in peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions under common conditions of use in pediatrics, particularly in automated PD. ♦ METHODS: Amoxicillin, cefazolin, cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, cotrimoxazole, tobramycin, vancomycin, and the association of ceftazidime + vancomycin and ceftazidime + tobramycin, were tested in 3 different PD solutions: bicarbonate/lactate solution with 2 glucose concentrations (Physioneal 1.36 and 3.86%; Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, USA) and an icodextrin-containing solution (Extraneal; Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, USA). Concentrations were those recommended in guidelines for the treatment of peritonitis in pediatrics. Physioneal bags were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours, whereas Extraneal bags were stored 12 hours at room temperature (22 ± 2°C) and then 12 hours at 37°C. Drug concentrations were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Each measure was taken in triplicate. Stability of antibiotics was defined as less than 10% degradation of the drug over time. ♦ RESULTS: Cefazolin, cotrimoxazole, tobramycin, and vancomycin were stable under studied conditions. Ceftazidime was stable 24 hours in icodextrin, 12 hours in Physioneal 1.36% and 6 hours in Physioneal 3.86%. The association of tobramycin or vancomycin did not influence the stability of ceftazidime. Cefepime and amoxicillin were stable 6 h, 4 h, and 8 h in Physioneal 1.36%, 3.86% and Extraneal, respectively. The stability of imipenem was very low: 2 h in Physioneal and 6 h in Extraneal. Moreover, an increasingly yellow coloration was observed with the use of imipenem, whereas no color change or precipitation occurred in other bags. ♦ CONCLUSION: Cefazolin, tobramycin, cotrimoxazole, and vancomycin are stable in PD solutions up to 24 hours and can be administered in the PD bag for the treatment of peritonitis, even in automated PD under studied conditions. However, amoxicillin, cefepime, ceftazidime, and imipenem must be used with caution due to their lack of stability.

10,10,10,12728112,"Otitis media is 1 of the most frequent diseases of early infancy and childhood and 1 of the most common reasons for children to visit a physician. In the past 2 decades, there has been a substantial increase in the diagnosis of otitis media worldwide. In the United States, 93% of all children have had at least 1 episode of acute otitis media (AOM) by 7 years of age. Otalgia is the hallmark of AOM. Most affected children either complain of earache or manifest behavior that the parents interpret as indicating ear pain. Treatment of the ear pain early in the course of AOM decreases both parental anxiety and the child's discomfort and accelerates the healing process. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and tolerability of naturopathic versus traditional treatment for the management of otalgia commonly associated with AOM in children. The study was designed as a double-blind trial in an outpatient community clinic. A total of 171 children who were aged 5 to 18 years and had otalgia and clinical findings associated with middle-ear infection were studied. The children were randomly assigned to receive treatment with Naturopathic Herbal Extract Ear Drops (NHED) or anesthetic ear drops, with or without amoxicillin. On enrollment, the children were assigned by computer-numbered randomization to receive NHED (contents: allium sativum, verbascum thapsus, calendula flores, hypericum perfoliatum, lavender, and vitamin E in olive oil) 5 drops 3 times daily, alone (group A) or together with a topical anesthetic (amethocaine and phenazone in glycerin) 5 drops 3 times daily (group B), or oral amoxicillin 80 mg/kg/d (maximum 500 mg/dose) divided into 3 doses with either NHED 5 drops 3 times daily (group C) or topical anesthetic 5 drops 3 times daily (group D). A double-blind design was used, and all ear drops were placed in identical bottles. Treatment was initiated by the nurse in all cases. A single physician (M.S.) evaluated and treated all of the patients included in the study and recorded all of the data. The presence or absence of ear pain was assessed over 3 days with a visual analog scale. Ear pain was assessed by a specially devised observational instrument based on previous reports. One side of the instrument consisted of a linear numbered scale, from 1 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), and a corresponding color scale, ranging from blue to dark red. The reverse side contained a scale of 5 facial expressions, ranging from broad smile (no pain) to a sad and crying face (worst possible pain), and a corresponding color scale, ranging from blue to dark red. There were no significant between-group differences in patient age or gender, degree of fever, main symptoms, associated symptoms, and severity or laterality of acute otitis media. Each group had a statistically significant improvement in ear pain over the course of the 3 days. Patients who were given ear drops alone had a better response than patients who were given ear drops together with amoxicillin. Results were better in the NHED group than in the controls. Nevertheless, the findings indicated that the pain was mostly (80%) self-limited and could be explained simply by the time elapsed. The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines recommend topical medications as the first line of treatment for ear pain in the absence of systemic infection or serious underlying disease. Because no evidence was found that systemic antibiotics alone improved treatment outcome, if antibiotics do not change the natural course of otitis media, then the main goal of treatment, as in the present study, should be to alleviate the ear pain. The alternative, naturopathic herbal extract medications, may offer many new possibilities in the management of ear pain associated with AOM. Primary care physicians should be aware that at least 10% of their patients may have tried 1 or more forms of alternative/complementary medicine before presenting for consultation. As it was widely reported in the medical literature, these herb, these herbal extracts have the potential to meet all of the requirements of appropriate medication that could be routinely used in the pediatric patient, namely in vitro bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal activity against common pathogens, immunostimulation ability, antioxidant activity, and anti-inflammatory effects. They are also well-absorbed with good penetration into the tissue surrounding the tympanic membrane. They have been found to enhance local immunologic activity. Finally, herbal extracts are well-tolerated (owing to their long elimination time), easy to administer, and less expensive than the new antibiotics. There are no documented side effects. On the basis of our findings that the group with the most significant treatment effects (NHED with topical anesthetic) explained only 7.3% of the total pain reduction, we propose that sometimes the general practitioner or pediatrician needs to give the human body a chance to repair itself. Nevertheless, if the physician believes that there is an indication for some treatment, especially if the parents are anxious, then a local treatment such as one used in our study might be adequate. This study suggests that in cases of ear pain caused by AOM in children in which active treatment, besides a simple 2- to 3-day waiting period, is needed, an herbal extract solution may be beneficial. Concomitant antibiotic treatment is apparently not contributory.

Two hundred ten discs were prepared from polyacid-modified composite resin material and divided into two groups: flouride varnish was applied to one group and flouride varnish was not applied to the other group. The groups were further divided into seven subgroups and the samples were kept in artificial saliva, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, cefuroxime axetil, clarithromycin, paracetamol, ibuprofen, and iron supplement drug solutions. The colour change values of the discs were measured using a spectrophotometer device before immersion in the drug solutions and on the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th days after the immersion. The obtained data were calculated and statistically evaluated using IBM SPSS V23 software. It was found that the application of fluoride varnish in the iron supplement drug group prevented the colour change of the polyacid-modified composite resins for 28 days. In the amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, cefuroxime axetil, and paracetamol groups, the fluoride varnish did not prevent colour change in the polyacid-modified composite resin restorative materials at the end of the 14th day. It is thought that fluoride varnish application may be beneficial as a preservative in the colour change of polyacid-modified composite resins due to the use of various paediatric drugs, and this protective feature may be effective for a specific period of time.

12,12,12,8745021,"During a 13-month period ending in January, 1995, we obtained 159 samples of middle ear exudate through tympanocentesis (n = 155) or acute spontaneous otorrhea (n = 4) from 151 children enrolled in therapeutic trials of acute otitis media in a pediatric practice in Northern Virginia. Their ages ranged from < 1 to > 6 years of age (mean, 35 months; median, 22 months). Precise diagnostic criteria for acute otitis media always included bulging outward of all or part of the eardrum, opacification of the eardrum regardless of color and impaired mobility to positive and negative pressure via the pneumatic otoscope. Bacterial pathogens were isolated from middle ear fluid in 95% of these children: Streptococcus pneumoniae was recovered from 61 (37%); Haemophilus influenzae from 45 (27%); Moraxella catarrhalis from 41 (25%); Group A streptococcus from 6 (4%); Staphylococcus aureus from 4 (2%); and no growth or microbes of uncertain significance from 8 (5%). Six of the patients had mixed bacterial cultures; 2 of the 6 had at least one ampicillin-resistant bacteria, and a third had 2 ampicillin-resistant bacteria. Eight patients who failed to improve with antimicrobial treatment had a second tympanocentesis performed or developed spontaneous drainage; on that follow-up culture 3 of 8 cultures had different microorganisms; and 5 of the 8 bacterial specimens were resistant to ampicillin or penicillin. Twenty-one percent of the S. pneumoniae strains recovered from the middle ear were resistant to penicillin. Sixty-two percent of the H. influenzae and 98% of the M. catarrhalis isolates were resistant to ampicillin. Overall bacteria resistant to penicillin or ampicillin were recovered in 54% of middle ear fluid from 46 patients who had received a beta-lactam antibiotic in the preceding month as well as in 57% of middle ear fluids from 105 patients who had not. The empiric use of amoxicillin for treatment of acute otitis media should be reexamined in our community particularly in those who appear ill, have a high fever or have severe unremitting otalgia.

13,13,13,18447664,"Cefdinir is an extended-spectrum, third-generation cephalosporin that may be used for treatment of acute otitis media in patients allergic to penicillin. When administered with iron-containing products, including infant formulas, cefdinir or one of its metabolites may bind to ferric ions, forming a nonabsorbable complex that imparts a reddish color to the stool. We describe a 9-month-old infant with failure to thrive and acute otitis media who developed an erythematous maculopapular rash during treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate. His antibiotic therapy was changed to cefdinir. Five days into a 10-day course of therapy, the infant's mother brought him to the pediatric clinic and reported the appearance of red stools. He had no associated gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, abdominal pain, or diarrhea). His hematocrit and hemoglobin level were normal, and Clostridium difficile antigen studies and tests for species of Shigella, Salmonella, and Camphylobacter as well as ova and parasites were all negative. Cefdinir was discontinued, and his stools returned to normal within 48 hours. Three weeks later, he again received cefdinir for recurrent otitis media. Red stools reappeared 48 hours later, were determined to be guaiac negative, and resolved within hours of drug discontinuation. During both occurrences of red stools, the infant had been breastfed and was receiving supplemental feedings with an iron-containing infant formula. In the product labeling of cefdinir, this adverse event is described as a consequence of the drug-drug interaction; however, it is not listed in the adverse drug reaction section of the labeling. As such, one may miss the association between cefdinir and reddish stools when investigating this event as a potential adverse reaction to cefdinir. When using the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale to assess causality in our patient's case, this adverse drug reaction was determined as highly probable. As this infant had been breastfed, the use of a supplemental iron-containing infant formula was not identified as a potential contributing factor until the second occurrence of red stools. Health care professionals should review the entire product labeling, including the drug-drug interaction section, when investigating a potential adverse drug reaction. With the recent approval of generic formulations of cefdinir, clinicians should be aware of this drug-drug interaction with iron-containing products to prevent unnecessary alarm by parents and caregivers, as well as costly medical evaluations for gastrointestinal bleeding.

14,14,14,19530341,"A 5-year-old boy was admitted to our center with a major complaint of bilateral hearing loss for 2 days. He was diagnosed with acute immune thrombocytopenic purpura 3 months before the admission and treated with high-dose methylprednisolone 2 months ago. Physical examination revealed wet purpura in the oral mucosa, serous nasal discharge, multiple petechiae and ecchymosis of the lower lip. Otomicroscopic ear examination revealed the presence of bilateral hemotympanum. The patient denied head trauma, ear pain, fever, hypertension and medications, including salicylates. The patient received high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone because of low platelet count and wet purpura for 7 days and oral prophylactic amoxicillin-clavulanate for 14 days. The onset of the response to corticosteroids was rapid, and significant hematologic improvement was observed within a few days. The 2-week follow-up examination revealed intact tympanic membranes with normal color and mobility, and the patient restored normal hearing. In this patient, hemotympanum developed rapidly, and no predisposing cause other than immune thrombocytopenic purpura was found. However, presence of a serous nasal discharge may be a sign of viral upper respiratory tract infection. Therefore, it can be speculated that sneezing or coughing might have caused bilateral hemotympanum by increasing the middle ear pressure abruptly. We would like to emphasize that bleeding may occur in unusual sites and, unlike in healthy people, may cause bizarre symptoms in patients with bleeding diathesis. Hemotympanum can be considered among the indications to start treatment in patients with acute immune thrombocytopenic purpura.

In all cases a broad excision of the pilonidal tissue was made, without colour signing the different incision sites and primary closure of the defect with no drainage. Using this technique we treated 20 adolescents (15 girls and 5 boys) of ages between 12 and 15 years (average age 13.3 years) and body mass index between 17 and 33 (mean BMI 26.4 kg/m2). Mean hospitalisation time was 1.45 days. Preoperative antibiotherapy with Amoxicillin-clavulanic was administered to 55% of patients and continued over the first postoperative week. We had four cases with recurrence of the disease (25%) (two of these with two recurrences), which we treated with three primary closures on the midline and three by flattening the cleft. In 2 cases with dehiscence of the wound we allowed treatment by secondary intention. No flaps or marsupialisation were attempted in any case. In all cases the result was aesthetically satisfactory, with maintenance of the intergluteal fold. In our series we have succeeded in undertaking primary closure of the defect after pilonidal resection without any excessive tension. This treatment enables a rapid return to a normal routine. We considered it important to undertake surgery that maintained the intergluteal fold, especially in patients with a short-term evolution of the disease, reserving flattening the cleft, closure by secondary intention, or primary closure by inserting flaps only for cases of recurrent disease; those with long-term evolution; or patients with complex lesions prior to surgery.

To determine whether lower-dose amoxicillin is noninferior to higher dose and whether 3-day treatment is noninferior to 7 days. Multicenter, randomized, 2 × 2 factorial noninferiority trial enrolling 824 children, aged 6 months and older, with clinically diagnosed CAP, treated with amoxicillin on discharge from emergency departments and inpatient wards of 28 hospitals in the UK and 1 in Ireland between February 2017 and April 2019, with last trial visit on May 21, 2019. Children were randomized 1:1 to receive oral amoxicillin at a lower dose (35-50 mg/kg/d; n = 410) or higher dose (70-90 mg/kg/d; n = 404), for a shorter duration (3 days; n = 413) or a longer duration (7 days; n = 401). The primary outcome was clinically indicated antibiotic re-treatment for respiratory infection within 28 days after randomization. The noninferiority margin was 8%. Secondary outcomes included severity/duration of 9 parent-reported CAP symptoms, 3 antibiotic-related adverse events, and phenotypic resistance in colonizing Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. Of 824 participants randomized into 1 of the 4 groups, 814 received at least 1 dose of trial medication (median [IQR] age, 2.5 years [1.6-2.7]; 421 [52%] males and 393 [48%] females), and the primary outcome was available for 789 (97%). For lower vs higher dose, the primary outcome occurred in 12.6% with lower dose vs 12.4% with higher dose (difference, 0.2% [1-sided 95% CI -∞ to 4.0%]), and in 12.5% with 3-day treatment vs 12.5% with 7-day treatment (difference, 0.1% [1-sided 95% CI -∞ to 3.9]). Both groups demonstrated noninferiority with no significant interaction between dose and duration (P = .63). Of the 14 prespecified secondary end points, the only significant differences were 3-day vs 7-day treatment for cough duration (median 12 days vs 10 days; hazard ratio [HR], 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; P = .04) and sleep disturbed by cough (median, 4 days vs 4 days; HR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; P = .03). Among the subgroup of children with severe CAP, the primary end point occurred in 17.3% of lower-dose recipients vs 13.5% of higher-dose recipients (difference, 3.8% [1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to10%]; P value for interaction = .18) and in 16.0% with 3-day treatment vs 14.8% with 7-day treatment (difference, 1.2% [1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to 7.4%]; P value for interaction = .73). Among children with CAP discharged from an emergency department or hospital ward (within 48 hours), lower-dose outpatient oral amoxicillin was noninferior to higher dose, and 3-day duration was noninferior to 7 days, with regard to need for antibiotic re-treatment.

18,2,2,14726904,"Treatment guidelines developed by the Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) were originally published in 2000. These guidelines were designed to: (1) educate clinicians and patients (or patients’ families) about the differences between viral and bacterial rhinosinusitis; (2) reduce the use of antibiotics for nonbacterial nasal/sinus disease; (3) provide recommendations for the diagnosis and optimal treatment of ABRS; (4) promote the use of appropriate antibiotic therapy when bacterial infection is likely; and (5) describe the current understanding of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics and how they relate to the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy. The original guidelines are updated here to include the most recent information on management principles, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, and therapeutic options. An estimated 20 million cases of ABRS occur annually in the United States. According to National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) data, sinusitis is the fifth most common diagnosis for which an antibiotic is prescribed. Sinusitis accounted for 9% and 21% of all pediatric and adult antibiotic prescriptions, respectively, written in 2002. The primary diagnosis of sinusitis results in expenditures of approximately $3.5 billion per year in the United States. ABRS is most often preceded by a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI). Allergy, trauma, dental infection, or other factors that lead to inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses may also predispose individuals to developing ABRS. Patients with a “common cold” (viral URI) usually report some combination of the following symptoms: sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, hyposmia/anosmia, facial pressure, postnasal drip, sore throat, cough, ear fullness, fever, and myalgia. A change in the color or the characteristic of the nasal discharge is not a specific sign of a bacterial infection. Bacterial superinfection may occur at any time during the course of a viral URI. The risk that bacterial superinfection has occurred is greater if the illness is still present after 10 days. Because there may be cases that fall out of the “norm” of this typical progression, practicing clinicians need to rely on their clinical judgment when using these guidelines. In general, however, a diagnosis of ABRS may be made in adults or children with symptoms of a viral URI that have not improved after 10 days or worsen after 5 to 7 days. There may be some or all of the following signs and symptoms: nasal drainage, nasal congestion, facial pressure/pain (especially when unilateral and focused in the region of a particular sinus), postnasal drainage, hyposmia/anosmia, fever, cough, fatigue, maxillary dental pain, and ear pressure/fullness. Physical examination provides limited information in the diagnosis of ABRS. While sometimes helpful, plain film radiographs, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging scans are not necessary for cases of ABRS. The most common bacterial species isolated from the maxillary sinuses of patients with ABRS are  The increasing prevalence of penicillin nonsusceptibility and resistance to other drug classes among  These guidelines apply to both adults and children. When selecting antibiotic therapy for ABRS, the clinician should consider the severity of the disease, the rate of progression of the disease, and recent antibiotic exposure. The guidelines now divide patients with ABRS into two general categories: (1) those with mild symptoms who have not received antibiotics within the past 4 to 6 weeks, and (2) those with mild disease who have received antibiotics within the past 4 to 6 weeks or those with moderate disease regardless of recent antibiotic exposure. The difference in severity of disease does not imply infection with a resistant pathogen. Rather, this terminology indicates the relative degree of acceptance of possible treatment failure and the likelihood of spontaneous resolution of symptoms—patients with more severe symptoms are less likely to resolve their disease spontaneously. The primary goal of antibiotic therapy is to eradicate bacteria from the site of infection, which, in turn, helps (1) return the sinuses back to health; (2) decrease the duration of symptoms to allow patients to resume daily activities more quickly; (3) prevent severe complications such as meningitis and brain abscess; and (4) decrease the development of chronic disease. Severe or life-threatening infections with or without complications are rare, and are not addressed in these guidelines. Prior antibiotic use is a major risk factor associated with the development of infection with antimicrobial-resistant strains. Because recent antimicrobial exposure increases the risk of carriage of and infection due to resistant organisms, antimicrobial therapy should be based upon the patient’s history of recent antibiotic use. The panel’s guidelines, therefore, stratify patients according to antibiotic exposure in the previous 4 to 6 weeks. Lack of response to therapy at ≥72 hours is an arbitrary time established to define treatment failures. Clinicians should monitor the response to antibiotic therapy, which may include instructing the patient to call the office or clinic if symptoms persist or worsen over the next few days. The predicted bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of antibiotics in adults and children has been determined according to mathematical modeling of ABRS developed by Michael Poole, MD, PhD, based on pathogen distribution, resolution rates without treatment, and in vitro microbiologic activity. Antibiotics can be placed into the following relative rank order of predicted clinical efficacy for adults: 90% to 92% = respiratory fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), ceftriaxone, high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (4 g/250 mg/day), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (1.75 g/250 mg/day); 83% to 88% = high-dose amoxicillin (4 g/day), amoxicillin (1.5 g/day), cefpodoxime proxetil, cefixime (based on  ",Antimicrobial treatment guidelines for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis,"Anon JB, Jacobs MR, Poole MD, Ambrose PG, Benninger MS, Hadley JA, Craig WA; Sinus And Allergy Health Partnership.",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2004 Jan;130(1 Suppl):1-45. doi: 10.1016/j.otohns.2003.12.003.,Anon JB,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,2004,2004/01/17,PMC7118847,,10.1016/j.otohns.2003.12.003

The aim of this study was to model efficacious and safe exposure for current neonatal amoxicillin dosing regimens, given a range of assumptions for minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), targeted %fT > MIC, and potential for aminopenicillin-related neurotoxicity. Individual intravenous amoxicillin exposures based on 6 international and 9 Swiss neonatal dosing recommendations, reflecting the range of current dosing approaches, were assessed by a previously developed population pharmacokinetic model informed by neonatal data from an international cohort. Exposure was simulated by attributing each dosing regimen to each patient cohort. End points of interest were %fT > MIC and potential neurotoxicity using Cmax > 140 mg/L as threshold. None of the dosing regimens achieved targets of ≥100%fT > MIC at any of the relevant MICs for a desired probability of target attainment (PTA) of ≥90%. All regimens achieved a PTA ≥90% for Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC 0.25 mg/L) and Listeria monocytogenes (MIC 1 mg/L) when targeting ≤70%fT > MIC. In contrast, none of the regimens resulted in a PTA ≥90% targeting ≥70%fT > MIC for enterococci (MIC 4 mg/L).

22,6,6,37493159,"Group A ß-hemolytic  This article aims to familiarize clinicians with the clinical manifestations, evaluation, diagnosis, and management of GABHS pharyngitis. A search was conducted in December 2022 in PubMed Clinical Queries using the key term ""group A β-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis"". This review covers mainly literature published in the previous ten years. Children with GABHS pharyngitis typically present with an abrupt onset of fever, intense pain in the throat, pain on swallowing, an inflamed pharynx, enlarged and erythematous tonsils, a red and swollen uvula, enlarged tender anterior cervical lymph nodes. As clinical manifestations may not be specific, even experienced clinicians may have difficulties diagnosing GABHS pharyngitis solely based on epidemiologic or clinical grounds alone. Patients suspected of having GABHS pharyngitis should be confirmed by microbiologic testing (e.g., culture, rapid antigen detection test, molecular point-of-care test) of a throat swab specimen prior to the initiation of antimicrobial therapy. Microbiologic testing is generally unnecessary in patients with pharyngitis whose clinical and epidemiologic findings do not suggest GABHS. Clinical score systems such as the Centor score and McIssac score have been developed to help clinicians decide which patients should undergo diagnostic testing and reduce the unnecessary use of antimicrobials. Antimicrobial therapy should be initiated without delay once the diagnosis is confirmed. Oral penicillin V and amoxicillin remain the drugs of choice. For patients who have a non-anaphylactic allergy to penicillin, oral cephalosporin is an acceptable alternative. For patients with a history of immediate, anaphylactic-type hypersensitivity to penicillin, oral clindamycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin are acceptable alternatives. Early diagnosis and antimicrobial treatment are recommended to prevent suppurative complications (e.g., cervical lymphadenitis, peritonsillar abscess) and non-suppurative complications (particularly rheumatic fever) as well as to reduce the severity of symptoms, to shorten the duration of the illness and to reduce disease transmission.

23,7,7,14632104,"Bacterial skin and skin structure infections commonly encountered in children include impetigo, folliculitis, furunculosis, carbuncles, wound infections, abscesses, cellulitis, erysipelas, scarlet fever, acute paronychia, and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. If diagnosed early and treated appropriately, these infections are almost always curable, but some have the potential to cause serious complications such as septicemia, nephritis, carditis and arthritis if diagnosis is delayed and/or treatment is inadequate. During the initial evaluation, it is important to determine whether the infection is superficial or deep, and whether it is localized or spreading. Prompt treatment is essential if the infection appears to be spreading, as the sequelae can be life threatening. Once the proper diagnosis is made, the next important step is selecting the most appropriate therapy. In children presenting with mild or moderately severe bacterial skin and skin structure infections and not requiring inpatient management or urgent operative débridement, prompt provision of oral antimicrobial therapy avoids the risk of worsening infection or hospitalization. Empiric antimicrobial therapy should be directed at the most likely pathogens, (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes), although some infections (e.g. subcutaneous abscesses and cellulitis following animal or human bites) may have a polymicrobial origin. In choosing the appropriate antimicrobial therapy, one must take into account the resistance profile of the target pathogen, the agent's antibacterial profile and intrinsic activity against the target pathogen, and its pharmacokinetic properties (including absorption, elimination, and extent of tissue penetration). Other factors to consider include tolerability of the drug, convenience of the dosing regimen, and acceptability and palatability of the oral formulation administered. Any treatment plan for bacterial skin and skin structure infections should aim to minimize the emergence of resistant organisms so that the risk of their dissemination to others in the community is reduced. Oral antimicrobial agents currently available that may be considered include: beta-lactamase-stable penicillins (e.g. cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium), the macrolides (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin), and the cephalosporins. Cephalosporins are now the most commonly used class, particularly because of increasing resistance among strains of S. pyogenes to erythromycin (and by implication, the other macrolides). The second- and third-generation cephalosporins have many advantages, with their extended spectra of antimicrobial activity, favorable pharmacokinetic and tolerability profiles, and convenient dosage schedules. The third-generation agent, cefdinir, has good activity against a broad range of likely pathogens, including staphylococci, a twice-daily administration schedule, a favorable efficacy and tolerability profile, is well accepted by young children when administered as an oral suspension, and may be an attractive alternative in the pediatric setting.

From October 2018 to October 2019, our tertiary-care obstetrical center reviewed components of our AMS program, which included: (1) antimicrobial consumption data, (2) point prevalence surveys (PPS), and (3) prospective audit and feedback. We reviewed institutional data for antimicrobial consumption from the pharmacy database. Detailed point prevalence surveys were conducted for all antimicrobial prescriptions on two predefined dates each month. Daily audits and feedback assessed the appropriateness of all non-protocolized antimicrobials. Our average antimicrobial length of therapy (LOT) was 12 days per 100 patient-days, where erythromycin (2.33), amoxicillin (2.28), and ampicillin (1.81) were the greatest contributors. Point prevalence surveys revealed that 28.8% of obstetrical inpatients were on antimicrobials, of which 11.2% were inappropriate. Protocolized antimicrobials were 62% less likely ( Antimicrobial use in obstetrics is unique compared to general inpatients.

Les chercheurs ont examiné les données institutionnelles relatives à la consommation d’antimicrobiens dans la base de données de la pharmacie. Ils ont effectué des enquêtes de prévalence ponctuelles détaillées sur toutes les prescriptions d’antimicrobiens à deux dates déterminées chaque mois. Les vérifications et les rétroactions quotidiennes ont permis d’évaluer la pertinence de tous les antimicrobiens non protocolisés. La durée du traitement antimicrobien moyen était de 12 jours sur 100 jours-patients, et l’érythromycine (2,33), l’amoxicilline (2,28) et l’ampicilline (1,81) étaient les plus utilisées. Les enquêtes de prévalence ponctuelles ont révélé que 28,8 % des patientes obstétricales hospitalisées prenaient des antimicrobiens, dont 11,2 % étaient inappropriés. Les antimicrobiens protocolisés étaient 62 % moins susceptibles d’être inappropriés (p = 0,027).

25,9,9,22208358,"The development of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines has gained wide acceptance in high-income countries and reputable international organizations. Whereas this approach may be a desirable standard, challenges remain in low-income settings with limited capacity and resources for evidence synthesis and guideline development. We present our experience using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for the recent revision of the Kenyan pediatric clinical guidelines focusing on antibiotic treatment of pneumonia. A team of health professionals, many with minimal prior experience conducting systematic reviews, carried out evidence synthesis for structured clinical questions. Summaries were compiled and distributed to a panel of clinicians, academicians and policy-makers to generate recommendations based on best available research evidence and locally-relevant contextual factors. We reviewed six eligible articles on non-severe and 13 on severe/very severe pneumonia. Moderate quality evidence suggesting similar clinical outcomes comparing amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole for non-severe pneumonia received a strong recommendation against adopting amoxicillin. The panel voted strongly against amoxicillin for severe pneumonia over benzyl penicillin despite moderate quality evidence suggesting clinical equivalence between the two and additional factors favoring amoxicillin. Very low quality evidence suggesting ceftriaxone was as effective as the standard benzyl penicillin plus gentamicin for very severe pneumonia received a strong recommendation supporting the standard treatment. Although this exercise may have fallen short of the rigorous requirements recommended by the developers of GRADE, it was arguably an improvement on previous attempts at guideline development in low-income countries and offers valuable lessons for future similar exercises where resources and locally-generated evidence are scarce.

The prevalence of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae with putative extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among isolates from blood, urinary tract, and skin and soft tissue infections ranged from 0 (Germany and France) to 29.6% (Italy). With the exception of pseudomonal infections or infections with MRSA, amoxicillin-clavulanate retained moderate activity, whilst ceftriaxone and cefepime were the most effective broad-spectrum injectable agents. Meropenem was the most effective agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with <5% resistance. Low levels of resistance, along with acceptable safety profiles and the availability of convenient oral formulations, continue to support the use of ceftriaxone, cefepime, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and meropenem as viable options for the treatment of infections in pediatric patients.

Two beta-lactamase-stable agents commonly used for empirical treatment of AOM are amoxicillin/clavulanate and cefixime. A multicenter, randomized clinical trial compared cefixime (CFX; 8 mg/kg once daily) with amoxicillin/clavulanate (A/C; 40 mg/kg/day in three divided doses) for the treatment of children with AOM. Three hundred thirteen children were randomly assigned to a 10-day course of either CFX (n = 158) or A/C (n = 155). Based on history, physical examinations and otoscopic and tympanometric assessments, clinical responses were evaluated as cure, improvement, failure, relapse or nonevaluable. Compliance and patient/parent acceptability were also analyzed. Overall favorable clinical responses (cure plus improvement) were comparable post-therapy for the two treatments (CFX = 76%; A/C = 77%). Significant differences in response rates for both treatments were noted among different geographic regions, with the highest response rates observed in the Northeast and South. Acceptability of CFX was significantly better than that of A/C (P = 0.0001), and the adverse experience rate was lower (P = 0.001). The most frequently reported adverse experiences were diarrhea (CFX 15.2%, A/C 29.7%) and vomiting (CFX 3.2%, A/C 10.32%). Relapse rates were 26% for CFX and 29% for A/C.

Between February and July 2006, the parents of 953 children enrolled by 46 pediatricians completed a questionnaire, including a taste assessment based on representations of five facial expressions. The proportions of ""satisfactory"" taste judgments showed a significant difference between amoxicillin-clavulanate reference product and its generics (77.9% vs. 65%, p = 0.01). The amoxicillin-clavulanate generics were more likely than the reference product to be spat out at least once (28.7% vs. 19%, p = 0.05).

The full treatment course was taken by 90.7% and 94.6% of children prescribed the amoxicillin reference product and its generics, respectively (p = 0.3). This study suggests the role of the active substance in the taste, and calls for the evaluation of palatability of future drugs (generics and references) before granting of the marketing authorization, particularly for active substances of poor taste; this palatability plays a significant role in the compliance of the treatment, notably in children.

31,15,15,12765486,"The approaches to diagnosing and treating Lyme disease (LD) have been improved and refined as a result of basic and clinical research, and considerable practical experience. In addition, there have been recent studies that have allowed improvements in the ability to prevent infection with Borrelia burgdorferi. This paper will review the relevant literature and address recent developments in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of LD. Issues specifically related to the management of children will be identified. Controversies regarding treatment approaches will be examined in some detail. Understanding the clinical manifestations, or stage, of LD is crucial when approaching both diagnosis and treatment. Early localized disease is best diagnosed by recognizing the characteristic skin lesion, erythema migrans. Early disease will frequently, but not always, be accompanied by a detectable antibody response, particularly IgM antibody to the spirochete. Late disease, chiefly arthritis, is generally associated with high levels of IgG antibody. Western blot technology allows confirmation of enzyme immunoassay results and is especially useful when the latter is in the low or equivocal range. Early localized disease responds well to oral antibacterial therapy. Early disseminated disease, often associated with neurologic findings, may require parenteral therapy. The arthritis associated with LD frequently responds to oral antibacterials, but some refractory cases may require intravenous therapy, and occasionally surgery. Doxycycline is the oral antibacterial of choice, while amoxicillin and cefuroxime axetil are alternatives that may be preferred in young children. Owing to its long half-life and once daily dose administration, intravenous ceftriaxone has become the accepted standard for parenteral therapy. Tick avoidance has long been the mainstay for preventing LD. Antibacterial prophylaxis, using doxycycline, for tick bites has been shown to be an effective approach to prevention, but its relevance to pediatrics is uncertain. Vaccines designed to prevent infection have also been developed.

Satisfactory clinical response rates at secondary evaluations were also comparable: 92.2% vs. 90.0% at Day 14 and 66.7% vs. 72.7% at Day 30 in patients treated with azithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate, respectively. No significant differences in treatment failures, relapses or recurrences were noted with either medication. Azithromycin was significantly better tolerated and caused fewer treatment-related adverse events (7.2%) than amoxicillin/clavulanate (17.1%) (P < 0.001). In response to the interview and questionnaire, parents of children treated with azithromycin noted less need for special arrangements to give medication (2.0% vs. 14.9%). Children liked the taste of azithromycin (89.2%) and did not have to be forced to take the medication (2.4%). Parents of children receiving amoxicillin/clavulanate noted that 61.8% liked the medication and 19.4% of children had to be forced to take it. This study demonstrates that azithromycin was comparable to amoxicillin/clavulanate in achieving satisfactory clinical response rates in children with acute otitis media attending day care or school. Azithromycin was significantly better tolerated than amoxicillin/ clavulanate. Parents considered azithromycin to be significantly more convenient to administer and more acceptable to children.

36,20,20,9076838,"Respiratory infections in children may occur as a consequence of resistant bacterial pathogens. Streptococcus pneumoniae organisms resistant to penicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and macrolides are increasingly prevalent. Amoxicillin- and macrolide-resistant Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis are also more commonly seen. Traditional agents such as amoxicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole remain acceptable choices for most children with respiratory infections because currently most patients are not infected by resistant pathogens and there is a high spontaneous cure rate associated with these infections. To analyze the criteria for the selection of extended spectrum antimicrobials as empiric therapy for respiratory infections. When an extended spectrum antimicrobial is appropriate for empiric therapy, selection should be based on: (1) efficacy; (2) adverse event profile; and (3) compliance-enhancing features (dosing with meals, once or twice daily administration, good palatability in suspension, shortened course of therapy and affordability). A new agent, ceftibuten, has recently joined other extended spectrum cephalosporins and newer macrolides (clarithromycin and azithromycin) as a choice to be considered for empiric therapy for respiratory infections. These antimicrobials are differentiated from each other and traditional agents by differences in activity in vitro against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, relative beta-lactamase stability against Gram-negative bacteria and pharmacodynamic properties. When resistant organisms are isolated or suspected in community-acquired respiratory infections, cautious use of newer antibiotics may have to be considered.

37,21,21,15270741,"Re-infection with Helicobacter pylori is more common in children than adults, and it is generally accepted that the family unit plays a significant role in primary childhood infection. We investigated whether the family unit plays a significant role in pediatric re-infection and if eradication of H. pylori from the entire family reduces the risk of childhood re-infection. Fifty families, each with an H. pylori-infected pediatric index case (mean age 9.48 years), were recruited. A 13carbon urea breath test was performed on all family members in the same house as the index case. Each family unit was randomized into a 'family unit treatment' group (all infected family members treated) or an 'index case treatment' group (index case only treated). At long-term follow-up (mean 62.2 months), there were three re-infected children in the 'index case treatment' group compared with one in the 'family unit treatment' group. The re-infection rate was 2.4% per patient per year in the 'index case treatment' group and 0.7% per patient per year in the 'family unit treatment' group (p = .31). This study is the first to evaluate the effect of total family unit H. pylori eradication on pediatric re-infection rates and reports the longest period of re-infection follow-up in children.

40,24,24,21281502,"Streptococcal pharyngitis is a very common pathology in paediatric age all over the world. Nevertheless there isn't a joint agreement on the management of this condition. Some authors recommend to perform a microbiological investigation in suspected bacterial cases in order to treat the confirmed cases with antibiotics so to prevent suppurative complications and acute rheumatic fever. Differently, other authors consider pharyngitis, even streptococcal one, a benign, self-limiting disease. Consequently they wouldn't routinely perform microbiological tests and, pointing to a judicious use of antibiotics, they would reserve antimicrobial treatment to well-selected cases. It has been calculated that the number of patients needed to treat to prevent one complication after upper respiratory tract infections (including sore throat), was over 4000. Even the use of the Centor score, in order to evaluate the risk of streptococcal infection, is under debate and the interpretation of the test results may vary considerably. Penicillin is considered all over the world as first line treatment, but oral amoxicillin is also accepted and, due to its better palatability, can be a suitable option. Macrolides should be reserved to the rare cases of proved allergy to β-lactams.

In a randomised, open-label, equivalence trial at five sites in DR Congo, Kenya, and Nigeria, community health workers followed up all births in the community, identified unwell young infants, and referred them to study nurses. We randomly assigned infants with fast breathing as a single sign of illness or possible serious bacterial infection, whose parents did not accept referral to hospital, to receive either injectable procaine benzylpenicillin-gentamicin once per day or oral amoxicillin treatment twice per day for 7 days. A person who was off-site generated randomisation lists using computer software. Trained health professionals gave injections, but outcome assessors were masked to group allocations. The primary outcome was treatment failure by day 8 after enrolment, defined as clinical deterioration, development of a serious adverse event including death, persistence of fast breathing on day 4, or recurrence up to day 8. The primary analysis was per protocol and we used a prespecified similarity margin of 5% to assess equivalence between regimens.

Outcomes included length of stay, intensive care admission and mortality. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria (5115 patients). All the studies were of low quality. The shortest length of stay was with anaerobic and gram-positive cover. Five studies used anaerobic, gram-positive and gram-negative cover (e.g., amoxicillin-clavulanic acid), which was frequently adequate. In one large study, it was better than gram-positive and gram-negative cover alone (e.g. ceftriaxone). Those unresponsive or more unwell at presentation improved faster on Pseudomonas aeruginosa cover (e.g., piperacillin-tazobactam). In this context, anaerobic, gram-positive and gram-negative cover is just as effective as P. aeruginosa cover, supporting empiric treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.

50,34,34,20924533,"The present study was conducted to evaluate the utilization of Clark's, Salisbury and Penna's rules and the Body Surface Area (BSA) formula for calculation of pediatric drug dosage, as well as their reliability and viability in the clinical use. These rules are frequently cited in the literature, but much controversy still exists with regards to their use. The pediatric drug dosage was calculated by utilization of the aforementioned rules and using the drugs Paracetamol, Dipyrone, Diclofenac Potassium, Nimesulide, Amoxicillin and Erythromycin, widely employed in Pediatric Dentistry. Weight and body surface areas were considered of children with ages between 1 and 12 years old as well as the dosage for the adult. The pediatric dosages achieved were compared to the predetermined dosages in mg kg-1 herein-named standard dosages. The results were submitted to the parametric test ANOVA and to the Tukey test (p<0,05). The antibiotics and Diclofenac provides acceptable utilization of the rules in pediatric dentistry, however for the Dipyrone, the dosages obtained by the rules suggest their clinical ineffectiveness. For the Paracetamol, the Penna's rule and the BSA formula should not be clinically employed, especially for children between 1 and 5 years old, once such dosages were much close to the hepatotoxic dosage of the drug. It can be concluded that the use of the rules for safe calculation of the pediatric drug dosage is possible and it depends on the used drug and age group.

Hypoxaemia is a life-threatening complication among children under 5 with pneumonia. Hypoxaemia increases risk of mortality by 4.3 times in children with pneumonia than those without hypoxaemia. Prevalence of hypoxaemia varies with geography, altitude and severity (9%-39% Asia, 3%-10% African countries). In this protocol paper, we describe research methods for assessing impact of Lady Health Workers (LHWs) identifying hypoxaemia in children with signs of pneumonia during household visits on acceptance of hospital referral in district Jamshoro, Sindh. A cluster randomised controlled trial using pulse oximetry as intervention for children with severe pneumonia will be conducted in community settings. Children aged 0-59 months with signs of severe pneumonia will be recruited by LHWs during routine visits in both intervention and control arms after consent. Severe pneumonia will be defined as fast breathing and/or chest in-drawing, and, one or more danger sign and/or hypoxaemia (Sa02 <92%) in PO (intervention) group and fast breathing and/or chest in-drawing and one or more danger sign in clinical signs (control) group.

52,36,36,37594179,"Information on the average and incremental costs of implementing alternative strategies for treating young infants 0-59 days old in primary health facilities with signs of possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) when a referral is not feasible is limited but valuable for policymakers. Direct activity costs were calculated for outpatient treatment of PSBI and pneumonia in two districts of India: Palwal, Haryana and Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. These included costs of staff time and consumables for initial assessment, classification, and referrals; recommended treatment of fast breathing (oral amoxicillin for seven days) and PSBI (injection gentamicin and oral amoxicillin for seven days); and daily assessments. Indirect operational costs included staff training; staff time cost for general management, supervision, and coordination; referral transport; and communication. The average cost per young infant treated for recommended and acceptable treatment for PSBI was 16 US dollars (US$) (95% CI = US$15.4-16.3) in 2018-19 and US$18.5 in 2022 (adjusted for inflation) when all direct and indirect operational costs were considered. The average cost of recommended treatment for pneumonia was US$10.1 (95% CI = US$9.7-10.6) or US$11.7 in 2022, per treated young infant. The incremental cost 2018-2019 for supplies, medicines, and operations (excluding staff time costs) per infant treated for PSBI was US$6.1 and US$4.3 and for pneumonia was US$3.5 and US$2.2 in Palwal and Lucknow, respectively. Operation and administrative costs were 25% in Palwal and 12% in Lucknow of the total PSBI treatment costs. The average cost per live birth for treating PSBI in each population was US$5 in Palwal and US$3 in Lucknow. Higher operation costs for social mobilisation activities in Palwal led to the empowerment of families and timely care-seeking. Costs of treatment of PSBI with the recommended regimen in an outpatient setting, when a referral is not feasible, are under US$20 per treated child and must be budgeted to reduce deaths from neonatal sepsis. The investment must be made in activities that lead to successful identification, prompt care seeking, timely initiation of treatment and follow-up.

53,37,37,25841891,"Severe infections remain one of the main causes of neonatal deaths worldwide. Possible severe infection is diagnosed in young infants (aged 0-59 days) according to the presence of one or more clinical signs. The recommended treatment is hospital admission with 7-10 days of injectable antibiotic therapy. In low-income and middle-income countries, barriers to hospital care lead to delayed, inadequate, or no treatment for many young infants. We aimed to identify effective alternative antibiotic regimens to expand treatment options for situations where hospital admission is not possible. We did this randomised, open-label, equivalence trial in four urban hospitals and one rural field site in Bangladesh to determine whether two alternative antibiotic regimens with reduced numbers of injectable antibiotics combined with oral antibiotics had similar efficacy and safety to the standard regimen, which was also used as outpatient treatment. We randomly assigned infants who showed at least one clinical sign of severe, but not critical, infection (except fast breathing alone), whose parents refused hospital admission, to one of the three treatment regimens. We stratified randomisation by study site and age (<7 days or 7-59 days) using computer-generated randomisation sequences. The standard treatment was intramuscular procaine benzylpenicillin and gentamicin once per day for 7 days (group A). The alternative regimens were intramuscular gentamicin once per day and oral amoxicillin twice per day for 7 days (group B) or intramuscular procaine benzylpenicillin and gentamicin once per day for 2 days, then oral amoxicillin twice per day for 5 days (group C). The primary outcome was treatment failure within 7 days after enrolment. Assessors of treatment failure were masked to treatment allocation. Primary analysis was per protocol. We used a prespecified similarity margin of 5% to assess equivalence between regimens. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00844337. Between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013, we recruited 2490 young infants into the trial. We assigned 830 infants to group A, 831 infants to group B, and 829 infants to group C. 2367 (95%) infants fulfilled per-protocol criteria. 78 (10%) of 795 per-protocol infants had treatment failure in group A compared with 65 (8%) of 782 infants in group B (risk difference -1.5%, 95% CI -4.3 to 1.3) and 64 (8%) of 790 infants in group C (-1.7%, -4.5 to 1.1). In group A, 14 (2%) infants died before day 15, compared with 12 (2%) infants in group B and 12 (2%) infants in group C. Non-fatal relapse rates were similar in all three groups (12 [2%] infants in group A vs 13 [2%] infants in group B and 10 [1%] infants in group C). Our results suggest that the two alternative antibiotic regimens for outpatient treatment of clinical signs of severe infection in young infants whose parents refused hospital admission are as efficacious as the standard regimen. This finding could increase treatment options in resource-poor settings when referral care is not available or acceptable.

54,38,38,33784321,"Neonatal infections contribute substantially to infant mortality in Nigeria and globally. Management requires hospitalization, which is not accessible to many in low resource settings. World Health Organization developed a guideline to manage possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) in young infants up to two months of age when a referral is not feasible. We evaluated the feasibility of implementing this guideline to achieve high coverage of treatment. This implementation research was conducted in out-patient settings of eight primary health care centres (PHC) in Lagelu Local Government Area (LGA) of Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. We conducted policy dialogue with the Federal and State officials to adopt the WHO guideline within the existing programme setting and held orientation and sensitization meetings with communities. We established a Technical Support Unit (TSU), built the capacity of health care providers, supervised and mentored them, monitored the quality of services and collected data for management and outcomes of sick young infants with PSBI signs. The Primary Health Care Directorate of the state ministry and the local government led the implementation and provided technical support. The enablers and barriers to implementation were documented. From 1 April 2016 to 31 July 2017 we identified 5278 live births and of these, 1214 had a sign of PSBI. Assuming 30% of births were missed due to temporary migration to maternal homes for delivery care and approximately 45% cases came from outside the catchment area due to free availability of medicines, the treatment coverage was 97.3% (668 cases/6861 expected births) with an expected 10% PSBI prevalence within the first 2 months of life. Of 1214 infants with PSBI, 392 (32%) infants 7-59 days had only fast breathing (pneumonia), 338 (27.8%) infants 0-6 days had only fast breathing (severe pneumonia), 462 (38%) presented with signs of clinical severe infection (CSI) and 22 (1.8%) with signs of critical illness. All but two, 7-59 days old infants with pneumonia were treated with oral amoxicillin without a referral; 80% (312/390) adhered to full treatment; 97.7% (381/390) were cured, and no deaths were reported. Referral to the hospital was not accepted by 87.7% (721/822) families of infants presenting with signs of PSBI needing hospitalization (critical illness 5/22; clinical severe infection; 399/462 and severe pneumonia 317/338). They were treated on an outpatient basis with two days of injectable gentamicin and seven days of oral amoxicillin. Among these 81% (584/721) completed treatment; 97% (700/721) were cured, and three deaths were reported (two with critical illness and one with clinical severe infection). We identified health system gaps including lack of staff motivation and work strikes, medicines stockouts, sub-optimal home visits that affected implementation. When a referral is not feasible, outpatient treatment for young infants with signs of PSBI is possible within existing programme structures in Nigeria with high coverage and low case fatality. To scale up this intervention successfully, government commitment is needed to strengthen the health system, motivate and train health workers, provide necessary commodities, establish technical support for implementation and strengthen linkages with communities.

55,39,39,21420838,"Compliance with antibiotics is essential to ensure treatment efficacy and to prevent the emergence of bacterial resistant stains. In children who take oral form, the palatability and the frequency of administration seem to be factors important to good compliance. This observational study was designed to assess the acceptability of oral antibiotics (including generics) commonly prescribed to children by primary care physicians in France. It was given to 50 pediatricians and 50 GPs in private practice. For each patient, the physician and parents completed a questionnaire, and parents filled out a log for each drug intake. Between September 2006 and September 2007, 91 physicians enrolled 2400 children and 1482 patient records are fully assessable. The two factors that improve significantly compliance are administration in two doses by day (OR 2.2 [95% CI 1 6-3]) and acceptability ≥80% (OR 2.6, [95% CI 1.9-3.7]). The acceptability was better for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 65.4% (95% CI [57.6 to 72.4]) than for cefpodoxime 47.1% (95% CI [43.8-50.4]) or cefuroxime axetil 26% (95% [CI 15.9-39.6]). Conversely, cefpodoxime proxetil obtained a better score for compliance 91.8% (95% CI [89.8 to 93.4) as amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 84.6% (95%CI 80.8 to 87.8) because of its mode of administration in two doses per day. There is no difference between the amoxicillin clavulanic acid reference product and its generics as a whole, however a large variability exists between generics. If, for antibiotics prescribed in two doses per day, the two administrations by day are roughly equidistant, it is not the same for those prescribed three times a day: indeed, while the doses taken are identical, only four hours separate the first intake of the morning from the second intake in mid-day and more than 12 hours between the evening dose from the next morning intake. This study confirms the disparity in terms of acceptability among the different antibiotics prescribed for children even for the same drug, warranting evaluation for marketing of future generic drugs pediatric oral suspension. The disparity ranges for drugs three times daily asking consequences pharmacokinetics and dosage adjustment for a transition to two doses per day.

56,40,40,29501295,"Acute otitis media (AOM) is predominantly a disease of childhood and one of the common reasons for prescribing antibiotics. Ear pain is the main symptom of AOM, with the result that parents frequently seek immediate medical assistance for their children. Antibiotic therapy for AOM does not provide symptomatic relief in the first 24 hours, and analgesics are commonly recommended for relieving the pain associated with AOM. The aims of the present study were to assess pediatricians' attitudes toward AOM and ear pain management in Turkey. This multicenter descriptive questionnaire study was conducted in 20 centers from different geographic locations in Turkey, with 977 pediatricians, between June 2015 and December 2016. The questionnaire comprised 20 questions focusing on the pediatricians' sociodemographic variables, experiences, and treatment related to AOM and ear pain. Of the pediatricians, 58.2% were residents, 36.5% were specialists, and 4.3% were lecturers. Most participants were working in a university hospital (54.8%) or education and research hospital (32.2%). In general daily practice, the AOM diagnosis rates were between 6% and 20% in outpatient clinics, and 52.3% of the participants stated the patients complained about ear pain in pediatric clinics. The watchful waiting (WW) rate, as opposed to immediate antibiotic treatment, was 39.8% for all the pediatricians. The pediatric residents used the WW strategy less than the specialists and lecturers did (p = 0.004). The rates of the WW strategy were higher in outpatient clinics where AOM was commonly diagnosed (p < 0.001). The most common antibiotic prescribed for AOM was amoxicillin clavulanate (76.7%). The mean recommended treatment period for AOM was 9.3 ± 2.2 days. The choices for systemic ear pain treatment were acetaminophen (26.8%), ibuprofen (29.4%), and alternating between ibuprofen and acetaminophen (43.9%). Moreover, 34.6% of the participants recommended topical agents for otalgia. Topical agents were more commonly recommended by the pediatric residents than specialists or lecturers (p < 0.001). Finally, 58.3% of pediatricians had experiences of the parents' usage of a variety of herbal and folk remedies, such as breast milk or olive oil, for their children's ear pain. Amoxicillin clavulanate was the most frequently prescribed antibiotic for AOM. WW was approved by the pediatricians, and having more AOM patients was a significant factor in the physicians' choice of WW; nevertheless, the WW rate was poor. Implementation of educational intervention strategies will help pediatricians in improving their compliance with evidence-based guidelines for AOM treatment. Otalgia is taken seriously by parents and pediatricians, and otalgia treatment seems to be well accepted in Turkey for providing symptomatic relief and enhancing the patients' quality of life.

57,41,41,33108920,"To gain an overview of the current management of patients with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) in Swiss maternity hospitals. We conducted a survey among all maternity hospitals in Switzerland from January to December 2018, irrespective of their annual birth rate and level of complexity. The survey consisted of an 11-item questionnaire, which was developed to retrieve information relevant to different areas of PPROM management. Of 64 questionnaires distributed by email, 36 (56.3%) centers responded to the survey. Up to 12 different antibiotic regimens were reported. Among these, 91.7% included a beta-lactam, with amoxicillin as the preferred agent (55.6%). Combined antibiotic schemes were used in 30.6% of hospitals. All centers considered the use of corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity if PPROM occurred before 34 weeks, although 36.1% would consider their use until 37 weeks' gestation in the presence of an increased risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Maternity hospitals who accept deliveries at any gestational age usually used magnesium sulfate as fetal neuroprotection when delivering babies <32 weeks, with the exception of two hospitals where it was either not used or only indicated if maternal preeclampsia was present. Concerning the time to delivery, 58.3% centers tended to wait until 37 weeks' gestation, while the others considered that it was not necessary to go beyond 34 weeks. Our survey shows that the current management of PPROM in Switzerland appears to be mostly in line with international recommendations. However, some heterogeneity exists, thus reflecting a lack of international consensus across guidelines, together with the absence of national Swiss guidelines, and this needs to be addressed to ensure high quality care for all patients and neonates.

58,42,42,24237429,"Escherichia coli is the most frequently isolated microorganism from both community-acquired and nosocomial urinary tract infections in Turkey. A large number of studies concerning antibiotic susceptibility of E.coli have been published from different centers throughout the country. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibiotic resistance patterns of E.coli strains isolated from urine cultures by a meta-analysis in published medical literature between the years of 1996-2012 in Turkey. The study was planned and conducted in accordance with the declaration of PRISMA and describes the methods of literature search, the determining criteria for inclusion and evaluation of articles, data collection and statistical analysis. To find the published series Google Scholar and PubMed international databases were used to access published manuscripts evaluated according to the determined criteria for acceptance and rejection. For each study, general data and antibiotic resistance rates were collected as a common unit. Publications considered as lacking in appropriate content was eliminated from the study. Statistical analysis of the data obtained were 95% confidence intervals, and p≤ 0.05 value was considered as significant difference. A total of 228 articles were found to be published during 1996-2012 period, while 101 of them were included in the meta-analysis according to the eligibility criteria. The analyses indicated that nitrofurantoin and piperacillin resistance rates have been decreased, whereas ciprofloxacin, cefepime, co-trimoxazole and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) positivity rates have been increased during the study period. The increases in the rates of ciprofloxacin and cefepime resistance and and ESBL production were statistically-significant (p< 0.05). A significant reduction in resistance rates for ampicilin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and amikacin was noted in pediatric patients between 2002-2012. Ceftriaxone, imipenem, gentamicin and amikacin resistance were not homogenous between the geographical regions, and statistically significant differences were observed for amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime and ciprofloxacin resistance rates (p< 0.05). Antibiotic resistance rates, except for imipenem, in bacterial strains, isolated from hospitalized patients were found significantly higher in strains obtained from outpatients. The differences between those groups were significant in terms of ampicilin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, amikacin and cefepime resistances (p< 0.05). It has been noted that antibiotic resistance patterns of E.coli strains isolated from urine cultures between 1996-2012 demonstrated significant variability, and many studies were based only on laboratory data. The results of this meta-analysis demonstrated that the resistance rates in commonly-used antibiotics for empirical therapy were high. In conclusion, information obtained by systematic evaluation of national data will be valuable for the determination of optimal antibiotic regimens and in prevention of unnecessary antibiotic use.

59,43,43,33052981,"The World Health Organization (WHO) launched a guideline in 2015 for managing Possible Serious Bacterial Infection (PSBI) when referral is not feasible in young infants aged 0-59 days. This guideline was implemented across 303 Basic Health Unit (BHU) Plus primary health care (PHC) facilities in peri-urban and rural settings of Sindh, Pakistan. We evaluated the implementation of PSBI guideline, and the quality of care provided to sick young infants at these facilities. Thirty (10%) out of 303 BHU Plus facilities were randomly selected for evaluation. A survey team visited each facility for one day, assessed the health system support, observed the management of sick young infants by health care providers (HCP), validated their management, interviewed HCPs and caretakers of sick infants. HCPs who were unable to see a young infant on the day of survey were evaluated using pre-prepared case scenarios. Thirty (100%) BHU Plus facilities had oral amoxicillin, injectable gentamicin, thermometers, baby weighing scales and respiratory timers available; 29 (97%) had disposable syringes and needles; 28 (93%) had integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI)/PSBI chart booklets and job aids and 18 (60%) had a functional ambulance. Each facility had at least one HCP trained in PSBI, and 21 (70%) facilities had been visited by a supervisor in the preceding six months. Of 42 HCPs, 19 (45.3%) were trained within the preceding 12 months. During the survey, 26 sick young infants were identified in 18 facilities. HCPs asked about history of breastfeeding in 23 (89%) infants, history of vomiting in 17 (65%), and history of convulsions in 14 (54%); weighed 25 (97%) infants; measured respiratory rate in all (100%) and temperature in 24 (92%); assessed 20 (77%) for movement and 14 (54%) for chest indrawing. HCPs identified two infants with fast breathing pneumonia and managed them correctly per IMCI/PSBI protocol. HCPs identified six (23%) infants with clinical severe infection (CSI), two of them were referred to a higher-level facility, only one accepted the referral advice. Only one CSI patient was managed correctly per IMCI/PSBI protocol at the outpatient level. HCPs described the PSBI danger signs to eight (31%) caretakers. Caretakers of five infants with CSI and two with pneumonia were not counselled for PSBI danger signs. Five of the six CSI cases categorized by HCPs were validated as CSI on re-examination, whereas one had pneumonia. Similarly, one of the two pneumonia patients categorized by HCPs had CSI and one identified as local bacterial infection was classified as CSI upon re-examination. Health system support was adequate but clinical management and counselling by HCPs was sub-optimal particularly with CSI cases who are at higher risk of adverse outcomes. Scaling up PSBI management is potentially feasible in PHC facilities in Pakistan, provided that HCPs are trained well and mentored, receive refresher training to appropriately manage sick young infants, and have adequate supplies and counselling skills.

This aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of rifabutin-based triple therapy for patients infected with dual drug-resistant strains to clarithromycin and levofloxacin. After 2 or 3 H. pylori treatment failures, patients underwent upper endoscopy with tissue biopsies. Phenotypic and genotypic resistances were determined using agar dilution test and polymerase chain reaction with direct sequencing, respectively. Patients infected with dual drug-resistant (clarithromycin and levofloxacin) strains and receiving rifabutin-based triple therapy (rifabutin 150 mg bid, amoxicillin 1 g bid and esomeprazole 40 mg bid for 10 days) were enrolled. Eradication status was determined by 13C-urea breath test 4 weeks after treatment completion. A total of 39 patients infected with dual drug-resistant strains were enrolled in this study, with a mean age of 55.9 years. The eradication rate was 79.5% (31/39) (95% confidence intervals: 54.96% ~ 111.40%). Adverse event was reported in 23.1% (9/39) of patients but they were mild and tolerable. In univariate analysis, no factor was identified as an independent predictor of eradication failure. Our current study demonstrated that rifabutin-based triple therapy was well tolerated and yielded an acceptable eradication rate for patients infected with dual drug-resistant strains of H. pylori.

This retrospective descriptive study covered all the children from 0 to 15 years old seen over a period of 7 years in any hospital department with suspected bacteriemia and for whom the bacteriology laboratory performed a blood culture. During the study period, the laboratory received 842 requests for blood cultures and found 154 (18.3%) of them to be positive. Files for 81 of the 154 patients could be found and examined. The distribution according to age showed septicemia was most frequent among those aged 6-15 years (61.7% of the cases). Microbial identification showed the dominant species to be Salmonella enterica (serovars paratyphi and typhi) (58%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (12.3%). The salmonella isolates had a high rate of resistance to amoxicillin, chloramphenicol and cotrimoxazole. Staphylococci were always sensitive to the antibiotics with which they were tested, although to a lesser extent for penicillin G. All patients routinely received antibiotic treatment, and 81.5% (n=66) were cured (5 children died and 10 left the hospital against medical advice). This study shows that the bacterial epidemiology of septicemia in our setting is dominated by salmonella. Trends in bacterial resistance to antibiotics showed that common antibiotics such as amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole are no longer acceptable as probabilist therapy here. They should be replaced in this type of infection by injectable third generation cephalosporin alone or combined with aminoglycosides.

62,46,46,8032405,"Clinicians all too often face the difficult dilemma of deciding whether a bone fracture in a young child was intentional. A structured expert consensus process suggests that all rib fractures; midshaft or metaphyseal fractures of the humerus; and fractures of the radius, ulna, tibia, or fibula in children younger than 1 year of age are highly likely to have been caused by abuse. Abused children are more likely to have negative social relationships with other children than their school-aged peers. Research on the causes of sudden infant death syndrome is still confounded by the likelihood that some deaths for which the label was misapplied are included in many studies; however, the presence of smokers in the household in the postnatal period appears to be yet another factor associated with increased risk. Congenital syphilis is on the rise. Detection of infants who have been infected is incomplete. Lack of prenatal care is strongly associated with infection. Cord serology is not sensitive enough to detect all possible cases. Testing of both maternal and neonatal sera results in detection of more infants at risk. Current tests still result in the treatment of some infants who are not themselves infected. Amoxicillin clavulante given twice daily rather then thrice, cefixime given once a day, and a single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone have all shown acceptable--though not exceptional--cure rates for otitis media. Price is a consideration. Fewer courses of antibiotics would be necessary if more infants were breastfed.

63,47,47,34370744,"Of 2.5 million newborn deaths each year, serious neonatal infections are a leading cause of neonatal death for which inpatient treatment is recommended. However, manysick newborns in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia do not have access to inpatientcare. A World Health Organization (WHO) guideline recommends simplified antibiotic treatment atan outpatient level for young infants up to two months of age with possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI), when referral is not feasible.We implemented this guidelinein Ethiopia to increase coverage of treatment and to learn about potential facilitating factors and barriers for implementation. We conducted implementation research in two districts (Tiro Afata and Gera) in Jimma Zone, Ethiopia, to learn about the feasibility of implementing the WHO PSBI guideline within a programme setting using the existing health care structure. We conducted orientation meetings and policy dialogue with key stakeholders and trained health extension workers and health centre staff to identify and manage sick young infants with PSBI signs at a primary health care unit. We established a Technical Support Unit (TSU) to facilitate programme learning, built health workers' capacity and provided support for quality control, monitoring and data collection.We sensitized the community to appropriate care-seeking and supported the health care system in implementation. The research team collected data using structured case recording forms. From September 2016 to August 2017, 6185 live births and 601 sick young infants 0-59 days of age with signs of PSBI were identified. Assuming that 25% of births were missed (total births 7731) and 10% of births had an episode of PSBI in the first two months of life, the coverage of appropriate treatment for PSBI was 77.7% (601/773). Of 601 infants with PSBI, fast breathing only (pneumonia) was recorded in 432 (71.9%) infants 7-59 days of age; signs of clinical severe infection (CSI) in 155 (25.8%) and critical illnessin 14 (2.3%). Of the 432 pneumonia cases who received oral amoxicillin treatment without referral, 419 (97.0%) were successfully treated without any deaths. Of 169 sick young infants with either CSI or critical illness, only 110 were referred to a hospital; 83 did not accept referral advice and received outpatient injectable gentamicin plus oral amoxicillin treatment either at a health post or health centre. Additionally, 59 infants who should have been referred, but were not received injectable gentamicin plus oral amoxicillin outpatient treatment. Of infants with CSI, 129 (82.2%) were successfully treated as outpatients, while two died (1.3%). Of 14 infants with critical illness, the caregivers of five accepted referral to a hospital, and nine were treated with simplified antibiotics on an outpatient basis. Two of 14 (14.3%) infants with critical illness died within 14 days of initial presentation. In settings where referral to a hospital is not feasible, young infants with PSBI can be treated on an outpatient basis at either a health post or health centre, which can contribute to saving many lives. Scaling-up will require health system strengthening including community mobilization. Trial is registered on Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials registry (ANZCTR) ACTRN12617001373369.

64,48,48,33544712,"Neonatal bacterial infections are a common cause of death, which can be managed well with inpatient treatment. Unfortunately, many families in low resource settings do not accept referral to a hospital. The World Health Organization (WHO) developed a guideline for management of young infants up to 2 months of age with possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) when referral is not feasible. Government of Ethiopia with WHO evaluated the feasibility of implementing this guideline to increase coverage of treatment. The objective of this study was to implement a simplified antibiotic regimen (2 days gentamicin injection and 7 days oral amoxicillin) for management of sick young infants with PSBI in a programme setting when referral was not feasible to identify at least 80% of PSBI cases, achieve an overall adequate treatment coverage of at least 80% and document the challenges and opportunities for implementation at the community level in two districts in Tigray, Ethiopia. Using implementation research, we applied the PSBI guideline in a programme setting from January 2016 to August 2017 in Raya Alamata and Raya Azebo Woredas (districts) in Southern Tigray, Ethiopia with a population of 260884. Policy dialogue was held with decision-makers, programme implementers and stakeholders at federal, regional and district levels, and a Technical Support Unit (TSU) was established. Health Extension Workers (HEWs) working at the health posts and supervisors working at the health centres were trained in WHO guideline to manage sick young infants when referral was not feasible. Communities were sensitized towards appropriate home care. We identified 854 young infants with any sign of PSBI in the study population of 7857 live births. The expected live births during the study period were 9821. Assuming 10% of neonates will have any sign of PSBI within the first 2 months of life (n = 982), the coverage of appropriate treatment of PSBI cases in our study area was 87% (854/982). Of the 854 sick young infants, 333 (39%) were taken directly to a hospital and 521 (61%) were identified by HEW at health posts. Of the 521 young infants, 27 (5.2%) had signs of critical illness, 181 (34.7%) had signs of clinical severe infection, whereas 313 (60.1%) young infants 7-59 days of age had only fast breathing pneumonia. All young infants with critical illness accepted referral to a hospital, while 117/181 (64.6%) infants with clinical severe infection accepted referral. Families of 64 (35.3%) infants with clinical severe infection refused referral and were treated at the health post with injectable gentamicin for 2 days plus oral amoxicillin for 7 days. All 64 completed recommended gentamicin doses and 63/64 (98%) completed recommended amoxicillin doses. Of 313 young infants, 7-59 days with pneumonia who were treated by the HEWs without referral with oral amoxicillin for 7 days, 310 (99%) received all 14 doses. No deaths were reported among those treated on an outpatient basis at health posts. But 35/477 (7%) deaths occurred among young infants treated at hospital. When referral is not feasible, young infants with PSBI can be managed appropriately at health posts by HEWs in the existing health system in Ethiopia with high coverage, low treatment failure and a low case fatality rate. Moreover, fast breathing pneumonia in infants 7-59 days of age can be successfully treated at the health post without referral. Relatively higher mortality in sick young infants at the referral level health facilities warrants further investigation.

65,49,49,26089185,"Severe delayed drug-induced skin reactions in children are not common but potentially serious. This article describes aspects concerning the etiology, pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of these processes; it presents three paediatric cases, namely STS (Steven Johnson Syndrome), TEN (toxic epidermal necrolysis), probably related to amoxicillin/clavulanate and ibuprofen and DRESS (a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) secondary to phenytoin; and in relation to them, the diagnosis and the treatment of these processes are discussed and reviewed. The AGEP (acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis) is also reviewed. The aetiological diagnosis of severe non-immediate reactions is difficult, and the value of current allergological testing is not well defined in these cases. Diagnosis is based on clinical history, the empirical risk of drugs to trigger SJS/TEN or DRESS, and the in vivo and in vitro testing of the suspect drug. Skin biopsy confirms that the clinical diagnosis and delayed hypersensitivity tests, especially the patch test and the lymphoblastic transformation test (LTT), may be important to confirm the aetiological diagnosis, in our cases emphasising the latter. These diseases can be life threatening (especially DRESS and TEN) and/or have a high rate of major complications or sequelae (SJS/TEN). The three cases described progressed well without sequelae.

A Technical Support Unit supported the programme to operationalize guidelines, built capacity of health workers through training, monitored their clinical skills, mentored them and assured quality. The community-based health workers visited households to identify sick infants and referred them to the nearest BHU for further management. The research team collected data. Of 17 600 identified livebirths, 1860 young infants with any sign of PSBI sought care at BHUs and 1113 (59.8%) were brought by families.

71,55,55,19000857,"The skin infections are common in pediatrics, ranging from furonculosis or impetigo to the severe forms of necrotizing dermohypodermitis. The general antibiotic treatments are not always indicated but when they are, they must take into account the resistance of two main species of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes), the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamic parameters and the severity and type of infection. Two situations should be treated by topical treatements: limited impetigo and furonculosis. The two topical antibiotics used preferentially are mupirocine and fucidic acid. Soon, a third topical antibiotic, reptamuline will complete these. For uncomplicated superficial skin infections justifying an oral antibiotic, amoxicillin-clavulanate offers the best guarantee of efficiency. Poor pharmacodynamic-pharmacokinetic must lead to not prescribe oral M penicillins. In case of allergy, a first-generation cephalosporin, a macrolide (if the susceptibility of the strain was checked) or pristinamycine (after 6 years of age) are acceptable alternatives. For dermohypodermitis bacterial antibiotic of choice remains amoxicillin-clavulanate through IV route, to be active against S. pyogenes but also S. aureus and anaerobic bacteria. The IV route is maintained until regression general signs and a relay orally by the same drug is then possible.

73,57,57,20027983,"A first urinary tract infection (UTI) in childhood is more prevalent in females < 5-years-old. Circumcision generally protects males from UTI, however, during the month following the procedure, the prevalence of infection increases up to 12 times in circumcised boys when compared with those not circumcised. Almost all the infections are caused by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria of which E. coli are responsible for 70-90% of the cases. Signs and symptoms of UTI vary in different age groups. Factors associated with the likelihood of UTI are: non-circumcised male, fever > 40 degrees C, and a fever > 39 degrees C for more than 48 hours with no other focus of infection on physical examination. Urinalysis and urine microscopy are screening tests for UTI. In children with clinical symptoms and signs suggesting UTI, the results of these tests have a positive predictive value (if both are positive), or negative predictive value (if both are negative) approximating 100%. The definitive diagnosis of UTI is based on the urine culture. Bag urine culture is associated with a very high rate of contamination. Therefore, in non-toilet trained children, urine culture should be obtained directly from the urinary bladder either by supra pubic aspiration or in and out transurethral catheterization. Mid stream clean voided urine specimens obtained from circumcised males in the first months of life are also acceptable. Depending on the clinical presentation, oral therapy can begin from as early as two months of age, and the recommended empiric drugs for first febrile UTI are cefuroxime axetil, or amoxicillin clavulanate.

74,58,58,7792129,"Most authorities continue to recommend penicillin as the treatment of choice for group A streptococcal pharyngitis. If penicillin is used, 10 days of treatment are necessary to achieve a clinical and bacteriologic cure. The usually recommended penicillin V dose is 250 mg (400,000 IU) three times daily. Twice daily dosing is acceptable to some authorities if compliance is good. However, oral penicillin fails to eradicate group A streptococci from the pharynx in up to 17% of cases; in some studies 30% failure rates have been reported. Several European and United States studies indicate that a variety of oral cephalosporins, when used for 10 days, are significantly superior to penicillin V in eradicating group A streptococci from the pharynx. For example cefpodoxime proxetil given twice daily for 10 days is comparable to penicillin V given three times daily for 10 days in achieving a clinical cure and appears to be significantly superior to penicillin in eradicating group A streptococci from the pharynx. Preliminary studies from Europe and the United States strongly suggest that 5-day therapy with cefpodoxime (or other selected oral cephalosporins) is at least as effective, clinically and microbiologically, as 10-day therapy with penicillin V. Further clinical trials are warranted to confirm the adequacy of 5-day treatment and to assess the efficacy of cefpodoxime and other agents in preventing rheumatic fever.

As the first-line therapy, the Japanese Pediatric Guideline in H. pylori Infection has recommended a triple regimen with amoxicillin and clarithromycin, because the Japanese national health care insurance system has permitted only this regimen. However, the primary resistance to clarithromycin in Japan is demonstrated in around 30% of the strains, leaving an urgent issue for the physicians. A triple regimen with amoxicillin and metronidazole is acceptable as the second-line therapy. In children with chronic H. pylori gastritis, eradication should be considered if they have gastric atrophy or a family history of gastric cancer.

76,60,60,24064294,"To document the trends of sensitivity and to find whether it is necessary to change antibiotics in selected patients according to the sensitivity test results in our clinical practice. We collected urine culture results from 0-18-year-old patients in the National Taiwan University Hospital from January 1, 2003 to October 31, 2012. Their medical chart was reviewed to identify true pathogens responsible for their urinary tract infection (UTI). We checked the percentage of susceptibility of these pathogens to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate (AMC), cefazolin, cefmetazole, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline. The extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases (ESBLs) rate was also checked. In addition, we reviewed the treatment response of different antibiotics. Defervescence within 48 hours after initial antibiotics use was considered responsive. A total of 7758 urine cultures positive for Escherichia coli infection were collected during the 10-year period. The E. coli cefazolin susceptibility rate was 62-73% during 2003-2010, but it dropped to 23% in 2011 and 28% in 2012 after the new CLSI guideline (M100-S21) was released. However, other antibiotics did not show a significant difference. In UTI caused by E. coli, on average, the sensitivity rates for various antibiotics were as follows: cefmetazole, 90%; ceftriaxone, 85%; gentamicin, 77%; AMC, 61%; TMP-SMX, 47%; and ampicillin, 20%. The ESBL rate was also found to increase (2-11%; p < 0.01). The overall response rate of UTI caused by E. coli to first-line antibiotics such as first-generation cephalosporin and/or gentamicin was 78%. The susceptibility of common urinary tract pathogens to cefazolin has decreased dramatically since 2010. This trend may be due to the change in the CLSI guideline. Although the susceptibility rate to first-line empirical antibiotics shows a decreasing trend, we found that the clinical response was acceptable for our first-line empirical antibiotics.

77,61,61,28611102,"The World Health Organization recently provided guidelines for outpatient treatment of possible severe bacterial infections (PSBI) in young infants, when referral to hospital is not feasible. This study evaluated newborn infection treatment at the most peripheral level of the health system in rural Ethiopia. We performed a cluster-randomized trial in 22 geographical clusters (11 allocated to intervention, 11 to control). In both arms, volunteers and government-employed Health Extension Workers (HEWs) conducted home visits to pregnant and newly delivered mothers; assessed newborns; and counseled caregivers on prevention of newborn illness, danger signs, and care seeking. Volunteers referred sick newborns to health posts for further assessment; HEWs referred newborns with PSBI signs to health centers. In the intervention arm only, between July 2011 and June 2013, HEWs treated newborns with PSBI with intramuscular gentamicin and oral amoxicillin for 7 days at health posts when referral to health centers was not possible or acceptable to caregivers. Intervention communities were informed of treatment availability at health posts to encourage care seeking. Masking was not feasible. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality of newborns 2-27 days after birth, measured by household survey data. Baseline data were collected between June 2008 and May 2009; endline data, between February 2013 and June 2013. We sought to detect a 33% mortality reduction. Analysis was by intention to treat. (ClinicalTrials.gov registry: NCT00743691). Of 1,011 sick newborns presenting at intervention health posts, 576 (57%) were identified by HEWs as having at least 1 PSBI sign; 90% refused referral and were treated at the health post, with at least 79% completing the antibiotic regimen. Estimated treatment coverage at health posts was in the region of 50%. Post-day 1 neonatal mortality declined more in the intervention arm (17.9 deaths per 1,000 live births at baseline vs. 9.4 per 1,000 at endline) than the comparison arm (14.4 per 1,000 vs. 11.2 per 1,000, respectively). After adjusting for baseline mortality and region, the estimated post-day 1 mortality risk ratio was 0.83, but the result was not statistically significant (95% confidence interval, 0.55 to 1.24;  When referral to higher levels of care is not possible, HEWs can deliver outpatient antibiotic treatment of newborns with PSBI, but estimated treatment coverage in a rural Ethiopian setting was only around 50%.

Therefore these deaths could possibly be averted by creating community awareness and promoting care seeking from qualified physicians in the government system. The objective of study was to assess the effectiveness of facility-based and village-based behavior change communication interventions delivered to community using validated information, education and communication materials, along with infrastructural strengthening of health facilities, for change in care seeking from government system for community acquired pneumonia in rural Lucknow, India. Community based open labeled behavioral trial in 2 by 2 factorial design was conducted in eight rural blocks of Lucknow, northern India. Trained community health workers conducted Pneumonia Awareness Sessions once a month for the care givers of children using validated information, education and communication materials either at the villages or at government health facilities. Prior infrastructural strengthening of public health facilities was done to provide optimal care to cases. Pre packed pneumonia drug kits were provided which had amoxicillin, paracetamol and an instruction card on their use as well as pictorial representation of danger signs of pneumonia. Study lasted from October 2015 to September 2018. Adherence to conduct of facility-based intervention was 93.0% (279/300) and to village-based intervention was 73.4% (7638/10410).

79,63,63,20100746,"Observation without initial antibiotic therapy was accepted as an option for acute otitis media (AOM) management in the 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians clinical practice guideline. The guideline also recommended amoxicillin as the first-line treatment for most children, and analgesic treatment to reduce pain if it was present. Our objective was to compare the management of AOM after publication of the 2004 guideline. We analyzed the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 2002-2006 (N = 1114), which occurred in US physicians' offices. The patients were children aged 6 months to 12 years who were diagnosed with AOM. The time comparisons were the 30-month periods before and after the guideline. The main outcome was the encounter rate at which no antibiotic-prescribing was reported. Secondary outcomes were the identification of factors associated with encounters at which no antibiotic-prescribing was reported and antibiotic- and analgesic-prescribing rates. The rate of AOM encounters at which no antibiotic-prescribing was reported did not change after guideline publication (11%-16%; P = .103). Independent predictors of an encounter at which no antibiotic-prescribing was reported were the absence of ear pain, absence of reported fever, and receipt of an analgesic prescription. After guideline publication, the rate of amoxicillin-prescribing increased (40%-49%; P = .039), the rate of amoxicillin/clavulanate-prescribing decreased (23%-16%; P = .043), the rate of cefdinir-prescribing increased (7%-14%; P = .004), and the rate of analgesic-prescribing increased (14%-24%; P = .038). Although management of AOM without antibiotics has not increased after the publication of the 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians clinical practice guideline, children who did not receive antibiotics were more likely to have mild infections. In accordance with the guideline, the prescribing of amoxicillin and analgesics has increased. Contrary to the guideline, the prescribing of amoxicillin/clavulanate has decreased, whereas the prescribing of cefdinir has increased.

80,64,64,26774460,"The objectives of our study were to analyse the prescriptions of antibiotics and assessing the relevance of pharmacist interventions (PI) in outpatient consultations in a pediatric unit of a Teaching Hospital of Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study from May to December 2013. The analysis of antibiotic prescriptions was documented. The tool of PI classification validated by the French Society of Clinical Pharmacy was used. The PI rating was made by prescribers. This rating evolved from PI0 to PI3 depending on the severity of the clinical impact of the problem and to the severity of clinical consequences avoided by the PI. The relevance was evaluated by the PI acceptance rate by physicians and clinical evaluation of their impact. Our study included 150 patients with a mean age of 11.75 months and a sex ratio (M/F) of 2. The amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (27.2 %) and amoxicillin (22.3 %) were the most prescribed antibiotics. Sixty-three drug-related problems (DRPs) were detected on the antibiotic prescriptions. They were non-optimal drug administration plan (88.9 %) and underdose (11.1 %). The amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (61.9 %) and josamycin (17.4 %) were the most affected by these DRPs. PI were related to the precision of modes of drug administration (88.9 %) and dose adjustments (11.1 %). The prescribers accepted 93.7 % of PIs.

81,65,65,16601883,"Persistent trimethylaminuria in children is caused by autosomal recessively inherited impairment of hepatic trimethylamine (TMA) oxidation due to deficiency of flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) secondary to mutations in the FMO3 gene. Trimethylaminuria or 'fish odour syndrome' is due to excessive excretion into body fluids and breath of TMA derived from the enterobacterial metabolism of dietary precursors. The disorder is present from birth but becomes apparent as foods containing high amounts of choline or of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) from marine (sea or saltwater) fish are introduced into the diet. In our experience, trimethylaminuria (FMO3 deficiency) in children is rare. We have compared the dynamics and diagnostic efficacy of choline loading with marine fish meals in six children with trimethylaminuria. Loading with a marine fish meal provides a simple and acceptable method for confirmation of diagnosis of suspected trimethylaminuria in children, with the effects being cleared more quickly than with a choline load test. However, oral loading with choline bitartrate allows estimation of residual oxidative capacity in vivo and is a useful adjunct to molecular studies. Patients homozygous for the 'common' P153L mutation in the FMO3 gene showed virtual complete lack of residual TMA N-oxidative capacity, consistent with a nonfunctional or absent FMO3 enzyme, whereas a patient with the M82T mutation showed some residual oxidative capacity. A patient compound heterozygous for two novel mutations, G193E and R483T, showed considerable residual N-oxidative capacity. A further patient, heterozygous for two novel sequence variations in the FMO3 gene, consistently showed malodour and elevated urinary TMA/TMAO ratios under basal conditions but a negative response to both choline and marine fish meal loading. Comparison of the effects of administration of antibiotics (metronidazole, amoxicillin, neomycin) on gut bacterial production of trimethylamine from choline showed they all reduced TMA production to a limited extent, with neomycin being most effective.

Using World Health Organization growth standards, we created 4 weight bands and then matched them to height and age 50th percentile growth curves. The resulting weight, height, and age bands were then applied to Ugandan and Bangladeshi anthropometric data sets, and the percentage of children who would have received a correct therapeutic dose based upon weight, height, or age was determined. This percentage was interpreted as acceptable if >95%, marginal if 90% to 95% and unacceptable if <90%. Applying the 4 weight bands to the 6 selected drugs, greater than 95% of children would have received an acceptable therapeutic dose across the 4 weight bands for each of the 6 drugs tested. None of the drugs tested would deliver an acceptable therapeutic dose across all bands based upon height or age among Ugandan children, and only co-trimoxazole would have been delivered at acceptable therapeutic levels based upon these bands in Bangladeshi children. For the 6 drugs tested, dispersible tablets prescribed on the basis of a 4-dose regimen determined by weight bands would deliver an acceptable therapeutic dose greater than 95% of the time.

We aimed to assess whether use of simplified antibiotic regimens to treat young infants with clinical signs of severe infection was as efficacious as an injectable procaine benzylpenicillin-gentamicin combination for 7 days for situations in which hospital referral was not possible. In a multisite open-label equivalence trial in DR Congo, Kenya, and Nigeria, community health workers visited all newborn babies at home, identifying and referring unwell young infants to a study nurse. We stratified young infants with clinical signs of severe infection whose parents did not accept referral to hospital by age (0-6 days and 7-59 days), and randomly assigned each individual within these strata to receive one of the four treatment regimens. Randomisation was stratified by age group of infants. An age-stratified randomisation scheme with block size of eight was computer-generated off-site at WHO. The outcome assessor was masked. We randomly allocated infants to receive injectable procaine benzylpenicillin-gentamicin for 7 days (group A, reference group); injectable gentamicin and oral amoxicillin for 7 days (group B); injectable procaine benzylpenicillin-gentamicin for 2 days, then oral amoxicillin for 5 days (group C); or injectable gentamicin for 2 days and oral amoxicillin for 7 days (group D). Trained health professionals gave daily injections and the first dose of oral amoxicillin. Our primary outcome was treatment failure by day 8 after enrolment, defined as clinical deterioration, development of a serious adverse event (including death), no improvement by day 4, or not cured by day 8. Independent outcome assessors, who did not know the infant's treatment regimen, assessed study outcomes on days 4, 8, 11, and 15. Primary analysis was per protocol. We used a prespecified similarity margin of 5% to assess equivalence between regimens. This study is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12610000286044. In Kenya and Nigeria, we started enrolment on April 4, 2011, and we enrolled the necessary number of young infants aged 7 days or older from Oct 17, 2011, to April 30, 2012.

We excluded 200 randomly assigned infants, who did not fulfil the predefined criteria of adherence to treatment and adequate follow-up. In the per-protocol analysis, 828 infants were included in group A, 826 in group B, 862 in group C, and 848 in group D. 67 (8%) infants failed treatment in group A compared with 51 (6%) infants in group B (risk difference -1·9%, 95% CI -4·4 to 0·1), 65 (8%) in group C (-0·6%, -3·1 to 2·0), and 46 (5%) in group D (-2·7%, -5·1 to 0·3). Treatment failure in groups B, C, and D was within the similarity margin compared with group A.

After each antimicrobial test dose, subjects rated the taste on a 10-cm visual analog scale incorporating a facial hedonic scale. Preference assessments for the best-tasting and worst-tasting agent were also conducted. Of the 20 children who expressed a preference, significantly more children (9 [45%], P<.05) selected the cefixime preparation as the best-tasting formulation compared with the other preparations. The cefixime preparation was also significantly the least likely to be selected as the worst-tasting preparation (2 [10%], P<.05). There were no significant differences between the other 3 preparations with respect to being selected as either the best or worst tasting. The mean (+/- SD) visual analog scale score for cefixime was highest (8.53 [2.49]) compared with the scores for azithromycin (6.78 [3.45]), cefprozil (6.26 [4.04]), and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (6.24 [4.01]). The cefixime preparation was most commonly rated as best tasting by children.

88,72,72,10608630,"Noncompliance with a prescribed therapy is a common problem in ambulatory pediatrics. To establish a nationwide status quo of compliance of German ambulatory pediatric patients with oral antibiotics prescribed for various bacterial infections. In this study, organized and financed by the German Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases, 42 pediatricians in private practice who were selected to represent the 3 main regions of Germany and residence in large cities or small towns, respectively, enrolled consecutive patients who had bacterial infections that required therapy with oral antibiotics. Choice of agent and duration of treatment were left to the study physicians. Compliance was measured by a standardized telephone interview on the penultimate day and a urine bioassay for antibacterial activity on the last day of the planned treatment period. Parents did not know the true purpose of the study. Five hundred eight-four patients were fully evaluable. The most frequent diagnoses included tonsillopharyngitis (n = 231), otitis media (n = 170) and lower respiratory tract infections (n = 114). Most frequently prescribed antibiotics included amoxicillin (n = 102), potassium penicillin V (n = 81) and clarithromycin (n = 67). Overall compliance (positive urine test) on the last day of therapy was 69.5% (406 of 584 patients). Compliance was not significantly influenced by the region of residence or the underlying bacterial infection. It was significantly associated with the antibiotic used (macrolides, 89.0%; penicillins, 62.2%; cephalosporins, 66.4%; P = 0.0001 for macrolides vs. the others). Best compliance was found with clarithromycin (94.0%) and erythromycin estolate (89.8%). Compliance was also significantly better in patients > or =6 years old (77.7%; P = 0.016); with a treatment duration of < or =7 days (77.6%; P = 0.014); when the drug package contained a dose-taking reminder (79.7%; P = 0.003); and when the pediatrician's behavior toward the patient was assessed by the parents as ""very sympathetic"" or ""sympathetic"" (72.6%; P = 0.017). Subjecting all variables to logistic regression analysis, we found 3 variables to be significant predictors of treatment compliance: choice of antibiotic (P = 0.0001); patient age (P = 0.0008); and residence in town or city (P = 0.03). A noncompliance rate of >30% is unsatisfactory. Whereas some variables significantly associated with compliance cannot be influenced (patient age; place of residence in town or city), others are amenable to modifications. These include the physician-patient interaction and the choice of antibiotic. Agents should be preferred that are well-accepted by patients, that enable short-term therapy with few daily doses and with a package that contains a dose-taking reminder.

89,73,73,17671053,"In 2004, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians released a clinical practice guideline on the management of acute otitis media that included endorsement of an observation option for selected cases and recommendations of specific antibiotics. We sought to describe primary care physicians' current management of acute otitis media to compare it with the guideline's recommendations and describe trends since 2004. We used a mail survey from March through June 2006 within the Slone Center Office-Based Research Network, a national practice-based pediatric research network. The response rate was 299 (62.7%) of 477. The observation option was considered reasonable by 83.3%, compared with 88.0% in 2004, and was used in a median of 15% of acute otitis media cases over the previous 3 months. The most common physician-identified barriers to the use of the observation option were parental reluctance (83.5%) and the cost and difficulty of follow-up of children who do not improve (30.9%). In terms of antibiotic choices for acute otitis media, agreement with the guideline's antibiotic recommendation for 4 common clinical scenarios was as follows: high-dose amoxicillin for acute otitis media with nonsevere symptoms (57.2%), high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate for acute otitis media with severe symptoms (12.7%), high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate for cases that failed to respond to amoxicillin (42.8%), and intramuscular ceftriaxone for cases that failed to respond to treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate (16.7%). Each of these proportions declined from 2004. Most primary care physicians accept the concept of an observation option for acute otitis media but use it only occasionally. Antibiotics prescribed for acute otitis media differ markedly from the guideline's recommendations, and the difference has increased since 2004.

90,74,74,2648939,"In a multicenter study, Augmentin pediatric suspension was given to 1,227 young children (3 months - 3 years) with otitis media seen in private practice. Patterns of otitis included first episodes, recurrences, and forms that had failed to respond to previous antimicrobial therapy. The study medication was given as a first-line treatment, on the basis of epidemiologic data, in a daily dose of 40 mg/kg for 7 to 10 days. In the 3 months to 3 years age group, two micro-organisms are prevalent, ie. Haemophilus influenzae, which is the most common agent and may produce beta-lactamases (10 to 18% of strains), and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Among our patients, the otitis-conjunctivitis syndrome caused by Haemophilus influenzae was fairly frequent (8.7% of cases). Clinical effectiveness as evaluated between D8 and D11 was good or very good in 91.2% of cases. Tolerance was satisfactory in 83% of patients. Side effects were uncommon and consisted primarily in gastrointestinal symptoms. We point out the potentially deleterious effect of concurrent anti-inflammatory treatment. Acceptability of the suspension was judged satisfactory by the parents in 91.6% of cases. Augmentin proved well-suited to epidemiologic data, outstandingly effective, well tolerated, and easy to use because of its presentation as a pediatric suspension; it is therefore an appropriate first-line drug in the common indication addressed in our study.

This study used a decision-analytic model to simulate the costs and consequences of the ototopical treatment of AOMT. The AOMT model consisted of 3 tiers of antimicrobial therapy. Each successive tier represented the repeat treatment of clinical failures from the preceding tier. Patients were modeled for treatment until cured or until third-tier therapy was complete, at which time patients were considered cured. First-tier therapy modeled a comparison of CD and OFX using efficacy rates taken from a randomized clinical trial with a population of 599 patients. Second-tier therapy modeled the use of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid using an efficacy rate taken from the medical literature. Third-tier therapy was modeled as being pathogen specific and could follow 1 of 3 possible clinical pathways: (1) PO fluconazole, (2) IM ceftriaxone, or (3) IV antibiotics administered in a hospital setting. Third-tier therapeutic pathway probabilities were based on the microbiologic spectrum of the treatment failures from the clinical trial. Cost information (in year-2003 US dollars) was taken from accepted cost reference sources and presented from the perspective of a third-party payer. The economic outcome of interest was the cost-effectiveness threshold of CD relative to OFX. Given the model parameters, CD had a cost-effectiveness threshold value of 4.5 times the wholesale acquisition cost of OFX. Based on actual cost, first-tier CD therapy was more cost-effective than OFX up to a threshold price of US 152.64 dollars. In this decision-analytic model, CD was more cost-effective than OFX for AOMT therapy in pediatric patients up to a threshold price of 4.5 times the price of OFX.

92,76,76,15930204,"The widespread use of antibiotics for treatment of acute otitis media (AOM) has resulted in the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens that are difficult to treat. However, it has been shown that most children with nonsevere AOM recover without ABX. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety, efficacy, acceptability, and costs of a non-ABX intervention for children with nonsevere AOM. Children 6 months to 12 years old with AOM were screened by using a novel AOM-severity screening index. Parents of children with nonsevere AOM received an educational intervention, and their children were randomized to receive either immediate antibiotics (ABX; amoxicillin plus symptom medication) or watchful waiting (WW; symptom medication only). The investigators, but not the parents, were blinded to enrollment status. Primary outcomes included parent satisfaction with AOM care, resolution of symptoms, AOM failure/recurrence, and nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains resistant to ABX. Secondary outcomes included medication-related adverse events, serious adverse events, unanticipated AOM-related office and emergency department visits and telephone calls, the child's absence from day care or school resulting from AOM, the parent's absence from school or work because of their child's AOM, and costs of treatment. Subjects were defined as failing (days 0-12) or recurring (days 13-30) if they experienced a higher AOM-severity score on reexamination. A total of 223 subjects were recruited: 73% were nonwhite, 57% were <2 years old, 47% attended day care, 82% had experienced prior AOM, and 83% had not been fully immunized with heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine. One hundred twelve were randomized to ABX, and 111 were randomized to WW. Ninety-four percent of the subjects were followed to the 30-day end point. Parent satisfaction with AOM care was not different between the 2 treatment groups at either day 12 or 30. Compared with WW, symptom scores on days 1 to 10 resolved faster in subjects treated with immediate ABX. At day 12, among the immediate-ABX group, 69% of tympanic membranes and 25% of tympanograms were normal, compared with 51% of normal tympanic membranes and 10% of normal tympanograms in the WW group. Parents of children in the ABX group gave their children fewer doses of pain medication than did parents of children in the WW group. Subjects in the ABX group experienced 16% fewer failures than subjects in the WW group. Of the children in the WW group, 66% completed the study without needing ABX. Immediate ABX resulted in eradication of S pneumoniae carriage in the majority of children, but S pneumoniae strains cultured from children in the ABX group at day 12 were more likely to be multidrug-resistant than strains from children in the WW group. More ABX-related adverse events were noted in the ABX group, compared with the WW group. No serious AOM-related adverse events were observed in either group. Office and emergency department visits, phone calls, and days of work/school missed were not different between groups. Prescriptions for ABX were reduced by 73% in the WW group compared with the ABX group. Costs of ABX averaged $47.41 per subject in the ABX group and $11.43 in the WW group. Sixty-six percent of subjects in the WW group completed the study without ABX. Parent satisfaction was the same between groups regardless of treatment. Compared with WW, immediate ABX treatment was associated with decreased numbers of treatment failures and improved symptom control but increased ABX-related adverse events and a higher percent carriage of multidrug-resistant S pneumoniae strains in the nasopharynx at the day-12 visit. Key factors in implementing a WW strategy were (a) a method to classify AOM severity; (b) parent education; (c) management of AOM symptoms; (d) access to follow-up care; and (e) use of an effective ABX regimen, when needed. When these caveats are observed, WW may be an acceptable alternative to immediate ABX for some children with nonsevere AOM.

Although a syringe would measure dosages more accurately, most oral medications have a broad acceptable dose range. A possible advantage of syringes is that parents who receive these may be more impressed with the importance of treatment than those prescribed medications by teaspoon. To test this hypothesis, 72 patients below 24 months of age with otitis media were randomly divided into a group that received a prescription indicating amoxicillin should be given by teaspoon and a group that received a labeled syringe for this purpose. The qualitative presence of the antibiotic in urine at seven-day follow-up visit was 56 per cent among the teaspoon users and 67 per cent among syringe users, while return rates for one week appointments were 51 per cent and 32 per cent, respectively. Neither difference was significant.

In this narrative review, we re-examine the properties of oral amoxicillin and clavulanic acid and provide guidance on their use, with emphasis on the preferred use of amoxicillin alone. Published medical literature (MEDLINE database via Pubmed). While amoxicillin and clavulanic acid have similar half-lives, clavulanic acid is more protein bound and even less heat stable than amoxicillin, with primarily hepatic metabolism. It is also more strongly associated with gastrointestinal side effects, including Clostridium difficile infection, and, thus, in oral combination formulations, limits the maximum daily dose of amoxicillin that can be given. The first ratio for an amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination was set at 4:1 due to clavulanic acid's high affinity for β-lactamases; ratios of 2:1, 7:1, 14:1 and 16:1 are currently available in various regions. Comparative effectiveness data for the different ratios are scarce. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is often used as empiric therapy for many of the World Health Organization's Priority Infectious Syndromes in adults and children, leading to extensive consumption, when some of these syndromes could be handled with a delayed antibiotic prescription approach or amoxicillin alone. Using available epidemiological and pharmacokinetic data, we provide guidance on indications for amoxicillin versus amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and on optimal oral administration, including choice of combination ratio.

97,1,1,36031053,"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common infection among pregnant women and have been associated with maternal and foetal complications. Antimicrobial exposure during pregnancy is not without risk. International guidelines recommend a single screen-and-treat approach to asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB); however, this approach has been questioned by recent studies. The aim of this narrative review was to assess the pathophysiology, current risk factors and management of UTI during pregnancy, its impact on pregnancy outcomes, and to develop recommendations on the best use of antimicrobials. PubMed, Cochrane database, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Owing to the physiological changes related to pregnancy, pregnant women are at higher risk of UTI. All types of UTIs combined have been estimated to affect approximately 2% to 15% of women. ASB affects 2% to 7% of pregnant women. Recent studies do not provide good-quality evidence for an association between ASB and acute pyelonephritis if ASB is untreated. There is low-to-moderate-quality evidence that treatment of ASB results in a reduction in the incidence of low birth weight and preterm birth, which justifies screening practices for ASB with only a single urine culture in the first trimester. If the clinician opts for treatment, a short course of β-lactams, nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin should be favoured. Studies on cystitis during pregnancy are limited. Acute pyelonephritis has been shown to be associated with increased maternal complications and in some studies has also been associated with preterm delivery and low birth weight. Preferred antimicrobials for the management of pyelonephritis are amoxicillin combined with an aminoglycoside, third-generation cephalosporins, or carbapenems. Studies on recurrent UTIs during pregnancy are limited, making it difficult to draw conclusions regarding prophylactic measures.

98,2,2,23529866,"The adequate management of central nervous system (CNS) infections requires that antimicrobial agents penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and achieve concentrations in the CNS adequate for eradication of the infecting pathogen. This review details the currently available literature on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of antibacterials in the CNS of children. Clinical trials affirm that the physicochemical properties of a drug remain one of the most important factors dictating penetration of antimicrobial agents into the CNS, irrespective of the population being treated (i.e. small, lipophilic drugs with low protein binding exhibit the best translocation across the BBB). These same physicochemical characteristics determine the primary disposition pathways of the drug, and by extension the magnitude and duration of circulating drug concentrations in the plasma, a second major driving force behind achievable CNS drug concentrations. Notably, these disposition pathways can be expected to change during the normal process of growth and development. Finally, CNS drug penetration is influenced by the nature and extent of the infection (i.e. the presence of meningeal inflammation). Aminoglycosides have poor CNS penetration when administered intravenously. Intrathecal gentamicin has been studied in children with more promising results, often exceeding the minimum inhibitory concentration. There are very limited data with intrathecal tobramycin in children. However, in the few patients that have been studied, the CSF concentrations were highly variable. Penicillins generally have good CNS penetration. Aqueous penicillin G reaches greater concentrations than procaine or benzathine penicillin. Concentrations remain detectable for ≥ 12 h. Of the aminopenicillins, both ampicillin and parenteral amoxicillin reach adequate CNS concentrations; however, orally administered amoxicillin resulted in much lower concentrations. Nafcillin and piperacillin are the final two penicillins with pediatric data: their penetration is erratic at best. Cephalosporins vary greatly in regard to their CSF penetration. Few first- and second-generation cephalosporins are able to reach higher CSF concentrations. Cefuroxime is the only exception and is usually avoided due to its adverse effects and slower sterilization of the CSF than third-generation agents. Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefixime and cefepime have been studied in children and are all able to adequately penetrate the CSF. As with penicillins, concentrations are greatest in the presence of meningeal inflammation. Meropenem and imipenem are the only carbapenems with pediatric data. Imipenem reaches higher CSF concentrations; however, meropenem is preferred due to its lower incidence of seizures. Aztreonam has also demonstrated favorable penetration but only one study has been completed in children. Both chloramphenicol and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (cotrimoxazole) penetrate into the CNS well; however, significant toxicities limit their use. The small size and minimal protein binding of fosfomycin contribute to its favorable CNS PK. Although rarely used, it achieves higher concentrations in the presence of inflammation and accumulation is possible. Linezolid reaches high CSF concentrations; however, more frequent dosing might be required in infants due to their increased elimination. Metronidazole also has very limited information but it demonstrated favorable results similar to adult data; CSF concentrations even exceeded plasma concentrations at certain time points. Rifampin (rifampicin) demonstrated good CNS penetration after oral administration. Vancomycin demonstrates poor CNS penetration after intravenous administration. When combined with intraventricular therapy, CNS concentrations are much greater. Of the antituberculosis agents, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and streptomycin have been studied in children. Isoniazid and pyrazinamide have favorable CSF penetration. Streptomycin appears to produce unpredictable CSF levels. No pediatric-specific data are available for clindamycin, daptomycin, macrolides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones. Daptomycin, fluoroquinolones, and tetracyclines have demonstrated favorable CNS penetration in adults; however, data are limited due to their potential pediatric-specific toxicities and newness within the marketplace. Macrolides and clindamycin have demonstrated poor CNS penetration in adults and thus have not been studied in pediatrics.

99,3,3,14726904,"Treatment guidelines developed by the Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) were originally published in 2000. These guidelines were designed to: (1) educate clinicians and patients (or patients’ families) about the differences between viral and bacterial rhinosinusitis; (2) reduce the use of antibiotics for nonbacterial nasal/sinus disease; (3) provide recommendations for the diagnosis and optimal treatment of ABRS; (4) promote the use of appropriate antibiotic therapy when bacterial infection is likely; and (5) describe the current understanding of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics and how they relate to the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy. The original guidelines are updated here to include the most recent information on management principles, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, and therapeutic options. An estimated 20 million cases of ABRS occur annually in the United States. According to National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) data, sinusitis is the fifth most common diagnosis for which an antibiotic is prescribed. Sinusitis accounted for 9% and 21% of all pediatric and adult antibiotic prescriptions, respectively, written in 2002. The primary diagnosis of sinusitis results in expenditures of approximately $3.5 billion per year in the United States. ABRS is most often preceded by a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI). Allergy, trauma, dental infection, or other factors that lead to inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses may also predispose individuals to developing ABRS. Patients with a “common cold” (viral URI) usually report some combination of the following symptoms: sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, hyposmia/anosmia, facial pressure, postnasal drip, sore throat, cough, ear fullness, fever, and myalgia. A change in the color or the characteristic of the nasal discharge is not a specific sign of a bacterial infection. Bacterial superinfection may occur at any time during the course of a viral URI. The risk that bacterial superinfection has occurred is greater if the illness is still present after 10 days. Because there may be cases that fall out of the “norm” of this typical progression, practicing clinicians need to rely on their clinical judgment when using these guidelines. In general, however, a diagnosis of ABRS may be made in adults or children with symptoms of a viral URI that have not improved after 10 days or worsen after 5 to 7 days. There may be some or all of the following signs and symptoms: nasal drainage, nasal congestion, facial pressure/pain (especially when unilateral and focused in the region of a particular sinus), postnasal drainage, hyposmia/anosmia, fever, cough, fatigue, maxillary dental pain, and ear pressure/fullness. Physical examination provides limited information in the diagnosis of ABRS. While sometimes helpful, plain film radiographs, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging scans are not necessary for cases of ABRS. The most common bacterial species isolated from the maxillary sinuses of patients with ABRS are  The increasing prevalence of penicillin nonsusceptibility and resistance to other drug classes among  These guidelines apply to both adults and children. When selecting antibiotic therapy for ABRS, the clinician should consider the severity of the disease, the rate of progression of the disease, and recent antibiotic exposure. The guidelines now divide patients with ABRS into two general categories: (1) those with mild symptoms who have not received antibiotics within the past 4 to 6 weeks, and (2) those with mild disease who have received antibiotics within the past 4 to 6 weeks or those with moderate disease regardless of recent antibiotic exposure. The difference in severity of disease does not imply infection with a resistant pathogen. Rather, this terminology indicates the relative degree of acceptance of possible treatment failure and the likelihood of spontaneous resolution of symptoms—patients with more severe symptoms are less likely to resolve their disease spontaneously. The primary goal of antibiotic therapy is to eradicate bacteria from the site of infection, which, in turn, helps (1) return the sinuses back to health; (2) decrease the duration of symptoms to allow patients to resume daily activities more quickly; (3) prevent severe complications such as meningitis and brain abscess; and (4) decrease the development of chronic disease. Severe or life-threatening infections with or without complications are rare, and are not addressed in these guidelines. Prior antibiotic use is a major risk factor associated with the development of infection with antimicrobial-resistant strains. Because recent antimicrobial exposure increases the risk of carriage of and infection due to resistant organisms, antimicrobial therapy should be based upon the patient’s history of recent antibiotic use. The panel’s guidelines, therefore, stratify patients according to antibiotic exposure in the previous 4 to 6 weeks. Lack of response to therapy at ≥72 hours is an arbitrary time established to define treatment failures. Clinicians should monitor the response to antibiotic therapy, which may include instructing the patient to call the office or clinic if symptoms persist or worsen over the next few days. The predicted bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of antibiotics in adults and children has been determined according to mathematical modeling of ABRS developed by Michael Poole, MD, PhD, based on pathogen distribution, resolution rates without treatment, and in vitro microbiologic activity. Antibiotics can be placed into the following relative rank order of predicted clinical efficacy for adults: 90% to 92% = respiratory fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), ceftriaxone, high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (4 g/250 mg/day), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (1.75 g/250 mg/day); 83% to 88% = high-dose amoxicillin (4 g/day), amoxicillin (1.5 g/day), cefpodoxime proxetil, cefixime (based on  ",Antimicrobial treatment guidelines for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis,"Anon JB, Jacobs MR, Poole MD, Ambrose PG, Benninger MS, Hadley JA, Craig WA; Sinus And Allergy Health Partnership.",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2004 Jan;130(1 Suppl):1-45. doi: 10.1016/j.otohns.2003.12.003.,Anon JB,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,2004,2004/01/17,PMC7118847,,10.1016/j.otohns.2003.12.003
100,4,4,20557952,"Tonsillectomy is the most common surgery performed in the pediatric and young adult populations. Although recent guidelines based on meta-analysis suggest that perioperative chemoprophylaxis plays a role in reducing bacteraemia-related post-tonsillectomy complications, there is no evidence or agreement upon which specific antibiotic, dosage or administration route should be preferred. Since few previous studies have assessed the effectiveness of prophylaxis by direct measurement of antibiotic levels both in plasma and tissue, we designed an experimental study to quantitatively evaluate amoxicillin concentrations in children ready for tonsillectomy and compare these plasma and tissue levels with the Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) of the bacteria more commonly involved in the upper airway infections. Thirty-three pediatric patients under 14 years of age (median 5.0, IQR 4-7, range 3-11; M:F 18:15) with recurrent tonsillitis were treated with 3 doses (established on patient's weight) of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid given orally the day before plus a further dose 2h before tonsillectomy. Amoxicillin concentrations on both homogenated tonsillar cores and plasma were measured by HPLC-UV. Bacterial epidemiology and susceptibility were derived respectively from survey data collected by Microbiology Unit and MIC according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Median plasma and tissue amoxicillin concentrations were respectively 4.7 microg/ml (IQR 2.1-8.0; min-max 0.4-14.3) and 1.1 microg/g (IQR 0.4-2.1; min-max 0.4-12.9), considerably below the selected target MIC of pathogens involved in the upper respiratory tract infections (S. aureus, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis). 20 Children showed undetectable amoxicillin levels in one or both tonsils. Interestingly, 7 out of these patients (35%) had plasma concentrations higher than the target MIC (8 microg/ml). No patient displayed plasma concentrations under the limit of sensitivity of the method. Poor core-plasma and left-right core correlation was observed among patients, suggesting that fibrosis developed after recurrent tonsillitis may hamper antibiotic penetration. Based upon direct measurement of antibiotic levels in plasma and tissue, this study suggests that a revision of the oral prophylaxis in children is required in order to reduce microbial charge in the operative field and accordingly improve the recovery after tonsillectomy.

We sought to describe short-term adverse effects and treatment failures among young children receiving oral doxycycline for Lyme disease. We completed a 2-pronged evaluation of children with Lyme disease treated with doxycycline. We performed a retrospective case series of patients <8 years old who were diagnosed with Lyme disease and treated with doxycycline. We then performed a telephone follow-up survey study of the patients' parents to gather additional details regarding clinical outcomes and adverse reactions to doxycycline. Descriptive statistics were calculated. A total of 32 patients were identified through the retrospective case series and 18 participated in the follow-up survey. The most common clinical diagnosis (22/32; 69%) was single erythema migrans. Seven (22%) had neurological Lyme disease. Three patients (9%) stopped doxycycline treatment prematurely due to adverse effects. During telephone follow-up, 2 children were reported to have dental staining. No patients were identified with treatment failure during the retrospective case series. On telephone follow-up, 3 patients had residual symptoms after treatment, though none were convincing of treatment failure. Our study suggests that doxycycline is generally well-tolerated and an effective treatment of Lyme disease in young children. Prospective, observational studies with long-term assessment of dental staining and clinical outcomes are needed. Alternative antibiotics, principally amoxicillin, remain the preferred treatment of non-neurological Lyme disease manifestations in young children, but doxycycline is likely a safe and effective alternative when needed.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has recognized the inappropriate, indiscriminate, and irrational use of antibiotics leading to antibiotic resistance as a global problem. The objective of this survey is to compare the antibiotic prescription pattern and the awareness of antibiotic resistance among Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) practitioners and pediatric dentists. A hundred BDS practitioners and 100 pediatric dentists included in the study were given a questionnaire containing both open-ended and closed-ended questions. The questionnaire comprised information pertaining to antibiotic prescription for most common oral conditions, commonly prescribed antibiotics, their dosage, etc. The majority of the practitioners prescribed antibiotics for managing oral diseases. On comparing the prescription patterns between the BDS practitioners and pediatric dentists, there was an overprescription in the BDS group for many conditions, which was statistically significant. Amoxicillin was the most commonly prescribed drug in both the groups. In the presence of an anaerobic infection, the most preferred drug was a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid with metronidazole. With regard to the duration of antibiotic prescription, 74% BDS practitioners prescribed antibiotics as a 3-day course and 60% pediatric dentists resorted to a 5-day course, which was statistically significant. The awareness regarding antibiotic prophylaxis and antibiotic resistance was found to be adequate in both the groups. However, there was a general lack of awareness with regard to the guidelines for antibiotic prescribing in both the groups. Practitioners should prescribe antibiotics in accordance with the guidelines to curb antibiotic resistance, an emerging public health problem.

Our study is the first to evaluate the impact of taste on prescribing patterns of antibiotic suspensions. The objective was to determine if taste testing common antibiotic suspensions altered prescribing patterns of medical residents, through data extracted from the electronic health record. After assessing 5 ""primer"" tastes (sweet, salty, bitter, sour, umami [savory]), residents were randomized to sample 6 antibiotic suspensions to rate their taste perception. A 12-month retrospective and prospective analysis of outpatient prescribing practices of the residents followed, and the results were compared to the resident cohort randomized to no taste test. The 43 residents prescribed 207 liquid antibiotic prescriptions for 176 patients, with no difference in patient characteristics between residents in the taste test versus non-taste test group. Although amoxicillin was most preferable and amoxicillin-clavulanate least, the only significant finding was a greater prescribing rate of cefdinir among those who had tasted it and an inverse relationship between cephalexin taste preference and percentage prescribing amoxicillin in the taste group. Residents who tasted were poor in identifying primer tastes, but this did not impact prescribing patterns. Among 6 commonly prescribed antibiotic suspensions, amoxicillin remains a highly preferred taste among prescribers. Interestingly, after the taste test there was a significantly greater prescribing rate of cefdinir among those who had tasted it and somewhat lower prescribing rate for amoxicillin-clavulanate.

105,9,9,20152073,"Upper respiratory tract infections in children are common and usually self-limiting conditions, which include acute otitis media (AOM), acute rhinosinusitis (ARS), and acute pharyngitis (AP). Management of pediatric AOM considers observation strategy for selected and uncomplicated cases, older than 2 years of age, only when adequate follow-up can be ensured. Otherwise, an antibiotic treatment should be prescribed. Amoxicillin should be preferred as the first-choice therapy. Switch therapy to ceftriaxone is suggested if amoxicillin regimen failure occurs within 48-72 hours. The diagnosis of ARS is established by the persistence of purulent nasal of post-nasal draining lasting at least 10 days especially if accompanied by supporting symptoms and signs. Amoxicillin is the first choice drug for mild ARS in children. When symptoms persist or worsen, amoxicillin/clavulanate or cefpodoxime proxetil, or ceftriaxone are recommended. Clinical criteria alone are not sufficiently accurate in children with AP to distinguish bacterial and viral etiology. Thus microbiological evaluation is needed and positive throat culture or rapid antigen detection test are required to establish the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis and consequently to prescribe antibiotic treatment.

106,10,10,14632102,"Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) is the most common bacterial cause of acute pharyngitis. Although children infected with GABHS will recover clinically without antibiotics, treatment is recommended in order to prevent acute rheumatic fever and probably suppurative complications, hasten resolution of clinical signs and symptoms, and prevent transmission to close contacts. Streptococcal pharyngitis usually cannot be reliably distinguished from other etiologies on the basis of epidemiologic or physical findings, and therefore a throat culture or a rapid antigen detection test is generally necessary to confirm the diagnosis. All isolates of GABHS are sensitive to penicillins and cephalosporins, whereas resistance to macrolides has been identified in some geographic regions. The recommended first-line therapy for streptococcal pharyngitis is a 10-day course of penicillin V, usually given 2 or 3 times per day. A number of alternatives to penicillin V are available, including other penicillins, macrolides, and cephalosporins. As a class, the cephalosporins are noteworthy because they may provide somewhat higher bacteriologic eradication rates than penicillin V. Many cephalosporins can be administered twice daily, but they also must be given for 10 days. Two third-generation cephalosporins, cefdinir and cefpodoxime proxetil, are approved for use in a more convenient 5-day dosing schedule, thus possibly increasing the likelihood of adherence to the full course of therapy. Palatability is also an important consideration when prescribing antibiotics to children. In a series of studies, children preferred the pleasant strawberry-cream taste of cefdinir to that of amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefprozil, and azithromycin. Cefdinir may offer an alternative to penicillin V for children with streptococcal pharyngitis, particularly when compliance is a clinical concern.

Although several anti-bacterial agents were proved to have the effect of alleviating bronchitis, their relative efficacies and potential side effects remained not clear. We are keen to compare the pathogen eradication rate and safety of anti-bacterial agents for bronchitis. Relevant studies were searched in multiple sources and data were extracted from eligible studies. Then conventional meta-analysis and network meta-analysis (NMA) were conducted to determine the relative efficacy and safety of bronchitis medications. The efficacy of bronchitis medications was determined by using the outcome of pathogen eradication, including total pathogen eradication, pathogen eradication of Haemophilus influenzae, pathogen eradication of Moraxella catarrhalis, and pathogen eradication of Streptococcus pneumoniae. In addition, safety was assessed by using the outcome of adverse effects and diarrhoea. A 27 RCTs with 9,414 participants were included in the study. Among the medications, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited better performance than clarithromycin with respect to pathogen eradication of H. influenzae (OR = 21.37, CI: 1.22-541.28; OR = 7.43, CI: 1.79-30.50). Clarithromycin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and telithromycin appeared to be more preferable than amoxicillin + clavulanate and azithromycin with respect to diarrhoea (all OR <1). The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) results suggested that gemifloxacin and levofloxacin had a relatively high ranking in total pathogen eradication, whereas amoxicillin + clavulanate and azithromycin exhibited relatively lower ranking with respect to adverse effects and diarrhoea.

Patient-level antibiotic use data were abstracted from medical records using a modified World Health Organization point-prevalence survey form. Altogether, 1,071 consenting patients were surveyed at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH, n = 579), Coast Provincial General Hospital (CPGH, n = 229) and Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH, n = 263). The majority (67%, 722/1071) were ≥18 years and 53% (563/1071) were female. Forty-six percent (46%, 489/1071) were receiving at least one antibiotic.

Along three non-recommended FDC-AB listed in the Tanzanian National Essential Medicine List (ampicillin-cloxacillin, flucloxacillin-amoxicillin and ceftriaxone-sulbactam) we discuss the concerns and reasons behind use of these products. Non-recommended FDC-AB have poor rationale (ratios of both ingredients), lack evidence of efficacy (pharmacological, microbiological and clinical), have difficulties in dosing (underdosing of the single ingredients, absence of pediatric dosing) and risks of safety (additive toxicity). They are expected to fuel antimicrobial resistance (unnecessary broad spectrum coverage) and are incompatible with antimicrobial stewardship. The specific context of low- and middle-income countries contributes to their increased use: at the side of prescriber and supplier are the lack of diagnostics, poor training in antibiotic prescribing, patients' preferences, role-model of senior prescribers and pharmaceutical promotion. International market mechanisms include economic motivation for development, branding and promotion, poor access to the single antibiotic forms and weak national regulatory capacity. There is an urgent need for monitoring consumption of non-recommended FDC-AB in low- and middle-income countries, particular in Sub-Saharan Africa.

113,17,17,14608265,"A first step in management decisions regarding otitis media must focus on accurate diagnosis to distinguish normal from acute otitis media (AOM) from otitis media with effusion (OME) or a retracted tympanic membrane without middle ear effusion. There are several classification schemes for AOM that may impact management decisions: patients with acute, persistent, recurrent, or chronic AOM may have a different distribution of bacterial pathogens and a different likelihood of success from antimicrobial therapy. Patient age, prior treatment history and daycare attendance are other important variables. The natural history of AOM without antibiotic treatment is generally favorable; however, from the few studies available, this is difficult to quantitate because the diagnosis was infrequently confirmed by tympanocentesis leaving the possibility that many patients entered into these trials may not have had bacterial AOM. Antibiotic choices should reflect pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data and clinical trial results demonstrating effectiveness in eradication of the most likely pathogens based on tympanocentesis sampling and antibiotic sensitivity testing. Thereafter, compliance factors such as formulation, dosing schedule and duration of treatment and accessibility factors such as availability and cost should be taken into account. The increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance among AOM pathogens and the changing susceptibility profiles of these bacteria should be considered in antibiotic selection. Current best practice recommends amoxicillin for uncomplicated AOM; continuing or switching to an alternative antibiotic based on clinical response after 48 hours of therapy; and selection of second line antibiotics as first line choices when the patient has already been on an antibiotic within the previous month or is otitis prone. Preferred second-line agents frequently noted in various guidelines include amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefdinir, cefpodoxime, cefprozil, and cefuroxime. Three injections of ceftriaxone or gatifloxacin (when approved) or diagnostic/therapeutic tympanocentisis (when approved) become a third-line treatment option. No single antibiotic or management strategy is ideal for all patients.

114,18,18,24586287,"To summarize recommendations of existing guidelines on the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in children, and to assess the methodological quality of these guidelines. We searched seven databases and web sites of relevant academic agencies. Evidence-based guidelines on pediatric URTIs were included. AGREE II was used to assess the quality of these guidelines. Two researchers selected guidelines independently and extracted information on publication years, institutions, target populations, recommendations, quality of evidence, and strength of recommendations. We compared the similarities and differences of recommendations and their strength. We also analyzed the reasons for variation. Thirteen guidelines meeting our inclusion criteria were included. Huge differences existed among these 13 guidelines concerning the categorization of evidence and recommendations. Nearly all of these guidelines lacked the sufficient involvement of stake holders. Further, the applicability of these guidelines still needs to be improved. In terms of recommendations, penicillin and amoxicillin were suggested for group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate were recommended for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS). An observation of 2-3 days prior to antibiotic therapy initiation for mild acute otitis media (AOM) was recommended with amoxicillin as the suggested first choice agent. Direct evidence to support strong recommendations on the therapy for influenza is still lacking. In addition, the antimicrobial durations for pharyngitis and ABRS were still controversial. No consensus was reached for the onset of antibiotics for ABRS in children. Future guidelines should use a consistent grading system for the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. More effort needs to be paid to seek the preference of stake holders and to improve the applicability of guidelines. Further, there are still areas in pediatric URTIs that need more research.

The open-ended, semistructured moderator guide included questions about PCN allergy testing and evaluation, accuracy of the PCN allergy diagnosis, amoxicillin oral challenges, delabeling process, and preferred setting for PCN allergy delabeling evaluation (outpatient clinic, hospital, etc). Study investigators coded the transcripts and identified underlying themes using inductive and deductive thematic analysis. A total of 21 parents and 2 adolescents participated across 4 focus groups. We developed a theoretical framework depicting key elements of parents' and adolescents' experiences with PCN allergies, consisting of 4 major interconnected themes: (1) family context; (2) the invitation to delabel; (3) decision context; and (4) the PCN delabeling outcome. PCN allergies remained a concern for families even if their children passed an oral challenge. Some parents preferred testing to be performed in the hospital and felt this was a safer location for the procedure. Parents are amenable to hospital based PCN allergy evaluation and delabeling. Further studies should incorporate parental and patient preferences to implement safe and effective PCN allergy delabeling processes in the hospital setting.

116,20,20,18574657,"We prospectively compared the efficacy of oral cefditoren-pivoxil and conventional oral amoxicillin for pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococcus in children. Either oral cefditoren-pivoxil (3 mg/kg t.i.d. for 5 days) or amoxicillin (10 mg/kg t.i.d. for 10 days) was administered to patients with group A streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis attending the pediatric outpatient clinic of Showa Hospital (Konan, Japan) between January and December 2006. Diagnosis was based on isolation of bacteria from a pharyngeal swab. Culture was always done to confirm eradication, and urinalysis and follow-up were performed at least once weekly for 4 weeks. Among 258 patients, 103 (aged 5.5 +/- 2.3 years) received cefditoren-pivoxil and 155 (aged 5.2 +/- 2.0 years) received amoxicillin. There were no significant between-group differences in age, sex, or symptoms. Eradication was confirmed in 99% (102/103) of the cefditoren-pivoxil group and 100% of the amoxicillin group. Recurrence within 4 weeks occurred in 8 and 15 patients in the cefditoren-pivoxil and amoxicillin groups, respectively, showing no significant difference in the recurrence rate, and all isolates had the same serotypes as before. There were no clinically significant adverse reactions or complications. The 50%/90% minimum inhibitory concentrations (microg/ml) of cefditoren-pivoxil and amoxicillin for the 258 isolates were < or =0.03/< or =0.03 and < or =0.03/0.06, respectively, so all isolates were susceptible to both agents. Because the efficacy for pediatric group A streptococcus pharyngotonsillitis was similar between oral cefditoren-pivoxil for 5 days and amoxicillin for 10 days, the shorter treatment period may make the former regimen preferable.

118,22,22,12765486,"The approaches to diagnosing and treating Lyme disease (LD) have been improved and refined as a result of basic and clinical research, and considerable practical experience. In addition, there have been recent studies that have allowed improvements in the ability to prevent infection with Borrelia burgdorferi. This paper will review the relevant literature and address recent developments in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of LD. Issues specifically related to the management of children will be identified. Controversies regarding treatment approaches will be examined in some detail. Understanding the clinical manifestations, or stage, of LD is crucial when approaching both diagnosis and treatment. Early localized disease is best diagnosed by recognizing the characteristic skin lesion, erythema migrans. Early disease will frequently, but not always, be accompanied by a detectable antibody response, particularly IgM antibody to the spirochete. Late disease, chiefly arthritis, is generally associated with high levels of IgG antibody. Western blot technology allows confirmation of enzyme immunoassay results and is especially useful when the latter is in the low or equivocal range. Early localized disease responds well to oral antibacterial therapy. Early disseminated disease, often associated with neurologic findings, may require parenteral therapy. The arthritis associated with LD frequently responds to oral antibacterials, but some refractory cases may require intravenous therapy, and occasionally surgery. Doxycycline is the oral antibacterial of choice, while amoxicillin and cefuroxime axetil are alternatives that may be preferred in young children. Owing to its long half-life and once daily dose administration, intravenous ceftriaxone has become the accepted standard for parenteral therapy. Tick avoidance has long been the mainstay for preventing LD. Antibacterial prophylaxis, using doxycycline, for tick bites has been shown to be an effective approach to prevention, but its relevance to pediatrics is uncertain. Vaccines designed to prevent infection have also been developed.

We compared OM visits between black and nonblack children, as percentages of all outpatient visits and visit rates per 1000. We compared antibiotic prescribing by race as the percentage of OM visits receiving narrow-spectrum (eg, amoxicillin) versus broader-spectrum antibiotics. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine whether race was independently associated with antibiotic selection for OM. The percentage of all visits resulting in OM diagnosis was 30% lower in black children compared with others (7% vs 10%, P = .004). However, OM visits per 1000 population were not different between black and nonblack children (253 vs 321, P = .12). When diagnosed with OM during visits in which antibiotics were prescribed, black children were less likely to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics than nonblack children (42% vs 52%, P = .01). In multivariable analysis, black race was negatively associated with broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing (adjusted odds ratio 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.86).

By using an electronic algorithm, we identified 61 patients (of 95 deemed not allergic by gold standard allergist decision) as low risk for penicillin allergy, with no false negatives and without the need for allergist assessment or skin testing. In this study, we demonstrate that an electronic algorithm can be used by various pediatric clinicians when evaluating possible penicillin allergy to reliably identify low risk patients. We identified the electronic algorithm was superior to the paper version, capturing an even higher percentage of low risk patients than the paper version. By developing an electronic algorithm to accurately assess penicillin allergy risk based on appropriate history, without the need for diagnostic testing or allergist assessment, we can empower non-allergist health care professionals to safely de-label low risk pediatric patients and assist in alleviating subspecialty wait times for penicillin allergy assessment.

The primary objective of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of both compounds in this pediatric subpopulation. Patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) in whom intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was indicated (25 to 35 mg/kg of body weight every 6 h) were enrolled. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted, and the clinical outcome was documented. A total of 325 and 151 blood samples were collected from 50 patients (median age, 2.58 years; age range, 1 month to 15 years) treated with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, respectively. A three-compartment model for amoxicillin and a two-compartment model for clavulanic acid best described the data, in which allometric weight scaling and maturation functions were added a priori to scale for size and age. In addition, plasma cystatin C and concomitant treatment with vasopressors were identified to have a significant influence on amoxicillin clearance. The typical population values of clearance for amoxicillin and clavulanic acid were 17.97 liters/h/70 kg and 12.20 liters/h/70 kg, respectively. In 32% of the treated patients, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid therapy was stopped prematurely due to clinical failure, and the patient was switched to broader-spectrum antibiotic treatment. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated that four-hourly dosing of 25 mg/kg was required to achieve the therapeutic target for both amoxicillin and clavulanic acid.

We compared the risk of treatment failure of antibiotic regimens for outpatient treatment of UTI in real-world practice. We identified non-pregnant, premenopausal women diagnosed with uncomplicated, lower tract UTI and prescribed an oral antibiotic with activity against common uropathogens. We used propensity score-weighted Kaplan-Meier functions to estimate 30-day risks and risk differences (RD) for pyelonephritis and UTI-related antibiotic prescription switch. Of 1 140 602 patients, the distribution of index prescriptions was 44% fluoroquinolones (non-first-line), 28% trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) (first-line), 24% nitrofurantoin (first-line), 3% narrow-spectrum β-lactams (non-first-line), 1% broad-spectrum β-lactams (non-first-line), and 1% amoxicillin/ampicillin (non-recommended). Compared to the risk of pyelonephritis for nitrofurantoin (0.3%), risks were higher for TMP/SMX (RD, 0.2%; 95% CI, 0.2%-0.2%) and broad-spectrum β-lactams (RD, 0.2%; 95% CI, 0.1%-0.4%). Compared to the risk of prescription switch for nitrofurantoin (12.7%), the risk was higher for TMP/SMX (RD 1.6%; 95% CI 1.3%-1.7%) but similar for broad-spectrum β-lactams (RD -0.7%; 95% CI -1.4%-0.1%) and narrow-spectrum β-lactams (RD -0.3%; 95% CI -0.8%-0.2%). Subgroup analyses suggest TMP/SMX treatment failure may be due in part to increasing uropathogen resistance over time. The risk of treatment failure differed by antibiotic agent, with higher risk associated with TMP/SMX versus nitrofurantoin, and lower or similar risk associated with broad- versus narrow-spectrum β-lactams. Given serious safety warnings for fluoroquinolones, these results suggest that nitrofurantoin may be preferable as the first-line agent for outpatient treatment of uncomplicated UTI.

Compared with general pediatricians (GP), pediatric pulmonologists (PP) preferred microbiology-based diagnosis criteria, prescribed more amoxicillin-clavulanate, and performed more investigations for recurrent patients (P<0.05). The majority of Chinese pediatricians diagnosed PBB in compliance with guidelines. However, the reasonable antibiotics applications and the investigations for recurrent PBB need to be improved.

128,32,32,11880740,"Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis is an infection of the nasal epithelium and paranasal sinus mucosa, usually caused in children by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and, less frequently, group A Streptococcus species. The clinical diagnosis is based on daytime cough that may be worse at night or purulent rhinorrhea, or both, lasting at least 10 days, often worsening after a period of initial improvement after initial symptoms of the common cold, and often associated with facial or dental pain, facial fullness, or swelling, headache, and fever. Sinusitis is diagnosed clinically; radiographic evaluation is not indicated for diagnosis. When the disease persists despite treatment, or is complicated by potential intracranial or orbital extension, CT is the preferred imaging modality. Initial therapy should be amoxicillin in a high dosage (80-90 mg/kg/day). Treatment is generally for 10 to 14 days and for at least 7 days beyond the time of substantial improvement in symptoms.

129,33,33,14608264,"Antibiotic therapy remains the treatment of choice for otitis media in most countries despite persuasive evidence that antibiotic therapy provides limited clinical benefit and promotes bacterial resistance. Meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials demonstrated that antibiotics increased resolution at 1 week by only 13%. Amoxicillin remains as effective as any other antibiotic, despite increasing resistance to amoxicillin among the major bacterial pathogens. Immediate antibiotic treatment has been shown to reduce the duration of symptoms by 1 day but not until after the first 24 hours when symptoms were already improving. A delayed prescribing strategy is currently utilized in most children for management of acute otitis media in the Netherlands; this method is now being evaluated elsewhere. Antibiotic therapy is delayed for 48-72 hours after diagnosis; thereafter, antibiotics are initiated only if symptoms persist or worsen. In 2 studies utilizing this strategy (England and the United States), only 24-30% of the patients in the delayed treatment group initiated antibiotic therapy; a majority of parents of children in the delayed group were satisfied with their child's treatment. Treatment of bacterial otitis media (""pus drum"") with high dose amoxicillin (80-100 mg/kg/kd) is recommmended; for acute otitis media without bulging, watchful waiting with a delayed prescribing strategy and treatment of pain is preferred. Yearly administration of the influenza vaccine and/or treatment of influenza with an antiviral (oseltamivir) can significantly decrease the incidence of acute otitis media during influenza season. Although pneumococcal vaccination effectively reduces the incidence of acute otitis media due to vaccine-related serotypes, there is a significant increase in the number of episodes of acute otitis media due to other serotypes of S. pneumoniae such that the overall incidence of acute otitis media is reduced only minimally by pneumoccocal vaccine. The careful use of strict diagnostic criteria coupled with judicious use of antibiotic therapy will direct antibiotic treatment to only those patients likely to benefit. ",Otitis media.

130,34,34,9310510,"Treatment of otitis media is the most frequent reason for administering antibiotics to children in the United States. However, only limited data are available on medical effectiveness of antibiotic prescribing patterns for otitis media and their associated expenditures or the factors that influence antibiotic prescribing. The study population consisted of 131 169 children during 1991 and 157 065 children during 1992 who were </=13 years of age and enrolled in Colorado's fee-for-service Medicaid program. Among these children, 5127 (1991) and 7254 (1992) were enrolled in the cohort treated for a ""new"" episode of acute otitis media. An analysis using this cohort was performed to document the antibiotics used to treat a new episode of acute otitis media, factors influencing antibiotic selection, and the short-term outcomes of therapy. An analysis using the entire Medicaid population was performed to document the annual use of antibiotics for otitis, the associated antibiotic expenditures, and factors influencing antibiotic selection. In the cohort analysis, office-based physicians prescribed second- and third-generation cephalosporins more often than did physicians in other settings (17% vs 9.7% and 11.8%), whereas hospital clinics prescribed trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole more frequently than did office-based physicians (19.2% vs 7.1% and 10.9%). Family physicians prescribed second- and third-generation cephalosporins more often than did pediatricians (16.6% vs 12.3%) but trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin plus sulfisoxazole less often than did pediatricians (10.5% vs 17%). The average rate of prescribing a second course of antibiotics within 24 days after initial antibiotic treatment of a new acute otitis media episode was 11.6% when less expensive antibiotics (amoxicillin, trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole, or erythromycin plus sulfisoxazole) were prescribed, and 13.2% when more expensive antibiotics (cefaclor, amoxicillin plus clavulanate, or cefixime) were prescribed. The average adverse drug reaction rate was 5.9% when less expensive antibiotics were prescribed, compared with 6.1% when more expensive antibiotics were prescribed. In each of the two study years, amoxicillin accounted for almost half of the total antibiotic fills but only 9% to 10% of the expenditures. Low-cost antibiotics (amoxicillin, trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole, and erythromycin plus sulfisoxazole) were prescribed for 66% to 67% of the total fills and accounted for 21% of the total projected expenditures. More expensive antibiotics (cefaclor, cefixime, amoxicillin plus clavulanate) prescribed for 30% of the fills generated 76% to 77% of expenditures. Cefaclor, prescribed for 17% to 18% of the total fills, generated 43% to 45% of total antibiotic expenses. The findings of this study document a preference for amoxicillin as the initial antibiotic for a new episode of acute otitis media. Although there was a wide variation in the selection of antibiotics to treat otitis, the more expensive antibiotics were not associated with better outcomes. This wide variation has important financial implications because of differences in antibiotic costs. Changes in prescribing patterns among initially uncomplicated children that reduce the use of high-cost antibiotics could reduce expenditures substantially without compromising short-term outcomes.

131,35,35,14658923,"The treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children is empirical, being based on the knowledge of the etiology of CAP at different ages. As a result of currently available methods in everyday clinical practice, a microbe-specific diagnosis is not realistic in the majority of patients. Even the differentiation between viral, 'atypical' bacterial (Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydia pneumoniae) and 'typical' bacterial (Streptococcus pneumoniae) CAP is often not possible. Moreover, up to one-third of CAP cases seem to be mixed viral-bacterial or dual bacterial infections. Recent serologic studies have confirmed that S. pneumoniae is an important causative agent of CAP at all ages. M. pneumoniae is common from the age of 5 years onwards, and C. pneumoniae is common from the age of 10 years onwards. In addition to age, the etiology and treatment of CAP are dependent on the severity of the disease. Pneumococcal infections are predominant in children treated in hospital, and mycoplasmal infections are predominant in children treated at home.In ambulatory patients with CAP, amoxicillin (or penicillin V [phenoxymethylpenicillin]) is the drug of choice from the age of 4 months to 4 years, and at all ages if S. pneumoniae is the presumptive causative organism. Macrolides, preferably clarithromycin or azithromycin, are the first-line drugs from the age of 5 years onwards. In hospitalized patients who need parenteral therapy for CAP, cefuroxime (or penicillin G [benzylpenicillin]) is the drug of choice. Macrolides should be administered concomitantly if M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae infection is suspected. Radiologic findings and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels offer limited help for the selection of antibacterials; alveolar infiltrations and high CRP levels indicate pneumococcal pneumonia, but the lack of these findings does not rule out bacterial CAP. Most guidelines recommend antibacterials for 7-10 days (except azithromycin, which has a recommended treatment duration of 5 days). If no improvement takes place within 2 days, therapy must be reviewed.

132,36,36,23039319,"10 days of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid high dose and 5 days of cefdinir have been the preferred first- or second-line antibiotics for treatment of children with acute otitis media (AOM) since 2004, as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics in the USA, but no head-to-head comparison study has been done. The purpose of the study was to compare the clinical efficacy of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid high-dose therapy for 10 days with cefdinir therapy for 5 days for AOM at recommended doses. This was an investigator-blind trial in young children 6-24 months old with no history of recurrent AOM who were randomly assigned to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (80 mg/kg/day amoxicillin) or cefdinir (14 mg/kg/day), both in two divided doses. The diagnosis of AOM was based on specific clinical criteria by validated otoscopists at two AOM research centres. The outcome measure for clinical cure was resolution of all symptoms and signs of AOM except for persistence of middle-ear effusion at test-of-cure (TOC) 11-14 days after initiation of antibiotic treatment. Clinical failure was defined as persistence of symptoms and signs of AOM and the need for additional antibiotic therapy. Subjects lost to follow up or who had not taken at least 80% of the prescribed medication were classified as having an indeterminate response. Compliance was monitored using Medical Electronic Monitoring System (MEMS) caps and antibiotic bottle volume measurement at the TOC visit. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the association of age with cure rate. Full interactions in terms of age with treatment were included to estimate any age gradient differential. A total of 330 children (average age 13.1 months) with AOM were studied. At TOC, 256 children had clinical cure, 69 had clinical failure, and 5 were lost to follow-up. High-dose amoxicillin/clavulanic acid-treated children had a better cure rate (86.5%) than cefdinir-treated patients (71.0%; p = 0.001). Cefdinir was correlated with less frequent cure outcomes as children increased in age between 6 and 24 months. The odds ratios for clinical cure per increasing month of age estimated from a logistic regression model for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid high dose and cefdinir treatment groups was 0.992 (95% CI 0.932, 1.056), p > 0.05 and 0.932 (95% CI 0.881, 0.986), p = 0.01. The differences in the odds ratios are significant at p < 0.002, indicating a stable clinical cure rate across the ages of children studied for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and decreasing clinical cure rates as children increased in age for cefdinir. In children with bona fide AOM for whom clinical outcomes are assessed by validated otoscopists, 10 days of high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is significantly more effective than 5 days of cefdinir as therapy for AOM. Because of the identified age effect (correlated to child weight), higher doses of cefdinir may have led to a different conclusion; 10 days of cefdinir may also have led to a different conclusion.

133,37,37,15977962,"Ticks can transmit bacterial, protozoal, and viral infections to humans. Specific therapy is available for several of these infections. Doxycycline is the antimicrobial treatment of choice for all patients, regardless of age, with Rocky Mountain spotted fever, human monocytic ehrlichiosis, or human granulocytic ehrlichiosis. Chloramphenicol has been used to treat these infections in children but is demonstrably inferior to doxycycline. In patients with Mediterranean spotted fever, doxycycline, chloramphenicol, and newer macrolides all appear to be effective therapies. Therapy of Lyme disease depends on the age of the child and stage of the disease. For early localized disease, amoxicillin (for those aged <8 years) or doxycycline (for those aged >/=8 years) is effective. Doxycycline, penicillin V (phenoxymethylpenicillin) or penicillin G (benzylpenicillin) preparations, and erythromycin are all effective treatments for tick-borne relapsing fever. Hospitalized patients with tularemia should receive gentamicin or streptomycin. Doxycycline and ciprofloxacin have each been investigated for the treatment of tularemia in outpatients; however, these agents do not yet have established roles in the treatment of this disease in children. Combination therapy with clindamycin and quinine is preferred for children with babesiosis; the combination of azithromycin and atovaquone also appears promising. Ribavirin has been recently shown to markedly improve survival in patients with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever.

134,38,38,1448307,"To determine current opinions among experts in pediatric infectious diseases for treatment of bacterial sepsis, meningitis and acute otitis media, we polled directors of training programs in January, 1992. Responses were received from 69 centers in the United States and Canada. For initial treatment of presumed bacterial meningitis, the third generation cephalosporins alone or combined with ampicillin have become drugs of choice in all age groups. Most infectious disease programs include dexamethasone in the management of presumed bacterial meningitis for children 2 months of age and older. Third generation cephalosporins are also drugs of choice for presumed sepsis: combined with ampicillin for infants 5 weeks of age; used alone for children 5 months and 12 years of age. Amoxicillin remains the preferred drug for initial treatment of acute otitis media. The combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid is favored in the setting of an increased proportion of beta-lactamase-producing bacterial pathogens.

However, dosage forms of antibiotics for pediatric patients may not be as readily available as the formulations for adult patients. As such, it is anticipated that during a public health emergency, special instruction may need to be provided on home preparation and administration procedures to dose pediatric patients using available stockpiles of oral tablet and capsule dosage forms. Mixing crushed tablets or capsule contents with soft- or liquid- foods is one of the most common home preparation procedures. To gain knowledge for safe and effective use of prepared drug product instead of the intended intact dosage form, the impact of manipulation of the dosage form was studied. Capsule opening, capsule content assay and uniformity, dissolution, homogeneity, and stability studies of drug mixed with various liquid and soft foods were carried out using intact capsules of amoxicillin, doxycycline, and clindamycin. Higher recovery of capsule contents was achieved when using hands or knives to open capsules compared to using scissors. The capsules of all three antibiotic products contained the labeled amount of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). The peanut butter-drug mixtures failed both United States Pharmacopeia (USP) assay and dissolution criteria because the peanut butter significantly affected the solubility of the drugs, and hence it was omitted from further study. All drug-food mixtures of the three antibiotic products and 15 selected foods exhibited fast dissolution (e.g., >80 % in 60 min) in the tested medium, except for the amoxicillin-chocolate pudding mixture. Three household containers (cups, plates, and bowls) and four mixing times (0.5 min, 1 min, 2 min, and 5 min) were found to be suitable for preparation of homogeneous mixtures of the antibiotics and foods.

Pathogens associated with failure of amoxicillin therapy were H. influenzae (five cases, two beta-lactamase-positive), S. pneumoniae (one case), and Moraxella catarrhalis (one case, beta-lactamase-positive). The four failures with cefixime therapy were all in patients infected with S. pneumoniae. Rates of rash, diarrhea, and vomiting were the same in both groups and did not necessitate stopping therapy. We conclude the following: (1) Cefixime and amoxicillin were equivalent in overall clinical and bacteriologic efficacy for otitis media. (2) Cefixime was more efficacious than amoxicillin in treating H. influenzae otitis media and should be preferred when H. influenzae is the suspected etiologic agent.

The recommendations from this group included amoxicillin as the preferred first-line drug because of the demonstrated activity against penicillin-intermediate and -resistant strains of S. pneumoniae, using higher dosages of up to 90 mg/kg per day in certain settings. For patients in whom initial treatment is unsuccessful after 3 days, the recommended agents included high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (for activity against beta-lactamase-producing pathogens), clindamycin, cefuroxime axetil, or 1 to 3 doses of intramuscular ceftriaxone. The principles set forth in these guidelines can assist the therapeutic decisionmaking process for practitioners in the urgent care setting.

142,46,46,38886111,"Neonatal sepsis (NS) is a global health issue, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, where it accounts for a substantial portion of neonatal morbimortality. This multicountry survey aimed to elucidate current practices, challenges and case definitions in managing NS among clinicians in Sub-Saharan Africa. The survey targeted physicians and medical practitioners working in neonatal care who participated in a Self-Administered Web Questionnaire. The main objective was to understand NS and infection case definitions and management from the clinician's point of view and to identify challenges and opportunities in sepsis management. Participants were queried on demographics, definitions and diagnostic criteria, treatment approaches, and infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. A total of 136 participants from 93 healthcare structures responded, providing valuable insights into NS management practices. From May to July 2022 across 21 Sub-Saharan African countries, 136 neonatal clinicians with an average from 93 structures with on average 10-year experience took the survey. NS ranked highest among prevalent neonatal conditions. Diagnostic case definitions between sepsis and infection were attributed to clinical signs, anamnesis, C reactive protein, white blood cll count and blood cultures with no statistically significant differences. Early-onset sepsis was defined within 72 hours by 48%, while late-onset varied. Antibiotics were likely on admission (86.4%) and during the stay (82.2%). Treatment abandonment was reported unlikely. The preferred antibiotic regimen for early-onset sepsis was intravenous amoxicillin (or ampicillin), gentamycin and cefotaxime. Blood culture availability and IPC protocols were reported as limited, particularly concerning patient environment, pharmacy protocols and clean-dirty circuits. This NS survey emphasises clinicians' challenges due to limited access to diagnostic tools and raises concerns about antimicrobial overexposure. IPC also seem limited, according to participants. Addressing these challenges can enhance diagnostic practices, antibiotic stewardship and infection control in the region.

143,47,47,25934607,"Urine dipsticks have to be used more frequently for the screening of urinary tract infections (UTI) in febrile infants and children (grade A). Confirmation of the UTI by urine culture should prefer other methods of sampling than the urine bag: sampling jet, urethral catheterization, or pubic puncture (grade A). The percentage of Escherichia coli producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) in children accounts for less than 10 % in France and does not justify revising the 2007 recommendations (grade B). An increase in the use of carbapenems in first-line treatment is a major environmental hazard and exposes the patient to the risk of untreatable infections. For febrile UTI, the expert group recommended: (1) recover the results of susceptibility testing as soon as possible to quickly adapt treatment for possible resistant strains; (2) favor initial treatment with aminoglycosides (particularly amikacin) which remain active in the majority of ESBL strains for patients seen in the pediatric emergency department and/or hospital; (3) ceftriaxone (IV or IM) remains an appropriate treatment for patients seen in the emergency department or outpatient clinic because the percentage of ESBL-producing enterobacteria strains remains low; (4) use oral cefixime (grade B) in nonsevere cases and low-risk patients defined as age>3 months, general condition preserved, disease duration of fever<4 days, no associated comorbidity, and no history of urinary tract infection, uropathy, or prior antibiotic therapy in the last 3 months; (5) oral relay for parenteral treatment is guided by in vitro susceptibility testing, in an attempt to reduce the use of oral cephalosporins to limit the selection of resistant bacterial strains. The total duration of treatment recommended is usually 10 days. Except for special circumstances, there is no need to prescribe retrograde cystography or antibiotic prophylaxis after a first febrile urinary tract infection. For cystitis, the panel recommends systematic urinalysis and initial prescription before the results of the urine culture of one of the three following oral antibiotics: amoxicillin-clavulanate, cotrimoxazole, cefixime.

To determine the effectiveness of patient choice in nonoperative vs surgical management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in children. Prospective patient choice cohort study in patients aged 7 to 17 years with acute uncomplicated appendicitis presenting at a single pediatric tertiary acute care hospital from October 1, 2012, through March 6, 2013. Participating patients and families gave informed consent and chose between nonoperative management and urgent appendectomy. Urgent appendectomy or nonoperative management entailing at least 24 hours of inpatient observation while receiving intravenous antibiotics and, on demonstrating improvement of symptoms, completion of 10 days of treatment with oral antibiotics. The primary outcome was the 1-year success rate of nonoperative management. Successful nonoperative management was defined as not undergoing an appendectomy. Secondary outcomes included comparisons of the rates of complicated appendicitis, disability days, and health care costs between nonoperative management and surgery. A total of 102 patients were enrolled; 65 patients/families chose appendectomy (median age, 12 years; interquartile range [IQR], 9-13 years; 45 male [69.2%]) and 37 patients/families chose nonoperative management (median age, 11 years; IQR, 10-14 years; 24 male [64.9%]). Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups. The success rate of nonoperative management was 89.2% (95% CI, 74.6%-97.0%) at 30 days (33 of 37 children) and 75.7% (95% CI, 58.9%-88.2%) at 1 year (28 of 37 children). The incidence of complicated appendicitis was 2.7% in the nonoperative group (1 of 37 children) and 12.3% in the surgery group (8 of 65 children) (P = .15). After 1 year, children managed nonoperatively compared with the surgery group had fewer disability days (median [IQR], 8 [5-18] vs 21 [15-25] days, respectively; P < .001) and lower appendicitis-related health care costs (median [IQR], $4219 [$2514-$7795] vs $5029 [$4596-$5482], respectively; P = .01).

We performed a randomized double-blind trial comparing amoxicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in 221 children in whom acute otitis media was diagnosed in an outpatient setting. Diagnosis was on the basis of symptoms, otoscopic examination and acoustic reflectometry. No culture specimens were taken. A research nurse, using the same methods, evaluated patients in a follow-up home visit at around 14 days and measured compliance by examination of the medicine bottle. Equal proportions of children in the two groups were cured or improved (88% and 87%). Therapeutic efficacy was related to compliance in both groups, and there were few side effects in either group. This study had statistical power of 80% to detect a difference of 15%. We conclude that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can be considered a first-line antibiotic in the treatment of acute otitis media.

Research aim: The authors aimed to characterize the molecular epidemiology and genetic content of staphylococci in the human milk of mothers of preterm and term neonates. Staphylococci were isolated once per week in the 1st month postpartum from the human milk of mothers of 20 healthy term and 49 preterm neonates hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit. Multilocus variable-number tandem-repeats analysis and multilocus sequence typing were used. The presence of the mecA gene, icaA gene of the ica-operon, IS 256, and ACME genetic elements was determined by PCR. The human milk of mothers of preterm compared with term neonates had higher counts of staphylococci but lower species diversity. The human milk of mothers of preterm compared with term neonates more often contained Staphylococcus epidermidis mecA (32.7% vs. 2.6%), icaA (18.8% vs. 6%), IS 256 (7.9% vs. 0.9%), and ACME (15.4% vs. 5.1%), as well as Staphylococcus haemolyticus mecA (90.5% vs. 10%) and IS 256 (61.9% vs. 10%). The overall distribution of multilocus variable-number tandem-repeats analysis (MLVA) types and sequence types was similar between the human milk of mothers of preterm and term neonates, but a few mecA-IS 256-positive MLVA types colonized only mothers of preterm neonates. Maternal hospitalization within 1 month postpartum and the use of an arterial catheter or antibacterial treatment in the neonate increased the odds of harboring mecA-positive staphylococci in human milk. Limiting exposure of mothers of preterm neonates to the hospital could prevent human milk colonization with more pathogenic staphylococci.

Targeted interventions to improve drug seller practices require understanding of the retail drug shop market and motivations that influence practices. This study aimed at describing the operational environment in relation to the Uganda National Drug Authority guidelines for setup of drug shops; characteristics, and dispensing practices of private retail drug shops in managing febrile conditions among under-five children in rural western Uganda. Cross sectional survey of 74 registered drug shops, observation checklist, and 428 exit interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire with care-seekers of children under five years of age, who sought care at drug shops during the survey period. The survey was conducted in Mbarara and Bushenyi districts, South Western Uganda, in May 2013. Up to 90 and 79% of surveyed drug shops in Mbarara and Bushenyi, largely operate in premises that meet National Drug Authority requirements for operational suitability and ensuring medicines safety and quality. Drug shop attendants had some health or medical related training with 60% in Mbarara and 59% in Bushenyi being nurses or midwives. The rest were clinical officers, pharmacists. The most commonly stocked medicines at drug shops were Paracetamol, Quinine, Cough syrup, ORS/Zinc, Amoxicillin syrup, Septrin® syrup, Artemisinin-based combination therapies, and multivitamins, among others. Decisions on what medicines to stock were influenced by among others: recommended medicines from Ministry of Health, consumer demand, most profitable medicines, and seasonal disease patterns. Dispensing decisions were influenced by: prescriptions presented by client, patients' finances, and patient preferences, among others. Most drug shops surveyed had clinical guidelines, iCCM guidelines, malaria and diarrhea treatment algorithms and charts as recommended by the Ministry of Health. Some drug shops offered additional services such as immunization and sold non-medical goods, as a mechanism for diversification. Most drug shops premises adhered to the recommended guidelines. Market factors, including client demand and preferences, pricing and profitability, and seasonality largely influenced dispensing and stocking practices.

Between February 2000 and April 2002, 110 children with a mean age of 30.73 +/- 20.79 months were enrolled. 109 patients were evaluated for the safety assessment. The intent-to treat population included 96 patients who completed at least 3 days of treatment. The standard analysis population included 73 patients who completed the 10-day treatment period without any major violation. For the standard analysis population, 57 out of 73 patients experienced treatment success; 31 out of 41 patients in the ceftriaxone group were cured compared with 25 out of 32 patients in the amoxi-clav group. The rate of persistence of middle-ear fluid did not differ between the 2 groups at day 11 or day 28. A higher treatment preference rate was observed in the ceftriaxone group (93.9% vs 58.6%). The most common drug-related adverse effects were found in the digestive system, skin and appendages in both treatment groups. A single dose of ceftriaxone is as safe and effective as amoxi-clav for curing patients with acute otitis media.

A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using decision tree models. Probabilities of SSIs and AMR-SSIs, costs, and effects (in terms of quality-adjusted life-years) were considered in the assessment of the alternative strategies. Input parameters integrated real data from the Italian surveillance system for SSIs with data from the published literature. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the potential impact of the decreasing efficacy of standard SAP regimens in preventing SSIs. According to our models, ertapenem was the most cost-effective strategy only when compared to amoxicillin-clavulanate, but it did not prove to be superior to cefoxitin and cefazolin plus metronidazole. The sensitivity analysis found ertapenem would be the most cost-effective strategy compared to these agents if their failure rate was more than doubled.

151,55,55,32836139,"The Italian Guideline for the management of acute otitis media (AOM) in children has been recently updated. We conducted a cross-sectional survey to investigate the adherence of Italian primary care paediatricians to the guideline recommendations. A questionnaire including 13 closed-ended questions was administered to the paediatricians participating in the 24th National Congress of Practical Pediatrics, held in Florence in November 2019. The answers were collected and analyzed. Eight hundred fifty-four out of 1000 questionnaires were collected (85.4%). Most of the participants declared that they did not remove the cerumen (63.9%). Pneumatic otoscope and tympanometry were routinely used by a minority of paediatricians (9.6% and 3.9%, respectively); all the participants declared to routinely prescribe oral analgesic drugs and 97.6% of them considered amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid as the first-choice antibiotic. In an uncomplicated unilateral AOM case, the preferred strategy was immediate antibiotic therapy in children under two years of age (83.1%) and watchful waiting in those >2 years (77.3%). Oral amoxicillin was most commonly prescribed at the 80-100 mg/kg/day (56.6%), in 3 daily doses (87.7%), while amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was equally prescribed at 80-100 or 50 mg/kg/day (47.1%-48.5%), mainly in 2 doses (58.6%). However, both drugs are recommended at a dosage of 80-90 mg/kg/day (calculated on amoxicillin), in 3 daily doses. Although the Guideline recommends ten days of therapy, both drugs were most commonly prescribed for 7-8 days (55.5%-57.7%). Pneumococcal and flu vaccines were recommended only by 41.6% and 31.6% of participants, respectively. Our data suggest adequate adherence of the guideline recommendations considering the preferred antibiotic drug, pain management and the choice between immediate antibiotic therapy and watchful waiting. Conversely, targeted training programs are needed to improve adherence to recommendations on cerumen removal, use of pneumatic otoscopy, correct use of antibiotics in terms of optimal dosage, duration and number of daily administrations, and to implement proper AOM prevention strategies.

152,56,56,33108920,"To gain an overview of the current management of patients with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) in Swiss maternity hospitals. We conducted a survey among all maternity hospitals in Switzerland from January to December 2018, irrespective of their annual birth rate and level of complexity. The survey consisted of an 11-item questionnaire, which was developed to retrieve information relevant to different areas of PPROM management. Of 64 questionnaires distributed by email, 36 (56.3%) centers responded to the survey. Up to 12 different antibiotic regimens were reported. Among these, 91.7% included a beta-lactam, with amoxicillin as the preferred agent (55.6%). Combined antibiotic schemes were used in 30.6% of hospitals. All centers considered the use of corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity if PPROM occurred before 34 weeks, although 36.1% would consider their use until 37 weeks' gestation in the presence of an increased risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Maternity hospitals who accept deliveries at any gestational age usually used magnesium sulfate as fetal neuroprotection when delivering babies <32 weeks, with the exception of two hospitals where it was either not used or only indicated if maternal preeclampsia was present. Concerning the time to delivery, 58.3% centers tended to wait until 37 weeks' gestation, while the others considered that it was not necessary to go beyond 34 weeks. Our survey shows that the current management of PPROM in Switzerland appears to be mostly in line with international recommendations. However, some heterogeneity exists, thus reflecting a lack of international consensus across guidelines, together with the absence of national Swiss guidelines, and this needs to be addressed to ensure high quality care for all patients and neonates.

153,57,57,20660544,"The use of cochlear implants is increasingly common, particularly in children younger than 3 years. Bacterial meningitis, often with associated acute otitis media, is more common in children with cochlear implants than in groups of control children. Children with profound deafness who are candidates for cochlear implants should receive all age-appropriate doses of pneumococcal conjugate and Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccines and appropriate annual immunization against influenza. In addition, starting at 24 months of age, a single dose of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine should be administered. Before implant surgery, primary care providers and cochlear implant teams should ensure that immunizations are up-to-date, preferably with completion of indicated vaccines at least 2 weeks before implant surgery. Imaging of the temporal bone/inner ear should be performed before cochlear implantation in all children with congenital deafness and all patients with profound hearing impairment and a history of bacterial meningitis to identify those with inner-ear malformations/cerebrospinal fluid fistulas or ossification of the cochlea. During the initial months after cochlear implantation, the risk of complications of acute otitis media may be higher than during subsequent time periods. Therefore, it is recommended that acute otitis media diagnosed during the first 2 months after implantation be initially treated with a parenteral antibiotic (eg, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime). Episodes occurring 2 months or longer after implantation can be treated with a trial of an oral antimicrobial agent (eg, amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate at a dose of approximately 90 mg/kg per day of amoxicillin component), provided the child does not appear toxic and the implant does not have a spacer/positioner, a wedge that rests in the cochlea next to the electrodes present in certain implant models available between 1999 and 2002. ""Watchful waiting"" without antimicrobial therapy is inappropriate for children with implants with acute otitis media. If feasible, tympanocentesis should be performed for acute otitis media, and the material should be sent for culture, but performance of this procedure should not result in an undue delay in initiating antimicrobial therapy. For patients with suspected meningitis, cerebrospinal fluid as well as middle-ear fluid, if present, should be sent for culture. Empiric antimicrobial therapy for meningitis occurring within 2 months of implantation should include an agent with broad activity against Gram-negative bacilli (eg, meropenem) plus vancomycin. For meningitis occurring 2 months or longer after implantation, standard empiric antimicrobial therapy for meningitis (eg, ceftriaxone plus vancomycin) is indicated.

The Infectious Disease Surveillance of Pediatrics (ISPED) collaboration group conducted this study. H. influenzae strains isolated from nine pediatric hospitals in Mainland China were included. Disk diffusion method was used for antimicrobial susceptibility test. Cefinase disc was used for detection of β-lactamase. In total, 13810 H. influenzae isolates were included during 2017-2019: 93.17% of which were from respiratory tract specimens, 4.63% from vaginal swabs, 1.10% from secretion, and 1.10% from others. Of all strains, 63.32% isolates produced β-lactamase; 8.22% isolates were β-lactamase-negative and ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR). The resistance to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim was 70.98%, followed by resistance to ampicillin (69.37%), cefuroxime (51.35%), ampicillin-sulbactam (38.82%), azithromycin (38.21%), amoxicillin-clavulanate (35.28%). More than 90% of H. influenzae isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, meropenem, levofloxacin and chloramphenicol. The resistance rate of ampicillin and azithromycin in H. influenzae showed an increasing trend through the years. Statistically significant differences in antibiotic-resistance rates of all the antibiotics except chloramphenicol were found in different regions. The major Multi-Drug Resistance pattern was resistant to β-lactams, macrolides, and sulfonamides. There is a rising trend of resistance rate of ampicillin and azithromycin in H. influenzae.

155,59,59,29273072,"Children are the most vulnerable population exposed to the use of antibiotics often incorrectly prescribed for the treatment of infections really due to viruses rather than to bacteria. We designed the MAREA study which consisted of two different studies: i) a surveillance study to monitor the safety/efficacy of the antibiotics for the treatment of pneumonia (CAP), pharyngotonsillitis and acute otitis media in children younger than 14 yrs old, living in Liguria, North-West Italy and ii) a pre-/post-interventional study to evaluate the appropriateness of antibiotic prescription for the treatment these infections. In this paper, we show only results of the appropriateness study about the antibiotic prescription for the treatment of pneumonia. Patients included in this study met the following inclusion criteria: i) admission to the Emergency/Inpatient Dpt/outpatient clinic of primary care pediatricians for pneumonia requiring antibiotics, ii) informed written consent. The practice of prescribing antibiotics was evaluated before-and-after a 1 day-educational intervention on International/National recommendations. Global adherence to guidelines was fulfilled in 45%: main reason for discordance was duration (shorter than recommended). Macrolide monotherapy and cephalosporins were highly prescribed; ampicillin/amoxicillin use was limited. 61% of patients received >1 antibiotic; parenteral route was used in 33%. After intervention, i) in all CAP, cephalosporin prescription decreased (-23%) and the inappropriate macrolide prescriptions was halved and, ii) in not hospitalized CAP (notH-CAP), macrolides were prescribed less frequently (-25%) and global adherence to guidelines improved (+39%); and iii) in H-CAP antibiotic choice appropriateness increase. Prescribing practices were sufficiently appropriate but widespread preference for multidrug empirical regimens or macrolide in monotherapy deserve closer investigation.

The survey included questions related to 2 clinical scenarios, respondent demographics, and knowledge of streptococcal pharyngitis. Pediatricians who treated patients with pharyngitis. Of the 690 surveys that were returned, 510 pediatricians treated patients with pharyngitis and were included in the data analysis. Data were analyzed using Chi 2 statistics for categorical data and the Student t test for continuous variables. Antigen detection tests (ADTs) were used by 64% of the pediatricians; 85% used throat cultures. Strategies for diagnosing streptococcal pharyngitis were throat culture alone (38%), consider positive ADTs definitive and use throat culture when ADTs are negative (42%), ADT alone (13%), ADT and throat culture for all patients with pharyngitis (5%), and no tests for GABHS performed (2%). Thirty-one percent usually or always treated with antibiotics before test results were available. Only 29% of these ""early treaters"" always discontinued antibiotics when tests did not confirm the presence of group A streptococci. The drug of choice for treatment was penicillin (73%); another 26% preferred a derivative of penicillin, particularly amoxicillin. Many pediatricians altered their management when a patient had recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis. Nearly half of the respondents would use a different antibiotic than they used for routine acute streptococcal pharyngitis. They most often changed to erythromycin (25%), cefadroxil (23%), or amoxicillin-clavulanate (20%). Follow-up throat culture was obtained by 51% of pediatricians after treatment of recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis. A patient with chronic carriage of GABHS and symptoms of pharyngitis would be treated with an antibiotic by 84%; most (62%) would use a penicillin. Other choices were cephalosporins (19%), erythromycin (12%), clindamycin (3%), or rifampin plus penicillin (3%). Tonsillectomy was recommended for symptomatic carriers by 31% of respondents. Carriers without symptoms were less likely to be treated with antibiotics (23%) or referred for tonsillectomy (21%). Most surveyed board-certified pediatricians managed acute GABHS pharyngitis appropriately, but 15% to 20% used diagnostic or treatment strategies that are not recommended.

157,61,61,15672640,"With the discovery of penicillin and entrance into the antibiotic era, the capability of dentists to treat dental infections have changed dramatically. Many antibacterial agents have developed since, but bacterial resistance using diverse mechanisms, have increased concomitantly. Since antimicrobial agents are frequently needed in dentistry, their judicious use is of prime importance. Dental infections can be divided to two main groups according to the origin of the infection. First, odontogenic infections (acute dento-alveolar abscess) originating from the dental pulp are most commonly caused by gram-positive anaerobic or facultative bacteria. Systemic antibiotic should be given concomitantly with drainage of the dento-alveolar abscess, debridment of the root canal of the infected tooth, and placement of inta-canal antimicrobial medication such as calcium hydroxide. Penicillin G, penicillin V (Rafapen) or amoxycillin (moxypen) are the first line systemic antimicrobial agents. In case of no improvement within 2-3 days, second line regimens such as amoxycillin-clavulanate (augmentin), cefuroxime (zinnat) or penicillin and metronidazole are recommended. In patients allergic to penicillin, clindamycinn (dalacin) is preferred over macrolides. The second group of infections originates from the periodontal apparatus, and is caused usually by gram-negative anaerobes bacilli, sometimes with Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitance (Aa). Systemic antibiotics are only infrequently indicated in this situation, and always accompanied by scaling, root planning and curettage of the infected root and gingiva. In regenerative or post surgical periodontitis, augmentin, metronidazole or metronidazole in combination with penicillin or amoxycillin augmentin are recommended. In aggressive periodontitis the most common pathogen is Aa and therefore tetracycline, augmentin, or metronidazole and amoxicillin are recommended. In necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, which is caused usually by fusiform bacilli and spirochetes, metronidazole or augmentin are appropriate. In patients with periodontal disease who are allergic to penicillin can be treated with a macrolides.

158,62,62,23433920,"Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most frequent diagnoses and reasons for prescribing antibiotics in children. The aims of this prospective study were the following: (1) to assess the continuing education of physicians and the sources of information about AOM; (2) to assess the current knowledge of and attitudes toward AOM as well as the compliance with AOM guidelines; (3) to evaluate opinions about vaccines against AOM; and (4) to estimate the potential costs of AOM on the healthcare system in Turkey. This is a web-based cross-sectional survey of a national convenience sample of 600 physicians in Turkey (325 pediatricians (PEDs), 214 family physicians/general practitioners (FP&GPs) and 61 otolaryngologists (ENTs)). Approximately 38.6% of participants (39.4% of PEDs, 44.3% of GP&FPs and 14.7% of ENTs) stated that pneumatic otoscopy is essential for AOM diagnosis. Regarding the most common etiological agents of AOM in children, 54.2% of PEDs, 51.4% of FP&GPs and 57.4% of ENTs stated that the most common causative agents of AOM are Streptococcus pneumoniae and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae. Nearly 76% of participants indicated they use direct antibiotic therapy when they diagnose AOM in certain situations. The first-line choice of antibiotic therapy is amoxicillin clavulanate, and 67% of participants prefer to use antibiotic therapy for 7-10 days. Approximately 31% of all participants stated that ""viruses"" are the main cause of AOM; however, 62% of these participants reported using antibiotic therapy. In comparison, 32% participants from private clinics prefer to treat AOM primarily with observation, a rate that is significantly higher than that of other clinical settings. Physicians who prefer to use observation strategy also prefer the combination of paracetamol and NSAIDs. Approximately 41% of participants have undergone postgraduate medical education on the topic of AOM. In total, 73% of all participant physicians believe that otitis media is a vaccine-preventable disease. With the information from all of the participants, the calculated mean cost per case of AOM is 28 ± 4 USD. In Turkey, the estimated incidence of AOM is 24,000-33,000 cases per 10,000 children <5 years of age (1,820,000-2,100,000 cases per year), and the estimated total cost of AOM is 61,152,000 USD (not including acute otitis media-related complications and otitis media-related hospitalizations). The medical and economic burden of AOM to the health economics in Turkey is considerable. Specific educational programs and evidence-based national guidelines concerning AOM should be implemented. Improving diagnostic accuracy with education will lead to improved management, judicious use of antibiotics, decreased antibiotic resistance, and potential economic benefits. A more prudent use of antibiotics would also lower the economic burden of this disease. Vaccination seems to be promising for the prevention of AOM.

Half of participants (n=40) were ineligible for OPT, with equal proportions due to clinical reasons or the nature of the reported reaction. Of the 40 eligible patients, 28 patients (70%) were de-labelled either by history alone (n=10) or OPT (n=18). All OPTs were successful. De-labelling allowed five additional patients (11% of those receiving antibiotics) to receive the preferred beta-lactam. Including patients who were subsequently assessed in the allergy clinic, almost half of all evaluated patients were de-labelled (n=37, 46%).

Parents arriving during the daytime were assigned to a shared group and could choose the antibiotic route, those admitted at other times were assigned to an unshared group for whom physicians chose the antibiotic route. Shared group parents answered anonymous questionnaire investigating why they chose a specific route. Parents in both groups answered another anonymous questionnaire at discharge assessing perceived satisfaction with care. Parents' satisfaction with perceived medical information as assessed by data from a questionnaire. Of the 95 children enrolled, more children's parents were assigned to the unshared than the shared group (77 vs. 18). Of the 18 children's parents in the shared group, 14 chose the oral antibiotic route mainly to avoid painful injections. Doctors explanations were considered better in the shared than in the unshared group (P = 0.02). The larger number of children's parents assigned to the unshared group reflects paediatricians' reluctance to offer shared-decision making.

Best compliance was found with clarithromycin (94.0%) and erythromycin estolate (89.8%). Compliance was also significantly better in patients > or =6 years old (77.7%; P = 0.016); with a treatment duration of < or =7 days (77.6%; P = 0.014); when the drug package contained a dose-taking reminder (79.7%; P = 0.003); and when the pediatrician's behavior toward the patient was assessed by the parents as ""very sympathetic"" or ""sympathetic"" (72.6%; P = 0.017). Subjecting all variables to logistic regression analysis, we found 3 variables to be significant predictors of treatment compliance: choice of antibiotic (P = 0.0001); patient age (P = 0.0008); and residence in town or city (P = 0.03). A noncompliance rate of >30% is unsatisfactory. Whereas some variables significantly associated with compliance cannot be influenced (patient age; place of residence in town or city), others are amenable to modifications. These include the physician-patient interaction and the choice of antibiotic. Agents should be preferred that are well-accepted by patients, that enable short-term therapy with few daily doses and with a package that contains a dose-taking reminder.

The following data sources were utilized: the Medline and LILACS (Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde) bibliographic databases; World Health Organization and Pan American Health Organization documents published between 1980 and 2002; Internet materials in Portuguese, Spanish, or English located using the search terms ""pneumonia, child, adolescent, etiology, treatment""; and interviews with renowned experts in the field. Hospitalization is always required for children younger than 2 months of age. That age group should be treated with ampicillin and aminoglycosides or third-generation cephalosporins. Children older than 2 months must be hospitalized if there is severe pneumonia. Tachypnea should be used as the criterion to distinguish between acute respiratory infection and pneumonia. Pneumonia is considered to be very severe when there are seizures, sleepiness, stridor at rest, severe malnutrition, no ingestion of fluids, or signs of respiratory failure such as central cyanosis. Children who are 2 months of age or older may receive outpatient treatment with amoxicillin or penicillin G procaine. In the case of inpatient treatment, crystalline penicillin or ampicillin may be used for severe cases, and oxacillin and chloramphenicol or ceftriaxone for very severe cases. A macrolide, preferably erythromycin, should be employed when the etiologic agent is suspected to be Chlamydia trachomatis, C. pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or Bordetella pertussis. The diagnosis of pneumonia and the need for hospitalization can be based on clinical assessment. The main antibiotics to be used are amoxicillin, penicillin, erythromycin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chloramphenicol, ceftriaxone, and aminoglycosides, depending on the age of the patient and the severity of the disease.

Additional information was collected at days 3 to 5 and 14 to 16 after the initiation of the therapy. Primarily private practices; 15 sites. For this study, 648 children aged 3 months to 6 years were randomly assigned to receive IM (n=327) or oral (n=321) therapy. The groups were equivalent in all measured sociodemographic factors. At the time of enrollment, 85% of parents expressed a preference for single-dose IM therapy. At days 3 to 5, no differences were reported in days children were absent from school or day care, parental absence from work, or loss of sleep by children. However, more parents with children in the IM therapy group than in the oral therapy group reported loss of sleep by the parent (35% vs 26%, P=.02, chi(2)). At days 14 to 16, more parents with children in the IM group reported being ""very satisfied"" with the antibiotic (65%) compared with parents whose children were assigned to the oral therapy group (38%, P<.001).

174,78,78,3322754,"Upper respiratory tract infections, particularly pharyngitis and acute otitis media (AOM) are the commonest diseases in children. Although viruses are the main causative agents, bacteria may play an important role. With regard to antibiotic therapy, clinicians must solve two problems: differentiation between viral and bacterial aetiology and choice of the optimal drug for each bacterial disease. In patients with pharyngitis the identification of group A haemolytic streptococci as the causative agent may be very difficult if only clinical and haematological data are considered. Throat culture is time consuming and difficult to perform in ambulatory practice; the recent techniques for rapid detection of streptococcal antigens are a possible answer to this problem. In bacterial pharyngitis a single injection of benzathine penicillin is considered to be first choice. However local pain and the significant increase of the relative risk of allergic problems in comparison with the decrease of incidence of rheumatic fever may shift therapeutic preference towards macrolides. The recently marketed ones, especially miocamycin, seem to offer easier administration, fewer side-effects and better efficacy. With regard to AOM, the differentiation between bacterial and viral disease is less important because over 70% of cases are of bacterial origin. Besides, an exact aetiological diagnosis is possible only by tympanocentesis, an invasive method.

A total of 303 children aged from 1 month to 5 years were recruited from eight private paediatric practices in northern Johannesburg. Nasopharyngeal samples were taken and parent interviews were conducted. Pneumococci were isolated from 121 children (40%). The most common serotypes were 6B, 19F, 6A, 23F, 14, and 19A. Carriage was significantly associated with prior hospital admission (odds ratio 1.89) and day care attendance (odds ratio 2.31) and was negatively associated with antibiotic use within the previous 30 days. Antibiotic resistance was found in 84 isolates (69.4%); 45 (37.2%) were multiply resistant. One-third of the pneumococci showed intermediate level resistance to penicillin and 12.4% were highly resistant. There was a high level erythromycin resistance in 38% of the isolates. A total of 94/214 children (42%) had recently used antibiotics and were four times more likely to carry antibiotic-resistant pneumococci (P < 0.05). Pneumococcal resistance was significant in this group of children with easy access to paediatric services and antibiotic use. The implication of such high resistance for the treatment of pneumococcal diseases is that high-dose amoxicillin is the preferred empirical oral therapy for treatment of otitis media. Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime should be used in combination with vancomycin for the treatment of meningitis until a cephalosporin-resistant pneumococcal cause is excluded. Intravenous penicillin or ampicillin will successfully treat pneumococcal pneumonia in this population.

Against Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, SY5555 displayed antimicrobial activities superior or nearly equivalent to those of the reference agents used in the study. In cases of Gram-negative bacteria, the antimicrobial activity of SY5555 against Haemophilus influenzae was inferior to those of CPDX and CFDN. Against Klebsiella pneumoniae, the antimicrobial activity of SY5555 was less potent than that of CPDX. 2. Forty-seven children with infectious diseases were treated with SY5555 dry syrup (powder dissolved just before use). The clinical results were excellent in 24 and good in 16, with an efficacy rate of 85.1%. 3. Bacteriological screening identified 30 pathogenic organisms, and the eradication rate was 76.7%. 4.

These failures appear to be related to increased resistance of the 2 principal pathogens, pneumococci and Hemophilus influenzae. A NEW FORMULATION: In order to reduce the rate of failure, it has been necessary to both increase the dose of penicillin to overcome the reduced susceptibility of pneumococci to penicillin and to prescribe a beta-lactam because of the frequent isolation of beta-lactamase producing Hemophilus influenzae. A new formulation has been developed where the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid dose is 14 to 1. This allows a daily dose of 80 mg/kg for amoxicillin and 6.4 mg/kg for clavulanic acid. In one open multicentric study including 51 pediatric patients aged 3 to 48 months with acute middle ear infections, it was demonstrated that this new formulation can be very effective in eradicating the causal agents of acute middle ear infections, including pneumococci and penicillin-resistant Hemophilus.

Restrictive use of antimicrobials is the key strategy for slowing the spread of resistances. Before initiation of antimicrobial therapy, suspected bacterial infections should be confirmed clinically (e.g. by observation of the natural evolution) or microbiologically. For acute otitis media, oral amoxicillin remains the drug of choice because of superior middle ear pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Treatment failure caused by resistance of the infecting pneumococcus can be overcome be increasing the dose, and not by switching to another class of antibiotics (e.g., cephalosporin, macrolide, cotrimoxazole), which is less likely to achieve middle ear eradication a priori. Widespread macrolide resistance among isolates of S. pneumoniae precludes the use of this class of antimicrobials for empiric therapy of community-acquired pneumonia in children.

Solid preparations, such as microtablets, pellets, dispersible tablets, and fine granules, have become the development trend of pediatric drugs. Liquid preparations mainly include syrup, suspension, oral solution, and drops. The poor taste and the treatment of drugs in children of different ages are the key factors affecting the efficacy, safety, and compliance of pediatric drugs. To reduce the risk caused by the fluctuation of blood concentration and improve the oral compliance of pediatric drugs, it is urgent to develop new techniques for granulation and flavor maskingto improve the poor taste of solid preparations. For liquid pre-parations with poor taste, the flavor correction technique should be used. This paper summarized the new pharmaceutical techniques for granulation and flavor masking, and it was found that sustained/controlled-releasegranules, fine granules, and chewing solid mini-tablets became the mainstream of oral solid preparations for children. Generally, multiparticle preparation, coating, microencapsulation, and other granulating techniques were involved in these preparations. Granulation and flavor masking are closely related and synergetic. Flavor masking techniques mask the bitter taste of Chinese medicine from four aspects, including confusing the brain taste, changing the compounds, reducing the exposure of bitter molecules to bitter receptors in the mouth, and numbing the taste cells to increase the threshold of bitter perception. At present, the main drugs for children on the market mainly inhibit the oral release of bitter drugs.

Children tasted the sample, swished it in their mouth for 10 seconds, and then expectorated the sample. Spring water and crackers were used to clear the palate between samples. After each sampling, children were observed for facial expressions and asked to rate their degree of liking of each sample based on a 5-point facial hedonic scale (5=like it very much, 1=dislike it very much). Likes, dislikes, and product preference were recorded. Of the 56 female and 54 male children who tasted both samples, 95% (105/110) preferred lansoprazole. Taste and flavor were the most often cited reasons for preferring lansoprazole (61 and 17 children, respectively) while three children preferred the flavor of ranitidine oral syrup. Lansoprazole received a higher mean liking rating compared with ranitidine (mean liking scores of 4.1 and 2.2, respectively).

Amiodarone hydrochloride is an antiarrhythmic drug used to treat supraventricular tachycardia. However, there are currently no commercial pediatric forms available to treat young patients. Various oral formulations were previously reported in the literature, but the concentration was lower than the doses prescribed in clinical practice (a loading dose of 500 mg/m2/day for 7-10 days followed by a maintenance dose of 250 mg/m2/day). The objective of this study was to develop an oral liquid formulation of amiodarone hydrochloride at an optimal concentration for use in children and to evaluate its physicochemical and microbiological stability. No commercial suspension vehicle was used, allowing the choice of excipients. Compounding was performed using hydroxypropylmethylcellulose as thickener, potassium sorbate preservative, citric acid/sodium citrate buffer, sodium saccharin as a , and a strawberry flavoring agent. A concentration of 40 mg/mL was selected based on a 5-year compilation of prescribed doses. Analyses performed were the following: visual and microscopic inspection, testing for antimicrobial preservation, osmolality and pH measurements, quantification of amiodarone hydrochloride by a stability-indicating liquid chromatography method, and a microbiological count. At least 95% of the initial amiodarone hydrochloride remained stable during the 60-day study period under refrigeration. All other tested parameters remained stable at 5 °C. A targeted log reduction of the microorganism inoculum by day 14 and no microbial growth by day 28 were demonstrated in the test for antimicrobial preservation.

Carbamazepine 400 mg was administered with a glass of water as either 20 mL of unflavored oral suspension (20 mg/mL) or two 200-mg tablets. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive first either the tablets or the suspension in crossover fashion on two days separated by at least two weeks. Blood samples were taken just before and at various times up to 72 hours after the carbamazepine dose. Serum samples were assayed for carbamazepine content by high-performance liquid chromatography. Of five flavored and unflavored carbamazepine suspensions tested in eight volunteers, the cherry-mint formulation was the least palatable. There was no trend in preference among the remaining suspensions (banana, tutti-frutti, grape, and unflavored). Mean values of maximum serum concentration and absorption rate constant were significantly greater for the unflavored suspension (5.7 mg/L [24 mumol/L] and 0.832 hr-1, respectively) than for the tablet (4.9 mg/L [20.8 mumol/L] and 0.266 hr-1, respectively). The mean time to maximum concentration was significantly shorter after suspension administration (3.87 hours) than after tablet administration (11.8 hours). There was no significant difference in the extent of absorption of the tablet and suspension formulation as reflected by the corrected values of the area under the serum concentration-versus-time curves.

189,8,8,36528009,"There is considerable clinical evidence that topiramate (TPM) has a high potential in the treatment of refractory and super-refractory status epilepticus (RSE, SRSE). Because TPM is only approved for oral administration, it is applied as suspension via a nasogastric tube for SE treatment. However, this route of administration is impractical in an emergency setting and leads to variable absorption with unpredictable plasma levels and time to peak concentration. Thus, the development of an intravenous (i.v.) solution for TPM is highly desirable. Here we present data on two parenteral formulations of TPM that are currently being developed. One of these solutions is using sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin (SBE-β-CD; Captisol®) as an excipient. A 1% solution of TPM in 10% Captisol® has been reported to be well tolerated in safety studies in healthy volunteers and patients with epilepsy or migraine, but efficacy data are not available. The other solution uses the FDA- and EMA-approved excipient amino sugar meglumine. Meglumine is much more effective to dissolve TPM in water than Captisol®. A 1% solution of TPM can be achieved with 0.5-1% of meglumine. While the use of Captisol®-containing solutions is restricted in children and patients with renal impairment, such restrictions do not apply to meglumine. Recently, first-in-human data were reported for a meglumine-based solution of TPM, indicating safety and efficacy when used as a replacement for oral administration in a woman with epilepsy. Based on the multiple mechanisms of action of TPM that directly target the molecular neuronal alterations that are thought to underlie the loss of efficacy of benzodiazepines and other anti-seizure medications during prolonged SE and its rapid brain penetration after i.v. administration, we suggest that parenteral (i.v.) TPM is ideally suited for the treatment of RSE and SRSE. This paper was presented at the 8th London-Innsbruck Colloquium on Status Epilepticus and Acute Seizures held in September 2022.

194,13,13,29737955,"Purpose To prospectively compare small bowel distention provided by, as well as patient acceptance of, two different neutral (negative) oral contrast materials used for cross-sectional enterography in a pediatric population. Materials and Methods In this noninferiority study, 66 pediatric patients undergoing clinical computed tomographic (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) enterography were randomized to receive either a flavored beverage for neutral abdominal and pelvic imaging (Breeza; Beekley Medical, Bristol, Conn) or a low-density barium sulfate suspension. Patients were blinded to the oral contrast material administered and were asked to rate taste, texture, and their perceived health state (where 0 was very bad and 10 was very good). Ingested volume of the prescribed weight-based oral contrast material preparation was recorded. Maximum small bowel diameter was measured in all four abdominal quadrants. Mean bowel diameter as well as taste, texture, and health state scores were compared between cohorts by using t tests; proportions were compared by using Fisher exact tests. Results Thirty-three patients each received Breeza and barium sulfate suspension, respectively. No difference was found in age (Breeza, 13.5 years ± 2.6 [standard deviation]; barium sulfate suspension, 13.9 years ± 2.8; P = .49), sex distribution (15 girls each; P > .99), or health state (P = .21) between cohorts. Twenty-eight of 33 (84.8%) and 17 of 33 (51.5%) patients completed the Breeza and barium sulfate suspension preparations, respectively (P = .007). Breeza received higher scores for taste (6.1 ± 2.5 vs 2.7 ± 2.5; P < .0001) and texture (7.3 ± 2.3 vs 3.6 ± 2.9; P < .0001).

197,16,16,15478848,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is among the most common disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, with symptoms affecting a substantial proportion of the US population on a daily basis. Heartburn and related symptoms arise from a number of pathophysiologic mechanisms, including dilated intercellular spaces, increased duration of acid reflux, greater proximal extent of reflux, and esophageal sensitivity. Chronic reflux may result in serious complications, such as esophageal erosions or ulceration, stricture, and Barrett esophagus. The goals of GERD therapy are to relieve patients' symptoms and prevent complications. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) represent the most effective treatment option for GERD, relieving symptoms, healing erosions, and maintaining a healed mucosa. Differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics among the PPIs may result in differences in intragastric pH holding time as well as the onset of symptom relief. Lansoprazole and esomeprazole produce similar degrees and onset of symptom relief, with both providing greater symptom relief as compared with omeprazole. Although manufactured as capsules containing enteric-coated granules, lansoprazole, omeprazole, and esomeprazole maintain their high level of pharmacologic efficacy when the capsule contents are emptied into soft foods or various liquids. Lansoprazole and pantoprazole also are manufactured as intravenous formulations, and lansoprazole is available as strawberry-flavored granules for oral suspension and as an orally disintegrating tablet. These alternative routes of administration are particularly beneficial in the management of acid-related disorders in infants, children, the elderly, and patients of all ages who have difficulty swallowing or are unable to swallow intact capsules or tablets and those in the critical care setting.

198,17,17,14725575,"The management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) continues to garner vast amounts of attention among physicians who care for adults. However, there is an increasing awareness of the fact that this disease, as well as several other lifelong digestive diseases (i.e. Crohn's disease) may actually have their origins in childhood. Paediatric gastro-oesophageal reflux (GER) is likely to share a similar pathophysiology to adult GER, and mounting evidence from published preliminary data suggests a genetic susceptibility to GERD. However, further studies will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis. In children, GER has a distinct presentation from that in adults, with the diagnostic work-up based upon the patient's age as well as their presenting signs and symptoms. Like their adult counterparts, the early detection and treatment of GER in children may result in a better long-term outcome, improved quality-of-life, and a reduction in overall healthcare burden. While the treatment of GER in infants tends to be conservative (i.e. positioning during feeding, smaller feedings), its management in older children parallels that of adults and includes lifestyle changes and pharmacological therapy. However, with persistent symptoms, acid suppression is the mainstay of GERD management in both children and adults. Several studies in children have verified that acid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor is superior to histamine-2 receptor antagonists. Among the proton pump inhibitors, both lansoprazole and omeprazole have been the subject of published adult and paediatric studies demonstrating their short and long-term safety, in addition to their efficacy in a variety of oesophageal and supra-oesophageal GERD related conditions. These two proton pump inhibitors are manufactured as capsules containing enteric-coated granules that can be emptied into soft foods or liquids without compromising their pharmacological effects or pharmacokinetic properties.

The study design is that of retrospective review of pediatric patients who underwent CTE or MRE from January 2014 to June 2016. Patients ingested low-concentration barium suspension or flavored beverage containing sorbitol and mannitol. The need for nasogastric tube (NGT) administration, amount ingested, emesis, distal extent of contrast, SB distension, terminal ileum (TI) transverse dimension, and diagnostic confidence in TI disease were assessed. Three radiologists each blindly reviewed a subset of the studies. Of the total 591 scans in 504 patients, 316 scans used low-concentration barium suspension and 275 scans flavored beverage. Nearly all consumed the entire amount (97% vs. 96%). Low-concentration barium suspension exams required NGT more often (7% [23/316] vs. 1% [3/275]; p < 0.0003), and tended to have more emesis (3% [9/316] vs. 1% [3/275]; p = 0.13).

Flavored beverage exams demonstrated a slight increase in distal extent of luminal distension (p = 0.02). A new flavored beverage distends small bowel as well as low-concentration barium suspension, with decreased requirement for NGT insertion and improved distal extent of luminal distension, and without any decrease in diagnostic confidence in the presence or the absence of TI disease.

In view of the particularity of puerpera, the research on pathogenesis and drug development of PPD are highly dependent on animal models. Although both maternal separation (MS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) modeling approaches have been used in PPD studies, the characteristics of the two rodent models have not been compared to explain which is more advantageous in PPD research. In this study, we applied 21-day MS and CUMS paradigms to induce mouse model of PPD and compared their differences in behavior, physiology and gut microbiota. As a result, the two models exhibited significant increases of immobility time in forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST), whereas sucrose preference index and pup weight were significantly decreased. Both displayed depression-like behaviors, and CUMS was more obvious, which demonstrated by the lower levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and higher hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis related mRNA expression (corticotropin releasing hormone, corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1) in CMUS group than that in MS group. The gut microbiota in MS and CUMS groups were significantly different in terms of the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria. In conclusion, MS model and CUMS model have different performance in behavior and physiology. The CUMS model showed more obvious parameter changes, which may be more suitable for PPD induced by various social environmental factors.

202,21,21,25747220,"Children generally reject taking medicine which does not have a favorable shape, taste, flavor, etc. However, if a child who needs to take a medicine, rejects taking it, he might never recover from his condition. When a child is unable to take medicine orally, it is intravenously administered, and he and his caregivers then may experience stress. Syrups and suspensions are considered as favorable types of dosage forms in which to orally administer medicine to infants and children. However, they may have disadvantages such as solubility, a bad taste, portability problems or required refrigerator storage. World Health Organization (WHO) currently favors that infants and children be treated with oral solid medicines. New oral solid tablets, such as a mini-tablet, instead of liquid medicines are proposed for this group, however, there are a few reports that mini-tablets are suitable for infants and children. Palatability is one of the main elements of patient acceptability of an oral pediatric medicine. Palatability is defined as the overall appreciation of an oral medicinal product in relation to its smell, taste, aftertaste and feeling in the mouth.

203,22,22,34716786,"A 28-kDa polysaccharide-peptide (PGL) with antidepressant-like activities was isolated from spores of the mushroom Ganoderma lucidum. It was unadsorbed on DEAE-cellulose. Its internal amino acid sequences manifested pronounced similarity with proteins from the mushrooms Lentinula edodes and Agaricus bisporus. The monosaccharides present in 28-kDa PGL comprised predominantly of glucose (over 90%) and much fewer galactose, mannose residues, and other residues. PGL manifested antidepressant-like activities as follows. It enhanced viability and DNA content in corticosterone-injured PC12 cells(a cell line derived from a pheochromocytoma of the rat adrenal medulla with an embryonic origin from the neural crest containing a mixture of neuroblastic cells and eosinophilic cells) and reduced LDH release. A single acute PGL treatment shortened the duration of immobility of mice in both tail suspension and forced swimming tests. PGL treatment enhanced sucrose preference and shortened the duration of immobility in mice exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Chronic PGL treatment reversed the decline in mouse brain serotonin and norepinephrine levels but did not affect dopamine levels. PGL decreased serum corticosterone levels and increased BDNF mRNA and protein levels and increased synapsin I and PSD95 levels in the prefrontal cortex. This effect was completely blocked by pretreatment with the BDNF antagonist K252a, indicating that PGL increased synaptic proteins in a BDNF-dependent manner.Key points• An antidepressive polysaccharide-peptide PGL was isolated from G. lucidum spores.• PGL protected PC12 nerve cells from the toxicity of corticosterone.• PGL upregulated BDNF expression and influenced key factors in the prefrontal cortex.

204,23,23,27036645,"Specific growth factors induce formation and differentiation of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and are essential for brain development and function. Fibroblast growth factor 22 (FGF22) is important for specifying excitatory synapses during development, including in the hippocampus. Mice with a genetic deletion of FGF22 (FGF22KO) during development subsequently have fewer hippocampal excitatory synapses in adulthood. As a result, FGF22KO mice are resistant to epileptic seizure induction. In addition to playing a key role in learning, the hippocampus is known to mediate mood and anxiety. Here, we explored whether loss of FGF22 alters affective, anxiety or social cognitive behaviors in mice. We found that relative to control mice, FGF22KO mice display longer duration of floating and decreased latency to float in the forced swim test, increased immobility in the tail suspension test, and decreased preference for sucrose in the sucrose preference test, which are all suggestive of a depressive-like phenotype. No differences were observed between control and FGF22KO mice in other behavioral assays, including motor, anxiety, or social cognitive tests. These results suggest a novel role for FGF22 specifically in affective behaviors.

205,24,24,25784402,"To develop an extemporaneous 1% benznidazole (BNZ) suspension, with masked taste and adequate stability starting from available commercial tablets. The quality of compounding was evaluated through content uniformity measurement and physical and microbiological stability evaluation, under different storage conditions during 90 days. Six batches of 1% BNZ suspension were prepared using safe excipients currently available in a galenic area of Hospital Pharmacy and then stored at 5 and 25 °C for 90 days. The BNZ content was determined by UV spectrophotometry. Physical stability was defined as the absence of colour, odour and/or flavour changes and the re-suspension of solid phase by a reasonable amount of simple 15-s shaking. The compliance with microbiological attributes of non-sterile pharmaceutical products was also evaluated. An oral liquid suspension, containing 1% of BNZ, was developed from commercially available BNZ tablets. The formulations stored for 90 days were easily re-dispersed after a simple 15-s shaking, ensuring the pouring of a liquid volume containing the desired dose of BNZ. All samples were within the acceptable range of BNZ concentration with minimal standard deviations. There were no detectable changes in colour, odour, viscosity, pH and microbial growth, complying with official quality requirements. The quality attributes were not affected by storage, room or refrigeration conditions or by the frequent opening or closing of the multidose containers. Paediatric oral liquid suspension containing 1.0% of BNZ was easily prepared starting from commercial tablets, being an interesting alternative for optimising the paediatric treatment of Chagas disease.

206,25,25,8878244,"Azithromycin, the prototypical azalide antibiotic, has a wide spectrum of activity that is characterized by resistance to beta-lactamase-producing microbes and efficacy against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae. Tissue-directed pharmacokinetics include tissue concentrations up to 100-fold higher than those in plasma and a tissue half-life of up to 4 days. Pharmacokinetics of azithromycin permits a reduction in dosage frequency and duration while maintaining efficacy comparable to that of conventional 7- to 10-day three or four times daily regimens. Dosage interval, duration of treatment, side effects and palatability can affect compliance and thus clinical outcome. Compliance among children is important in light of the high incidence of community-acquired infections such as otitis media and streptococcal pharyngitis.

The taste and acceptability of the oral suspension form of azithromycin vs. cefixime, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefprozil, clarithromycin or loracarbef were rated by children during blinded taste tests and with acceptability/ preference questionnaires. Analysis of the mean acceptability/ preference rating from 769 children demonstrated that the flavor of azithromycin was rated significantly higher than that of cefpodoxime (4.3 vs. 2.8), cefprozil (4.0 vs. 3.4) and clarithromycin (4.3 vs. 2.7) and was comparable to that of cefixime (4.0 vs. 4.2) and loracarbef (4.4 vs. 4.5).

207,26,26,24061605,"This in situ study aimed to investigate the effect of a sugar-free antibiotic suspension containing amoxicillin and clavulanic acid on enamel hardness of human primary teeth simulating different conditions of cariogenic challenge. A crossover, partially double-blind study was conducted in three phases of 14 days each, during which 11 volunteers wore palatal devices containing six dental enamel blocks covered with plastic meshes to allow biofilm formation. Dental blocks were extraorally submitted to treatment with a 20 % sucrose solution at three different daily frequencies of exposure (0, 3, and 8 times/day), and to the antibiotic suspension or its excipients at an 8-h time interval application regimen. On the 14th day of each phase, the blocks were removed for enamel analysis (surface and cross-sectional microhardness--SMH and CSMH). The antibiotic suspension showed significant higher SMH and CSMH values than the excipients (p < 0.05; Wilcoxon), regardless of the frequency of sucrose exposure. Sucrose exposure did not account for further enamel demineralization both for antibiotic and excipients (p > 0.05; Friedman). A protective effect of the antibiotic suspension on enamel demineralization was verified because its excipients alone promoted more pronounced surface and subsurface enamel demineralization, even in the absence of sucrose exposure. The use of a sugar-free amoxicillin/clavulanic acid suspension may promote a protective effect on primary enamel demineralization probably due to its topical effect on dental biofilm.

208,27,27,15478849,"Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is a ubiquitous disorder in infants. Whereas infants typically outgrow regurgitation by 1 year of age, the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms in those aged 3 to >18 years ranges from 1.8% to 22%. The pathophysiology of GERD in children is similar to that in adults. However, children may present with gastroesophageal and extraesophageal symptoms distinct from classic heartburn. In addition to a growing awareness of the high prevalence of the disorder, increasing evidence supports GERD being a lifelong condition in some individuals that begins in childhood. Although the diagnostic workup in children compared with adults may differ, studies suggest that the early detection and treatment of GERD in childhood may result in better adult disease outcomes, improved quality of life, and decreased overall healthcare burden. Studies of proton pump inhibitor therapy in children confirm high rates of mucosal healing and GER symptom resolution, even in children whose symptoms did not respond to H2-receptor therapy or fundoplication procedures. Omeprazole, lansoprazole, and esomeprazole are formulated as capsules containing enteric-coated granules that can be sprinkled onto applesauce or other soft foods. Lansoprazole is also formulated as strawberry-flavored granules for suspension. These as well as other alternative dosing formulations expand the ability to administer these agents to children. Moreover, long-term studies in adults and in children demonstrate that these agents are safe and well tolerated, even at the higher milligram per kilogram doses that are often required in pediatric patients because of their greater hepatic metabolic capacity.

During early development of this new formulation, two studies were performed in healthy subjects, one to evaluate the palatability of three flavours of A-L, and a second one to compare the bioavailability of active principles between the dispersible tablet and the tablet (administered crushed and intact). Study 1 was performed in 48 healthy schoolchildren in Tanzania. Within 1 day, all subjects tasted a strawberry-, orange- and cherry-flavoured oral A-L suspension for 10 seconds (without swallowing) in a randomized, single-blind, crossover fashion. The palatability of each formulation was rated using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Study 2 was an open, randomized crossover trial in 48 healthy adults given single doses of A-L (80 mg artemether + 480 mg lumefantrine) with food. The objectives were to compare the bioavailability of artemether, dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and lumefantrine between the dispersible tablet and the tablet administered crushed (primary objective) and intact (secondary objective). Study 1 showed no statistically significant difference in VAS scores between the three flavours but cherry had the highest score in several ratings (particularly for overall liking). Study 2 demonstrated that the dispersible and crushed tablets delivered bioequivalent artemether, DHA and lumefantrine systemic exposure (area under the curve [AUC]); mean ± SD AUC0-tlast were 208 ± 113 vs 195 ± 93 h.ng/ml for artemether, 206 ± 81 vs 199 ± 84 h.ng/ml for DHA and 262 ± 107 vs 291 ± 106 h x μg/ml for lumefantrine. Bioequivalence was also shown for peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of DHA and lumefantrine. Compared with the intact tablet, the dispersible tablet resulted in bioequivalent lumefantrine exposure, but AUC and Cmax values of artemether and DHA were 20-35% lower.

We prospectively compared three MRE oral preparations in pediatric patients with known or suspected Crohn disease with respect to patient-reported tolerability and radiologist-determined small-bowel distension and opacification. Seventy-five pediatric patients (mean age 14.8 years, 55% female) with known or suspected Crohn disease referred for MRE were randomized to an oral preparation with a sugar alcohol-based flavored beverage (Breeza), polyethylene glycol preparation (MiraLAX), or low-concentration barium sulfate suspension (VoLumen). Patients were instructed to consume oral contrast agent (using a weight-based protocol) beginning 60 min prior to MRE imaging. Following MRE, patients completed a questionnaire regarding their oral preparation solution including: taste (1-5 scale), feeling of well-being (1-5 scale) and willingness to consume again (yes/no). Two radiologists reviewed all MRE exams and rated exams for global features (active disease, overall small-bowel distention [1-4 scale]) and features specific to individual small-bowel segments (extent of distention, maximal luminal diameter, opacification, and susceptibility artifact). Statistical methods included one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey honest difference and Fisher exact tests. The overall rate of completion of the entire prescribed contrast volume was 53% (40/75), with a significantly higher rate of completion for MiraLAX than for VoLumen (70% vs. 30%, P=0.007). Crossover to a different preparation occurred in nine patients (12%) and was significantly more frequent when the initial preparation was VoLumen versus MiraLAX (29% vs. 0%, P=0.005). Mean subjective taste ratings for both MiraLAX (3.4, P<0.0001) and Breeza (2.8, P=0.006) were superior to those of VoLumen (1.9), which persisted in the subset of patients with MRE evidence of active Crohn disease. Patients who consumed MiraLAX were more likely to be willing to drink it again compared to those consuming VoLumen (82% vs. 46%, P=0.009). Overall small-bowel distention and bowel-segment-specific metrics (distention, maximal diameter, opacification and susceptibility) did not significantly differ among groups.

216,35,35,28271493,"Prednisone is a widely used anti-inflammatory for a variety of conditions. While oral liquid formulations of prednisone enable weight-based dosing, children frequently find them to be objectionable due to bitter taste. This limitation of prednisone can adversely impact patient acceptance and may result in non-compliance. Efforts to mask flavours often result in poorly controlled, heterogeneous particle distributions and can provide ineffective taste masking. The present work utilized a novel drug delivery technology developed by Orbis Biosciences, Inc., to create an oral taste-masked formulation of prednisone. The study examined the palatability of Orbis' microsphere prednisone formulation in healthy young adults (n = 24). Four test articles were used in the study including a reference formulation (Roxanne Laboratories), a control and the test formulation (Orbis) prepared in two different ways. Study participants were randomized in a crossover design. Results indicated that the test prednisone formulation was indistinguishable from the control, and both were preferable to the reference formulation in every category of palatability assessed using a validated 9-point Hedonic Scale. The data also suggested that preparing the microsphere suspension immediately before administration results in the most ideal palatability properties. In conclusion, the novel microsphere formulation technology was effective in taste-masking prednisone.

217,36,36,19246906,"Both Candida albicans and lactobacilli are common colonizers of carious lesions in children and adolescents. The purpose of this study is to compare the velocity of acid production between C. albicans and several Lactobacillus species at different pH levels and concentrations of glucose. Washed, pure resting-cell suspensions were obtained by culturing a total of 28 oral isolates comprising the species C. albicans, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus paracasei paracasei, Lactobacillus paracasei tolerans and Lactobacillus delbrueckii lactis. Acid production from glucose was determined at a constant pH of 7.0, 5.5, 5.0 and 4.0 by repeated titrations with NaOH in an automated pH-stat system. Acid formation rates of yeast and lactobacilli proved to be similar at both neutral and low pH, while in a moderately acidic environment C. albicans produced less acid than the lactobacilli. Ion chromatographic analysis of the cell-free medium after titration revealed pyruvate to be the predominant organic acid anion secreted by C. albicans. The proportion of organic acids to overall acid production by the yeast was below 10% at neutral conditions, in contrast to 42-66% at pH 4.0. Compared to lactobacilli, yeast required a concentration of glucose that was about 50 times higher to allow acid production at half the maximum speed. Considering the clinical data in the literature about the frequency and proportions of microorganisms present in early childhood caries lesions, the contribution of oral lactobacilli as well as C. albicans to overall microbial acid formation appears to be important.

218,37,37,16732449,"Growing evidence from clinical studies suggests that mothers using xylitol gums or lozenges have decreased levels of Streptococcus mutans (SM) and do not transmit these cariogenic bacteria as readily to their children. To begin to determine mechanisms for these clinical findings and to explore potential synergism of antimicrobial combinations, we studied the effect of multiple exposures of chlorhexidine (CHX) combined with copper gluconate (CG) or zinc gluconate (ZG) followed by xylitol (XYL) on the ability of SM to adhere and form biofilms. Cell suspensions of SM were exposed two times to CHX; CG; CHX plus CG; ZG; and CHX plus ZG, and then four times to XYL. Control cells were exposed six times to water or XYL or received no treatment. For biofilm assessment, glass slides were inoculated with treated cells, and numbers of bacteria were enumerated after 48 hours of incubation. To assess the ability of SM to adhere, microtiter plate wells coated with primary S. sanguinis biofilms grown in sucrose were inoculated with treated SM, and adhesion was determined. Cells exposed to CHX-XYL combinations exhibited significant but transient inhibition of growth. The multiple-exposure regimen groups showed significant decreases in the ability of SM to form biofilms (P < 0.05). However, the CHX-XYL group exhibited a much greater effect than the other treatment groups (P < 0.001). Adhesion studies revealed that none of the multiple-exposure regimens had a significant effect on adhesion of SM to primary biofilms of S. sanguinis. We concluded that significant inhibition of SM growth and subsequent inability to grow as biofilms in the presence of sucrose occurs after a staggered exposure regimen to CHX initially and then to XYL. This may help explain the clinical data showing the decreased levels of SM in mothers treated with CHX and XYL.

219,38,38,22478950,"Prescribing of diclofenac for children usually involves a dose different from commercially available strengths. This drug is available only as tablets, which can be divided only so many times before the dose obtained becomes inaccurate. In addition, children may have difficulty swallowing tablets. For these reasons, a compounding formula for a liquid dosage form is essential to ensure effective delivery of the drug to pediatric patients. To develop a compounding formula for diclofenac sodium and to determine the extended physical and chemical stability of this compound when stored in amber polyvinyl chloride (PVC) prescription bottles under refrigeration and at room temperature. A suspension of diclofenac sodium (10 mg/mL) was prepared from commercially available diclofenac sodium tablets, with Ora-Blend as the suspending and flavouring agent. The suspension was packaged in 60-mL amber PVC prescription bottles and stored at either room temperature (23°C) or under refrigeration (5°C). Samples were collected on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 27, 56, and 93. Chemical stability was determined using a validated stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography method. At each sampling time, the suspensions were checked for changes in appearance (i.e., colour, layering, caking, ease of resuspension), odour, and pH. The diclofenac sodium suspensions were very stable, retaining at least 99.5% of the original concentration for up to 93 days, regardless of storage temperature. There were no apparent changes in the physical appearance of the suspensions, nor were there any substantial changes in odour or pH. Suspensions of diclofenac sodium (10 mg/mL) were quantitatively stable but difficult to prepare because of the enteric coating of the tablets. Therefore, it is recommended that diclofenac powder be used for the preparation of suspensions. For pediatric use, palatability is a consideration, and a masking agent should be added before administration. An expiry date of up to 93 days is suggested. La prescription de diclofénac aux enfants requiert généralement une dose qui ne correspond à aucun des dosages disponibles dans le commerce. Ce médicament n’existe que sous forme de comprimés qui ne peuvent être subdivisés que quelques fois sans compromettre l’exactitude de la dose obtenue. En outre, les enfants peuvent avoir du mal à avaler les comprimés. Pour ces raisons, il faut une recette pour la préparation d’une forme pharmaceutique liquide afin d’assurer l’administration effective du médicament aux patients en pédiatrie. Développer une recette pour la préparation de diclofénac sodique et déterminer la stabilité physique et chimique prolongée de cette préparation lorsqu’elle est conservée dans des flacons en polychlorure de vinyle (PVC) ambré pour médicaments d’ordonnance au réfrigérateur ou à la température ambiante. Une suspension de diclofénac sodique (10 mg/mL) a été préparée à partir de comprimés de diclofénac sodique commercialisés avec l’agent de suspension et aromatisant, Ora-Blend. La suspension a été conditionnée dans des flacons en PVC ambré de 60 mL pour médicaments d’ordonnance, puis entreposée à la température ambiante (23 °C) ou au réfrigérateur (5 °C). Des échantillons ont été prélevés aux jours 0, 7, 14, 21, 27, 56 et 93. La stabilité chimique a été déterminée à l’aide d’une épreuve validée par chromatographie liquide haute performance. À chaque prélèvement d’échantillon, les suspensions ont été inspectées visuellement pour déceler tout changement d’apparence (c.-à-d., couleur, stratification, agglutination et facilité de remise en suspension), d’odeur et de pH. Les suspensions de diclofénac sodique sont demeurées très stables, conservant plus de 99,5 % de la concentration initiale pendant une période allant jusqu’à 93 jours, peu importe les conditions d’entreposage. On n’a observé aucun changement évident dans l’apparence des suspensions ni de changement substantiel dans l’odeur ou le pH des suspensions. Les suspensions de diclofénac sodique (10 mg/mL) étaient quantitativement stables, mais difficiles à préparer à cause de l’enrobage entérosoluble des comprimés. Par conséquent, il est recommandé d’utiliser plutôt le diclofénac en poudre. La palatabilité étant un facteur dont il faut tenir compte en pédiatrie, on devrait ajouter un masquant du goût avant l’administration de la préparation.

S. mutans (clinical strains) represented the inoculum to form biofilm on the fragments for 24 h. Twelve fragments were separated for the initial count of microorganisms (baseline). The other fragments were divided into 4 groups (n=12) of treatment: G1 (Clavulin(r)), G2 (Betamox(r)), G3 (chlorhexidine 0.12%), G4 (sucrose 10%). All specimens had their self-control area (covered area). The cross-sectional microhardness (CSMH) was evaluated for each specimen.

222,41,41,14522964,"Oscillations in citric acid cycle intermediates have never been previously reported in any type of cell. Here we show that adding pyruvate to isolated mitochondria from liver, pancreatic islets, and INS-1 insulinoma cells or adding glucose to intact INS-1 cells causes sustained oscillations in citrate levels. Other citric acid cycle intermediates measured either did not oscillate or possibly oscillated with a low amplitude. In INS-1 mitochondria citrate oscillations are in phase with NAD(P) oscillations, and in intact INS-1 cells citrate oscillations parallel oscillations in ATP, suggesting that these processes are co-regulated. Oscillations have been extensively studied in the pancreatic beta cell where oscillations in glycolysis, NAD(P)/NAD(P)H and ATP/ADP ratios, plasma membrane electrical activity, calcium levels, and insulin secretion have been well documented. Because the mitochondrion is the major site of ATP synthesis and NADH oxidation and the only site of citrate synthesis, mitochondria need to be synchronized for these factors to oscillate. In suspensions of mitochondria from various organs, most of the citrate is exported from the mitochondria. In addition, citrate inhibits its own synthesis. We propose that this enables citrate itself to act as one of the cellular messengers that synchronizes mitochondria. Furthermore, because citrate is a potent inhibitor of the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase, the pacemaker of glycolytic oscillations, citrate may act as a metabolic link between mitochondria and glycolysis. Citrate oscillations may coordinate oscillations in mitochondrial energy production and anaplerosis with glycolytic oscillations, which in the beta cell are known to parallel oscillations in insulin secretion.

Granulation experiments were performed incorporating PZQ either in the powder mixture, according to the traditional way, or in the liquid phase containing wetting agents. In the powder mixture several excipients were tested: Flowlac 100 as filler, Galeniq 721 (isomalt) and Neosorb P 100 T (D-sorbitol) as sweeteners and PVP K30 as binder; while in the liquid phase Lutrol F68, Cremophor RH 40 or Tween 80 as surfactants were investigated. Different formulations loaded with 10% w/w (batches 1-8) and 20% w/w of PZQ (batches 9-13) were produced The majority of granules displayed good flow properties and uniform drug content. X-ray powder diffraction showed that PZQ remained in its original crystalline state, while differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform-infrared analysis evidenced the formation of chemical interactions among the ingredients. The solubilisation test performed in non-sink condition to reproduce the actual condition in which a child of 4 years takes the medicine revealed that granules quickly formed a very fine suspension in water (dV90=39.9 μm). Although after the granulation process the solubility of raw PZQ was not increased, adding the aqueous suspension to 500 ml of buffer solution of pH 1.5, simulating the fasted state of a child, 50% of the drug was dissolved after 30 min. After granule manipulation with milk and fruit juices, no PZQ degradation was observed during time. Finally, the selected granule formulation provided evidence to be stable even at hot and very humid climate (30°C/75% RH), at least for the examined time.

On the other hand, the mixture with a chocolate jelly, which has a neutral pH, was less bitter than water suspensions of the dry syrups. The bitterness intensities predicted by the taste sensor output values correlated well with the observed bitterness intensities in human gustatory sensation tests. When the concentrations of CAM and AZM in solutions extracted from physical mixtures of dry syrup and jelly were determined by HPLC, concentrations in the solutions extracted from mixtures with acidic jellies were higher than those from mixtures with a neutral jelly (almost 90 times higher for CAM, and almost 7-10 times higher for AZM). Thus, bitterness suppression is correlated with the pH of the jelly. Finally, a drug dissolution test for dry syrup with and without jelly was performed using the paddle method. There was no significance difference in dissolution profile. It was concluded the appropriate choice of jelly with the right pH is essential for taste masking.

The contribution of the glucosyl and fructosyl moieties of sucrose to each metabolic by-product was determined. All of the metabolic data were adjusted to the size of the plaque specimens as determined by colony-forming units, Coulter counter particle counts, and fluorometric protein analyses. Both types of dental plaque transformed from 70 to 80% of the consumed sucrose into lactic acid and cell-bound and insoluble products, primarily intracellular polysaccharide and extracellular glucan. Volatile acids accounted for most of the remaining by-products. CP metabolized significantly more sucrose than NCP and consequently produced significantly higher levels of each metabolic by-product. High levels of Streptococcus mutans were found in CP (averaging 40% of colony-forming units), whereas it was virtually absent in NCP. Actinomyces and S. sanguis levels were distinctly higher in NCP.

The taste rating of cloxacillin was significantly lower compared with the other three antibiotics (p = 0.001). Cloxacillin was chosen as having the worst taste by a significant proportion of the children (18 of 20). None of the antibiotics was clearly best tasting. Given similar effectiveness, taste considerations may be important in the decision as to which antibiotic to prescribe. The perception that cloxacillin is poor tasting to children is supported by this study, which suggests that when compliance with oral medication is critical for successful treatment, prescription of cloxacillin suspension should be avoided.

233,52,52,18245869,"Palatability is an important factor in medication compliance for children where the acceptability of a liquid medication and its ease of administration will be greatly affected by its taste. The objective of this study was to determine which, if any of two steroid preparations, oral dexamethasone or oral prednisolone, was more palatable to children requiring steroid treatment for asthma. A single-blind taste test of 2 different steroid suspensions, liquid prednisolone (1mg/ml) versus liquid dexamethasone (1mg/ml), was conducted in children aged 5-12 years, presenting to the pediatric emergency department with an exacerbation of asthma requiring steroid treatment. Children received 2.5mls of either prednisolone or dexamethasone and were asked to score their impression of taste on a 10 cm visual analog scale. After cleansing of the palate they were given the other steroid and scored its taste. Thirty-nine children (54% male) were enrolled in the study. The mean age was 7.1 years (SD=2.0). The median visual analog scale measurement for dexamethasone was 8.2 cm (IQR= 5.2) whilst the median measurement for prednisolone was 5.0 cm (IQR= 7.3), p=0.03. Male children were more likely to prefer dexamethasone than females with a median score of 9.9 cm (IQR=3.8) for males vs. 5.9 cm (IQR=9.3) for females, p=0.005. There was no gender preference for prednisolone. There was a statistically significant difference between the taste of dexamethasone and prednisolone, with dexamethasone being the preferred steroid among pediatric patients with asthma. Males were much more likely to prefer dexamethasone than females.

The parasitological diagnosis was based on stool examination, a trophozoite search in duodenal aspiration, mucus adhered to mucosa and parasite identification in the intestinal biopsy material. Functional intestinal absorption studies, IgA determination in intestinal secretions and immunofluorescence studies were made. After the tests, tinidazole in suspension was administered at 60-70 mg/kg in one single oral dose. Patients were clinically re-evaluated and tests were done again after 30 days. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the changes in the functional morphologic and immunologic studies and the therapeutic efficacy of the drug in a single dose. Nine patients had good clinical results, 2 fair and 3 were not evaluated due to celiac disease. All had negative results on the parasitological tests after treatment. There was no relationship between the number of parasites and the severity of symptoms. There was no significant difference between stool fat and d-xylose at the time of diagnosis and 30 days after the administration of tinidazole. The lactose tolerance test presented a significant difference (p less than 0.05) in the disaccharide absorption after treatment. The secretory IgA revealed significantly lower value (p less than 0.01) with respect to the normal values. The immunofluorescence showed productive IgA cells in all cases.

The granules are designed to be mixed with vehicles that facilitate delivery to children, who may be unable to swallow solid formulations. The primary objective of this study-conducted on the sponsor's initiative-was to compare the bioavailability of rabeprazole granules when mixed with various dosing vehicles (small amount of soft food or infant formula) with that of a rabeprazole suspension with inactive vehicle granules (reference), to determine which dosing vehicle can be used to deliver rabeprazole in children. Tolerability was also assessed. This single-center, single-dose, randomized, open-label, 5-period crossover study was conducted in 35 healthy adult subjects. In a randomized sequence, fasting subjects received a single dose of 10-mg rabeprazole granules per treatment period, mixed with small amounts of 1 of 5 dosing vehicles (a strawberry-flavored suspension of rabeprazole granules with inactive vehicle granules reconstituted with water, yogurt [1 tablespoon], applesauce [1 tablespoon], or infant formula [5 mL], or a suspension of rabeprazole granules with inactive vehicle tablet reconstituted with water). Full plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of rabeprazole and its thioether metabolite were collected; concentrations were estimated via LC-MS/MS. PK properties were estimated using noncompartmental methods; 90% CIs around least squares mean test-to-reference ratios were calculated for C(max) and AUC values. All treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were recorded and assessed for severity (mild, moderate, or severe) and relationship to study drug. A total of 35 subjects were enrolled (mean age, 38 years; 54.3% female; 100% white; mean weight, 71.4 kg). Thirty-four subjects completed the study. Rabeprazole and rabeprazole thioether plasma PK properties were comparable between all of the dosing vehicles tested. Median T(max) was 2.5 to 3.0 hours, and mean elimination half-life was 1.27 to 1.43 hours. The 90%CIs for the least squares mean ratios for rabeprazole and rabeprazole thioether exposure were within the 80% to 125% bioequivalence limits for all relevant comparisons. All TEAEs were of mild or moderate intensity, with headache being the most commonly reported; 21 subjects (60%) experienced TEAEs during the study. No deaths or serious AEs were reported during the study; 1 subject experienced a TEAE (urinary tract infection) that led to the discontinuation of treatment. In these healthy adult subjects, the bioavailability of rabeprazole granules was comparable between all of the dosing vehicles tested, and rabeprazole was well tolerated.

Nine blood samples were drawn from each child at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h following dosing with the antibiotic. Serum fusidic acid levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A model-independent method was used for the pharmacokinetic analysis. Results were compared with those obtained after dosing eight healthy adult volunteers with 500 mg of sodium fusidate by parenteral administration (infusion) then per os. The acceptability of the single dose was good. The terminal elimination half-life t1/2 (h) and the mean residence time (MRT, h) of fusidate were similar to those determined in healthy adults after oral dosing, i.e. 16.0 +/- 14.5 versus 16.0 +/- 3.5 and 17.7 +/- 12.1 versus 17.7 +/- 2.5, respectively. In contrast, the oral bioavailability of the suspension (Fapprox., %) was relatively low: of the order of 22.5 versus 91.0% for tablets in the healthy adult, which justifies the use of a relatively higher dose in the child. This led to the calculation of an estimated total clearance (Clest., ml/min) significantly less than that in the healthy adults, while the estimated apparent volume of distribution (Vd, litre/kg) was significantly increased (10.4 +/- 9.1 versus 21.8 +/- 2.1 and 0.73 +/- 0.53 versus 0.30 +/- 0.04, respectively).

Such a product was prepared with A. caudatus grain. Batches were processed without previous treatment of the grain, washed with water or with a bicarbonate solution. Processing consisted of cooking at atmospheric pressure for 10 min before passing the partially cooked grain through a double drum-drier heated with steam at 70 psi, and at a velocity of 3 rpm. Batches were also processed with the addition of strawberry flavor. All samples were analyzed for damaged starch and fluid characteristics using a 10% concentration, viscosity (by the Brabender amylograph), water absorption and retention, particle size, stability of the suspension, and soluble sugars. The different samples were organoleptically evaluated for acceptability, consistency, astringency, sweetness flavor and aroma, with a 20-member panel. A product with water or with milk and sugar was also evaluated. The results indicated that washing the grain prior to cooking increased the consistency of the product and eliminated the astringency of the grain. Washing also increased water absorption and retention, soluble sugars and the coefficient of consistency. all samples exhibited 100% damaged starch and had a pseudoplastic behavior. The raw grain flour gave a viscosity of 500 UB, while for the processed samples this value increased to 1,420 UB. In general, its acceptability on the part of the panelists was high. It was good for the product with strawberry flavor, but it was even better for the sample without flavor which had been previously washed.

Health care personnel delivering the dose were unaware of the study hypothesis. A total of 82 containers were obtained in this manner. Each container was labelled to contain 25 g AC and 48 g sorbitol. Five unused containers of ACS were obtained as controls. Each container was thoroughly cleaned, and the contents vacuum filtered and washed with 1 L of tap water. The tared filter paper and charcoal was dried for 24 h and weighed. The average amount of charcoal retained in each used container (retained) was 0.549 g (range 0.318-1.637 g). This accounts for 2.2% of the 25 g dose expected to be delivered. The average amount of charcoal found in each unused container (actual) was 25.892 g. The delivered dose (actual minus retained) may be calculated as 101.4% of the expected 25 g dose. When using this formulation of ACS there is no significant difference between the amount of charcoal given to an overdose patient and the amount ordered for gut decontamination. Despite the poor suspension of charcoal in sorbitol and the less than ideal conditions under which it is given, the patient receives an adequate dosage of AC if it is ordered.

The lactic acid concentration was significantly reduced (p<0.05) by 22% compared with baseline following the xylitol gum regimen but was unaltered after the control gum. The levels of salivary mutans streptococci were mainly unaffected by both chewing gums.

These data were compared with plaque pH changes caused by rinsing with an established cariogenic challenge, 10% sucrose solution. Decreased plaque pH was caused by each medication tested. The extent and duration of the pH drop varied among the medications. Patterns of the pH curves are discussed in relation to sucrose content, endogenous pH, and buffering capacity of the medications. Intraoral pH response to several medications equaled or exceeded that seen when sucrose rinses alone were given. The findings are discussed in relation to dental caries-producing potential of long-term therapy with liquid medications, and two cases are presented that implicate liquid medications as a major etiologic factor leading to rampant dental decay.

251,1,1,35913365,"Previous research has underscored a need to understand the experiences and decision-making processes that contribute to suspension and expulsion in early care and education settings, particularly among young children of color. The present study conducted qualitative interviews with 20 center- and family-based childcare providers from the Minnesota Early Care and Education (MECE) study. Participants were asked about challenging child behaviors that they have encountered, their perceptions of these behaviors and how they manage them, and their thought processes around suspension and expulsion. Overall, the most frequently reported categories of challenging behaviors were physical aggression and noncompliance/defiance/arguing. The most commonly reported perceived causes of challenging behaviors were typical child development and parenting problems. The primary reported strategy for addressing challenging behaviors was connecting with the child, with relatively few providers reporting using other evidence-based strategies. Finally, the most commonly reported reasons for considering suspension or expulsion were the providers feeling they had exhausted options and could not meet the child's needs, and the child's behavior being perceived as dangerous to self or others. Implications for future research and practice (including increased support services for childcare providers) are discussed. La investigación previa ha subrayado una necesidad de comprender las experiencias y los procesos de toma de decisiones que contribuyen a la suspensión y expulsión en centros de tempranos cuidados y educación, particularmente entre niños pequeños de color. El presente estudio llevó a cabo entrevistas cualitativas con 20 proveedores de cuidado infantil con base en el centro y en la familia, del estudio Tempranos Cuidados y Educación en Minnesota (MECE). A los participantes se les preguntó acerca de los retos enfrentados en cuanto al comportamiento de los niños, sus percepciones de estos comportamientos y cómo los manejaron, así como los procesos de pensamiento sobre la suspensión y expulsión. En términos generales, las categorías más frecuentemente reportadas de comportamientos desafiantes fueron la agresión física y la desobediencia/desafío/discusión. Las más comúnmente reportadas causas percibidas de comportamientos desafiantes fueron el típico desarrollo del niño y problemas de crianza. La estrategia primariamente reportada para hablar de y dirigir los comportamientos desafiantes fue la conexión con el niño, con relativamente pocos proveedores que reportaron el uso de otra estrategia con base en la evidencia. Finalmente, las razones más comúnmente reportadas en cuanto a considerar la suspensión o la expulsión fueron el instinto del proveedor de haber agotado las opciones y el no haber podido satisfacer las necesidades del niño, así como la percepción de que el comportamiento del niño era peligroso para el propio niño y otros. Se discuten las implicaciones para la futura investigación (incluyendo el aumento de servicios de apoyo para proveedores del cuidado infantil). Les recherches précédentes ont souligné un besoin de comprendre les expériences et les processus décisionnels qui contribuent à la suspension et à l'expulsion dans les contextes de la crèche ou de l’éducation, particulièrement chez les jeunes enfants racialisés / de couleur. Cette étude a procédé à des entretiens qualitatifs avec 20 prestataires de service de garde d'enfants (centres ou crèches et prestataires à domicile) de l’étude des Soins Précoces et de l'Education (abrégé MECE) dans l’état du Minnesota aux Etats-Unis. Les participants ont répondu à des questions sur les comportements difficiles de l'enfant auxquels ils ont fait face, leurs perceptions de ces comportements et la manière dont ils les ont gérés, et leurs processus de réflexion au sujet de la suspension et de l'expulsion. Dans l'ensemble les catégories les plus fréquemment rapportées de comportements difficiles étaient l'agression physique et le non-respect, la défiance et la dispute. Les causes perçues de comportements difficiles les plus fréquemment rapportées étaient les problèmes typiques de comportement de l'enfant et de parentage. La stratégie la plus rapportée pour faire face aux comportements difficiles était de communiquer avec l'enfant, avec relativement peu de prestataires utilisant d'autres stratégies fondées sur des données probantes. Enfant, les raisons les plus communément rapportées quant à la considération de la suspension ou de l'expulsion étaient que les prestataires sentaient qu'ils avaient épuisé les options et ne pouvaient pas répondre aux besoins de l'enfant et que le comportement de l'enfant était perçu comme dangereux pour lui / elle ou les autres. Les implications pour les recherches et la pratique futures (y compris l'augmentation de services de soutien pour les prestataires de garde d'enfant) sont discutées. Die Sicht von Kinderbetreuungseinrichtungen auf problematisches Verhalten von Kindern, Suspendierung und Ausschluss: Eine qualitative Analyse Frühere Forschungsarbeiten haben die Notwendigkeit betont, die Erfahrungen und Entscheidungsprozesse zu verstehen, die zur Suspendierung und zum Ausschluss von Kindern aus der Frühbetreuung/ -erziehung beitragen, insbesondere bei Kleinkindern of Color. In der vorliegenden Studie wurden mit 20 Anbietern von Kinderbetreuungseinrichtungen und Familienbetreuungseinrichtungen aus der Minnesota Early Care and Education (MECE) Studie qualitative Interviews durchgeführt. Die Teilnehmenden wurden zu herausfordernden Verhaltensweisen von Kindern befragt, mit denen sie konfrontiert wurden, zu ihrer Wahrnehmung dieser Verhaltensweisen, zu ihrer Art, damit umzugehen, und zu ihren Denkprozessen bezüglich Suspendierung und Ausschluss. Insgesamt waren die am häufigsten genannten Kategorien herausfordernder Verhaltensweisen körperliche Aggression und Ungehorsam/Trotz/Streit. Die am häufigsten genannten Ursachen für herausforderndes Verhalten waren typische kindliche Entwicklungsprozesse und Erziehungsprobleme bei den Eltern. Die am häufigsten genannte Strategie zur Bewältigung schwieriger Verhaltensweisen war die Kontaktaufnahme mit dem Kind. Nur relativ wenige Anbieter gaben an, andere evidenzbasierte Strategien zu verwenden. Die am häufigsten genannten Gründe für eine Suspendierung oder einen Ausschluss waren schließlich, wenn die Anbieter das Gefühl hatten, alle Möglichkeiten ausgeschöpft zu haben und den Bedürfnissen des Kindes nicht gerecht werden zu können. Ein weiterer häufig genannter Grund war, wenn das Verhalten des Kindes als selbst- oder fremdgefährdend eingeschätzt wurde. Implikationen für zukünftige Forschung und Praxis (einschließlich verstärkter Unterstützungsangebote für Anbieter von Kinderbetreuungseinrichtungen) werden diskutiert. 子どもの挑戦的行動と停学、退学に関する保育者の見解:定性的分析 これまでの研究で、特に有色人種の幼児において、早期ケアや教育の現場における停学や退学の原因となる経験や意思決定過程を理解する必要性が強調されてきた。本研究では、ミネソタ州早期ケアと教育 (MECE) 研究における施設保育者および在宅保育者20名に対して定性的面接を行った。参加者は、これまでに遭遇した子どもの挑発的行動、これらの行動に対する認知、どのように対処したか、そして停学や退学に関連する思考過程について質問された。全体として、最も頻繁に報告された挑戦的行動の領域は、身体的な攻撃性と不従順/反抗的/論争的であった。挑戦的行動の原因として最もよく報告されたのは、典型的な子どもの発達と子育ての問題であった。挑戦的行動に対処するための主な戦略は、子どもと関係をつくることであり、他のエビデンスに基づいた戦略を用いることを報告した保育者は比較的少数であった。最後に、停学や退学を検討する理由として最も多く報告されたのは、選択肢を使い果たし、子どものニーズに応えられないと保育者が感じたこと、子どもの行動が自分や他人にとって危険であると認識されたことであった。今後の研究と実践への示唆 (保育者への支援サービスの充実など) を述べる。. 前的研究强调, 在早期护理和教育机构中, 需要了解导致停学和开除 (特别是在有色人种的幼儿中) 的经验与决策过程。本研究对来自“明尼苏达州早期护理和教育”(MECE) 研究项目的20个中心托儿和家庭托儿服务提供者进行了定性访谈。参与者被问及他们遇到的具有挑战性的儿童行为, 他们对这些行为的看法, 他们如何管理这些行为, 以及他们围绕停学和开除的思维过程。总体而言, 最常报告的挑战性行为类别是身体攻击, 以及不服从、反抗或争吵。最常报告的导致挑战性行为的原因是典型的儿童发育和养育问题。报告的应对挑战性行为的主要策略是与儿童沟通, 而使用其他循证策略的提供者相对较少。最后, 最常报告的考虑停学或开除的原因是, 提供者觉得他们已经穷尽了选择而无法满足儿童的需求, 以及儿童的行为被认为对自己或他人有危险。还讨论了对未来研究和实践的影响 (包括增加对托儿服务提供者的支持服务) 。. آراء مقدمي رعاية الأطفال حول السلوكيات الصعبة للأطفال وحالات التعليق والطرد: تحليل وصفي أكدت الأبحاث السابقة على الحاجة إلى فهم الخبرات وعمليات صنع القرار التي تساهم في التعليق والطرد في أماكن الرعاية والتعليم المبكرة ، لا سيما بين الأطفال الصغار الملونين. أجرت الدراسة الحالية مقابلات نوعية مع 20 من مقدمي الرعاية من مراكز الرعاية وعلى مستوى العائلات باستخدام بيانات من دراسة مينيسوتا للرعاية المبكرة والتعليم (MECE). وسُئل المشاركون عن السلوكيات الصعبة التي واجهوها مع الأطفال ، وتصوراتهم عن هذه السلوكيات وكيفية إدارتها ، وعمليات تفكيرهم حول التعليق والطرد. بشكل عام ، كانت أنواع السلوكيات الصعبة الأكثر شيوعاً هي العدوان الجسدي وعدم الامتثال / التحدي / الجدال. وكانت الأسباب المتصورة الأكثر شيوعًا للسلوكيات الصعبة هي مشكلات نمو الطفل والتربية الوالدية. كانت الإستراتيجية الأولية التي تم الإبلاغ عنها لمعالجة السلوكيات الصعبة هي التواصل مع الطفل ، مع عدد قليل نسبيًا من مقدمي الخدمة الذين أبلغوا عن استخدام استراتيجيات أخرى قائمة على الأدلة. أخيرًا ، كانت الأسباب الأكثر شيوعًا للنظر في التعليق أو الطرد هي شعور مقدمي الخدمة بأنهم استنفدوا خياراتهم ولا يمكنهم تلبية احتياجات الطفل ، وأن سلوك الطفل يُنظر إليه على أنه خطر على نفسه أو على الآخرين. تم مناقشة التطبيقات العملية على البحث والممارسة في المستقبل (بما في ذلك زيادة خدمات الدعم لمقدمي رعاية الأطفال).

252,2,2,36678693,"The scarcity of age-appropriate pharmaceutical formulations is one of the major challenges impeding successful management of tuberculosis (TB) prevalence in minors. To this end, we designed and assessed the quality of a multiparticulate reconstitutable suspension powder containing fixed dose rifampicin and pyrazinamide (150 mg/300 mg per 5 mL) which was prepared employing solid−liquid direct dispersion coupled with timed dehydration, and mechanical pulverization. The optimized formulation had a high production yield (96.000 ± 3.270%), displayed noteworthy powder flow quality (9.670 ± 1.150°), upon reconstitution the suspension flow property was non-Newtonian and was easily redispersible with gentle manual agitation (1.720 ± 0.011 strokes/second). Effective drug loading was attained for both pyrazinamide (97.230 ± 2.570%w/w) and rifampicin (97.610 ± 0.020%w/w) and drug release followed a zero-order kinetic model (R2 = 0.990) for both drugs. Microscopic examinations confirmed drug encapsulation efficiency and showed that the particulates were micro-dimensional in nature (n < 700.000 µm). The formulation was physicochemically stable with no chemically irreversible drug-excipient interactions based on the results of characterization experiments performed. Findings from organoleptic evaluations generated an overall rating of 4.000 ± 0.000 for its attractive appearance and colour 5.000 ± 0.000 confirming its excellent taste and extremely pleasant smell. Preliminary cytotoxicity studies showed a cell viability above 70.000% which indicates that the FDC formulation was biocompatible. The optimized formulation was environmentally stable either as a dry powder or reconstituted suspension. Accordingly, a stable and palatable FDC antimycobacterial reconstitutable oral suspension powder, intended for flexible dosing in children and adolescents, was optimally fabricated.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the organoleptic excipients in oral antibiotics for pediatric use marketed in Brazil. The information was obtained from the GuidetoPharmacy, a reference for the pharmaceutical trade. The analysis included dosage forms for oral administration and drugs and their combination with antibacterial action. After this survey, we identified the constitution of the flavoring, sweetening, and coloring agents of each medicine. The results are presented in a descriptive form. Twelve drugs or associations are distributed in 70medicines. Oral suspension was the most common pharmaceutical dosage form. Sweeteners were sucrose, sodium saccharin, and sodium cyclamate. All the coloring agents observed are synthetic and the most frequent ones were yellow twilight no. 6, yellow tartrazine no. 5, and red ponceau 4R. The presence of two or more types of flavorings per medicine was observed. Antibacterials use coloring agents, flavorings, and sweeteners to facilitate the administration of medicines for children, using up to six different substances per formulation. No natural coloring agent was observed, demonstrating an issue to be explored in the future. It is important to note that, although necessary, these excipients are responsible for a high incidence of allergic reactions in children.

254,4,4,35397909,"Featured with high multiplexibility, suspension microarray technology usually involves the conjugation of second-antibody with organic dye based fluorescent proteins, which are inherently unsuitable for multicolor signaling under single wavelength excitation. In addition, application of single QDs-based fluorescent reporter in suspension microarray is dramatically hampered since its preparation often suffers from poor reproducibility and stability. Herein, a novel suspension microarray system based on dual color quantum dots (QDs) nanobead as fluorescence label was developed for simultaneous detection of prostate specific antigen (PSA) biomarkers. When both antigens are present in sera sample, free (f)-PSA antibody-conjugated green and complexed (c)-PSA antibody-conjugated red QDs nanobeads would be both specifically absorbed onto the surface of total PSA antibody-conjugated magnetic beads, leading to the formation of magnetic fluorescent hybrid that can be purified from the mixture by an external magnet prior to flow cytometry analysis. The proposed method demonstrates simultaneous detection ability for f- and c- PSA antigen assay with high detection sensitivity that is comparable to clinical approaches including ELISA and chemiluminescence assay. Furthermore, result of clinical application of the proposed method is consistency with clinical data, demonstrating its potential in suspension microarray for accurate prostate cancer diagnosis.

The classical clinical triad, consisting of abdominal colics, red jelly stools and a palpable mass, is only present in approximately 50% of cases, 20% of patients are symptom free at clinical presentation. Primary imaging modality of choice is ultrasound scanning, which enables the diagnosis or exclusion of an intussusception at a sensitivity of 98-100%, specificity of 88% and a negative predictive value of 100%. In emergency cases, additional plain films are necessary to detect potential intestinal perforation, to identify intestinal obstruction or other diseases mimicking the clinical presentation. Once the diagnosis of an intussusception is established, non-surgical reduction (NSR) is used. A surgical approach is chosen in patients with signs of perforation, shock or peritonitis. Depending on the choice of guiding imaging technique, different contrast media are used for NSR. Barium suspension or air with fluoroscopic guidance, or saline only or mixed with water-soluble contrast under sonographic guidance, has to be used.

However, repigmentation in generalized and acrofacial vitiligo and over acral or bony sites (eg, elbows, knees, iliac crests, and malleoli), which are difficult to treat, is challenging. To study the efficacy of transplanting a combination of autologous, noncultured ECS and FCS (ECS + FCS) compared with ECS alone in stable vitiligo. A prospective, observer-blinded, active-controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted at a tertiary care hospital, with treatment administered as an outpatient procedure. Thirty participants who had stable vitiligo with symmetrical lesions were recruited between October 18, 2013, and October 28, 2016. All of the lesions were resistant to medical modalities with minimum lesional stability of 1 year. Intent-to-treat analysis was used. ECS + FCS was prepared by mixing equal amounts (in cell number) of FCS with ECS. After manual dermabrasion, ECS was applied to 1 lesion and ECS + FCS was applied to the anatomically based paired lesion of the same patient. No adjuvant treatment was given. Patients were followed up at 4, 8, and 16 weeks by a blinded observer and extent of repigmentation, color match, pattern of repigmentation, patient satisfaction and complications were noted. Both the visual and the computerized image analysis methods were used for outcome assessment. Cell suspensions were assessed post hoc for OCT4+ stem cell counts using flow cytometry; expression of stem cell factor and basic fibroblast growth factor was evaluated using quantitative relative messenger RNA expression. Of the 30 patients included in the study, 18 (60%) were women; mean (SD) age was 23.4 (6.4) years. Seventy-four percent of the lesions (62 of 84) were difficult-to-treat vitiligo. ECS + FCS showed superior repigmentation outcomes compared with ECS: extent (76% vs 57%, P < .001), rapidity (48% vs 31%, P = .001), color match (73% vs 61%, P < .001), and patient satisfaction (mean [SD] patient global assessment score, 23.30 [6.89] vs 20.81 [6.61], P = .047). Melanocyte stem cell counts (2% in ECS + FCS vs 0.5% in ECS) as well as expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (11.8-fold) and stem cell factor (6.0-fold) were higher in ECS + FCS suspension (P<.05 for both). The findings from this study establish ECS + FCS as a novel approach in vitiligo surgery for attaining good to excellent repigmentation in a short period with good color match, even in difficult-to-treat vitiligo. ctri.nic.in Identifier: CTRI/2017/05/008692.

259,9,9,31496971,"Research from education, psychology, and human development indicates that social and emotional skills are essential to success in school, work, and life, and that high-quality social and emotional learning (SEL) programs can benefit students' mental health, academic achievement, and behavioral outcomes. While many schools are adopting an SEL approach, there remains a concerning gap between SEL research and policies and practices related to discipline and behavior management. Following the No Child Left Behind Act and education reform driven by a culture of high-stakes standardized testing and accountability benchmarks, there has been an increase in elementary schools adopting a ""no excuses"" model of education. This model is characterized by extended time in school, highly structured in-service teacher training, frequent assessments, and ""zero tolerance"" policies to strictly manage and control children's behavior. These behavior policies are problematic as they run counter to what research tells us about children's social and emotional development. Reactive and exclusionary discipline policies inhibit children's abilities to build and practice self-regulation skills and jeopardize the relationships between students and teachers. The developmental science perspective on children's regulatory skills suggests that the early years of school are a central context for developing and practicing self-regulation with the support of educators and peers. Research also indicates that warm, caring, reciprocal relationships based on trust are critical to learning and development. Yet, this research base is often overshadowed by pressures to improve standardized achievement scores or misinterpreted in the form of hyper-vigilance about children's behavior in the classroom. Finally, the ""no excuses"" approach to behavior management is used disproportionally in schools serving low-income students of color and thus may contribute to unequal rates of suspensions and expulsions, both of which are linked to negative developmental outcomes later in life. This is particularly true for students who have experienced trauma, in part because the act of social exclusion is often re-traumatizing. This article summarizes research on self-regulation, trauma, and developmental relationships, highlights potential consequences of ""no excuses"" policies and practices in schools, and presents an alternative view of learning environments which promote effective self-regulation skills in young children.

In this article, we present a logic model for educator-level interventions that have the potential to reduce disparate discipline practices and ultimately work toward a more equitable school climate. We describe how an integrated approach to supporting all children's constitutional right to a free public education, which is prevented by exclusionary discipline practices, must purposefully integrate social and emotional learning, classroom management, cultural competence, and racial equity approaches that target educators. Together, the integration of these approaches has the potential to impact initial, intermediate, and long-term education outcomes by enhancing educators' practices and raising awareness of their internal and interpersonal biases and role in perpetuating institutional racism in education. We conclude with recommendations for how this logic model can be used to guide future research to further our knowledge in this area to support educators in their practice and inform educational policy.

Autologous noncultured epidermal cell suspension (NCES; a cellular grafting technique) and suction blister epidermal grafting (SBEG; a tissue grafting technique) are important established surgical modalities for the treatment of stable vitiligo. To compare the two techniques, NCES and SBEG, for producing repigmentation in patients with stable vitiligo. We randomized 41 patients with 54 stable vitiligo lesions into two groups. Patients in group 1 were treated with NCES, and those in group 2 with SBEG. They were evaluated 16 weeks postsurgery for the extent of repigmentation, colour match, change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score and patient satisfaction. The extent of repigmentation was excellent (showing 90-100% repigmentation) in 71% of lesions in the NCES group and 27% of lesions in the SBEG group (P = 0·002). Repigmentation ≥ 75% (good repigmentation) was observed in 89% of lesions in the NCES group and 85% of lesions in the SBEG group (P = 0·61). There was a significant decline in DLQI score in both the groups; the mean decline among groups differed significantly (P = 0·045). No significant difference was seen in colour match and pattern of repigmentation. Adverse effects were minimal.

Here, we aimed to illustrate whether RSNP and its active ingredient crocin-1 rescue depressive-like phenotypes in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) induced mouse model of depression. Our results showed that peripheral administration of RSNP or crocin-1 ameliorated the depressive-like behaviors in CUMS-treated mice, as demonstrated by the forced swimming test and tail suspension test. Furthermore, RSNP or crocin-1 treatment reduced oxidative stress in the peripheral blood and hippocampus of the CUMS-treated mice. Additionally, the dysregulated immune system response, as demonstrated by the increased expression of the pro-inflammatory factors (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6) and the decreased expression of the anti-inflammatory factor-interleukin-10 in the prefrontal cortex and/or hippocampus of CUMS-treated mice, were at least partially restored by RSNP or crocin-1 treatment. RSNP or crocin-1 also restored apoptotic protein marker (Bcl-2 and Bax) levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of the CUMS-treated mice. Moreover, our data indicated that RSNP or crocin-1 increased astrocyte number and brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in the hippocampus of CUMS-treated mice after RSNP or crocin-1 administration.

The mean aortic crossclamp and cardiopulmonary bypass time was 36 ± 9 and 57 ± 9 minutes, respectively. No early or late deaths occurred. At discharge, no patient had more than mild regurgitation with a gradient of 4.4 ± 2.4 mm Hg in the mitral position and 2 ± 1.75 mm Hg in the tricuspid position.

Controlling for school racial composition, gender, grade level and other covariates, students of color were significantly less likely to feel connected to school adults than their White peers. Additionally, the racial discipline gap was significantly and negatively associated with connectedness for all students. Results indicate that strategies to improve educational outcomes for youth of color need to attend to relational dynamics between students and school adults. Research findings also suggest that efforts to reduce discipline disparities may improve all students' connectedness.

No liquid formulation of sunitinib malate is commercially available for pediatric administration. To prepare extemporaneously an oral liquid formulation of sunitinib malate from commercially available capsules and study its chemical and physical stability in suspension at room temperature and under refrigeration at 4 degrees C. Six independent samples were prepared by mixing the contents of 3 sunitinib malate capsules (each equivalent to 50 mg of sunitinib) with 15 mL of a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Plus:Ora-Sweet solution to yield a final concentration of 10 mg/mL. Suspensions were stored in amber plastic bottles with child-resistant caps. Three samples were refrigerated at 4 degrees C and 3 were stored at room temperature. Aliquots from each bottle were obtained on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, 30, and 60 and diluted to a final concentration of 300 ng/mL with 500 ng/mL of clozapine in 50% acetonitrile. Sunitinib concentrations were then measured by a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay validated in our laboratory. At room temperature and under refrigeration at 4 degrees C, sunitinib in a 10-mg/mL suspension of sunitinib malate with Ora-Plus:Ora-Sweet 1:1 maintained greater than 96% of its initial concentration for 60 days. Visual appearance (color and consistency) and odor of drug suspension remained unchanged during the study. Sunitinib is stable in an oral suspension prepared from commercially available capsules for at least 60 days at room temperature and refrigeration at 4 degrees C.

To determine prevalent fungal species and response to standard antifungal therapy in inner-city children of color. An IRB-approved chart review of demographic, clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic data was conducted for children and young adults (0 to 18 years of age) who had scalp fungal culture performed for scalp hyperkeratosis and/or alopecia over a 2.5 year time-period. Supplemental parental phone interview was performed for missing data points. A total of 84 patients with final diagnosis of tinea capitis were identified-52% male, 60.6% African-American, 28.2% Hispanic, and 9.9% Caucasian. Complete resolution at 4 weeks was uncommon in all demographic groups (Hispanic: 11.7%, African-American: 41.3%). The Hispanic group and the youngest patients (aged less than 4 years) were less likely to respond to initial therapy, but the results were not significant. Of the 80 tinea capitis patients initially treated with griseofulvin, 41 out of 54 children (76%) had complete response to micronized suspension +/- crushed tablet (33% required shift to tablets from suspension) and 20 out of 26 (76.9%) cleared on crushed tablets alone. Of the 19 griseofulvin failures, 5 cleared on fluconazole suspension, 7 on terbinafine sprinkles, 3 on itraconazole therapy, and 4 were lost to follow-up. Of the 47 patients who could be evaluated long-term after a single course of oral griseofulvin at 6 weeks or greater, 38 had documented long-term mycological cure (80.8%) and 42 had long-term clinical cure (89%). Trichophyton tonsurans (n=40) was the most prevalent causative species identified on culture, followed by Alternaria species (n=10) and Microsporum canis (n=1).

Tinea capitis is still the most common cause of Trichophyton tonsurans in New York City.

We synthesized core-shell silica-PEG nanoparticles by a one-pot direct micelles approach. Fluorescence emission and photoacoustic and photothermal properties were obtained at the same time by appropriate doping with triethoxysilane-derivatized cyanine 5.5 (Cy5.5) and cyanine 7 (Cy7) dyes. The performances of these nanoprobes were measured in vitro, using nanoparticle suspensions in phosphate-buffered saline and blood, dedicated phantoms, and after incubation with MDA-MB-231 cells. We obtained core-shell silica-PEG nanoparticles endowed with very high colloidal stability in water and in biological environment, with absorption and fluorescence emission in the NIR field. The presence of Cy5.5 and Cy7 dyes made it possible to reach a more reproducible and higher doping regime, producing fluorescence emission at a single excitation wavelength in two different channels, owing to the energy transfer processes within the nanoparticle. The nanoarchitecture and the presence of both Cy5.5 and Cy7 dyes provided a favorable agreement between fluorescence emission and quenching, to achieve optical imaging and photoacoustic and photothermal properties. We obtained rationally designed nanoparticles with outstanding stability in biological environment. At appropriate doping regimes, the presence of Cy5.5 and Cy7 dyes allowed us to tune fluorescence emission in the NIR for optical imaging and to exploit quenching processes for photoacoustic and photothermal capabilities.

The proposed vision-guided pipeline applies a color-based skin region segmentation procedure followed by the localization of body parts before feature extraction and classification. After constrained localization of lower body parts, a stick-diagram representation is used for extracting novel features that correspond to the motion dynamic characteristics of the infant's leg movements during HINE. This set of pose features generated from such a representation includes knee angles and distances between knees and hills. Finally, a time-series representation of the feature vector is used to train a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for classifying the grades of the HINE tests into three predefined categories. Experiments are carried out by testing the proposed framework on a large number of vertical suspension test videos recorded at a Neuro-development clinic.

Le lévétiracétam est largement utilisé comme traitement d’appoint dans le traitement des crises partielles, des crises myocloniques, des crises tonico-cloniques généralisées primaires et de l’épilepsie généralisée idiopathique dans la communauté et dans les hôpitaux. Cependant, il n’existe aucune forme pharmaceutique pratique et facile à avaler au Canada. En outre, il n’y a aucune donnée disponible sur la stabilité de cet antiépileptique préparé dans un excipient combinant l’édulcorant Ora-Sweet et l’agent de suspension Ora-Plus. Évaluer la stabilité de suspensions de lévétiracétam conditionnées dans des flacons en plastique ambré et conservées à la température ambiante et au réfrigérateur pendant un maximum de 91 jours. Des suspensions de lévétiracétam (50 mg/mL) ont été préparées dans un mélange 1 : 1 d’Ora-Sweet (édulcorant) et d’Ora-Plus (agent de suspension). Les suspensions ont été transférées dans des flacons pour médicaments d’ordonnance en plastique ambré de 50 mL puis entreposées à une température de 25 °C ou de 4 °C. Des échantillons ont été prélevés de chaque flacon au temps zéro puis aux jours 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84 et 91. Les échantillons ont été analysés en triple à l’aide d’une épreuve validée par chromatographie liquide haute performance avec détection ultraviolette mesurant la stabilité. La suspension était considérée comme stable si elle conservait au moins 90 % de la concentration initiale de lévétiracétam. La compatibilité physique des suspensions de lévétiracétam a été évaluée en contrôlant tout changement dans la couleur, l’odeur, le goût, la limpidité et le pH des préparations. Aucun changement des propriétés physiques ni aucun changement significatif du pH des suspensions n’ont été observés dans le temps. L’intervalle de confiance à 95 % de la pente de la courbe de la concentration en fonction du temps, déterminée par régression linéaire, a montré que les suspensions de lévétiracétam entreposées à 25 °C conserveraient au moins 91,4 % de la concentration initiale de lévétiracétam pendant 91 jours et que les suspensions entreposées à 4 °C conserveraient au moins 93,2 % de la concentration initiale de lévétiracétam pendant 91 jours, avec un niveau de confiance de 95 %.

295,45,45,2943795,"The germinal center of lymphoid tissues is a critical microenvironmental site of B cell activation and differentiation in response to antigenic stimuli. However, characterization of germinal center cells (GCC) in tissue sections has proved technically difficult. Therefore, we have employed two-color flow cytometric analysis of suspended human tonsillar lymphocytes in order to define more precisely the immunologic features of GCC. These cells were identified in suspension by virtue of their specific surface binding of the lectin peanut agglutinin (PNA), confirmed by tissue immunoperoxidase studies. Phycoerythrin-labeled lectin was used in combination with a variety of fluorescein-labeled antibodies in order to identify subpopulations of tonsillar lymphocytes. The majority of PNA+ cells were B cells, and both PNA+ and PNA- B cells stained for surface immunoglobulin light chains. PNA+ cells lacked surface IgD, but included cells with surface IgG and IgM. Both PNA+ and PNA- cells stained for B1, B2, BA-1, Leu-12, Leu-14, CR-I, and HLA-DR antigens, whereas CALLA was present only on PNA+ cells. There were differences between PNA+ and PNA- cells in the relative expression of B1 and B2 antigens, possibly reflecting differences in B cell activation or maturation. A small proportion of T cells were PNA+, including both helper/inducer and suppressor/cytotoxic phenotypes. PNA+ cells included both small and large lymphoid cells, and almost all DNA synthetic activity was associated with the large PNA+ cells. PNA+ B cells isolated by cell sorting had morphologic features characteristic of GCC. Therefore, PNA+ cells in suspension appeared to represent GCC, and features of these cells that cannot be convincingly shown in tissue section studies were demonstrated by flow cytometry.

Oxandrolone oral suspension (1 mg/mL) was prepared using oxandrolone tablets, Ora-Plus, and either Ora-Sweet or Ora-Sweet SF. Three identical samples of each formulation were prepared and stored in 2-oz amber plastic bottles with child-resistant caps at room temperature (23-25 °C). After thorough but gentle shaking by hand to prevent foaming, a 1-mL sample was withdrawn from each of the six bottles, diluted with mobile phase to an expected concentration of 200 μg/mL, and assayed in duplicate by injecting 5 μL into the high-performance liquid chromatography system immediately after preparation and at 7, 14, 35, 60, and 90 days. The samples were examined for any change in color or pH on each day of analysis. The stability of the suspensions was determined by calculating the percentage of the initial oxandrolone concentration remaining on each test day. Stability was defined as the retention of at least 90% of the initial oxandrolone concentration. At least 98% of the original oxandrolone concentration remained in both formulations at the end of the 90-day study period. There was no appreciable change in odor, taste, color, or pH. Both suspensions remained white in color and sweet with no aftertaste throughout the study period. The oxandrolone was easily resuspended with gentle shaking.

298,48,48,23616676,"Propranolol is a drug of choice for many diseases occurring in neonates and infants, an age group for which oral suspensions are required almost exclusively. Many adult and elderly patients for whom propranolol is prescribed are also unable to swallow solid dosage forms. In Canada, propranolol is not commercially available in a liquid dosage form, and existing recipes for extemporaneously compounded suspensions of propranolol (1 mg/mL) are limited by concerns regarding diabetes mellitus in certain subpopulations, the need for a more concentrated suspension for patients taking larger doses, and the tediousness of compounding. To evaluate the stability of propranolol suspensions in a sugar-free, commercially available vehicle after storage at room temperature and under refrigeration for up to 120 days. Suspensions of propranolol (2 and 5 mg/mL) were prepared in the sugar-free vehicle (Ora-Blend SF), placed in 100-mL amber plastic prescription bottles, and stored at 25°C and 4°C. Samples were collected from each bottle once weekly for 120 days, stored frozen, and analyzed by a validated, stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography - ultraviolet detection method. A suspension was considered stable if it maintained at least 90% of its initial concentration of propranolol. Physical compatibility was evaluated in terms of colour, taste, precipitation, and pH. Propranolol suspensions 2 mg/mL and 5 mg/mL stored at 25°C maintained at least 94.7% of their initial concentration for 120 days, and suspensions stored at 4°C maintained at least 93.9% of their initial concentration for 120 days. There were no notable changes in pH, and all samples remained physically unchanged except for a slight change in colour, around day 70, of suspensions stored at room temperature.

299,49,49,28703954,"For consumers suffering with gluten intolerance, the only way to manage the condition is to avoid foods which are high in gluten. Instant gruels, processed from gluten-free corn and rice by extrusion cooking, could be used as a ready meal both for children and for adults on a gluten-free diet. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of various processing conditions on selected characteristics of corn-rice instant gruels. Corn-rice mixtures (75:25 and 50:50) were processed at 12, 14, 16 and 18% of initial moisture content, using an extruder with screw speeds of 80, 100 and 120 rpm. Bulk density, water absorption and solubility, gel formation, color and sensory characteristics were assessed, under various pro- cessing conditions and with various corn:rice ratios. The composition of the raw materials, initial moisture content and screw speed applied during processing affected the characteristics of the corn-rice extruded instant gruels. Increasing the amount of rice in the recipe from 25 to 50% resulted in decreased bulk density, water solubility, volumetric gel formation ability and b* value. Increasing the initial moisture content increased the bulk density, L*, a* and b* intensity, and gel formation index values of extrudates made with a 75:25 corn-rice recipe. Increased rpm increased extrudate solubility and water absorption, if the initial moisture content was higher than 14%. The highest scores for overall acceptability were found for milk suspensions of 75:25 and 50:50 corn-rice instant gruels processed at 12 and 14% of initial moisture content, at 120 rpm. Corn-rice instant gruels can be successfully produced by extrusion-cooking. Variable param- eters, like the initial moisture content of raw materials or screw speed during processing significantly affected the properties of the products. An understanding of the effects of processing conditions on some qualities of extruded instant gruels allows more desirable products to be created. Moreover, the various components can be used for extruded products for consumers on gluten-free diets.

300,50,50,34577643,"Stability studies performed by the pharmaceutical industry are principally designed to fulfill licensing requirements. Thus, post-dilution or post-reconstitution stability data are frequently limited to 24 h only for bacteriological reasons, regardless of the true physicochemical stability which could, in many cases, be longer. In practice, the pharmacy-based centralized preparation may require preparation in advance for administration, for example, on weekends, holidays, or in general when pharmacies may be closed. We report an innovative strategy for storing resuspended solutions of azacitidine, a well-known chemotherapic agent, for which the manufacturer lists maximum stability of 22 h. By placing the syringe with the azacitidine reconstituted suspension between two refrigerant gel packs and storing it at 4 °C, we found that the concentration of azacitidine remained above 98% of the initial concentration for 48 h, and no change in color nor the physicochemical properties of the suspension were observed throughout the study period. The physicochemical and microbiological properties were evaluated by HPLC-UV and UHPLC-HRMS analysis, FTIR spectroscopy, pH determination, visual and subvisual examination, and sterility assay. The HPLC-UV method used for evaluating the chemical stability of azacitidine was validated according to ICH. Precise control of storage temperature was obtained by a digital data logger. Our study indicates that by changing the storage procedure of azacitidine reconstituted suspension, the usage window of the drug can be significantly extended to a time frame that better copes with its use in the clinical environment.

Inactivated B. pertussis cells in suspension form were used as an antigen in the immunoassay. Pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria antigens were separately spotted onto nitrocellulose strips, and then the immunostrips were successively incubated with blood sera and a suspension of carbon nanoparticles. The immunostrips were then scanned with a flatbed scanner, and the images obtained were processed with ImageJ. One hundred fifty-five venous blood serum samples from children vaccinated with diphtheria, tetanus, and whole-cell pertussis (DTwP) vaccine were tested in comparison with a conventional ELISA and agglutination test. The total time required for analysis of 32 serum samples was less than 3 h. Comparison between the results of the dot immunoassay and the corresponding ELISA/agglutination test revealed a high level of agreement (Cohen's kappa between 0.765 and 0.813). The lower limit of quantification was 0.06 IU/ml for anti-Ttx and anti-Dtx. The intra-assay coefficients of variation were less than 15% for anti-Ttx and anti-Dtx and less than 10% for anti-pertussis. The diagnostic sensitivity of detection of the antibody protection level was 93.5% for anti-Ttx [95% confidence interval (CI) 83.5-97.9%], 92.4% for anti-Dtx (95% CI 80.9297.5%), and 90.2% for anti-pertussis (95% CI 75.9-96.8%).

304,54,54,21760836,"The association between childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and major depression disorder (MDD) gives reason to suspect that many mothers with postpartum depression (PPD) have a history of CSA. However, few studies have investigated how CSA and PPD are related. In this case study we explore how the experience of incest intertwines with the experience of postpartum depression. We focus on participant subject ""Nina,"" who has experienced both. We interviewed her three times and we analysed the interviews with Giorgi's phenomenological descriptive method to arrive at a contextualised meaning structure. Nina's intruding fantasies of men who abuse her children merge with her recollections of her own incest experiences. She may succeed in forcing these fantasies out of her consciousness, but they still alter her perceptions, thoughts, and emotions. She feels overwhelmed and succumbs to sadness, while she also is drawn towards information about CSA, which in turn feeds her fantasies. The psychodynamic concepts of repetition compulsion, transference, and projection may provide some explanation of Nina's actions, thoughts, and emotions through her past experiences. With our phenomenological stance, we aim to acknowledge Nina's descriptions of her everyday life here and now. With reference to Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, and Minkowski, we show that Nina's past is not a dated memory; rather it determines the structure of her consciousness that constitutes her past as her true present and future. Incest dominates Nina's world, and her possibilities for action are restricted by this perceived world. Any suspension of action implies anguish, and she resolves this by incest-structured action that in turn feeds and colours her expectations. Thus anxiety and depression are intertwined in the structure of this experience.

307,57,57,23149007,"Administration of medications to pediatric patients is challenging because many drugs are not commercially available in appropriate dosage formulations and/or strengths. Consequently, these drugs are prepared extemporaneously as oral liquid (OL) formulations using marketed tablets or capsules. In many cases, the stability of these extemporaneous preparations, which may affect their tolerability, has not been documented. An alternative extemporaneous solid formulation, such as a fast-dispersing tablet (FDT), may offer enhanced stability as well as dosing flexibility because it may be administered as an orodispersible tablet or as a reconstituted suspension/solution. Although FDTs are available increasingly as patient-friendly oral dosage formulations, and their simple method of manufacture can be applied to extemporaneous formulations, such applications have not been explored to date. The use of extemporaneous captopril OL formulations in hospitals in Ireland was surveyed, and the stability of the most commonly used captopril formulation (reference) was investigated and compared with that of a newly available extemporaneous FDT formulation. The survey was carried out in 120 hospitals in the Republic of Ireland. The 56-day stability of the most commonly used formulation was compared with that of a newly available extemporaneous captopril FDT preparation. The captopril content of the formulations was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Formulations were also monitored for changes in appearance, including color; odor; and pH (OLs only). The survey showed that extemporaneously prepared captopril OLs were extensively used, particularly in specialist children's hospitals. The most commonly used preparation was a xanthan gum-based oral suspension. Analysis of these OL preparations showed the OLs to have been stable up to day 7, but that the captopril concentration decreased to 72% to 84% at day 14 and to 59% to 68% at day 56; this decrease was accompanied by a pungent odor suggestive of captopril oxidation. In contrast, FDT formulations demonstrated greater stability, with 96% of captopril present at day 56. The results of this study support only a 7-day stability for the currently dispensed captopril OL in hospitals in Ireland. In contrast, a stability of at least 56 days was shown with the FDTs. The FDTs may represent an alternative and convenient oral solid extemporaneous preparation of captopril and, potentially, other extemporaneous pediatric medications.

309,59,59,10486524,"Patients suffering from neuroblastic tumors are currently being classified into prognostic subsets based on different clinical and biologic features. In this study, a triple-color flow cytometric assay and a functional test were applied to neuroblastoma cell lines and patients with a neuroblastic tumor, and the value of P-glycoprotein expression and function as potential prognostic characteristics, was determined. Twenty-two single-cell suspensions prepared from tumors, and neuroblasts from four bone marrow samples were analyzed by triple-color flow cytometry. Neuroblasts were identified by NB84-positivity and absence of CD45. P-glycoprotein expression was evaluated using 4E3 and MRK16 antibodies. Eighteen samples were tested with a functional assay, based on accumulation and retention of rhodamine-123 with and without the inhibitor verapamil. Six neuroblastoma cell lines were also evaluated. P-glycoprotein expression was seen in 18 of 26 patient samples and in three of six cell lines. The highest expression levels were found in low stage neuroblastoma and well-differentiated tumors; whereas the highest activities were found in stage 4 neuroblastoma and the lowest in ganglioneuroblastoma and ganglioneuroma patients. In 10 of 17 samples, concordant results were found between the flow cytometric immunological test and immunocytochemistry. The described flow cytometric technique is a new, alternative approach to detect P-glycoprotein expression and function in neural crest tumors. Based on the expression level and the activity value, patients can be segregated into different phenotypic groups. In particular, those patients with high P-glycoprotein activity might benefit from treatment regimens containing reversal agents.

To evaluate the stability of dexamethasone suspensions in commercially available vehicles (Oral Mix and Oral Mix SF) in various types of containers after storage at 25°C and 4°C for up to 91 days. Dexamethasone suspensions (1 mg/mL) were prepared in Oral Mix and Oral Mix SF and then transferred to amber glass and plastic prescription bottles and plastic oral syringes. Suspensions in all 3 types of containers were stored at 25°C; suspensions in glass and plastic bottles were also stored at 4°C. Samples were collected weekly from each container up to 28 days and then every 2 weeks up to 91 days. The samples were analyzed by a validated, stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography - ultraviolet detection method. A suspension was considered stable if it maintained at least 90% of its initial dexamethasone concentration. Changes in colour, taste, odour, precipitation (and ease of resuspension), and pH were used to assess physical compatibility. All suspensions maintained at least 96% of the original concentration for up to 91 days with storage at 25°C or at 4°C. No notable changes in colour, taste, odour, precipitation, or pH were observed over the 91-day period. Dexamethasone suspensions (1 mg/mL) in Oral Mix and Oral Mix SF, stored in amber glass or plastic bottles or plastic syringes at 25°C or in amber glass or plastic bottles at 4°C can be expected to remain stable for up to 91 days.

312,62,62,15363498,"There is a great need for oral anti-malaria preparations especially for small children, which are easy to administer and keep their stability under tropical conditions. The purpose of this work was therefore to develop a dry suspension, containing one of the artemisinin derivatives, namely artesunate, artemether and dihydroartemisinin using fast wetting suspending agents, i.e. xanthan gum and Avicel CL611. For the optimisation of these two variables, namely the suspending agent's content, a Doehlert design was applied. Via preliminary tests on sedimentation behaviour, the limits of both products were determined, respectively 0.1-0.4% (w/v) and 1.0-2.5% (w/v). As responses, sedimentation as a function of time, viscosity and price of the suspension, were evaluated. The stability tests of the reconstituted suspensions showed bad results for artesunate, even when the pH was adapted. In contrast, dihydroartemisinin showed only 10% degradation within 10 days and artemether was stable at least 21 days. Practically the last one was able to foresee a chemically and physically stable suspension at least during the administration period (5 to 7 days) and was therefore selected for further optimisation concerning taste and appearance. Based on the results of selection tests for the colourant, sweetener and taste masking agent, the following composition was proposed for a suitable dry powder with artemether (AM) as active compound to prepare 100 ml reconstituted suspension: AM 300 mg, Avicel CL611 2 g, xanthan gum 200 mg, crystalline saccharose 35 g, citric acid monohydrate 150 mg, Nipagine 80 mg, Nipasol 20 mg, sodium saccharinate 250 mg, tutti-frutti 250 mg and Sunset yellow 10 mg.

313,63,63,9063785,"The management of pain and anxiety in pediatric patients with burns includes the challenge of striking a balance between inadequate versus excessive medication. Ketamine provides effective sedative, analgesic, and amnestic properties for children and has been used intravenously with good results. With its recent availability as an elixir, we speculated that ketamine given orally may provide effective analgesia and sedation during wound care procedures with a wide safety margin. To test this hypothesis, 19 pediatric patients with burns undergoing a wound care procedure were randomized to receive either ketamine oral suspension or 300 mg acetaminophen with codeine phosphate and diphenhydramine, our prior standard for analgesia and sedation. Intensity of pain was determined with use of a color slide algometer and demonstrated more than 400% reduction in pain with the use of ketamine (p < 0.05). The Ramsey scale was used to quantitate sedation and demonstrated that ketamine improved sedation by 360% (p < 0.05). These results substantiate improved analgesia and sedation with oral ketamine as compared to a commonly used narcotic and sedative in facilitating wound care procedures in pediatric patients with burns.

314,64,64,33022335,"Wound infection in burn patients is common and has an impact on outcomes. There is no objective method to diagnose infection at point of care (PoC). Early diagnosis prevents progression to sepsis. Diagnostic subjectivity supports over-diagnosis, unnecessary hospitalization, and antibiotic overuse. This pilot study aimed to investigate the accuracy of a novel PoC wound infection diagnostic in burn patients. We produced, and in vitro tested, a PoC diagnostic for early wound infection diagnosis. The prototype SPaCE diagnostic uses a patented lipid vesicle suspension into which a clinical swab is placed. The diagnostic delivers a colour-response to Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida species and Enterococcus faecalis at toxin release. A pilot clinical diagnostic accuracy study was undertaken. The reference standard was a retrospective decision made by an expert clinical panel using routinely available data. Data was available from 33 of 34 patients. Of these, 52% were considered to have a wound infection, 42% not, and two (6%) were equivocal. The diagnostic results showed 24% were infected, 42% were not and 33% produced intermediate results. Agreement between clinical judgement and diagnostic result, assessed using a weighted Kappa, was 0.591 suggesting moderate agreement. If the intermediate results were excluded, 22 sets of data with definitive results achieved a Kappa statistic of 0.81 suggesting 'almost perfect' agreement. Sensitivity and specificity were 57% (8/14) and 71% (12/17), respectively.

We reported that nevus specimens were inactivated after HHP at 200 MPa and that the inactivated nevus could be used as autologous dermis for covering skin defects. In this study, we verified the inactivation of nevus specimens using a newly developed portable HHP device which will be used in a clinical trial. Nevus tissue specimens were obtained from 5 patients (mean age 7.2 years, range 1-19). We cultured fibroblasts and nevus cells from the tissue specimens and then evaluated their inactivation after HHP at 200 MPa by confirming the attachment of the suspensions and by the live/dead staining of the suspensions, through the dissociation of the cells on chamber slides and by the live/dead staining of the remaining cells. The cells were also quantitatively evaluated by WST-8 assay. We then confirmed the inactivation of the nevus specimens after HHP using explant culture. Our results indicated that fibroblasts and nevus cells were inactivated after HHP at 200 MPa, with the exception of a small percentage of green-colored cells, which reflected the remaining activity of the cellular esterases after HHP. No cells migrated from the nevus specimens after HHP at 200 MPa. We verified the inactivation of fibroblasts and nevus cells cultured from nevus specimens, and in the nevus samples themselves after pressurization at 200 MPa using this device.

This drug is available only as tablets, which can be divided only so many times before the dose obtained becomes inaccurate. In addition, children may have difficulty swallowing tablets. For these reasons, a compounding formula for a liquid dosage form is essential to ensure effective delivery of the drug to pediatric patients. To develop a compounding formula for diclofenac sodium and to determine the extended physical and chemical stability of this compound when stored in amber polyvinyl chloride (PVC) prescription bottles under refrigeration and at room temperature. A suspension of diclofenac sodium (10 mg/mL) was prepared from commercially available diclofenac sodium tablets, with Ora-Blend as the suspending and flavouring agent. The suspension was packaged in 60-mL amber PVC prescription bottles and stored at either room temperature (23°C) or under refrigeration (5°C). Samples were collected on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 27, 56, and 93. Chemical stability was determined using a validated stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography method. At each sampling time, the suspensions were checked for changes in appearance (i.e., colour, layering, caking, ease of resuspension), odour, and pH. The diclofenac sodium suspensions were very stable, retaining at least 99.5% of the original concentration for up to 93 days, regardless of storage temperature. There were no apparent changes in the physical appearance of the suspensions, nor were there any substantial changes in odour or pH. Suspensions of diclofenac sodium (10 mg/mL) were quantitatively stable but difficult to prepare because of the enteric coating of the tablets. Therefore, it is recommended that diclofenac powder be used for the preparation of suspensions. For pediatric use, palatability is a consideration, and a masking agent should be added before administration. An expiry date of up to 93 days is suggested.

319,69,69,19208060,"The aims of this study were to develop and evaluate a shorter gestational age estimation method based on the Dubowitz scoring system (DSS) that could be taught easily to untrained health-care workers. Using the DSS, seven criteria were identified that explained 90% of the variance in gestational age estimation. Ventral suspension was excluded, skin texture was substituted for skin colour and ear bending was for ear firmness. The final six criteria comprise the short DSS (SDSS). The study population was 100 babies, 51 Caucasian, 34 Aboriginal. Birth weight ranged from 1351 to 5430 g. The gestational age range was 29.6-41.7 weeks. Three researchers (medical student 1 (MS1), medical student 2 (MS2) and a paediatrician) who were blind to other available gestational age estimations assessed babies within 72 h of birth using the DSS and SDSS. MS1 found the 95% limits of agreement (LOA) between SDSS and DSS to be -1.1 to 1.7 weeks. In the 27 babies who had first trimester foetal ultrasound (USS), the LOA between USS and SDSS were -1.9 to 1.4 weeks and -2.3 to 1.9 weeks, respectively. Using the SDSS, the LOA for the three researchers were within +/-2 weeks. The data presented suggest that the SDSS is approximately equivalent to the DSS in the relatively limited population studied, and within these limitations appears to be a simple alternative to the DSS. Further evaluation is needed before firm conclusions about the accuracy and clinical utility of the SDSS can be made.

321,71,71,9298839,"Twenty-two fresh surgical specimens of human sarcomas (soft tissue and bone) from 20 patients were analyzed by flow cytometry for the expression of drug resistance-related P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and cellular daunorubicin (DNR) accumulation with or without the presence of DNR efflux blockers. Single-cell suspensions prepared from the tumor specimens were analyzed by dual-color flow cytometry after reaction with MRK-16 (anti-P-gp) and anti-CD45 (pan-leukocyte) antibodies. MRK-16 reactivity of tumor cells was evaluated after exclusion of CD45-positive cells by electronic gates. Parallel samples were incubated with DNR alone or in combination with DNR efflux blockers, verapamil (VPL), or dipyridamole (DPD) for determination of cellular DNR accumulation and the effect of the efflux blockers. Extensive heterogeneity was observed in both P-gp expression and DNR accumulation of the tumor specimens examined. Eight of the 22 tumor specimens had significant numbers of P-gp-positive cells. In three of the eight P-gp-positive tumors, cellular DNR accumulation was significantly increased by co-incubation with the efflux blockers VPL or DPD. These results indicate that both quantitative and functional analysis of P-gp expression may be essential in determining the cellular drug resistance phenotype of tumor cells and its correlation with therapeutic outcome.

322,72,72,7873389,"Diagnosis of platelet dense granule storage pool disease and release defects at present requires a combination of studies including lumiaggregometry, conventional platelet aggregation, radioactive serotonin uptake and release, and electron microscopy. Flow cytometric methods have been developed to study platelet activation, aggregation, and alpha-granule protein release. Here, we have investigated the use of flow cytometry for analysis of platelet dense granule content uptake and release using mepacrine as a fluorescent marker. Mepacrine (quinacrine) is rapidly taken up and localized in dense granules of platelets. For the assay, as little as 20 microliters of blood from a fingerstick collected without anticoagulant or venous blood collected in 3.8% sodium citrate were diluted 1:40 with 2 ml Hanks balanced salt solution (BSS). 300 microliters of this cell suspension were incubated with mepacrine alone, or simultaneously with a mouse monoclonal antibody to human platelet glycoprotein IIb (Tab), used as a platelet-specific marker. The bound monoclonal antibody was then indirectly labelled with the fluorochrome, RED670. 100 microliters of the sample were further diluted with Hanks BSS for one- or two-colour flow cytometric analysis. To verify that mepacrine uptake was related to platelet dense granule content, platelets of beige mice, a strain with dense granule deficiency, were examined. Their mepacrine uptake was substantially decreased compared to that of normal mice. Decreased mepacrine uptake also was demonstrated in platelets of a patient with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome in which a deficiency of platelet dense granules is characteristic. In both human and mouse platelets, mepacrine uptake was proportional to platelet size. Thrombin induced mepacrine release in a dose-dependent manner from 0.003 to 0.4 U/ml. Therefore both platelet uptake and release of mepacrine can be readily detected by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry provides an attractive alternative to aggregation and radioactive serotonin as methods to study defects in platelet dense granule function.

323,73,73,12187247,"Contrast medium enhanced harmonic ultrasound is a recently developed ultrasound technique that improves the assessment of renal parenchymal vascularity. We performed a preliminary study to define the ability of contrast enhanced ultrasound with harmonic imaging to detect and localize renal scars in a porcine model of experimentally induced pyelonephritis. Vesicoureteral reflux was surgically induced in 10 pigs weighing 10 kg. with the contralateral kidney serving as a control. Approximately 4 weeks after the creation of vesicoureteral reflux cystography confirmed reflux. Infection was induced by placing a suspension of paraffin broth impregnated with Escherichia coli in the bladder of each pig. At 4 to 8 weeks (mean 6.5) after the induction of infection a radiologist blinded to the side of the previous procedure performed conventional gray scale ultrasound, color Doppler ultrasound and contrast enhanced ultrasound with harmonic power imaging. The animals were sacrificed; the kidneys were inspected and tissues from the upper, mid and lower poles were sent for culture and histological examination. Histology results were compared with the findings of the 3 ultrasound modalities. All 10 pigs survived the surgical procedures with no complications. Post-contrast harmonic ultrasound images were available in 9 pigs (18 renal units). Harmonic ultrasound revealed decreased blood flow in 11 renal units, including the upper pole in 7, lower pole in 3, and upper and lower poles in 2. Renal tissue cultures were positive in 11 renal units (6 refluxing units). Histological findings revealed fibrosis in 10 renal units (8 refluxing units). Harmonic ultrasound findings in these 10 renal units showed 9 with changes consistent with inflammation or scars. Using histological results as the gold standard for renal injury harmonic ultrasound was more sensitive than gray scale ultrasound for detecting renal injury with 90% sensitivity, 75% specificity, 81% positive predictive value and 85% negative predictive value. Preliminary results indicate that contrast enhanced ultrasound with harmonic imaging is a sensitive method for determining renal scarring without the need for radiation exposure.

324,74,74,11122020,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a clinically characteristic, chronic inflammatory skin disease of unknown origin. IgE-mediated uptake and antigen focusing of environmental allergens by dendritic cells (DCs) is assumed to be a central immunopathogenetic event. A so-called intrinsic type of AD (IAD) has been delineated from the more common extrinsic AD (EAD) by normal serum IgE levels, negative RAST tests and negative immediate-type skin reactions towards environmental allergens. The recently characterized human autoantigen Hom S 1 has been proposed to play a part in the pathogenesis of IAD. To compare clinical and laboratory data between patients with IAD and EAD, and to investigate potential differences in the inflammatory micromilieu of the epidermal compartment in IAD and EAD lesions. Epidermal DC phenotyping, a recently validated technique based on the three-colour flow cytometric analysis of Langerhans cells and the so-called inflammatory dendritic epidermal cells from epidermal single-cell suspensions, was performed on samples from 69 patients with AD (seven with IAD and 62 with EAD) and 94 controls. Patients with EAD tended to have an earlier onset of disease but similar disease duration and family history of atopic diseases. Quantitative analysis of CD36 expression on DCs as a marker of inflammation, as well as the percentage of inflammatory dendritic epidermal cells in the CD1a+ epidermal DC pool, indicated a comparable disease activity in IAD and EAD. EAD was characterized by a significantly higher FcepsilonRI expression on the CD1a+ epidermal DCs than IAD. Using the FcepsilonRI/FcgammaRII expression ratio as a disease marker for AD, values for IAD fell below the diagnostic cut-off level of 1.5 for this ratio. While IAD is clinically similar to EAD, the inflammatory microenvironment in this condition seems different from classical EAD and can be distinguished by phenotyping of epidermal DCs.

325,75,75,16813711,"Apoptosis, one of the forms of programmed cell death, is a physiologic process of cell death that is central to normal development and occurs in response to a variety of physiologic and pathophysiologic stimuli. In the thyroid, abnormal apoptotic activity may be involved in a variety of diseases such as Hashimoto thyroiditis and Graves disease. The aim of this study was to estimate the expression of chosen apoptotic molecules CD95 (Fas) and CD95L (FasL) on the surface of thyroid follicular cells in application of mouse monoclonal antibodies #64 which recognized B antigen regions of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and infiltrating inflammatory cells. The investigation was performed on thyroid cells isolated from surgically treated thyroid tissues of 15 patients with Graves' disease (GD), 15 patients with a nontoxic multinodular goiter (NTMG) and 15 aspirates obtained by FNAB from patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT). The thyrocytes were identified by an indirect method: in the first stage we added mouse monoclonal autoantibodies specific for TPO (mAb #64) regions and in the second stage we conjugated this complex with rabbit anti-mouse antibodies IgG (Fab')2 with FITC. In the next step the cellular suspension was completed with suitably well-chosen two-colour monoclonal antibodies marked (PE or PerCP) (Becton Dickinson) directed against suitable apoptotic (Fas/FasL) molecules. All investigations were performed by flow cytometry using Coulter EPICS XL apparatus. The percentages of thyroid cells were estimated with expression of region B antigenic TPO in reference to individual apoptotic molecules. The analysis of Fas and FasL expression in thyroid tissues revealed significantly increased percentage of intrathyroidal T cells with CD95+ (p<0.005, p<0.001), CD95L+ (p<0.02, p<0.01) and both CD95/CD95L (ns, p<0.05) expression in comparison to percentages of T cells in patients with HT and NTMG. In addition, on the surface of thyroid follicular cells in patients with GD (p<0.01, p<0.01) and NTMG (p<0.001, p<0.004) we observed a lower percentage of thyrocytes with CD95 and CD95L molecules than in cases with HT. The expression of both apoptotic molecules on thyroid cells was higher (18%) in patients with HT in comparison to the percentages of positive cells in patients with GD (p<0.02, p<0.002) and NTMG, 8% and 1%, respectively. We conclude that alterations in the expression of death receptors and their ligands on the surface of thyroid follicular cells may play a role in the regulation of apoptosis in thyroid autoimmune disorders.

FISH, using dual-color extra-signal (ES) DNA probe specific for the TEL and AML1 genes, was performed either on blast cells suspensions stored in liquid nitrogen immediately after Ficoll or on leukemic cells preserved in fixative solution at -20 degrees C after short-term culture. No TEL-AML1 fusion was observed in the 26 ALL adults. The fusion was found among 19.6% of the 57 ALL children, additional changes being identified by conventional cytogenetics in 80% of the cases.

However, when the usual color-producing substrates are employed, relatively large amounts of substrate must be hydrolyzed by the bound enzyme before detection can be achieved. We attempted to improve the sensitivity of ELISA by utilizing a substrate that yields a fluorescent product on enzyme action. The enzyme-linked fluorescence assay (ELFA) based on this principle was approximately 100 times more sensitive than the corresponding ELISA or radioimmunoassay for the detection of human rotavirus in a standard stool suspension. In addition, the ELFA for human rotavirus was capable of detecting antigen in six specimens that were negative by ELISA. Five of these specimens were obtained late in the course of confirmed rotavirus infections. ELFA provides a simple, reliable, ultrasensitive method for the rapid detection of viral antigen.

331,81,81,11699206,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of childhood has been cytogenetically well characterized, and approximately 25% of cases will have a high-hyperdiploid (51-68) chromosome complement. In a 5 year period a consecutive series of 152 presentation ALL's were karyotyped. In all cases a result was obtained and 138 (91%) had a detectable abnormal clone of which 44 (29%) were high-hyperdiploid. Within the high-hyperdiploidy group karyotypic cell to cell variation was observed in many cases. To provide further evidence of this phenomenon a dual-color fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) experiment was performed on stored fixed suspension from 14 ALL's with such a karyotype. In each case 4-6 probes were investigated, employing probes to centromeres of chromosomes X, 4, 6, 8, and 10 and a locus specific probe to chromosome 21q22. It was found that the FISH produced results that were generally in good agreement with the G-banding findings and supported the notion of karyotypic cell to cell variation. FISH further showed that most of cases would have two extra copies of chromosome 21 in the majority of leukemic cells and a single extra copy in the minority. A further finding was that fewer cells contained extra copies of chromosomes 6, 8 and 10 than was expected based on the comparison of the signal number of the other probes investigated. In contrast chromosomes X, 4, and 21 seldom displayed this feature. We have demonstrated that karyotypic instability as defined by karyotypic cell to cell variation is a feature of the high-hyperdiploid subgroup in childhood ALL. It is questioned whether the underlying defect resulting in the observed karyotypic instability of this subgroup is one of the primary causative events in the formation of the leukemia.

333,83,83,9162192,"Childhood endodermal sinus tumors (CESTs) are a unique category of germ cell tumors involving the testis and extragonadal region in children less than 4 years of age. Recent studies of CEST have shown recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities involving the short arm of chromosome 1, most commonly, a deletion of distal 1p. Experience with neuroblastomas has shown that cytogenetic analyses may underestimate the frequency of 1p deletion. To determine the frequency of deletion of Ip in CEST and to verify that 1p is, in fact, deleted and not translocated, we analyzed ten tumors by two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization on single-cell suspensions of interphase nuclei by using a cosmid probe from the PITSLRE kinase (p58) locus (previously mapped to 1p36) cohybridized with plasmid probe pUC1.77 (which recognizes the 1q heterochromatic region) to determine the copy number of chromosome 1. Eight of the ten tumors examined showed evidence of deletion of 1p36. Five of the eight tumors exhibited multiple subdones, and all subdones showed deletion of at least one copy of 1p36, indicating that the deletion probably occurred before the development of chromosome 1 aneusomy. We conclude that deletions of the short arm of chromosome 1, specifically 1p36, do occur in CEST and probably occur at a, higher incidence than that found in neuroblastoma Further studies are needed to determine the degree of overlap of the common area of deletion in CEST with that of neuroblastoma and to determine whether 1p deletion in CEST has prognostic significance.

The median concentration of Evans blue (colorant) in the middle ear was <15.6 mg/mL (lower limit of quantification) when diffusion was impossible but 45.3 µg/mL when diffusion was possible (P = .01).

MR-87 cells grew in single cell suspensions with a doubling time of 120 to 144 hours. Both MR-87 and original leukemia cells were positive for myeloperoxidase (MPO) and myeloid antigen CD13. These cells exhibited the early B-cell phenotype, ie, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase+, Ia+, CD19+, and CD10+. Rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain was confirmed in both. Approximately 80% of MR-87 cells coexpressed CD13 and lymphoid antigens CD10 or CD19, as confirmed by a two-color analysis. Simultaneous expression of MPO and CD19 on a single MR-87 cell was demonstrated at ultrastructural level. Thus, MR-87 is a Ph+ leukemia cell line exhibiting a hybrid phenotype. The breakpoint cluster region (bcr) was not rearranged in the MR-87 cells and subsequent analysis using antisera revealed that these cells expressed a novel protein, P190c-abl, which was immunoprecipitated with anti-abl and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies.

Since 1989, we have indicated treatment with anticholinergic agents to 16 patients: 9 patients had neurogenic bladder secondary to: myelomeningocele (n=7) and sacrocoxigeal teratoma (n=2). Others 7 patients had non neurogenic bladder secondary to: posterior urethral valvulas (n=1), valvula-like syndrome (n=4), post-surgery of neonatal giant bladder diverticulum (n=1) and Prune-Belly syndrome (n=1). The urodinamic study was performed during the first six months of life, being ""high risk bladder"" defined according to the parameters of compliance vesical and pressure of leak at point (PER). Five of the patients showed neonatal cronic renal failure (CRF), who were treated by cutaneus temporary derivation.

During the treatment with anticholinergic agents, the cardiac frequency was controlled by EKG registration in 6 patients, being the rest of the children clinicaly controled (skin colour, mouth dryness, cardiac frequency and intestinal function). In all the cases, the minimum duration of the treatment was one year, until the functional stabilization of the urinary tract. It is to underline the absence of secondary complications which would have caused the suspension or the reduction of the treatment at long term. Conventional studies of urologicals image and urodinamic studies, showed the stabilization of the urinary tract and also the preservation of kidney function and not only was demonstrated in those patients with oral anticholinergic agent as their unique treatment, but also in those patients who had previously been derivated. The previous vesical stabilization allowed the optimum result of subsequent corrective surgeries in five patients (ureteroneocystostomy and vesiscotomy clousure. In cases with previous derivation, the treatment with oral anticholinergic agents made easier vesicostomic clousure in the forth quarter of the first year old wih the maintenance of the vesical stability. The use of oral anticholinergic agents at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day, has resulted to be safe as well as effective in the treatment of high risk bladder in infancy those with less than one year of life. In those patients with serious dysplasia by reflux, it contributes to the preservation of kidney function, it makes easier the early desderivation and it also stabilizes in a functional way the bladder as a previous step to subsequent reconstructive surgeries.

343,2,2,36471989,"There are many kinds of pharmaceutical preparations for children in China, which are generally divided into oral solid preparations and oral liquid preparations. Solid preparations, such as microtablets, pellets, dispersible tablets, and fine granules, have become the development trend of pediatric drugs. Liquid preparations mainly include syrup, suspension, oral solution, and drops. The poor taste and the treatment of drugs in children of different ages are the key factors affecting the efficacy, safety, and compliance of pediatric drugs. To reduce the risk caused by the fluctuation of blood concentration and improve the oral compliance of pediatric drugs, it is urgent to develop new techniques for granulation and flavor maskingto improve the poor taste of solid preparations. For liquid pre-parations with poor taste, the flavor correction technique should be used. This paper summarized the new pharmaceutical techniques for granulation and flavor masking, and it was found that sustained/controlled-releasegranules, fine granules, and chewing solid mini-tablets became the mainstream of oral solid preparations for children. Generally, multiparticle preparation, coating, microencapsulation, and other granulating techniques were involved in these preparations. Granulation and flavor masking are closely related and synergetic. Flavor masking techniques mask the bitter taste of Chinese medicine from four aspects, including confusing the brain taste, changing the compounds, reducing the exposure of bitter molecules to bitter receptors in the mouth, and numbing the taste cells to increase the threshold of bitter perception. At present, the main drugs for children on the market mainly inhibit the oral release of bitter drugs.

Amiodarone hydrochloride is an antiarrhythmic drug used to treat supraventricular tachycardia. However, there are currently no commercial pediatric forms available to treat young patients. Various oral formulations were previously reported in the literature, but the concentration was lower than the doses prescribed in clinical practice (a loading dose of 500 mg/m2/day for 7-10 days followed by a maintenance dose of 250 mg/m2/day). The objective of this study was to develop an oral liquid formulation of amiodarone hydrochloride at an optimal concentration for use in children and to evaluate its physicochemical and microbiological stability. No commercial suspension vehicle was used, allowing the choice of excipients. Compounding was performed using hydroxypropylmethylcellulose as thickener, potassium sorbate preservative, citric acid/sodium citrate buffer, sodium saccharin as a , and a strawberry flavoring agent. A concentration of 40 mg/mL was selected based on a 5-year compilation of prescribed doses. Analyses performed were the following: visual and microscopic inspection, testing for antimicrobial preservation, osmolality and pH measurements, quantification of amiodarone hydrochloride by a stability-indicating liquid chromatography method, and a microbiological count. At least 95% of the initial amiodarone hydrochloride remained stable during the 60-day study period under refrigeration. All other tested parameters remained stable at 5 °C. A targeted log reduction of the microorganism inoculum by day 14 and no microbial growth by day 28 were demonstrated in the test for antimicrobial preservation. The stability of 40 mg/mL amiodarone hydrochloride oral suspension was maintained under refrigeration for 60 days before opening bottles and for 1 month after opening bottles.

351,10,10,39245358,"This publication is the first to report current, global, pediatric oral extemporaneous compounding practices. Complete survey responses were received from 479 participants actively involved in compounding across all the World Health Organization (WHO) regions. The survey addressed oral formulation of extemporaneous liquids, including the use of commercial or in-house vehicles, flavoring excipients, source of formulation recipes, and beyond use dates (BUDs). Over 90% of the survey participants prepared oral liquids. Solid dosage forms, comprising capsules and powder papers (sachets), were also frequently prepared for children, albeit to a lesser extent. The top 20 active pharmaceutical ingredients compounded for children, globally, were: omeprazole, captopril, spironolactone, propranolol, furosemide, phenobarbital, hydrochlorothiazide, ursodeoxycholic acid, sildenafil, melatonin, clonidine, enalapril, dexamethasone, baclofen, caffeine, chloral hydrate, trimethoprim, atenolol, hydrocortisone, carvedilol and prednisolone. Diuretics, drugs for acid-related disorders, and beta-blockers were the top three most frequently compounded classes per the WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. The principal need identified for the practice of extemporaneous compounding for children was the development of an international, open-access formulary that includes validated formulations, as well as updated compounding literature and guidelines. Furthermore, improved access to data from stability studies to allow compounding of formulations with extended BUDs.

352,11,11,23979771,"Amiodarone is commercially available as both a tablet and an injectable formulation. It is widely dispensed as an extemporaneously compounded suspension for pediatric and geriatric patients. Extensive stability data at numerous temperatures and a calculated shelf life based on kinetics for such a formulation have not been reported. Refrigeration and room temperature data for finite times have been reported in the literature. In this study, a stable extemporaneous formulation of amiodarone hydrochloride was formulated using Paceron tablets. The formulation consisted of 0.75% carboxymethylcellulose and 0.75% Veegum as suspending agents; 25% sucrose, provided as simple syrup; and aqueous strawberry concentrate as flavor. A total of 2.5L of the formulation was compounded and stored in quanitites of 150 mL in 8-oz glass containers. The initial drug content was determined by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, with a method that was developed in our laboratory. The stability study was carried out by storing three containers at five different temperatures, namely 4, 30, 40, 50, and 60 deg C. The suspension was analyzed at the end of 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours at 7 days, and, therafter, at the end of every week for 13 weeks. The percentage of drug remaining was plotted against time for each temperature. The slope of the regression line was obtained for each temperature and the zero-order degradation rate constant obtained. The logarithm of the zero-order degradation rate constants was plotted against the inverse of the temperature in degrees Kelvin to obtain the Arrhenius plot. From the regression line for the Arrhenius plot, the zero-order degradation constant at 25 deg C was calculated to be 0.0517 day -1. The shelf life for the formulation at 25 deg C was calculated to be 193.4 days; the shelf life under refrigeration (4 deg C) was found to be 677.3 days. The degradation products were characterized using high-performance liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometry. Data obtained from the analysis suggested that amiodarone cleaved at its ketone and ether linkages to yield corresponding degradation products.

355,14,14,28987500,"Pharmaceutical cocrystals have garnered significant interest as potential solids to address issues associated with formulation development of drug substances. However, studies concerning the understanding of formulation behavior of cocrystals are still at the nascent stage. We present results of our attempts to evaluate suspension formulations of cocrystals of an antiasthmatic drug, theophylline, with 2 artificial sweeteners. Stability, solubility, drug release, and taste of the suspension formulations were evaluated. Suspension that contained cocrystal with acesulfame showed higher drug release rate, while a cocrystal with saccharin showed a significant reduction in drug release rate. The cocrystal with saccharin was found stable in suspension for over 9 weeks at accelerated test condition; in contrast, the cocrystal with acesulfame was found unstable. Taste analysis using an electronic taste-sensing system revealed improved sweetness of the suspension formulations with cocrystals. Theophylline has a narrow therapeutic index with a short half-life which necessitates frequent dosing. This adversely impacts patient compliance and enhances risk of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular adverse effects. The greater thermodynamic stability, sweetness, and sustained drug release of the suspension formulation of theophylline-saccharin could offer an alternative solution to the short half-life of theophylline and make it a promising formulation for treating asthmatic pediatric and geriatric patients.

364,23,23,14725575,"The management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) continues to garner vast amounts of attention among physicians who care for adults. However, there is an increasing awareness of the fact that this disease, as well as several other lifelong digestive diseases (i.e. Crohn's disease) may actually have their origins in childhood. Paediatric gastro-oesophageal reflux (GER) is likely to share a similar pathophysiology to adult GER, and mounting evidence from published preliminary data suggests a genetic susceptibility to GERD. However, further studies will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis. In children, GER has a distinct presentation from that in adults, with the diagnostic work-up based upon the patient's age as well as their presenting signs and symptoms. Like their adult counterparts, the early detection and treatment of GER in children may result in a better long-term outcome, improved quality-of-life, and a reduction in overall healthcare burden. While the treatment of GER in infants tends to be conservative (i.e. positioning during feeding, smaller feedings), its management in older children parallels that of adults and includes lifestyle changes and pharmacological therapy. However, with persistent symptoms, acid suppression is the mainstay of GERD management in both children and adults. Several studies in children have verified that acid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor is superior to histamine-2 receptor antagonists. Among the proton pump inhibitors, both lansoprazole and omeprazole have been the subject of published adult and paediatric studies demonstrating their short and long-term safety, in addition to their efficacy in a variety of oesophageal and supra-oesophageal GERD related conditions. These two proton pump inhibitors are manufactured as capsules containing enteric-coated granules that can be emptied into soft foods or liquids without compromising their pharmacological effects or pharmacokinetic properties. Lansoprazole is also available as a strawberry-flavoured suspension that is acceptable to children and as an oral disintegrating tablet.

Materials and Methods In this noninferiority study, 66 pediatric patients undergoing clinical computed tomographic (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) enterography were randomized to receive either a flavored beverage for neutral abdominal and pelvic imaging (Breeza; Beekley Medical, Bristol, Conn) or a low-density barium sulfate suspension. Patients were blinded to the oral contrast material administered and were asked to rate taste, texture, and their perceived health state (where 0 was very bad and 10 was very good). Ingested volume of the prescribed weight-based oral contrast material preparation was recorded. Maximum small bowel diameter was measured in all four abdominal quadrants. Mean bowel diameter as well as taste, texture, and health state scores were compared between cohorts by using t tests; proportions were compared by using Fisher exact tests. Results Thirty-three patients each received Breeza and barium sulfate suspension, respectively. No difference was found in age (Breeza, 13.5 years ± 2.6 [standard deviation]; barium sulfate suspension, 13.9 years ± 2.8; P = .49), sex distribution (15 girls each; P > .99), or health state (P = .21) between cohorts. Twenty-eight of 33 (84.8%) and 17 of 33 (51.5%) patients completed the Breeza and barium sulfate suspension preparations, respectively (P = .007). Breeza received higher scores for taste (6.1 ± 2.5 vs 2.7 ± 2.5; P < .0001) and texture (7.3 ± 2.3 vs 3.6 ± 2.9; P < .0001).

After development of a clinical protocol for suspension of the powdered microbiota, the new formulation was tested in three elderly patients with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections and who have difficulties in swallowing capsules. Changes in the microbial community structure in one of the patients were characterized using 16S rRNA gene profiling and engraftment analysis. The processing steps used to produce an organoleptically acceptable suspension of powdered fecal microbiota did not result in loss of its viability. The powder could be easily suspended in a liquid carrier. The use of the new formulation was associated with abrogation of the cycle of C. difficile infection recurrences in the three patients.

The following five drinking protocols were administered to 10 volunteers: 1000 mL of flavored beverage followed by 350 mL of water, 1500 mL of flavored beverage, 900 mL of low-Hounsfield-value barium suspension followed by 450 mL of water, 1350 mL of low-Hounsfield-value barium suspension followed by 150 mL of water, and 1500 mL of water. MR images were obtained 50 and 60 minutes after initiation of drinking. Subjects completed a questionnaire evaluating the side effects, the taste of the drink, and their willingness to repeat the drinking protocol. Reviewers assigned scores evaluating small-bowel distention and ranked the examinations in order of preference. There was no significant difference in nausea or vomiting among the protocols (p = 0.20 and 0.42, respectively), but larger volumes of flavored beverage and low-Hounsfield-value barium suspension resulted in more cramping and diarrhea (p = 0.001 and 0.002, respectively). The taste of the low-Hounsfield-value barium suspension was rated the worst (p < 0.0001). The subjects' willingness to repeat the drinking protocol was highest for the 1000 mL of flavored beverage or water alone (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in subjective small-bowel distention except that water was rated the worst by two of the three readers (p < 0.02). There was no significant difference in the diameter of the most dis-tended small bowel for any segment or reader (p > 0.23). A flavored beverage containing a thickening agent has a similar side effect profile and results in equivalent small-bowel distention compared with a low-Hounsfield-value barium suspension, but subjects rate taste and their willingness to repeat the drinking protocol higher for this new agent.

368,27,27,20637962,"Children who experience adverse reactions to cow's milk or who have diseases predisposing them to low bone mass are often prescribed a supplementation of calcium and vitamin D(3), but adherence can be poor. Age-specific preferences for different formulations may exist and at least partially explain poor compliance. The aim of this study was to compare the preference of Swiss children at risk for low bone mass for either a single-serving sachet or a suspension containing calcium and vitamin D(3). Two different commercial formulations containing calcium and vitamin D(3), either as a lemon-flavored single-serving sachet or as a banana-flavored commercial suspension, were tested for preference by means of a 5-point facial hedonic scale in children aged 4 to 7 and 8 to 11 years. A concealed random allocation procedure was used. The investigator asking about preference was blinded to the sequence. A total of 40 Swiss children (13 boys and 7 girls aged 4-7 years; 11 boys and 9 girls aged 811 years) were assessed in this study. Low bone mass risks included adverse reactions to cow's milk (n = 25); cerebral palsy (4), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (4), cystic fibrosis (3), inflammatory bowel diseases (2), anorexia nervosa (1), and osteogenesis imperfecta (1). Two children (10%) aged 4 to 7 years were not able to express their preference. Twelve of the remaining 18 children (67%) aged 4 to 7 years preferred the suspension, 5 (28%) did not express a clear preference, and 1 (5%) preferred the sachet (P < 0.002). In children aged 8 to 11 years, 15 (75%) preferred the sachet, 4 (20%) did not express a clear preference, and 1 (5%) preferred the suspension (P < 0.001). The results were not significantly different between boys and girls or between children initially presented the suspension and those initially presented the sachet. In this small study, significantly more Swiss children aged 4 to 7 years who were prescribed a supplementation of calcium and vitamin D(3) preferred a banana-flavored suspension compared with those who preferred a lemon-flavored single-serving sachet. However, significantly more children aged 8 to 11 years prescribed the same supplementation preferred the single-serving sachet compared with the suspension.

369,28,28,31218388,"To evaluate the ability of pediatric patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease to ingest a new oral distending agent at CT or MR enterography (CTE/MRE), and to determine the impact on small bowel (SB) distension and diagnostic confidence. The study design is that of retrospective review of pediatric patients who underwent CTE or MRE from January 2014 to June 2016. Patients ingested low-concentration barium suspension or flavored beverage containing sorbitol and mannitol. The need for nasogastric tube (NGT) administration, amount ingested, emesis, distal extent of contrast, SB distension, terminal ileum (TI) transverse dimension, and diagnostic confidence in TI disease were assessed. Three radiologists each blindly reviewed a subset of the studies. Of the total 591 scans in 504 patients, 316 scans used low-concentration barium suspension and 275 scans flavored beverage. Nearly all consumed the entire amount (97% vs. 96%). Low-concentration barium suspension exams required NGT more often (7% [23/316] vs. 1% [3/275]; p < 0.0003), and tended to have more emesis (3% [9/316] vs. 1% [3/275]; p = 0.13). Diagnostic confidence score was nearly identical (p = 0.94). Qualitative and quantitative analyses showed no difference in SB distension, except for distension of mid-ileum (flavored beverage > low-concentration barium suspension; p = 0.02). Flavored beverage exams demonstrated a slight increase in distal extent of luminal distension (p = 0.02). A new flavored beverage distends small bowel as well as low-concentration barium suspension, with decreased requirement for NGT insertion and improved distal extent of luminal distension, and without any decrease in diagnostic confidence in the presence or the absence of TI disease.

371,30,30,26926148,"The purpose of this study is to develop an oral suspension of clindamycin resin complex for the potential use in pediatrics. Several types of Ion exchange resins were screened for their binding efficiency with clindamycin. In order to develop a suspension formulation, several thickening agents, surfactants, sweeting, and flavoring agents were evaluated for their influence on the release of clindamycin from resinate. Rheological studies were also conducted to select the optimum amounts of the suspending agents. The release profiles of clindamycin in SGF and SIF were also evaluated from freshly prepared suspension and from suspension formulation after storage for 1 month at 25 °C and 40 °C. Clindamycin bitterness threshold was determined based on volunteers' evaluation, and taste evaluation was conducted in 12 adult volunteers who evaluated the taste of the optimized suspension against clindamycin solution. Among all resins tested, Amberlite IRP 69 showed the highest binding efficiency to clindamycin. Several excipients were selected into the suspension formulation based on no or minimum influence on the release of clindamycin from the resinate complex. Moreover, xanthan gum was selected as the optimal suspending agent for the suspension. Clindamycin release profiles in SGF or SIF showed 90% release within 30 min from freshly prepared sample. Clindamycin exhibited good stability profiles at 25 °C and 40 °C over 1 month storage. The mean bitterness threshold of clindamycin was 12.5 μg/ml, and taste evaluation study in adults showed sustainable taste improvement for suspension over clindamycin solution.

372,31,31,25747220,"Children generally reject taking medicine which does not have a favorable shape, taste, flavor, etc. However, if a child who needs to take a medicine, rejects taking it, he might never recover from his condition. When a child is unable to take medicine orally, it is intravenously administered, and he and his caregivers then may experience stress. Syrups and suspensions are considered as favorable types of dosage forms in which to orally administer medicine to infants and children. However, they may have disadvantages such as solubility, a bad taste, portability problems or required refrigerator storage. World Health Organization (WHO) currently favors that infants and children be treated with oral solid medicines. New oral solid tablets, such as a mini-tablet, instead of liquid medicines are proposed for this group, however, there are a few reports that mini-tablets are suitable for infants and children. Palatability is one of the main elements of patient acceptability of an oral pediatric medicine.

Despite intensive effort, the ability to express and purify sufficient quantities of structurally and functionally intact protein for biophysical analysis has previously been exceedingly difficult. We report here the development of novel methods to express, purify, and functionally reconstitute GLUT4 into detergent micelles and proteoliposomes. Rat GLUT4 containing FLAG and His tags at the amino and carboxy termini, respectively, was engineered and stably transfected into HEK-293 cells. Overexpression in suspension culture yielded over 1.5 mg of protein per liter of culture. Systematic screening of detergent solubilized GLUT4-GFP fusion protein via fluorescent-detection size exclusion chromatography identified lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG) as highly effective for isolating monomeric GLUT4 micelles. Preservation of structural integrity and ligand binding was demonstrated via quenching of tryptophan fluorescence and competition of ATB-BMPA photolabeling by cytochalasin B. GLUT4 was reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs and proper folding was confirmed. Reconstitution of purified GLUT4 with amphipol A8-35 stabilized the transporter at elevated temperatures for extended periods of time. Functional activity of purified GLUT4 was confirmed by reconstitution of LMNG-purified GLUT4 into proteoliposomes and measurement of saturable uptake of D-glucose over L-glucose. Taken together, these data validate the development of an efficient means to generate milligram quantities of stable and functionally intact GLUT4 that is suitable for a wide array of biochemical and biophysical analyses.

374,33,33,35532810,"Dielectric spectroscopy has been used in the study and development of non-invasive glucose monitoring (NIGM) sensors, including the range of microwave frequencies. Dielectric relaxation of red blood cell (RBC) cytosolic water in the microwave frequency band has been shown to be sensitive to variations in the glucose concentration of RBC suspensions. It has been hypothesized that this sensitivity stems from the utilization of D-glucose by RBCs. To verify this proposition, RBCs were pretreated with inhibitors of D-glucose uptake (cytochalasin B and forskolin). Then their suspensions were exposed to different D-glucose concentrations as measured by microwave dielectric spectroscopy (MDS) in the 500 MHz-40 GHz frequency band. After incubation of RBCs with either inhibitor, the dielectric response of water in the cytoplasm, and specifically its relaxation time, demonstrated minimal sensitivity to the change of D-glucose concentration in the medium. This result allows us to conclude that the sensitivity of MDS to glucose uptake is associated with variations in the balance of bulk and bound RBC cytosolic water due to intracellular D-glucose metabolism, verifying the correctness of the initial hypothesis. These findings represent a further argument to establish the dielectric response of water as a marker of glucose variation in RBCs.

The quality of compounding was evaluated through content uniformity measurement and physical and microbiological stability evaluation, under different storage conditions during 90 days. Six batches of 1% BNZ suspension were prepared using safe excipients currently available in a galenic area of Hospital Pharmacy and then stored at 5 and 25 °C for 90 days. The BNZ content was determined by UV spectrophotometry. Physical stability was defined as the absence of colour, odour and/or flavour changes and the re-suspension of solid phase by a reasonable amount of simple 15-s shaking. The compliance with microbiological attributes of non-sterile pharmaceutical products was also evaluated. An oral liquid suspension, containing 1% of BNZ, was developed from commercially available BNZ tablets. The formulations stored for 90 days were easily re-dispersed after a simple 15-s shaking, ensuring the pouring of a liquid volume containing the desired dose of BNZ. All samples were within the acceptable range of BNZ concentration with minimal standard deviations. There were no detectable changes in colour, odour, viscosity, pH and microbial growth, complying with official quality requirements. The quality attributes were not affected by storage, room or refrigeration conditions or by the frequent opening or closing of the multidose containers.

A crossover, partially double-blind study was conducted in three phases of 14 days each, during which 11 volunteers wore palatal devices containing six dental enamel blocks covered with plastic meshes to allow biofilm formation. Dental blocks were extraorally submitted to treatment with a 20 % sucrose solution at three different daily frequencies of exposure (0, 3, and 8 times/day), and to the antibiotic suspension or its excipients at an 8-h time interval application regimen. On the 14th day of each phase, the blocks were removed for enamel analysis (surface and cross-sectional microhardness--SMH and CSMH). The antibiotic suspension showed significant higher SMH and CSMH values than the excipients (p < 0.05; Wilcoxon), regardless of the frequency of sucrose exposure. Sucrose exposure did not account for further enamel demineralization both for antibiotic and excipients (p > 0.05; Friedman). A protective effect of the antibiotic suspension on enamel demineralization was verified because its excipients alone promoted more pronounced surface and subsurface enamel demineralization, even in the absence of sucrose exposure. The use of a sugar-free amoxicillin/clavulanic acid suspension may promote a protective effect on primary enamel demineralization probably due to its topical effect on dental biofilm.

378,37,37,15478849,"Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is a ubiquitous disorder in infants. Whereas infants typically outgrow regurgitation by 1 year of age, the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms in those aged 3 to >18 years ranges from 1.8% to 22%. The pathophysiology of GERD in children is similar to that in adults. However, children may present with gastroesophageal and extraesophageal symptoms distinct from classic heartburn. In addition to a growing awareness of the high prevalence of the disorder, increasing evidence supports GERD being a lifelong condition in some individuals that begins in childhood. Although the diagnostic workup in children compared with adults may differ, studies suggest that the early detection and treatment of GERD in childhood may result in better adult disease outcomes, improved quality of life, and decreased overall healthcare burden. Studies of proton pump inhibitor therapy in children confirm high rates of mucosal healing and GER symptom resolution, even in children whose symptoms did not respond to H2-receptor therapy or fundoplication procedures.

We prospectively compared three MRE oral preparations in pediatric patients with known or suspected Crohn disease with respect to patient-reported tolerability and radiologist-determined small-bowel distension and opacification. Seventy-five pediatric patients (mean age 14.8 years, 55% female) with known or suspected Crohn disease referred for MRE were randomized to an oral preparation with a sugar alcohol-based flavored beverage (Breeza), polyethylene glycol preparation (MiraLAX), or low-concentration barium sulfate suspension (VoLumen). Patients were instructed to consume oral contrast agent (using a weight-based protocol) beginning 60 min prior to MRE imaging. Following MRE, patients completed a questionnaire regarding their oral preparation solution including: taste (1-5 scale), feeling of well-being (1-5 scale) and willingness to consume again (yes/no). Two radiologists reviewed all MRE exams and rated exams for global features (active disease, overall small-bowel distention [1-4 scale]) and features specific to individual small-bowel segments (extent of distention, maximal luminal diameter, opacification, and susceptibility artifact). Statistical methods included one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey honest difference and Fisher exact tests. The overall rate of completion of the entire prescribed contrast volume was 53% (40/75), with a significantly higher rate of completion for MiraLAX than for VoLumen (70% vs. 30%, P=0.007). Crossover to a different preparation occurred in nine patients (12%) and was significantly more frequent when the initial preparation was VoLumen versus MiraLAX (29% vs. 0%, P=0.005). Mean subjective taste ratings for both MiraLAX (3.4, P<0.0001) and Breeza (2.8, P=0.006) were superior to those of VoLumen (1.9), which persisted in the subset of patients with MRE evidence of active Crohn disease. Patients who consumed MiraLAX were more likely to be willing to drink it again compared to those consuming VoLumen (82% vs. 46%, P=0.009). Overall small-bowel distention and bowel-segment-specific metrics (distention, maximal diameter, opacification and susceptibility) did not significantly differ among groups.

382,41,41,19136828,"This study evaluated acid production from cooked starch by Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus mitis, and the effects of alpha-amylase inhibitors (maltotriitol and acarbose) and xylitol on acid production. Streptococcal cell suspensions were anaerobically incubated with various carbohydrates that included cooked potato starch in the presence or absence of alpha-amylase. Subsequently, the fall in pH and the acid production rate at pH 7.0 were measured. In addition, the effects of adding alpha-amylase inhibitors and xylitol to the reaction mixture were evaluated. In the absence of alpha-amylase, both the fall in pH and the acid production rate from cooked starch were small. On the other hand, in the presence of alpha-amylase, the pH fell to 3.9-4.4 and the acid production rate was 0.61-0.92 micromol per optical density unit per min. These values were comparable to those for maltose. When using cooked starch, the fall in pH by S. sanguinis and S. mitis was similar to that by S. mutans and S. sobrinus. For all streptococci, alpha-amylase inhibitors caused a decrease in acid production from cooked starch, although xylitol only decreased acid production by S. mutans and S. sobrinus. These results suggest that cooked starch is potentially acidogenic in the presence of alpha-amylase, which occurs in the oral cavity. In terms of the acidogenic potential of cooked starch, S. sanguinis and S. mitis were comparable to S. mutans and S. sobrinus. Alpha-amylase inhibitors and xylitol might moderate this activity.

383,42,42,22478950,"Prescribing of diclofenac for children usually involves a dose different from commercially available strengths. This drug is available only as tablets, which can be divided only so many times before the dose obtained becomes inaccurate. In addition, children may have difficulty swallowing tablets. For these reasons, a compounding formula for a liquid dosage form is essential to ensure effective delivery of the drug to pediatric patients. To develop a compounding formula for diclofenac sodium and to determine the extended physical and chemical stability of this compound when stored in amber polyvinyl chloride (PVC) prescription bottles under refrigeration and at room temperature. A suspension of diclofenac sodium (10 mg/mL) was prepared from commercially available diclofenac sodium tablets, with Ora-Blend as the suspending and flavouring agent. The suspension was packaged in 60-mL amber PVC prescription bottles and stored at either room temperature (23°C) or under refrigeration (5°C). Samples were collected on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 27, 56, and 93. Chemical stability was determined using a validated stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography method. At each sampling time, the suspensions were checked for changes in appearance (i.e., colour, layering, caking, ease of resuspension), odour, and pH. The diclofenac sodium suspensions were very stable, retaining at least 99.5% of the original concentration for up to 93 days, regardless of storage temperature. There were no apparent changes in the physical appearance of the suspensions, nor were there any substantial changes in odour or pH. Suspensions of diclofenac sodium (10 mg/mL) were quantitatively stable but difficult to prepare because of the enteric coating of the tablets. Therefore, it is recommended that diclofenac powder be used for the preparation of suspensions. For pediatric use, palatability is a consideration, and a masking agent should be added before administration. An expiry date of up to 93 days is suggested. La prescription de diclofénac aux enfants requiert généralement une dose qui ne correspond à aucun des dosages disponibles dans le commerce. Ce médicament n’existe que sous forme de comprimés qui ne peuvent être subdivisés que quelques fois sans compromettre l’exactitude de la dose obtenue. En outre, les enfants peuvent avoir du mal à avaler les comprimés. Pour ces raisons, il faut une recette pour la préparation d’une forme pharmaceutique liquide afin d’assurer l’administration effective du médicament aux patients en pédiatrie. Développer une recette pour la préparation de diclofénac sodique et déterminer la stabilité physique et chimique prolongée de cette préparation lorsqu’elle est conservée dans des flacons en polychlorure de vinyle (PVC) ambré pour médicaments d’ordonnance au réfrigérateur ou à la température ambiante. Une suspension de diclofénac sodique (10 mg/mL) a été préparée à partir de comprimés de diclofénac sodique commercialisés avec l’agent de suspension et aromatisant, Ora-Blend. La suspension a été conditionnée dans des flacons en PVC ambré de 60 mL pour médicaments d’ordonnance, puis entreposée à la température ambiante (23 °C) ou au réfrigérateur (5 °C). Des échantillons ont été prélevés aux jours 0, 7, 14, 21, 27, 56 et 93. La stabilité chimique a été déterminée à l’aide d’une épreuve validée par chromatographie liquide haute performance. À chaque prélèvement d’échantillon, les suspensions ont été inspectées visuellement pour déceler tout changement d’apparence (c.-à-d., couleur, stratification, agglutination et facilité de remise en suspension), d’odeur et de pH. Les suspensions de diclofénac sodique sont demeurées très stables, conservant plus de 99,5 % de la concentration initiale pendant une période allant jusqu’à 93 jours, peu importe les conditions d’entreposage. On n’a observé aucun changement évident dans l’apparence des suspensions ni de changement substantiel dans l’odeur ou le pH des suspensions. Les suspensions de diclofénac sodique (10 mg/mL) étaient quantitativement stables, mais difficiles à préparer à cause de l’enrobage entérosoluble des comprimés. Par conséquent, il est recommandé d’utiliser plutôt le diclofénac en poudre. La palatabilité étant un facteur dont il faut tenir compte en pédiatrie, on devrait ajouter un masquant du goût avant l’administration de la préparation. La durée de conservation suggérée est de 93 jours au maximum.

384,43,43,2511611,"The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the taste of two formulations of phenoxymethylpenicillin suspension in children. The two suspensions, designated Test and Standard, differed only in their flavouring and sweetening agents. The secondary objectives were to study age-related differences in taste perception, to evaluate the acceptability of the suspensions, and to determine patient compliance. In 319 children with acute otitis media a taste description was recorded after a single therapeutic dose. The patient's own spontaneous verbal judgements, directly after the dose intake and also 3-4 minutes later, were recorded. The parents were asked about the child's acceptance of the suspension after finalized treatment. For 214 patients compliance was calculated from the remaining amount of suspension in the returned medication bottles. The study indicated that children aged 6 years or older considered the test formulation to be better-tasting than the standard formulation. The judgements by the parents also indicated that the test suspension was more acceptable. In children below 6 years there was no significant difference between the two suspensions with regard to taste or acceptance. A high patient compliance (greater than or equal to 90%) was obtained in 88% of the patients.

385,44,44,23092239,"The increasing interest in probiotic lactobacilli in health maintenance has raised the question of potential risks. One possible side effect could be an increased acidogenicity in dental plaque. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of probiotic lactobacilli on plaque lactic acid (LA) production in vitro and in vivo. In the first part (A), suspensions of two lactobacilli strains (L. reuteri DSM 17938, L. plantarum 299v) were added to suspensions of supragingival dental plaque collected from healthy young adults (n=25). LA production after fermentation with either xylitol or fructose was analyzed. In the second part (B), subjects (n=18) were given lozenges with probiotic lactobacilli (L. reuteri DSM 17938 and ATCC PTA 5289) or placebo for two weeks in a double-blinded, randomized cross-over trial. The concentration of LA in supragingival plaque samples was determined at baseline and after 2 weeks. Salivary counts of mutans streptococci (MS) and lactobacilli were estimated with chair-side methods. Plaque suspensions with L. reuteri DSM 17938 produced significantly less LA compared with L. plantarum 299v or controls (p<0.05). Fructose gave higher LA concentrations than xylitol. In part B, there were no significant differences in LA production between baseline and follow up in any of the groups and no differences between test and placebo were displayed. The salivary MS counts were not significantly altered during the intervention but the lactobacilli counts increased significantly in the test group (p<0.05). Lactic acid production in suspensions of plaque and probiotic lactobacilli was strain-dependant and the present study provides no evidence of an increase in plaque acidity by the supply of selected probiotic lactobacilli when challenged by fructose or xylitol.

386,45,45,28271493,"Prednisone is a widely used anti-inflammatory for a variety of conditions. While oral liquid formulations of prednisone enable weight-based dosing, children frequently find them to be objectionable due to bitter taste. This limitation of prednisone can adversely impact patient acceptance and may result in non-compliance. Efforts to mask flavours often result in poorly controlled, heterogeneous particle distributions and can provide ineffective taste masking. The present work utilized a novel drug delivery technology developed by Orbis Biosciences, Inc., to create an oral taste-masked formulation of prednisone. The study examined the palatability of Orbis' microsphere prednisone formulation in healthy young adults (n = 24). Four test articles were used in the study including a reference formulation (Roxanne Laboratories), a control and the test formulation (Orbis) prepared in two different ways. Study participants were randomized in a crossover design. Results indicated that the test prednisone formulation was indistinguishable from the control, and both were preferable to the reference formulation in every category of palatability assessed using a validated 9-point Hedonic Scale. The data also suggested that preparing the microsphere suspension immediately before administration results in the most ideal palatability properties. In conclusion, the novel microsphere formulation technology was effective in taste-masking prednisone.

The levels of mutans streptococci (ms) were enumerated in plaque and saliva and the proportion of xylitol-sensitive (X(S)) strains in saliva was determined by autoradiography with [(14)C]-xylitol at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 wk. The lactic acid formation rate was assessed enzymatically in sucrose-challenged plaque suspensions. A drop in salivary ms levels was found in Group A after 6 wk but not after 12 or 18 wk. The proportion of X(S) ms was decreased after 6 wk in groups A and B and remained so during the experimental period. The lactic acid formation rates decreased slightly ( approximately 10%) in the two xylitol groups compared with baseline. In conclusion, our results showed that although an alteration of ms strains was demonstrated following a regular daily low-dose intake of xylitol, the long-term total ms counts in plaque and saliva as well as plaque acidogenicity remained unchanged.

388,47,47,16732449,"Growing evidence from clinical studies suggests that mothers using xylitol gums or lozenges have decreased levels of Streptococcus mutans (SM) and do not transmit these cariogenic bacteria as readily to their children. To begin to determine mechanisms for these clinical findings and to explore potential synergism of antimicrobial combinations, we studied the effect of multiple exposures of chlorhexidine (CHX) combined with copper gluconate (CG) or zinc gluconate (ZG) followed by xylitol (XYL) on the ability of SM to adhere and form biofilms. Cell suspensions of SM were exposed two times to CHX; CG; CHX plus CG; ZG; and CHX plus ZG, and then four times to XYL. Control cells were exposed six times to water or XYL or received no treatment. For biofilm assessment, glass slides were inoculated with treated cells, and numbers of bacteria were enumerated after 48 hours of incubation. To assess the ability of SM to adhere, microtiter plate wells coated with primary S. sanguinis biofilms grown in sucrose were inoculated with treated SM, and adhesion was determined. Cells exposed to CHX-XYL combinations exhibited significant but transient inhibition of growth. The multiple-exposure regimen groups showed significant decreases in the ability of SM to form biofilms (P < 0.05). However, the CHX-XYL group exhibited a much greater effect than the other treatment groups (P < 0.001). Adhesion studies revealed that none of the multiple-exposure regimens had a significant effect on adhesion of SM to primary biofilms of S. sanguinis. We concluded that significant inhibition of SM growth and subsequent inability to grow as biofilms in the presence of sucrose occurs after a staggered exposure regimen to CHX initially and then to XYL. This may help explain the clinical data showing the decreased levels of SM in mothers treated with CHX and XYL.

X-ray powder diffraction showed that PZQ remained in its original crystalline state, while differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform-infrared analysis evidenced the formation of chemical interactions among the ingredients. The solubilisation test performed in non-sink condition to reproduce the actual condition in which a child of 4 years takes the medicine revealed that granules quickly formed a very fine suspension in water (dV90=39.9 μm). Although after the granulation process the solubility of raw PZQ was not increased, adding the aqueous suspension to 500 ml of buffer solution of pH 1.5, simulating the fasted state of a child, 50% of the drug was dissolved after 30 min. After granule manipulation with milk and fruit juices, no PZQ degradation was observed during time. Finally, the selected granule formulation provided evidence to be stable even at hot and very humid climate (30°C/75% RH), at least for the examined time.

Twenty healthy volunteer children with a mean age of 9.2 +/- 2.0 SD years (range 6-12). The taste of each antibiotic was rated by the children on a 10-cm visual analog scale incorporating a facial hedonic scale.

Taste scores were as follows: cloxacillin 1.4 +/- 1.8 cm, cephalexin 6.5 +/- 2.7 cm, erythromycin 6.8 +/- 3.0 cm, and fusidic acid 6.3 +/- 2.4 cm. The taste rating of cloxacillin was significantly lower compared with the other three antibiotics (p = 0.001). Cloxacillin was chosen as having the worst taste by a significant proportion of the children (18 of 20). None of the antibiotics was clearly best tasting. Given similar effectiveness, taste considerations may be important in the decision as to which antibiotic to prescribe. The perception that cloxacillin is poor tasting to children is supported by this study, which suggests that when compliance with oral medication is critical for successful treatment, prescription of cloxacillin suspension should be avoided.

Dental blocks were extraorally submitted to a 20% sucrose solution at three different frequencies of exposure (0, 3 and 8 times/day), and to a suspension of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium (A/CP) or a placebo (P) suspension at an 8-hour time interval application regimen. On the 14(th) day of each phase, biofilms were collected for microbiological (conventional culture) and molecular (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis--DGGE) analyses. In the absence of sucrose exposure (SE) and at the 3-time daily frequency, dental biofilms treated with A/CP showed lower total biofilm weight and lower counts of total microbiota than the ones treated with P (p>0.05). A/CP presented higher counts of Candida spp. when compared with P in the presence of SE, especially at the 8-time daily frequency (p<0.05). Considering the DGGE analysis, the mean number of bands was higher for P (p>0.05), regardless of SE. However, DGGE profiles demonstrated large interindividual variability. Both conventional culture and DGGE have demonstrated some differences on total microbiota of dental biofilms when exposed to the A/CP or P suspensions, mainly in the absence of sucrose, which suggests a possible topical effect of the sugar-free A/CP suspension on dental biofilm.

The applicability of an electronic tongue in the development of a taste masked generic ibuprofen suspension, starting from a commercial taste masked product, was evaluated in this study. The initial screening study on 3 proprietary and 11 generic products showed that sensors of the taste sensing system TS-5000Z could clearly detect differences between the products. The variation of sensor responses were mainly caused by sodium salts, sweeteners, and preservatives, whereas pH and viscosity did not affect sensor response. In addition, the presence of the particles (20-100 µm) did not damage the sensor membranes. Based on this screening, and the known qualitative composition of the proprietary formulations, the approximate quantitative composition of a proprietary formulation could be deduced and a taste masked generic formulation could be developed using the electronic tongue data. Differences in sensor responses between the proprietary and optimized generic formulation were smaller than 11 mV for each sensor.

At the same time, more hypoglycemic episodes and a higher time below range were noted in this group. Almost 90% of them were the threshold value for initiating treatment for hypoglycemia and occurred near the end of observation period.

398,57,57,8431459,"We have investigated the mechanism by which amiloride and 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA) inhibit glucose-stimulated medium acidification in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The addition of glucose to an unbuffered suspension of cells results in the extrusion of acid. This process was inhibited by diethylstilbestrol (DES), an inhibitor of the H(+)-ATPase (IC50 71 microM), and also by amiloride (IC50 824 microM) and EIPA (IC50 203 microM). The presence of 100 mM NaCl reduced the degree of inhibition observed for amiloride and EIPA, but had no effect on inhibition by DES. N-Methylglucosamine partially protected the cells against the effect of amiloride, but choline chloride did not, suggesting that sodium may be important in the action of amiloride. To establish the site of action of amiloride and EIPA, ATP hydrolysis assays were performed on isolated plasma membranes. H(+)-ATPase activity was inhibited by orthovanadate, but not by amiloride or EIPA. However, both amiloride and EIPA were found to inhibit the incorporation of radioactivity from labelled glucose in S. pombe, with IC50 values of 879 and 272 microM for amiloride and EIPA respectively. Again, 100 mM NaCl was found to reduce the effectiveness of inhibition. Amiloride had no effect on the uptake of 2-deoxyglucose under the same conditions, indicating that amiloride does not inhibit the glucose transporter. We propose that amiloride and EIPA disrupt glucose-induced acidification by inhibiting glucose metabolism.

399,58,58,1590430,"To determine whether growth hormone (GH) directly affects ammoniagenesis in the renal proximal tubule, ammonia production was measured in suspensions of isolated canine renal proximal tubule segments (IPTs) incubated with 2.5 mM L-glutamine and varying concentrations of human growth hormone (hGH). Ammonia production from IPTs significantly increased by nearly threefold in the presence of hGH (10(-6) M) at 60 min. This increase was dose dependent, with as little as 10(-9) M hGH significantly stimulating ammonia production. In addition, hGH enhanced glucose production when lactate, alanine, and succinate replaced L-glutamine as substrate. hGH significantly stimulated ammonia production when IPTs were incubated at alkalotic and neutral pH. The effect of hGH was lost at acidic pH. When hGH was added to IPTs incubated under Na(+)-equilibrated conditions, ammonia production was not different from control. hGH stimulated ouabain-sensitive Na(+)-K(+)-adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) activity by 8.1 +/- 1.1% in basolateral membranes isolated from IPTs. hGH stimulation of proximal tubule ammonia production from L-glutamine occurs at physiological concentrations of hGH and when the extracellular-to-intracellular Na+ gradient favors L-glutamine transport. This effect is associated with an increase in basolateral Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity. The data suggest a role for hGH in the regulation of renal acid-base metabolism under physiological conditions in which increased net acid excretion is important.

However, there are no adequate pharmaceutical presentation forms for infants. To assess the acid suppression capacity of a new pharmaceutical association of omeprazole with sodium bicarbonate and sodium alginate (OBA), powder for oral suspension, in small infants with GERD. The response was measured according to the gastric variations of pH after a 3-day treatment with OBA. This is a pilot, prospective, open study in infants with no congenital nor associated anomalies under 12 months of age with GERD. Two double channel pHmetry with gastric sensor were performed on different days in the same patient. The first one to establish the diagnosis (day 0) and the second one (day 3) after receiving omeprazole (OBA) at 1.5 mg/kg/day in a twice/dose/day (BID). The comparison between the frst and the second gastric pHmetry showed a statistically significant reduction in gastric acidity. No adverse events were observed in infants and the suspension flavor was palatable. This new presentation of omeprazole (OBA) with sodium bicarbonate and sodium alginate powder for oral suspension is capable of a significant and intense acid suppression, necessary for treatment of infants with GERD. The taste of the solution was well accepted by all the babies, which is a very important finding for this age group.

Nine blood samples were drawn from each child at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h following dosing with the antibiotic. Serum fusidic acid levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A model-independent method was used for the pharmacokinetic analysis. Results were compared with those obtained after dosing eight healthy adult volunteers with 500 mg of sodium fusidate by parenteral administration (infusion) then per os. The acceptability of the single dose was good. The terminal elimination half-life t1/2 (h) and the mean residence time (MRT, h) of fusidate were similar to those determined in healthy adults after oral dosing, i.e. 16.0 +/- 14.5 versus 16.0 +/- 3.5 and 17.7 +/- 12.1 versus 17.7 +/- 2.5, respectively. In contrast, the oral bioavailability of the suspension (Fapprox., %) was relatively low: of the order of 22.5 versus 91.0% for tablets in the healthy adult, which justifies the use of a relatively higher dose in the child. This led to the calculation of an estimated total clearance (Clest., ml/min) significantly less than that in the healthy adults, while the estimated apparent volume of distribution (Vd, litre/kg) was significantly increased (10.4 +/- 9.1 versus 21.8 +/- 2.1 and 0.73 +/- 0.53 versus 0.30 +/- 0.04, respectively).

Productions of ammonia were linear functions of time for 120 min and averaged 231 +/- 55 and 311 +/- 67 mumol ammonia/g protein in the absence and presence of PTH, respectively. When measured over the range of 10(-11)-10(-7) M PTH, half-maximal stimulation of ammonia production occurred between 10(-10) and 10(-9) M PTH. Maximal production of ammonia was observed at 10(-8) M PTH. Incubation of proximal tubular segments with PTH increased levels of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) in vitro. Ammonia production was significantly enhanced by incubation of segments with the cAMP analogue, 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate. PTH also increased ammonia production in segments incubated with 1 mM L-glutamine. We conclude that PTH stimulates ammonia production in canine renal proximal tubular segments. This effect appears to be mediated, at least in part, through cAMP in vitro. Such stimulation could reflect a direct action of PTH on the proximal tubule to enhance ammoniagenesis in vivo.

406,65,65,3386134,"Renal hypertrophy is a common consequence of diabetes mellitus that precedes and possibly accounts for the increased glomerular filtration rate. We have postulated that the glucose-mediated increase in the intracellular concentration of sodium [Na]i initiates the chain of events leading to the increase in cell size and eventually cell number. Experiments were conducted on Sprague-Dawley rats made diabetic by the intravenous injection of 45 mg/kg body wt of streptozotocin dissolved in a 5 mM citrate buffer solution. Control animals were injected with the vehicle alone. Ninety-six hours and 11 weeks later, measurements of [Na]i were done by NMR spectroscopy on suspensions of proximal tubules, using dysprosium tripolyphosphate as an extracellular shift reagent. At 96 hours after the induction of the diabetes, there was a 60% increase in [Na]i compared to control (P less than 0.01). No further increase in [Na]i was observed during the subsequent 11 weeks of observation. Addition of ouabain (1.0 mM) resulted in a fourfold increase in [Na]i in tubules from control animals, and a 2.5-fold increase in tubules from 96-hour diabetic rats. Ouabain-inhibitable Na+-K+-ATPase activity was substantially higher in the renal tubules of diabetic rats, the increase being proportional to that of [Na]i. In order to ascertain the effect of hyperglycemia on [Na]i, proximal tubules prepared from kidneys of normal and diabetic rats were exposed to low (5 mM) and high (25 mM) concentration of glucose in the media.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) ",Intracellular sodium in proximal tubules of diabetic rats.

The children were instructed to chew 6 pieces of a test or a control gum every day for a 14-day period. The test gum contained 65% xylitol and the control gum was sweetened with sorbitol. At baseline and after 14 days, salivary mutans streptococci were enumerated with a chair-side test (Strip mutans) and dental plaque was collected from the upper maxillary incisors. After a washout period of 6 weeks, the same procedure was repeated with the corresponding test or control gum. Lactic acid was determined enzymatically in glucose-challenged plaque suspensions. The lactic acid concentration was significantly reduced (p<0.05) by 22% compared with baseline following the xylitol gum regimen but was unaltered after the control gum. The levels of salivary mutans streptococci were mainly unaffected by both chewing gums.

Intraoral microbial plaque pH changes were determined at intervals for 30 minutes following an oral rinse with each medication. These data were compared with plaque pH changes caused by rinsing with an established cariogenic challenge, 10% sucrose solution. Decreased plaque pH was caused by each medication tested. The extent and duration of the pH drop varied among the medications. Patterns of the pH curves are discussed in relation to sucrose content, endogenous pH, and buffering capacity of the medications. Intraoral pH response to several medications equaled or exceeded that seen when sucrose rinses alone were given. The findings are discussed in relation to dental caries-producing potential of long-term therapy with liquid medications, and two cases are presented that implicate liquid medications as a major etiologic factor leading to rampant dental decay. It is concluded that health practitioners should be aware of the sucrose content of pediatric medications.
