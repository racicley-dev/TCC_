There is evidence that medical cannabis (MC) may be efficacious in ameliorating such symptoms and improving HRQoL. As many of these HRQoL symptoms may mutually reinforce one another, we conducted an exploratory study to investigate how MC users perceive the efficacy of MC in addressing co-occurring HRQoL symptoms.

1,1,1,39294485,"The rapidly changing policy climate related to cannabis legalization has led to drastic changes in cannabis use in the United States (US). Medical cannabis use is increasing overall, but at a faster rate among older adults compared to other age groups. The aim was to investigate older adults' cannabis use behaviors and attitudes around disclosing medical cannabis use to their primary healthcare providers (HCPs). Nineteen older adults (ages 65+ years) with self-reported medical cannabis use were recruited from flyers posted in ambulatory clinics in San Diego, CA. Surveys and semi-structured interviews on cannabis use were completed. A multi-methods approach was used to analyze data. Participants' mean age was 75.3 years; 52.6% identified as women, and 89.5% as White. Cannabis was used by all participants to treat pain and by 75% for insomnia, with 25-33% reductions in use of prescription medications to treat these symptoms. Approximately 89% reported their primary HCPs were aware of their cannabis use, and 84.2% felt very comfortable/comfortable talking to HCPs about cannabis. Common themes from interviews included participants (1) being motivated to disclose cannabis use to their HCPs to seek medical advice on dosing, side effects, and benefits of cannabis, (2) feeling comfortable disclosing cannabis use as legalization has eased the stigma around cannabis use, and (3) perceiving mostly neutral attitudes from HCPs on their cannabis use. The study emphasizes the pivotal role of HCPs as educators in addressing patient inquiries about cannabis, underlining the need for equipping healthcare professionals with evidence-based knowledge through education and training initiatives.

2,2,2,16202145,"The New South Wales State Government recently proposed a trial of the medical use of cannabis. Australians who currently use cannabis medicinally do so illegally and without assurances of quality control. Given the dearth of local information on this issue, this study explored the experiences of medical cannabis users. Australian adults who had used cannabis for medical purposes were recruited using media stories. A total of 147 respondents were screened by phone and anonymous questionnaires were mailed, to be returned by postage paid envelope. Data were available for 128 participants. Long term and regular medical cannabis use was frequently reported for multiple medical conditions including chronic pain (57%), depression (56%), arthritis (35%), persistent nausea (27%) and weight loss (26%). Cannabis was perceived to provide ""great relief"" overall (86%), and substantial relief of specific symptoms such as pain, nausea and insomnia. It was also typically perceived as superior to other medications in terms of undesirable effects, and the extent of relief provided. However, nearly one half (41%) experienced conditions or symptoms that were not helped by its use. The most prevalent concerns related to its illegality. Participants reported strong support for their use from clinicians and family. There was almost universal interest (89%) in participating in a clinical trial of medical cannabis, and strong support (79%) for investigating alternative delivery methods. Australian medical cannabis users are risking legal ramifications, but consistent with users elsewhere, claim moderate to substantial benefits from its use in the management of their medical condition. In addition to strong public support, medical cannabis users show strong interest in clinical cannabis research, including the investigation of alternative delivery methods.

3,3,3,12618922,"Cannabis occurs naturally in the dried flowering or fruiting tops of the Cannabis sativa plant. Cannabis is most often consumed by smoking marihuana. Cannabinoids are the active compounds extracted from cannabis. Recently, there has been renewed interest in cannabinoids for medicinal purposes. The two proven indications for the use of the synthetic cannabinoid (dronabinol) are chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and AIDS-related anorexia. Other possible effects that may prove beneficial in the oncology population include analgesia, antitumor effect, mood elevation, muscle relaxation, and relief of insomnia. Two types of cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, have been detected. CB1 receptors are expressed mainly in the central and peripheral nervous system. CB2 receptors are found in certain nonneuronal tissues, particularly in the immune cells. Recent discovery of both the cannabinoid receptors and endocannabinoids has opened a new era in research on the pharmaceutical applications of cannabinoids. The use of cannabinoids should be continued in the areas indicated, and further studies are needed to evaluate other potential uses in clinical oncology.

4,4,4,35970642,"Over the past century a dramatic decline in sleep duration among adolescents, such as more than one hour of sleep loss per night, has been reported. A debt in sleep duration could lead to sleep deprivation, a major risk factor associated with daytime sleepiness. Sleepiness refers to the inability to maintain an adequate level of alertness during the day which may result in more or less being able to control falling asleep at inappropriate times. This literature review updates on sleepiness regarding its characteristics, etiology and consequences on adolescents. Studies revealed that from 25 % to 78 % of adolescents had reported sleepiness. Its manifestations may include heavy lids, yawns, difficulties to concentrate and emotional irritability. In addition, while it is recommended that adolescents under 18 years-old should sleep from eight to ten hours a night, only 63 % of them actually do so. The etiology of sleep deprivation and sleepiness in this population can be explained by various biological and societal factors. First, the sleep-wake cycle of adolescents shows a biological shift from the beginning of pubertal maturation, described as a perfect storm. It refers to a social jetlag by going to sleep and waking up later and accumulating a sleep debt during weekdays which they try to reimburse during weekends. This phenomenon can be explained by physiological changes such as a slower accumulation of sleep pressure. In addition to this perfect storm, environmental and societal factors contribute to the social jetlag and reduce sleep duration in adolescents. Screen exposure before bedtime can delay sleep and wake onset, which is a risk factor for sleeping debt. Substance use such as caffeine, cigarettes or electronic vaporizer, ADHD or freely available medication, alcohol, cannabis use or drug consumption could further disrupt sleep-wake cycle by stimulating, depressing or otherwise disrupting the central nervous system. Early, before 8:30 am, class start times have been associated with chronic sleep deprivation, higher level of sleepiness and delayed melatonin peak secretion. Adolescents working or doing extracurricular occupations for more than 20hours a week are more at risk for reduced sleep duration and sleepiness. Parental supervision about sleep during the weekdays were associated with more appropriate bedtime. Adolescents from low socio-demographic characteristics and from minority ethnic groups have reported displaying a shorter sleep duration. Finally, sleep disorders of a physiological origin such as narcolepsy, sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome, may explain the sleep deprivation and sleepiness. Sleep deprivation and sleepiness in adolescents have consequences on their health. Cognitive functioning, such as problem solving, attention or memory, as well as school performance, can be compromised by sleep deprivation and sleepiness. At the psychological level, adolescents reporting sleepiness are more prone to display mental health problems: associations were found between sleepiness and subjective perception of depression, anxiety, somatic complaints as well as with antisocial behaviors. Finally, 68 % of 16 year-old adolescents reported they drove a car, and the reported sleepiness could lead to road accidents due to reduced attentional functioning, reaction time and decision-making abilities. In the United-States, from 7 % to 16.5 % of deadly accidents were related to driving while drowsy. Highlighting etiology and problems associated with sleep deprivation and sleepiness in adolescents could guide researchers and clinicians towards the development of possible interventions. Public health measures and knowledge transfer programs regarding modifiable psychosocial and societal factors associated with sleep-wake bioregulation could increase awareness in parents as well as in political and societal decision makers.

RCTs were reviewed here if they were peer-reviewed manuscripts that included objective measures of sleep in RCTs that sought to improve sleep in persons with SUDs. The initial search yielded 13,403 potential articles, with 27 meeting a priori criteria to be included in this review. The most common SUD was alcohol use disorder (59%). The most common technology used to assess sleep was polysomnography (41%), followed by actigraphy (37%), ambulatory polysomnography or components of polysomnography (e.g., electroencephalography; 19%), and at-home sleep apnea testing (7%). The most common sleep outcome reported was total sleep time (96%). There are a range of options to assess objective sleep outcomes. Polysomnography or ambulatory devices that directly measure brain activity are critical to advance medications through the regulatory process for the indication of improving sleep duration, continuity, and/or sleep onset latency outcomes. Actigraphy is also useful in preliminary investigations and in detecting the relationship between diurnal and SUD-related behaviors.

We seek to define the patterns of MC use among cancer patients, as well as efficacy and safety of MC. Cancer patients attending oncology office visits at Beaumont Hospital, Michigan from July to December 2018 were anonymously surveyed. The survey included data regarding demographics, diagnosis, treatment, symptom burden, and MC use. Patients who reported MC use since their cancer diagnosis completed a section on patterns of use, efficacy, and safety. The response rate was 188 of 327 (57.5%). MC use was reported by 46 of 188 (24.5%). A median composite baseline symptom score ranging from 8 (best) to 32 (worst) was higher in patients using MC versus nonusers; 17.5 versus 14.4 (P<0.001). Pain was the symptom with the highest frequency of improvement 34/42 (81%), followed by appetite 34/44 (77.3%), and anxiety 32/44 (73%). MC improved the ability to tolerate treatment in 24/44 (54.5%).

Placebo was administered at bedtime during one abstinence period (withdrawal test) and extended-release zolpidem, a non-benzodiazepine GABA(A) receptor agonist, was administered during the other. Polysomnographic (PSG) sleep architecture measures, subjective ratings, and cognitive performance effects were assessed each day. During the placebo-abstinence period, participants had decreased sleep efficiency, total sleep time, percent time spent in Stage 1 and Stage 2 sleep, REM latency and subjective sleep quality, as well as increased sleep latency and time spent in REM sleep compared with when they were using cannabis. Zolpidem attenuated the effects of abstinence on sleep architecture and normalized sleep efficiency scores, but had no effect on sleep latency. Zolpidem was not associated with any significant side effects or next-day cognitive performance impairments. These data extend prior research that indicates abrupt abstinence from cannabis can lead to clinically significant sleep disruption in daily users.

Two-hundred and twenty seven participants (117 ecstasy/polydrug users, 53 cannabis users and 57 drug naive participants) took part. The participants completed measures of daytime sleepiness, and indicators of sleep quality. The results demonstrated that ecstasy/polydrug users viewed themselves as being more evening types and having poorer sleep quality than cannabis users and drug naive participants. They were also more likely to have missed a night's sleep. The reported differences in sleep type may reflect ecstasy-related serotonergic dysfunction resulting in problems with shifting circadian rhythms.

17,17,17,24474865,"Cannabis is one of the most widely used illicit drugs worldwide. However, while the rates of cannabis dependence and treatment increase, there remains no medications approved for this use. Due to its sedative effects and low abuse liability, the typical antipsychotic pericyazine has been utilized in some parts of Australia for the treatment of cannabis dependence. We aimed to provide documentation of preliminary outcomes and acceptability of pericyazine treatment in a small sample. A naturalistic case series study was conducted in which 21 patients were enrolled for a 4-week course of pericyazine (up to 8 × 2.5 mg tablets daily) and weekly medical review. Levels of cannabis use were reported and side effects with electrocardiography and blood tests were monitored. Measures of dependence severity, depression, anxiety, and insomnia were taken at baseline and follow-up utilizing validated psychometric tools. Significant reductions in cannabis use, depression, anxiety, and insomnia severity occurred across time. Pericyazine appeared to be well tolerated and easily administered in the community clinics. The results provide some preliminary evidence that low-dose short-term pericyazine may be an acceptable mode of treatment in this population. Given the open-label nature of the design, we cannot conclude that pharmacotherapy was uniquely responsible for the treatment effect. Nonetheless, low-dose pericyazine may be a potentially effective approach to the treatment of cannabis dependence, and further evaluation via a randomized placebo-controlled trial is warranted.

18,18,18,39196883,"Drugs have actions that may be classified as therapeutic effects and side effects; side effects are actions that do not contribute to therapeutic benefit. Some side effects are neutral; others, experienced as undesirable or unpleasant, are recorded as adverse effects. Some drug actions are therapeutic for some disorders and adverse for others; or therapeutic during acute illness and adverse during maintenance treatment. As an example, anticholinergic action may be adverse when a tricyclic antidepressant is used to treat depression but therapeutic when the drug is used to treat irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea. In clinical practice, side or adverse effects of a drug may be leveraged to manage troublesome symptoms. As an example, the sedative effect of a low dose of trazodone may be useful for some patients with insomnia. With this background, studies have examined whether the increase in appetite and weight associated with olanzapine and mirtazapine may be effective against anorexia and cachexia associated with cancer and cancer chemotherapy. The subject is important because cachexia may be present in 30%-50% of patients with cancer (with higher prevalence in patients with more advanced cancer) and because the presence of cachexia is associated with a higher risk of disease progression and mortality. Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have examined pharmacologic interventions such as progestins, corticosteroids, anamorelin, and medical cannabis for cancer related cachexia; most results have been disappointing. A recent RCT found that olanzapine (2.5 mg/d for 12 weeks) improved appetite, weight, other nutritional parameters, and quality of life in patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer treated with chemotherapy. Another RCT, however, found that mirtazapine (30 mg/d for 8 weeks) brought no nutritional or anthropometric gain in patients with cancer and anorexia. It is concluded that olanzapine but not mirtazapine merits further investigation in patients with cancer who have anorexia and cachexia.

In this study we carried out the most comprehensive investigation so far of the demographic, economic, social and clinical correlates of self-reported paranoia in the general population. Data weighted to be nationally representative were analysed from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey in England (APMS 2007; n=7281). The prevalence of paranoid thinking in the previous year ranged from 18.6% reporting that people were against them, to 1.8% reporting potential plots to cause them serious harm. At all levels, paranoia was associated with youth, lower intellectual functioning, being single, poverty, poor physical health, poor social functioning, less perceived social support, stress at work, less social cohesion, less calmness, less happiness, suicidal ideation, a great range of other psychiatric symptoms (including anxiety, worry, phobias, post-traumatic stress and insomnia), cannabis use, problem drinking and increased use of treatment and services. Overall, the results indicate that paranoia has the widest of implications for health, emotional well-being, social functioning and social inclusion.

We investigated the degree of genetic overlap between smoking behaviours and psychiatric traits and disorders, and whether genetic associations exist beyond genetic influences shared with confounding variables (cannabis and alcohol use, risk-taking and insomnia). Second, we investigated the presence of causal associations between smoking initiation and psychiatric traits and disorders. We found significant genetic correlations between smoking and psychiatric disorders and adult psychotic experiences. When genetic influences on known covariates were controlled for, genetic associations between most smoking behaviours and schizophrenia and depression endured (but not with bipolar disorder or most psychotic experiences). Mendelian randomization results supported a causal role of smoking initiation on psychiatric disorders and adolescent cognitive and negative psychotic experiences, although not consistently across all sensitivity analyses. In conclusion, smoking and psychiatric disorders share genetic influences that cannot be attributed to covariates such as risk-taking, insomnia or other substance use. As such, there may be some common genetic pathways underlying smoking and psychiatric disorders. In addition, smoking may play a causal role in vulnerability for mental illness.

22,22,22,26285109,"Sleep disturbance is a hallmark feature of cannabis withdrawal. In this study we explored the effects of lithium treatment supplemented with nitrazepam on objective and subjective measures of sleep quality during inpatient cannabis withdrawal. Treatment-seeking cannabis-dependent adults (n = 38) were admitted for 8 days to an inpatient withdrawal unit and randomized to either oral lithium (500 mg) or placebo, twice daily in a double-blind RCT. Restricted nitrazepam (10 mg) was available on demand (in response to poor sleep) on any 3 of the 7 nights. Dependent outcome measures for analysis included repeated daily objective actigraphy and subjective sleep measures throughout the 8 day detox, subjective cannabis withdrawal ratings, and detoxification completion rates. Based on actigraphy, lithium resulted in less fragmented sleep compared to placebo (p = 0.04), but no other objective measures were improved by lithium. Of the subjective measures, only nightmares were suppressed by lithium (p = 0.04). Lithium did not have a significant impact on the use of nitrazepam. Sleep bout length (p < 0.0001), sleep efficiency (p < 0.0001), and sleep fragmentation (p = 0.05) were improved on nights in which nitrazepam was used. In contrast, only night sweats improved with nitrazepam from the subjective measures (p = 0.04). A Cox regression with daily repeated measures of sleep efficiency averaged across all people in the study a predictor suggests that a one-unit increase in sleep efficiency (the ratio of total sleep time to the total time in bed expressed as a percentage) resulted in a 14.6% increase in retention in treatment (p = 0.008, Exp(B) = 0.854, 95% CI = 0.759-0.960). None of the other sleep measures, nor use of lithium or nitrazepam were significantly associated with retention in treatment. Lithium seems to have only limited efficacy on sleep disturbance in cannabis withdrawal. However the nitrazepam improved several actigraphy measures of sleep disturbance, warranting further investigation. Discord between objective and subjective sleep indices suggest caution in evaluating treatment interventions with self-report sleep data only.

In this study, we compared clinical and subclinical psychopathological symptoms associated with SC use and natural cannabis (NC) use. A convenience sample of 367 NC and SC users was recruited online, including four validated psychometric questionnaires: The Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Altman Mania Scale (Altman), and Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). The two groups were compared with analysis of variance (ANOVA) and covariance (ANCOVA), chi The SC user group did not differ in age from the NC user group (27.7 years), but contained less females (21% and 30%, respectively). SC users scored higher than NC users on all used psychometric measures, indicating a higher likelihood of drug abuse, sleep problems, (hypo)manic symptoms, and the nine dimensions comprising the BSI, somatization, obsessive-compulsive behavior, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism. Odds ratios (95% CI) for the SC user group vs NC user group were, respectively, drug dependence 3.56 (1.77-7.16), (severe) insomnia 5.01 (2.10-11.92), (hypo-)mania 5.18 (2.04-13.14), and BSI psychopathology 5.21 (2.96-9.17).

This employed a cross-sectional design. The sample consisted of 162 adults (mean age = 42.05 years, SD = 14.8; 22% female), with current recommendations from a doctor for medical cannabis, recruited from a medical cannabis dispensary. Consistent with previous research, individuals with heightened depression symptoms had greater problematic cannabis use. In addition, perceived sleep quality moderated this relation, such that depression symptoms differentially related to problematic cannabis use as a function of perceived quality of sleep (ΔR(2) = .03, p = .02). Participants with higher levels of depression and good perceived sleep quality had the greatest rates of problematic cannabis use. These results suggest that individuals with heightened depression may have higher rates of problematic cannabis use, in part, because of the beneficial effects of cannabis in terms of perceived sleep quality.

Approximately two-thirds of the sample (67.8%) reported at least one moderate or severe withdrawal symptom. The most commonly observed symptom was sleep difficulties (50.3%), followed by anxiety (27.8%), irritability (26.7%), and appetite disturbance (25.2%). Patients with low mental functioning had significantly higher rates of withdrawal symptom endorsement than patients with high mental functioning. However, no association was observed between physical functioning and withdrawal symptom endorsement. These patterns of association were consistent in multivariate analyses that controlled for other potentially confounding variables.

This double blind, placebo controlled, phase III study had a screening period, a 2 week dose titration phase from 5 mg to a maximum of 25 mg of tetrahydrocannabinol daily and a 10 week maintenance phase. The primary outcome measure was a category rating scale (CRS) measuring patient reported change in muscle stiffness from baseline. Further CRSs assessed body pain, spasms and sleep quality. Three validated MS specific patient reported outcome measures assessed aspects of spasticity, physical and psychological impact, and walking ability. The rate of relief from muscle stiffness after 12 weeks was almost twice as high with CE than with placebo (29.4% vs. 15.7%; OR 2.26; 95% CI 1.24 to 4.13; p=0.004, one sided). Similar results were found after 4 weeks and 8 weeks, and also for all further CRSs. Results from the MS scales supported these findings. The study met its primary objective to demonstrate the superiority of CE over placebo in the treatment of muscle stiffness in MS. This was supported by results for secondary efficacy variables.

There is an increasing prescription for complementary and alternative medicines, such as medical cannabis (MC). Knowledge and attitudes of Italian medical oncologists and palliative care physicians toward medical cannabis in cancer care remain unknown. We conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate the knowledge and attitude toward MC prescription among cancer care professionals in Italy. All invited participants received an email with the electronic questionnaire accessible through a direct link. Among the 2616 members who received the invitation, 475 replied to the questionnaire and were considered for the survey analysis. The most prescribed formulations among those available in Italy were cannabis FM2. The most frequent clinical indications for the use of MC were pain, gastrointestinal, and mood disorders. Only 9 responders reported MC-related side effects like anxiety insomnia and muscle spasms. The question regarding the normative references for MC prescription and use in Italy had conflicting results: only 14% indicated the exact legislative reference. Our study highlights a significant discrepancy between personal attitudes, prescription levels, and actual knowledge on MC.

The present study examined the sleep characteristics of alcohol and cannabis users recruited from the wider community. Two hundred forty-eight self-identified alcohol and/or cannabis users (131 women and 117 men) with a mean age of 26.41 years completed an online study that was advertised via online forums, print media and flyers. As part of the study, participants completed validated sleep scales assessing sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) in addition to validated drug scales assessing alcohol (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) and cannabis (Marijuana Screening Inventory) use. Problems with sleep quality were more commonly reported than were complaints of excessive daytime sleepiness. Clinically significant poor sleep quality was associated with comorbid problem alcohol and cannabis use. Women reporting problem alcohol and cannabis use had poorer sleep outcomes than men. Social drug users who report risky alcohol and cannabis use also report poor sleep. Poor sleep quality likely exacerbates any drug-associated problems in non-clinical populations.

The classical presentation is a sudden chest or back pain described as sharp or ripping in quality. We present a 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension, Liddle's syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic cannabis use for insomnia who arrived at a non-PCI hospital complaining of severe retrosternal chest pain lasting several hours in evolution that started upon masturbation. The pain was ripping in character, starting retrosternally and radiating to his neck and back. After evidence of rising troponin values, he was initially diagnosed with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), managed with dual antiplatelet therapy with full anticoagulation, and subsequently transferred to our institution for further care. Shortly after his arrival at our hospital, he suddenly deteriorated with recurrent chest pain and hypotension, which triggered an emergent bedside echocardiogram evaluation. This revealed a hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion, moderate to severe aortic valve regurgitation (AR), and an intimal flap visualized on the ascending and descending aorta, suggestive of an extensive AD. A computerized tomographic angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of a Stanford type A AD that required an emergent surgical pericardiotomy, ascending aorta with partial arch replacement, and aortic valve repair. Often, AD may mimic an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or even present with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The appropriate diagnostic imaging evaluation prior to the initiation of anticoagulation therapy should be done in patients with higher-risk clinical criteria for AD to reduce adverse treatment outcomes. The use of a simple three-step diagnostic algorithm for acute aortic syndromes (AAS) may decrease diagnostic delays, misdiagnosis, and inappropriate therapies.

Recent research has connected the role of microglial cells with psychiatric disorders such as substance abuse. The aim was to show the effect of two major components of cannabis on circadian genes regulation in microglial cells. In BV-2 microglial cells, cannabidiol (CBD) induces a deregulation of circadian genes with (P-value = 0.039) or without (P-value = 0.0015) lipopolisaccharides stimulation. CBD up regulated Arntl (P = 9.72E-5) and down regulated Clock (P = 0.0034) in BV-2 cells. Temporal expression of Arntl (light and dark P = 0.0054) and Clock (light and dark P = 0.047) was confirmed to have 24 hours light and dark rhythmic regulation in dissected suprachiasmatic nucleus as well as of Cb1 cannabinoid receptor (light and dark P = 0.019).

The relationship between poor sleep quality and the use of alcohol and illicit substances among university students has not been studied. Our study aimed to determine these relationships and the factors influencing the risk of poor sleep in students from health sciences degrees which are the future healthcare providers. A cross-sectional study performed in European university students (n = 676). Sleep quality was assessed by measuring insomnia symptoms with the Athens insomnia scale (AIS). The CRAFFT screening test and AUDIT test were used to measure the use of substances of abuse. Insomnia symptoms were highly prevalent (40.2%) and more common among the youngest students (p = 0.012), who had been studying at the university for less time (p = 0.018), and had high levels of illicit drug use (p = 0.037). Good sleep quality represented a significant protective factor for problematic drug use, with an OR of 0.8 (CI95%: 0.76-0.99). In contrast, the category ""not having a job"" represents risk 1.2 times higher (CI95%: 1.025-1.557) for problematic drug use. The CRAFFT score significantly predicted higher insomnia symptoms (AIS ≥ 6), yielding an OR of 1.2 (CI95%:1.10-1.32, p < 0.001). Poor sleep quality is common in university students. There is an inverse association between higher insomnia symptoms and illicit drug abuse being a good sleep qualitya protective factor against problematic use of illicit drugs.

This study was conducted with orthopaedic trauma patients in a level 1 trauma center. A convergent mixed-methods design was used. Data on pain experience, pain management strategies used and AEs were collected with self-administered questionnaires at hospital discharge (T1) and at 3 months after injury (T2). Patients' preferences about the pain management strategies used, the required support and AEs were further examined through semi-structured individual interviews at the same time measures. Descriptive statistics and thematic analyses were performed. Seventy-one patients were recruited and 30 individual interviews were undertaken. Pharmacological pain management strategies used at T1 and T2 were mainly opioids (95.8%; 20.8%) and acetaminophen (91.5%; 37.5%). The most frequently applied non-pharmacological strategies were sleep (95.6%) and physical positioning (89.7%) at T1 and massage (46.3%) and relaxation (32.5%) at T2. Findings from quantitative and qualitative analyses highlighted that non-pharmacological strategies, such as comfort, massage, distraction, and physical therapy, were perceived as the most effective by participants. Most common AEs related to opioids were dry mouth (78.8%) and fatigue (66.1%) at T1 and insomnia (30.0%) and fatigue (20.0%) at T2.

53,53,53,39474237,"Medical cannabis (MC) is available upon certification for one of several qualifying conditions in Florida, USA. Previous studies suggested that some people seek cannabis for medical conditions/symptoms beyond those legally permitted. However, data remain limited on patient motives for seeking MC and their experiences around its impact on their health. We aimed to compare reported qualifying conditions for MC certification with the most frequently self-reported reasons for using MC while assessing the alignment between the two and understanding the perceived impacts of MC on self-reported conditions and symptoms. We conducted a cross-sectional study using survey data from the Medical Marijuana and Me (M A total of 632 participants completed the survey, of whom 396 (62.66%) were female and 471 (74.53%) were non-Hispanic white. The median (IQR) age was 45 (35, 58). The most frequently reported qualifying conditions were post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) ( Qualifying conditions and self-reported reasons for using MC aligned for most respondents. Yet, a notable proportion of respondents sought MC for broader treatment effects beyond those delineated by the officially recognized qualifying conditions in Florida, USA. Most patients perceived positive effects, including those with limited available evidence on efficacy. In Florida, USA, medical cannabis (MC) is accessible for certified individuals with specific health conditions. Previous research found that many people seek MC for conditions beyond the officially approved ones. We aimed to understand the alignment between qualifying conditions per statute, the reasons patients reported for using MC, and the perceived impacts on health conditions and symptoms. In a 2022 survey of 632 MC users, the top reported qualifying conditions were post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), medical condition comparable to listed conditions, and chronic nonmalignant pain. The top ten self-reported reasons for using MC were anxiety, chronic pain, depression, PTSD, headaches/migraine, fibromyalgia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, high blood pressure, and cancer. Many patients reported multiple reasons for MC use, including typically one reason that matched their reported qualifying condition. Most respondents noted improvements in anxiety, depression, chronic pain, insomnia, PTSD, headaches/migraine, ADHD, bipolar disorder, and fibromyalgia. These findings suggest that in addition to the officially recognized qualifying conditions, people often use MC for a broader range of conditions and symptoms, some of which are not included in the current statute and/or without evidence of efficacy.

The current study examined daily-level associations between perceived sleep health and SAM use, relative to non-substance-use days and alcohol- or marijuana-only days. We also estimated linear associations between alcohol/marijuana use and perceived sleep health and explored whether effects were moderated by combined use of alcohol and marijuana. A community sample of SAM-using young adults (N = 409; Mage = 21.61, SD = 2.17; 50.9% female; 48.2% White; 48.9% college students) completed twice-daily surveys for five 14-day sampling bursts. Daily measurements assessed substance use and perceived sleep health in terms of subjective sleep quality, negative impact of sleep on functioning, and symptoms of insomnia. Multilevel models indicated that, relative to non-substance-use days, participants reported poorer perceived sleep health on alcohol-only days, better perceived sleep health on marijuana-only days, and mixed evidence regarding SAM use (i.e. fewer perceived symptoms of insomnia, but poorer perceived next day functioning attributed to sleep). Daily-level estimates showed increased alcohol use was associated with poorer perceived sleep health, while stronger effects from marijuana were associated with better perceived sleep health. Across all indices of sleep health, only one linear association was moderated by combined use: The adverse association between alcohol and next day functioning was weaker on days alcohol was combined with marijuana. Findings provide additional evidence for daily-level effects of alcohol and marijuana use on perceived sleep health and address an important literature gap regarding potential adverse effects of SAM use.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize marijuana use of older adults in a state in which it is legal for medical and recreational use. Marijuana was used for several common geriatric conditions, and respondents reported few side effects.

60,60,60,37279315,"Introduction Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is associated with many unhealthy behaviors. Psychoactive substance (alcohol and drugs) use is present in 78% of adults with BPD. Moreover, a poor sleep seems linked to the clinical profile of adults with BPD. Finally, some physical comorbid disorders like obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes are linked to physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors. However, to this day no study analyzed these behaviors in French-speaking individuals with BPD. Objectives This study's goal is to document health behaviors in adults with BPD in Canada and in France. Method This cross-sectional study consists of an online survey on the LimeSurvey platform including validated questionnaires distributed in France and Canada. To measure physical activity, we used the ""Global Physical Activity Questionnaire."" Insomnia was measured with the ""Insomnia Severity Index."" Substance use was measured with the ""Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Test."" Descriptive statistics (N,% and mean) are used to describe previously mentioned health behaviors. Five regression models have been realized to find the main associated variables (age, perceived social status, education level, household income, body mass index, emotional regulation difficulties, BPD symptoms, depression level, previous suicide attempts and psychotropic medication use) to health behaviors. Results A total of 167 participants (92 Canadians, 75 French; 146 women, 21 men) filled out the online survey. In this sample, 38% of Canadians and 28% of French reported doing less than 150 minutes of physical activity weekly. Insomnia affected 42% of Canadians and 49% of French. Tobacco use disorder affected 50% of Canadians and 60% of French. Alcohol use disorder affected 36% of Canadians and 53% of French. Cannabis use disorder affected 36% of Canadians and 38% of French. All tested variables were linked to physical activity (R² = 0.09). Insomnia was only linked with BPD symptoms (R² = 0.24). Tobacco use disorder was linked to social status and alcohol use disorder (R² = 0.13). Alcohol use disorder was linked to social status, body mass index, tobacco use disorder, and depression (R² = 0.16). Finally, cannabis use disorder was linked to age, body mass index, tobacco use disorder, depression, and past suicide attempts (R² = 0.26). Conclusion These results are essential to design health prevention interventions in French-speaking adults with BPD in Canada and in France. They help identify the main factors associated with these health behaviors.

In this study, we examined the content of marijuana advertising on Weedmaps, a popular website that markets marijuana retailers online. A total of 146 recreational marijuana retailers in Colorado and Washington were examined on Weedmaps. We studied the age verification practices made in retailers' own websites, the presence of health claims they made about marijuana on Weedmaps, and the characteristics of followers of Weedmaps on social media sites. Many retailers had no security measure to determine age (41 % in Colorado, 35 % in Washington). Approximately 61 % of retailers in Colorado and 44 % in Washington made health claims about the benefits of marijuana, including anxiety reduction, treatment of depression, insomnia, and pain/inflammation. Inferred demographic characteristics of followers of Weedmaps on Twitter and Instagram revealed that over 60 % were male and nearly 70 % or more were age 20-29 years old, yet some (15-18 %) were under the age of 20. Our findings indicate that marijuana retailers have a visible presence on the Internet. Potential customers might be enticed by retailers who tout health claims about marijuana use. It may also be appealing for a younger demographic to overlook age restrictions and engage with marijuana retailers via social media.

This retrospective study of 104 male inmates with serious mental illness prescribed nabilone analyzes the indications, efficacy, and safety of its use. Medications discontinued with the initiation of nabilone were also reviewed. The results showed nabilone targeting a mean of 3.5 indications per patient, thus likely reducing polypharmacy risk.

68,68,68,35754104,"Sleep problems and substance use frequently co-occur. While substance use can result in specific sleep deficits, genetic pleiotropy could explain part of the relationship between sleep and substance use and use disorders. Here we use the largest publicly available genome-wide summary statistics of substance use behaviours (N = 79,729-632,802) and sleep/activity phenotypes to date (N = 85,502-449,734) to (1) assess the genetic overlap between substance use behaviours and both sleep and circadian-related activity measures, (2) estimate clusters from genetic correlations and (3) test processes of causality versus genetic pleiotropy. We found 31 genetic correlations between substance use and sleep/activity after Bonferroni correction. These patterns of overlap were represented by two genetic clusters: (1) tobacco use severity (age of first regular tobacco use and smoking cessation) and sleep health (sleep duration, sleep efficiency and chronotype) and (2) substance consumption/problematic use (drinks per day and cigarettes per day, cannabis use disorder, opioid use disorder and problematic alcohol use) and sleep problems (insomnia, self-reported short sleep duration, increased number of sleep episodes, increased sleep duration variability and diurnal inactivity) and measures of circadian-related activity (L5, M10 and sleep midpoint). Latent causal variable analyses determined that horizontal pleiotropy (rather than genetic causality) underlies a majority of the associations between substance use and sleep/circadian related measures, except one plausible genetically causal relationship for opioid use disorder on self-reported long sleep duration.

69,69,69,35986953,"Transgender and nonbinary (TGNB) individuals are a health disparity population at high risk for sleep disturbance (e.g., insomnia). Recent evidence suggests minority stress (e.g., discrimination) is associated with sleep disturbance in TGNB adults. However, investigators have yet to identify factors that might explain this relationship. In this study, we investigated the role of problematic drug use (PDU) in the relationship between discrimination and sleep disturbance in TGNB individuals. The study sample included 194 TGNB participants from Wave 5 (2021) of Project AFFIRM, a multi-site longitudinal study of transgender health. Discrimination, PDU, and sleep disturbance were measured using the Everyday Discrimination Scale, Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT), and PROMIS Sleep Disturbance measures, respectively. Individuals were classified as having PDU using established DUDIT criteria that were applied based on sex assigned at birth. Regression analyses were used to estimate the associations of study variables, and subsequently, mediation analysis was used to determine whether PDU partially mediated the association between discrimination and sleep disturbance. Nearly half of participants reported PDU, of which 83.2% reported cannabis use. Higher levels of discrimination were associated with worse self-reported sleep disturbance scores. Additionally, participants with greater discrimination were more likely to have PDU. Surprisingly, participants with PDU had lower sleep disturbance scores. Our cross-sectional findings suggest that PDU partially suppressed the association between discrimination and sleep disturbance in TGNB people. Efforts to address PDU in TGNB adults may consider assessing sleep disturbance as a motivating factor for drug use and the potential role of discrimination in perpetuating PDU.

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of nabilone, a synthetic cannabinoid, on sleep disturbance in fibromyalgia (FM), a disease characterized by widespread chronic pain and insomnia. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, active-control, equivalency crossover trial to compare nabilone (0.5-1.0 mg before bedtime) to amitriptyline (10-20 mg before bedtime) in patients with FM with chronic insomnia. Subjects received each drug for 2 wk with a 2-wk washout period. The primary outcome was sleep quality, measured by the Insomnia Severity Index and the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes included pain, mood, quality of life, and adverse events (AEs). Thirty-one subjects were enrolled and 29 completed the trial (26 women, mean age 49.5 yr). Although sleep was improved by both amitriptyline and nabilone, nabilone was superior to amitriptyline (Insomnia Severity Index difference = 3.2; 95% confidence interval = 1.2-5.3). Nabilone was marginally better on the restfulness (Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire difference = 0.5 [0.0-1.0]) but not on wakefulness (difference = 0.3 [-0.2 to 0.8]). No effects on pain, mood, or quality of life were observed. AEs were mostly mild to moderate and were more frequent with nabilone. The most common AEs for nabilone were dizziness, nausea, and dry mouth. Nabilone is effective in improving sleep in patients with FM and is well tolerated. Low-dose nabilone given once daily at bedtime may be considered as an alternative to amitriptyline. Longer trials are needed to determine the duration of effect and to characterize long-term safety.

72,72,72,35775024,"Prescribed cannabinoids are now legal in the UK and increasingly being used for a variety of conditions, with one of the most frequent conditions being chronic pain. This paper describes the characteristics of individuals seeking prescribed cannabinoids for the treatment of chronic pain in Project Twenty 21, a UK based real world data registry of prescribed cannabis patients. By 1st November 2021 data were available for 1,782 people who had sought treatment with medical cannabis as part of Project Twenty 21. The most common diagnosis among this cohort was chronic pain with 949 (53.5%) of the cohort reporting a primary condition related to chronic pain. Medical and self-report data on the characteristics of these patients, their health status and type/s of cannabinoid/s prescribed are summarized in this report. Of the 949 people reporting chronic pain as a primary condition 54.7% were male and their average age was 42.0 years (range = 18-84). Patients reported a low quality of life and high levels of comorbidity: people reported an average of 4.6 comorbid conditions with the most common comorbid conditions including anxiety, depression, insomnia and stress. A range of cannabinoid products were prescribed with the most common products being classified as high THC flower (48.5%). The majority of patients also reported using at least one other prescribed medication (68.7%). Consistent with findings in other national and international databases, chronic pain was the most common primary condition in this real world study of prescribed cannabinoids. There was considerable variation in the types of chronic pain, comorbid pathology and in the characteristics of products being prescribed to treat these conditions. Together, this evidence supports the utility of real world evidence, as opposed to clinical trial approaches to studying the potential benefits of prescribed cannabinoids in treating chronic pain.

Given the anecdotal observations that several patients have reported use of CBD for spine-related pain, this study was designed to characterize CBD consumption patterns and perceived effects in patients with spine-related complaints. The study design was a cross-sectional survey. Over a 4-week period, an anonymous paper survey was administered to all patients presenting for evaluation by 1 of 9 spine surgeons at a single institution. Surveys were given upon registration for the office visit and collected by the office manager or nurse before evaluation by the surgeon. Patients were included regardless of surgical status (ie, preoperative, postoperative, or nonoperative) or region of pathology (lumbar, thoracic, or cervical). The survey consisted of multiple-choice questions on patient patterns of CBD use. Out of 300 surveys, 214 (71%) were completed. CBD use for spine-related pain was reported by 54 (25.2%) patients. CBD was initially used for potential relief of back pain (66.7%), neck pain (37.0%), leg pain (35.2%), and/or arm pain (9.3%). Users also sought improvements in insomnia (25.9%) and mood (18.5%). Oil was the most popular formulation (64.8%). CBD was most often consumed 2-5 times (40.7%) or 6-10 times (31.5%) per week. The most common source of initial recommendation for CBD was friends or family (75.9%). Reported benefits were pain relief (46.3%), improved sleep (33.3%), and reduced anxiety (20.4%); however, 24.1% of patients reported no benefit from CBD use. The most reported side effect was fatigue (7.4%). Most users (63.0%) would recommend CBD to a friend for pain relief. CBD is already used by many patients, and further high-quality research on this supplement is essential. 4. CBD is a commonly used by spine patients as an off label treatment.

74,74,74,32758411,"Sleep disruption and relaxation are commonly cited reasons for marijuana use. Job loss is a significant stressor associated with high risk for sleep disruption. Little is known about marijuana use in relation to other intervention choices for sleep/relaxation in individuals who have experienced recent, involuntary job loss. This study compared self-reported use of marijuana to evidence-based treatments (EBT) for sleep/relaxation using data from the ongoing Assessing Daily Activity Patterns through Occupational Transitions (ADAPT) study. Participants were 1639 completers of the ADAPT phone screen interview. EBT was defined as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, and benzodiazepines. Marijuana was the most common treatment for sleep/relaxation. Two-sample tests of proportions revealed that prevalence of use of marijuana was comparable to the entire class of EBTs (~5%). Only 2 (0.1%) participants reported receiving CBT-I, the first-line treatment for insomnia disorder, as per the American College of Physicians Clinical Practice Guidelines. Rates of dose increase following job-loss were comparable between users of marijuana and EBTs (Z = 0.56, p = .58). Multiple logistic regression models demonstrated that male sex (OR = 0.28, 95%CI = 0.14-0.57) and substance abuse (OR = 7.68, 95%CI = 2.89-20.43) were significantly associated with increased likelihood of marijuana use. Individuals who have recently experienced involuntary job loss may be more likely to use marijuana than any one EBT for sleep/relaxation and as likely to increase their treatment dose. Dissemination of evidence-based sleep health interventions is needed in unemployed populations to prevent habitual patterns resulting in the long-term use of marijuana for sleep/relaxation.

75,75,75,24281562,"Cannabidiol (CBD), a major phytocannabinoid constituent of cannabis, is attracting growing attention in medicine for its anxiolytic, antipsychotic, antiemetic and anti-inflammatory properties. However, up to this point, a comprehensive literature review of the effects of CBD in humans is lacking. The aim of the present systematic review is to examine the randomized and crossover studies that administered CBD to healthy controls and to clinical patients. A systematic search was performed in the electronic databases PubMed and EMBASE using the key word ""cannabidiol"". Both monotherapy and combination studies (e.g., CBD + ∆9-THC) were included. A total of 34 studies were identified: 16 of these were experimental studies, conducted in healthy subjects, and 18 were conducted in clinical populations, including multiple sclerosis (six studies), schizophrenia and bipolar mania (four studies), social anxiety disorder (two studies), neuropathic and cancer pain (two studies), cancer anorexia (one study), Huntington's disease (one study), insomnia (one study), and epilepsy (one study). Experimental studies indicate that a high-dose of inhaled/intravenous CBD is required to inhibit the effects of a lower dose of ∆9-THC. Moreover, some experimental and clinical studies suggest that oral/oromucosal CBD may prolong and/or intensify ∆9-THC-induced effects, whereas others suggest that it may inhibit ∆9-THC-induced effects. Finally, preliminary clinical trials suggest that high-dose oral CBD (150-600 mg/d) may exert a therapeutic effect for social anxiety disorder, insomnia and epilepsy, but also that it may cause mental sedation. Potential pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic explanations for these results are discussed.

Items included questions about current/recent cannabinoid use, reasons for use, preferred THC/CBD formulations, and perceived benefits/side effects. PROMIS short-forms assessed symptom severity. Pain phenotype was assessed with the painDETECT questionnaire and FMSurvey Criteria Questionnaires. Among n = 1,027 respondents, 42% endorsed recent cannabinoid use, of which 18% endorsed healthcare provider guidance regarding use. PROMIS scores (except cognitive abilities), and pain centralization and neuropathic pain scores, were higher among recent/current users (each p < 0.0001). Sleep and pain were the most frequently reported reasons for use. Benefit from cannabinoids for sleep and pain were strongly correlated (r = 0.65, p < 0.0001). For those who expressed a preference for specific THC/CBD ratios, CBD-predominant formulations were favored. Cannabinoid use is common in PwMS, despite a paucity of provider guidance.

77,77,77,29764217,"Individuals with an evening chronotype are at increased risk of experiencing emotional problems, including depressive symptoms. However, the mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear. The present study aimed to determine whether poor sleep quality, substance use and cognitive emotion regulation difficulties - which have been implicated in the etiology of depression - mediate the relationship between chronotype and depressive symptoms in a student sample, which was assessed cross-sectionally and after 1 year. A total of 742 Dutch students (75% women, mean age 21.4 ± 2.9 years) completed the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, a questionnaire assessing alcohol, caffeine, tobacco and cannabis use, the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and the Behavioral Inhibition/Activation Scale. A subsample (n = 115) was assessed 1 year later with the same questionnaires. Cross-sectional analyses showed that evening chronotype was associated with more depressive symptoms, adjusted for age and gender (β = -0.082, p = 0.028). The relationship between eveningness and depressive symptoms was mediated by sleep quality, alcohol consumption and the cognitive emotion regulation strategies of self-blame and positive reappraisal. In longitudinal analyses, eveningness at baseline predicted more depressive symptoms at follow-up, adjusted for age and gender (β = -0.29, p = 0.002); after additional adjustment for baseline depressive symptoms, chronotype remained a significant predictor of depressive symptoms at T2 (β = -0.16, t = -2.01, p = 0.047). Only poor sleep quality at follow-up was a significant mediator of this relationship. Even though the effect is small in terms of explained variance, eveningness is related to depressive symptoms and this relationship is mediated by poor sleep quality, also in a prospective design. Self-blame and reduced positive reappraisal are correlated with eveningness. Further research is needed to assess the efficacy of chronotherapeutic interventions for the prevention of depression, in addition to sleep education and cognitive approaches.

This study assessed the impact of sleep difficulty on single and repeated school and out-of-school injuries and the confounding role of socioeconomic factors and school, behaviour and health-related difficulties among adolescents. The study population included 1559 middle-school adolescents from north-eastern France (mean age 13.5, SD 1.3) who completed at the end of school year a self-administered questionnaire to gather school and out-of-school injuries during the school year, and to assess sleep difficulty and previous injury risk factors which were socioeconomic factors (family structure, parents' education, father's occupation, and family income), school performance, obesity, alcohol/tobacco/cannabis/hard drugs use, health status, psychological health, and involvement-in-violence. For sleep difficulty and behaviour and health-related difficulties their first occurring over adolescent's life course was gathered. Multinomial logistic regression models were used retaining only sleep difficulty and other risk factors which had started before the school year (thus before the injuries studied). School and out-of-school injuries and sleep difficulty were frequent. The adolescents with sleep difficulty without medical treatment had a higher risk of single school and out-of-school injuries (gender-age-adjusted odds ratio gaOR 1.86 and 1.76, respectively) and a much higher risk of repeated school and out-of-school injuries (≥2 injuries; gaOR 2.43 and 3.73, respectively). The adolescents with persistent sleep difficulty despite a medical treatment also had a higher risk of single school and out-of-school injury (gaOR 2.31 and 1.78, respectively), and a much higher risk of repeated school and out-of-school injuries (gaOR 4.92 and 4.36, respectively). Socioeconomic factors had a moderate contribution (<27%) while school, behaviour and health-related difficulties had a high contribution (reaching 71%) to the association between sleep difficulty and single/repeated injuries. The role of these factors differed between single/repeated school/out-of-school injuries.

Adjusted logistic models show females had lower odds than males of using CBD for general health and wellbeing [OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.30-0.72] and post-workout muscle-soreness [OR 0.46, 95%CI 0.24-0.91] but had higher odds of using CBD for self-perceived anxiety [OR 1.60, 95% CI 0.02-2.49] and insomnia [OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.13-3.11]. Older individuals had lower odds of using CBD for general health and wellbeing, stress, post-workout sore muscles, anxiety, skin conditions, focusing, and sleep but had higher odds of using CBD for pain. Respondents reported that CBD use was effective for stress, sleep problems, and anxiety in those who used the drug for those conditions. This survey indicated that CBD users take the drug to manage self-perceived anxiety, stress, sleep, and other symptoms, often in low doses, and these patterns vary by demographic characteristics. Further research is required to understand how low doses, representative of the general user, might impact mental health symptoms like stress, anxiety, and sleep problems.

87,87,87,29808787,"Non-psychotic affective symptoms are important components of psychotic syndromes. They are frequent and are now thought to influence the emergence of paranoia and hallucinations. Evidence supporting this model of psychosis comes from recent cross-fertilising epidemiological and intervention studies. Epidemiological studies identify plausible targets for intervention but must be interpreted cautiously. Nevertheless, causal inference can be strengthened substantially using modern statistical methods. Directed Acyclic Graphs were used in a dynamic Bayesian network approach to learn the overall dependence structure of chosen variables. DAG-based inference identifies the most likely directional links between multiple variables, thereby locating them in a putative causal cascade. We used initial and 18-month follow-up data from the 2000 British National Psychiatric Morbidity survey (N = 8580 and N = 2406). We analysed persecutory ideation, hallucinations, a range of affective symptoms and the effects of cannabis and problematic alcohol use. Worry was central to the links between symptoms, with plausible direct effects on insomnia, depressed mood and generalised anxiety, and recent cannabis use. Worry linked the other affective phenomena with paranoia. Hallucinations were connected only to worry and persecutory ideation. General anxiety, worry, sleep problems, and persecutory ideation were strongly self-predicting. Worry and persecutory ideation were connected over the 18-month interval in an apparent feedback loop. These results have implications for understanding dynamic processes in psychosis and for targeting psychological interventions. The reciprocal influence of worry and paranoia implies that treating either symptom is likely to ameliorate the other.

88,88,88,21763331,"Most recreational users of 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ""ecstasy"") also take cannabis, in part because cannabis can reduce the dysphoric symptoms of the ecstasy come-down such as agitation and insomnia. Although previous animal studies have examined the acute effects of co-administering MDMA and Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the major psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, research on chronic exposure to this drug combination is lacking. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the effects of chronic adolescent administration of both THC and MDMA on behavior and on regional serotonin transporter (SERT) binding and serotonin (5-HT) concentrations as indices of serotonergic system integrity. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four drug administration groups: (1) MDMA alone, (2) THC alone, (3) MDMA plus THC, and (4) vehicle controls. MDMA (2 × 10 mg/kg × 4 h) was administered every fifth day from postnatal day (PD) 35 to 60 to simulate intermittent recreational ecstasy use, whereas THC (5mg/kg) was given once daily over the same time period to simulate heavy cannabis use. THC unexpectedly produced a modest hyperthermic effect when administered alone, but in animals co-treated with both THC and MDMA, there was an attenuation of MDMA-induced hyperthermia on dosing days. Subsequent testing conducted after a drug washout period revealed that THC reduced MDMA-related behavioral changes in the emergence and social interaction tests of anxiety-like behavior and also blunted the MDMA-induced decrease in exploratory behavior in the hole-board test. THC additionally attenuated MDMA -induced decreases in 5-HT levels and in SERT binding in the frontal cortex, parietal cortex, and striatum, but not in the hippocampus. These results suggest that chronic co-administration of THC during adolescence can provide some protection against various adverse physiological, behavioral, and neurochemical effects produced by MDMA.

Most gender comparisons showed no evidence of differences. Nonetheless, more men than women reported mania at the onset of bipolar I disorder. Men also had higher rates of comorbid alcohol abuse/dependence, cannabis abuse/dependence, pathological gambling and conduct disorder. Men were more likely to report 'behavioural problems' and 'being unable to hold a conversation' during mania. Women reported higher rates of comorbid eating disorders, and weight change, appetite change and middle insomnia during depression.

However, current formulations suffer from low bioavailability and side effects. PTL-101, an oral formulation containing highly purified cannabidiol (CBD) embedded in seamless gelatin matrix beadlets was designed to enhance bioavailability and maintain a constant gastrointestinal transit time. This phase II, prospective study was open to pediatric patients with TRE on stable antiepileptic drugs' (AEDs) doses, who experienced ≥4 seizures within four weeks of enrolment and with a history of ≥4 AEDs failing to provide seizure control. Following a 4-week observation period, patients began a 2-week dose-titration phase (up to ≤25mg/kg or 450mg, the lower of the two), followed by a 10-week maintenance treatment period. Caregivers recorded seizure frequency, type, and severity and ranked their global impressions after 7 and 12weeks of treatment. Responders were those showing a ≥50% reduction from baseline monthly seizure frequency. Safety assessments monitored vital signs, adverse effects, physical and neurological exams, and laboratory tests. Sixteen patients (age: 9.1±3.4) enrolled in the study; 11 completed the full treatment program. The average maintenance dose was 13.6±4.2mg/kg. Patient adherence to treatment regimens was 96.3±9.9%. By the end of the treatment period, 81.9% and 73.4±24.6% (p<0.05) reductions from baseline median seizure count and monthly seizure frequency, respectively, were recorded. Responders' rate was 56%; two patients became fully seizure-free. By study end, 8 (73%) caregivers reported an improved/very much improved condition, and 9 (82%) reported reduced/very much reduced seizure severity. Most commonly reported treatment-related adverse effects were sleep disturbance/insomnia, (4 (25.0%) patients), followed by somnolence, increased seizure frequency, and restlessness (3 patients each (18.8%)).

92,92,92,28341617,"Due to easy access and low cost, Internet-delivered therapies offer an attractive alternative to improving health. Although numerous websites contain health-related information, finding evidence-based programs (as demonstrated through randomized controlled trials, RCTs) can be challenging. We sought to bridge the divide between the knowledge gained from RCTs and communication of the results by conducting a global systematic review and analyzing the availability of evidence-based Internet health programs. The study aimed to (1) discover the range of health-related topics that are addressed through Internet-delivered interventions, (2) generate a list of current websites used in the trials which demonstrate a health benefit, and (3) identify gaps in the research that may have hindered dissemination. Our focus was on Internet-delivered self-guided health interventions that did not require real-time clinical support. A systematic review of meta-analyses was conducted using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (PROSPERO Registration Number CRD42016041258). MEDLINE via Ovid, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) were searched. Inclusion criteria included (1) meta-analyses of RCTs, (2) at least one Internet-delivered intervention that measured a health-related outcome, and (3) use of at least one self-guided intervention. We excluded group-based therapies. There were no language restrictions. Of the 363 records identified through the search, 71 meta-analyses met inclusion criteria. Within the 71 meta-analyses, there were 1733 studies that contained 268 unique RCTs which tested self-help interventions. On review of the 268 studies, 21.3% (57/268) had functional websites. These included evidence-based Web programs on substance abuse (alcohol, tobacco, cannabis), mental health (depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD], phobias, panic disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder [OCD]), and on diet and physical activity. There were also evidence-based programs on insomnia, chronic pain, cardiovascular risk, and childhood health problems. These programs tended to be intensive, requiring weeks to months of engagement by the user, often including interaction, personalized and normative feedback, and self-monitoring. English was the most common language, although some were available in Spanish, French, Portuguese, Dutch, German, Norwegian, Finnish, Swedish, and Mandarin.

Recipients of BMT (n=113) and MMT (n=184), non-opioid users (n=105) and opioid users not receiving OST (n=87) completed the Patient Assessment of Constipation (PAC-SYM) and a general symptom checklist. Multivariate analysis included other potential moderators of opioid-associated symptoms. Opioid users reported a higher frequency and severity of symptoms than non-opioid users. Constipation, dry mouth, decreased appetite, sweating and fatigue were highly prevalent in the previous 30days (51-80%). Nausea, itchy skin, trouble urinating, menstrual problems, lightheadedness, blurred vision, heart racing were also common (30-50%). Non-OST opioid users had significantly higher frequency and severity than OST recipients of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, decreased appetite, sweating and itchy skin. Sweating was significantly more common in MMT than BMT. Constipation scores were higher in women, otherwise most sex differences were small.

95,95,95,17994489,"After Sweden's zero-tolerance law came into force (1 July 1999), the number of cases of driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) submitted by the police for toxicological analysis increased more than 10-fold. This prompted an in-depth investigation into the kinds of drugs used by DUID offenders, whether licit or illicit, and the frequency of their occurrence. All blood samples from DUID suspects sent by the police for toxicological analysis over a 4-year period (2001-2004) were investigated (N = 22,777 cases). Specimens of blood or urine were subjected to a broad screening analysis by immunoassay methods aimed at detecting amphetamines, cannabis, opiates, cocaine metabolite, and the major benzodiazepines. All positive results from the screening stage were verified by use of more specific analytical methods (e.g., GC-MS, LC-MS, GC-FID, and GC-NPD). Between 80 and 85% of all the blood samples contained at least one banned substance and many contained two or more therapeutic and/or illicit drugs. About 15% of cases were negative for drugs, although these frequently (30-50%) contained ethanol above the legal limit for driving in Sweden, which is 0.20 mg/g (0.02 g%). Amphetamine was the most prominent illicit drug seen in 55-60% of cases either alone or together with other drugs of abuse. Stimulants like cocaine and/or its metabolite were infrequently encountered ( approximately 1.2% of cases). The next most prevalent illicit drug was cannabis, with positive results for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in blood either alone ( approximately 4%) or together with other psychoactive substances ( approximately 20%). Morphine, codeine, and/or 6-acetyl morphine were identified in approximately 2% of all DUID suspects, being indicative of heroin abuse. The major prescription drugs identified in blood were benzodiazepines (10%) as exemplified by diazepam, alprazolam, nitrazepam, and flunitrazepam. Drugs for treating insomnia, zolpidem and zopiclone, were also identified in blood samples from DUID suspects over the study period. Other therapeutic agents were encountered in only 1-2% of all cases. The dramatic increase in DUID after the zero-tolerance law came into force probably reflects enhanced police activity and more enthusiasm to apprehend and charge individuals for this offence. Illicit drugs, particularly amphetamine and cannabis, and poly-drug use were predominant compared with use of scheduled prescription drugs. The typical DUID offender in Sweden abuses central stimulants, particularly amphetamine, and has probably done so over many years. Options for treating offenders for their underlying substance abuse problem should be considered instead of the more conventional penalties for drug-impaired driving.

There was a significant degree of comorbidity between the two subtypes of phobia, with females exhibiting a significantly greater frequency of co-occurrence of both disorders than males. The course of the two disorders was quite similar. In general, subjects with both disorders reported a more severe course. Assessment of comorbidity of phobias and other disorders revealed that agoraphobia was most significantly associated with extended neurasthenia, sexual problems, and the consumption of cannabis. On the other hand, social phobia was associated with other disorders than agoraphobia, with the strongest associations emerging for simple phobia, extended insomnia, and alcohol abuse.

97,97,97,26228404,"There is ample data suggesting that individuals with bipolar disorder more frequently suffer from disturbed sleep even when euthymic. Since sleep is a process that is crucial for affective homeostasis, disturbed sleep in healthy individuals may be a risk factor for the subsequent onset of bipolar disorder. Utilizing data from a large cohort of adolescents and young adults, this study tests the hypothesis that disturbed sleep constitutes a risk factor for the later onset of bipolar disorder. A representative community sample of N = 3021 adolescents and young adults (baseline age 14-24) was assessed using the standardized Composite International Diagnostic Interview and followed-up prospectively up to 3 times over up to 10 years. Disturbed sleep at baseline was quantified utilizing the corresponding items from the self-report inventory SCL-90-R. The compound value (insomnia-score) as an ordinal parameter for the severity of sleep disturbances was used to assess associations with the incidence of bipolar disorder among participants free of major mental disorder at baseline (N = 1943) using odds ratios (OR) from logistic regressions. Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, parental mood disorder and lifetime alcohol or cannabis dependence. Poor sleep quality significantly increased the risk for the subsequent development of bipolar disorder (OR = 1.75; p = 0.001). Regarding individual sleep items, trouble falling asleep and early morning awakening were predictive for the subsequent onset of bipolar disorder. Disturbed sleep in persons otherwise free of major mental disorders appears to confer an increased risk for the subsequent onset of bipolar disorder.

The prevalence of cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking and cannabis use was higher in boys than in girls and increased with age. Age-adjusted and multivariate analyses showed that several individual level characteristics (e.g. suicidal ideation and truancy) and family level characteristics (e.g. poor parental monitoring) were associated with substance use among students.

Data about psychosocial characteristics and risk behaviors among the schoolchildren, their parents, their siblings and their friends were collected anonymously using a self-administrated questionnaire. Results Females represented 50.5% of participants. The mean age of schoolchildren was 13.3 (±1.2) years. Lifetime illicit substances use prevalence was 2.9% [confidence interval (CI) 95%: (2.4%-3.4%)] and lifetime use of tobacco prevalence was 12.9% [CI 95%: (11.9%-13.9%)]. The age of tobacco onset was significantly younger to the age of experimentation with illicit substances. Insomnia, sadness and illicit substances use among peers were associated with illicit substances use among participants. While the most influential risk factor on illicit substances use was current cigarette smoking with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 7.2 [CI 95%: (4.5-11.2)].

We used an anonymous individual questionnaire of 4 sections: socioprofessional and sanitary characteristics of drivers, working conditions, sleeping habits, symptoms of sleep problems and favouring factors. Drivers were a population at risk: high body mass index (62.2%), toxic habits (smoking: 50.6%; alcohol: 12.9%; cannabis use: 11.7%), pathological antecedents (27%) and consumption of psychotropic drugs (4%). Their working conditions were difficult and sleeping problems were frequent. The mean daily hours of work was 10.6 ± 1.6, and mean sleep duration 6.5 ± 1.3 hr. Insomnia was 40.2%, abnormally high Epworth scores 36.3% and sleepiness when driving 53.4%. Information and education on the dangers of sleepiness while driving is necessary, as is respect for regulations on work duration.

Little information is available, however, about the factors influencing negative mood states in otherwise healthy adolescents. We aimed to describe the mood states and related factors in a sample of adolescents in the city of Barcelona (Spain). We administered a health survey to a sample of 2,727 students from public, subsidized, and private schools in Barcelona, aged approximately 14, 16, and 18 years old. To analyze the associations among moods and related factors, we used bivariate logistic regression, and fitted multivariate logistic regressions using the statistically significant variables from the bivariate analysis. To examine the possible group effects of the school on individual students, we employed multilevel analysis. The frequencies of negative mood states increased with age, with girls consistently reporting more frequent negative mood states than boys. The factors associated with negative mood states were problematic alcohol use, perceived mistreatment or abuse, antisocial behavior, intention to use or current use of illegal drugs (not including cannabis), lower perceived academic performance, and feeling isolated. Mood states are influenced by lifestyle and social factors, about which there is little local information. To plan and implement appropriate public health interventions, more complete information about the possible areas of influence is required. To complement the information obtained from studies such as the present study, longitudinal and qualitative studies would be desirable.

Participants with a history of regular cocaine use (n = 146) were administered the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV (SCID) and were asked to recall whether they experienced any of the six DSM-IV cocaine withdrawal symptoms. Results of bivariate analyses demonstrated that those meeting criteria for the cocaine withdrawal syndrome (dysphoria plus two or more other symptoms), in comparison to those who did not, were significantly (P<.001) more likely to have a lifetime history of depression. Lifetime history of depression was also more common in those individuals reporting the withdrawal symptoms of ""dysphoria"" (P<.001), ""insomnia/hypersomnia"" (P<.05), ""vivid unpleasant dreams"" (P<.01), and ""psychomotor agitation/retardation"" (P<.01). These relationships remained significant after controlling for demographics, severity of addiction, and the presence of opiate, alcohol and cannabis dependence or abuse. The withdrawal symptoms of ""fatigue"" and ""increased appetite"" were not associated with mood history. Results suggest that lifetime history of depression is strongly related to whether or not a cocaine abuser self-reports withdrawal symptoms.

108,0,0,36102608,"This review aims to summarize recent updates in the area of cannabis use for insomnia. Cannabis products have continued to become more potent, particularly in regard to delta-9- tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentration. Additionally, the use of cannabis has continued to become more accepted with less legal restrictions. The reported use of cannabis for relief of symptoms in sleep disorders appears to be increasing, however the specific effects of cannabinoids on sleep varies with cannabinoid type and concentration. Some evidence supports claims of efficacy of cannabinoids in sleep disorders such as insomnia, while other evidence is either lacking or in some cases contradictory. Regular cannabis use has been associated with withdrawal which can profoundly alter sleep. Also, clinicians should be aware of the potential effects of cannabis on the metabolism of other medications as well as the fact that cannabis use has been reported in a significant number of women in the periods before, during, and after pregnancy. Cannabis use has been becoming more and more prevalent in the setting of relaxed restrictions and easier consumer level access to cannabis and cannabis products. A relative paucity of high quality evidence regarding the effects of cannabis on sleep and the treatment of insomnia symptoms remains. The optimal type, concentration, ratio, and dosage form of cannabinoids in the treatment of insomnia symptoms needs further clarification.

Preliminary research into cannabis and insomnia suggests that cannabidiol (CBD) may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of insomnia. Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) may decrease sleep latency but could impair sleep quality long-term. Novel studies investigating cannabinoids and obstructive sleep apnea suggest that synthetic cannabinoids such as nabilone and dronabinol may have short-term benefit for sleep apnea due to their modulatory effects on serotonin-mediated apneas. CBD may hold promise for REM sleep behavior disorder and excessive daytime sleepiness, while nabilone may reduce nightmares associated with PTSD and may improve sleep among patients with chronic pain.

112,4,4,35537535,"Sleep disturbances are often cited as a primary reason for medicinal cannabis use, and there is increasing clinical interest in the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in treating sleep disorders. Burgeoning evidence suggests a role of the endocannabinoid system in regulating the circadian sleep-wake cycle, highlighting a potential avenue for developing novel therapeutics. Despite widespread use of cannabis products as sleep aids globally, robustly designed studies verifying efficacy in sleep-disordered populations are limited. Although some study outcomes have suggested cannabinoid utility in insomnia disorder and sleep apnea, most studies to date are limited by small sample sizes, lack of rigorously controlled study designs, and high risk of bias. This critical review summarizes the current evidence for the use of cannabinoids as a treatment for sleep disorders and provides an overview of endocannabinoid modulation of sleep-wake cycles, as well as the sleep-modulating effects of plant-derived cannabinoids such as delta-9-tetrahydrocannbinol, cannabidiol, and cannabinol. The review also discusses practical considerations for clinicians regarding cannabinoid formulations, routes of administration, respiratory concerns, dosing, potential side effects, drug interactions, and effects relevant to driving, tolerance, and withdrawal.

Non-motor symptoms, including pain, fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, and depression to name a few, are increasingly recognized and often just as disabling at motor symptoms. The mainstay of treatment is dopamine replacement; however, the beneficial effects tend to wane over time with disease progression, and patients often experience motor fluctuations and medication side effects. The lack of a disease-modifying intervention and the shortcomings of traditional symptomatic medications have led many patients to pursue complementary therapies to alleviate motor and non-motor symptoms associated with PD. The term complementary implies that the therapy is used along with conventional medicine and may include supplements, manipulative treatments (chiropractic, massage), exercise-based programs, and mind-body practices. As these practices become more widespread in Western medicine, there is a growing interest in evaluating their effects on a number of medical conditions, PD included.

122,14,14,30907602,"Previous research has reported that sleep problems longitudinally predict both onset of cannabis use and cannabis-related problems. However, the mediators of this relationship remain unclear. The present study examined (a) the concurrent relationship between insomnia symptoms and hazardous cannabis use and (b) examined whether use of protective behavioral strategies (PBS) for cannabis mediated this relationship among college student cannabis users. Participants were 984 (69.9% female) college students who reported consuming cannabis at least once in the past month and completed measures of insomnia, cannabis PBS, and cannabis misuse. Data were analyzed by structural equation modeling for binary and count outcomes. The significance of the mediator was evaluated using bias-corrected bootstrap confidence intervals. Insomnia symptoms were associated with an increase in the odds of hazardous cannabis use and possible cannabis use disorder. Cannabis PBS significantly mediated the relationship between insomnia symptoms and hazardous cannabis use, cannabis use disorder symptoms, and cannabis-related problems. Specifically, higher reports of insomnia symptoms were associated with lower use of cannabis PBS; which in turn was associated with an increase in the odds of hazardous cannabis use and possible cannabis use disorder, as well as a higher report of cannabis-related problems. Implications of these findings on the prevention of cannabis use problems among college students in the United States were discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).

125,17,17,37243415,"Insomnia is highly prevalent among military veterans, with rates nearly double that of civilian populations. Insomnia typically co-occurs with other psychological problems, including substance use (e.g. cannabis) and perceived stress. Much of the research focused on insomnia, stress and cannabis use explores cannabis as a sleep aid and a mechanism for stress relief. However, recent theoretical and empirical evidence suggests a dynamic interplay between insomnia, cannabis use and perceived stress, yet few longitudinal studies exist. Using a sample of 1105 post-9/11 veterans assessed over four time points across 12 months, we used latent difference score modelling to examine proportional change between insomnia, perceived stress and cannabis use. Results revealed a complex interplay between all three constructs. In particular, we show that higher prior levels of insomnia are associated with greater increases in perceived stress, and greater prior levels of stress are associated with greater increases in cannabis use. Perhaps more importantly, our results also point to cannabis use as a catalyst for greater increases in both stress and insomnia severity. Our results suggest there may be both benefits and costs of cannabis use among veterans. Specifically, for veterans who experience chronic sleep problems, perceived stress may become overwhelming, and the benefit of stress reduction from increased cannabis use may come at the cost of increasing insomnia symptomology.

This pragmatic, single-site, single-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted in the Greater Boston area from July 1, 2017, to July 31, 2020. Participants were adults aged 18 to 65 years with a chief concern of pain, insomnia, or anxiety or depressive symptoms. Participants were randomized 2:1 to either the immediate card acquisition group (n = 105) or the delayed card acquisition group (n = 81). Randomization was stratified by chief concern, age, and sex. The statistical analysis followed an evaluable population approach. The immediate card acquisition group was allowed to obtain a medical marijuana card immediately after randomization. The delayed card acquisition group was asked to wait 12 weeks before obtaining a medical marijuana card. All participants could choose cannabis products from a dispensary, the dose, and the frequency of use. Participants could continue their usual medical or psychiatric care. Primary outcomes were changes in CUD symptoms, anxiety and depressive symptoms, pain severity, and insomnia symptoms during the trial. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for CUD diagnosis, and linear models were used for continuous outcomes to estimate the mean difference (MD) in symptom scores. A total of 186 participants (mean [SD] age 37.2 [14.4] years; 122 women [65.6%]) were randomized and included in the analyses. Compared with the delayed card acquisition group, the immediate card acquisition group had more CUD symptoms (MD, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.15-0.40; P < .001); fewer self-rated insomnia symptoms (MD, -2.90; 95% CI, -4.31 to -1.51; P < .001); and reported no significant changes in pain severity or anxiety or depressive symptoms. Participants in the immediate card acquisition group also had a higher incidence of CUD during the intervention (17.1% [n = 18] in the immediate card acquisition group vs 8.6% [n = 7] in the delayed card acquisition group; adjusted odds ratio, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.17-7.07; P = .02), particularly those with a chief concern of anxiety or depressive symptoms.

A systematic review was conducted including case reports, case series, open-label trials, non-randomized and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The search resulted in 23 relevant studies on CBD and nabiximols in the treatment of a wide range of psychiatric disorders. The quality of evidence was judged by using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine 2011 Levels of Evidence that ranges from Level 1 to Level 5 based on the quality and study design. These levels of evidence help in grading the recommendations, including Grade A (strong), Grade B (moderate), Grade C (weak), and Grade D (weakest). CBD and CBD-containing compounds such as nabiximols were helpful in alleviating psychotic symptoms and cognitive impairment in patients with a variety of conditions, and several studies provided evidence of effectiveness in the treatment of cannabis withdrawal and moderate to severe cannabis use disorder with Grade B recommendation. There is Grade B recommendation supporting the use of CBD for the treatment of schizophrenia, social anxiety disorder and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Grade C recommendation exists for insomnia, anxiety, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and Tourette syndrome. These recommendations should be considered in the context of limited number of available studies.

It also aims to investigate the effect of CBTi on levels of serum inflammatory markers in relation to insomnia symptoms. Individuals with cannabis use disorder and insomnia symptoms were recruited over 18 months. Data collected included demographics, self-reported sleep parameters, and cannabis use. Blood samples were drawn to measure IL-2, IL-6, CRP, and cortisol. Participants completed the Insomnia Severity Index questionnaire (ISI) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), and they were provided with an actigraphy (wrist) device for 1 week before CBTi and a subsequent week after completing the 4 CBTi sessions. Nineteen participants were enrolled in the study. The mean ISI score decreased from moderately severe insomnia at baseline to no clinically significant insomnia after CBTi with a sustained decrease at 3- and 6-months follow-up. Actigraphy showed a significant decrease in sleep onset latency (SOL) after CBTi. Three months after CBTi, 80% of participants reported a decrease in their cannabis use. There was also a significant and sustained decrease in mean PHQ-4 scores after CBTi. Although only trending towards significance, the levels of three out of four biomarkers (IL-2, IL-6, CRP) were decreased 6 months after CBTi. CBTi is effective as a short- and long-term treatment of insomnia and comorbid anxiety/depression in individuals who regularly use cannabis. A potential added benefit is a reduction in cannabis consumption and inflammatory serum biomarkers.

In the present chapter, we reviewed the main effect Cannabis on sleep. We focused on the effect of ""crude or whole plant"" Cannabis consumption (i.e., smoked, oral or vaporized) both in humans and experimental animal models.The data reviewed establish that Cannabis modifies sleep. Furthermore, a recent experimental study in animals suggests that vaporization (which is a recommended route for medical purposes) of Cannabis with high THC and negligible CBD, promotes NREM sleep.

The present study examined the self-reported effect of cannabis use on individual's sleep-related problems. Participants included 311 individuals recruited online, who reported both sleep-related problems and cannabis use. Analyses revealed that participants expected cannabis to decrease the incidence of sleep-related problems, including allowing participants to have an earlier bedtime, to fall asleep more quickly, and to have a longer night's sleep. Moreover, expectancies about the influence of cannabis on sleep negatively covaried with cannabis-related problems.

142,34,34,31161270,"Cannabis is a useful botanical with a wide range of therapeutic potential. Global prohibition over the past century has impeded the ability to study the plant as medicine. However, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has been developed as a stand-alone pharmaceutical initially approved for the treatment of chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting in 1986. The indication was expanded in 1992 to include treatment of anorexia in patients with the AIDS wasting syndrome. Hence, if the dominant cannabinoid is available as a schedule III prescription medication, it would seem logical that the parent botanical would likely have similar therapeutic benefits. The system of cannabinoid receptors and endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) has likely developed to help us modulate our response to noxious stimuli. Phytocannabinoids also complex with these receptors, and the analgesic effects of cannabis are perhaps the best supported by clinical evidence. Cannabis and its constituents have also been reported to be useful in assisting with sleep, mood, and anxiety. Despite significant in vitro and animal model evidence supporting the anti-cancer activity of individual cannabinoids-particularly THC and cannabidiol (CBD)-clinical evidence is absent. A single intervention that can assist with nausea, appetite, pain, mood, and sleep is certainly a valuable addition to the palliative care armamentarium. Although many healthcare providers advise against the inhalation of a botanical as a twenty-first century drug-delivery system, evidence for serious harmful effects of cannabis inhalation is scant and a variety of other methods of ingestion are currently available from dispensaries in locales where patients have access to medicinal cannabis. Oncologists and palliative care providers should recommend this botanical remedy to their patients to gain first-hand evidence of its therapeutic potential despite the paucity of results from randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials to appreciate that it is both safe and effective and really does not require a package insert.

Among patients there is also a growing preference for the use of MC to manage sleep problems. The aim of the current study was to examine the associations between use of whole plant cannabis and sleep problems among chronic pain patients. A total of 128 individuals with chronic pain over the age of 50 years were recruited from the Rambam Institute for Pain Medicine in Haifa, Israel. Of them, 66 were MC users and 62 were non-users. Regression models tested the differences in sleep problems between the two groups. Furthermore, Pearson correlations between MC use measures (dose, length and frequency of use, number of strains used, tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol levels) and sleep problems were assessed among MC users. After adjustment for age, sex, pain level and use of sleep and anti-depressant medications, MC use was associated with less problems with waking up at night compared with non-MC use. No group differences were found for problems with falling asleep or waking up early without managing to fall back asleep. Frequent MC use was associated with more problems waking up at night and falling asleep. MC use may have an overall positive effect on maintaining sleep throughout the night in chronic pain patients. At the same time, tolerance towards potential sleep-inducing properties of MC may occur with frequent use.

UPC-level grocery store scanner data in a multivariable panel regression design were used to compare the change in the monthly market share of sleep aids with varying dispensary-based recreational cannabis access (existence, sales, and count) in Colorado counties between 12/2013 and 12/2014. We measured annually-differenced market shares for sleep aids as a portion of the overall OTC medication market, thus accounting for store-level demand shifts in OTC medication markets and seasonality, and used the monthly changes in stores' sleep aid market share to control for short-term trends. Relative to the overall OTC medication market, sleep aid market shares were growing prior to recreational cannabis availability. The trend reverses (a 236% decrease) with dispensary entry (-0.33 percentage points, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.24, p < 0.01) from a mean market share growth of 0.14 ± 0.97. The magnitude of the market share decline increases as more dispensaries enter a county and with higher county-level cannabis sales. The negative associations are driven by diphenhydramine- and doxylamine-based sleep aids rather than herbal sleep aids and melatonin. These findings support survey evidence that many individuals use cannabis to treat insomnia, although sleep disturbances are not a specific qualifying condition under any U.S. state-level medical cannabis law. Investigations designed to measure the relative effectiveness and side effect profiles of conventional OTC sleep aids and cannabis-based products are urgently needed to improve treatment of sleep disturbances while minimizing potentially serious negative side effects.

As such, the current pilot study used a randomized controlled design to test the effects of Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia (BBTI) against a waitlist control among a sample of trauma-exposed young adults with elevated insomnia symptoms who regularly use cannabis (N = 56). Intent-to-treat multilevel modeling analyses indicated that BBTI may be more efficacious than waitlist control in reducing self-reported insomnia symptoms, with large effects three months post-treatment (d = 1.34). Further, our initial evidence suggested that BBTI resulted in reductions in cannabis-related problems with medium to large effects at three months post-treatment (d = 0.75). The current pilot analyses indicated BBTI also reduced cravings to use cannabis to reduce negative emotions in response to trauma cues with a large effect size. This pilot study suggests BBTI may be efficacious not only in improving insomnia symptoms among cannabis users but also in reducing cannabis-related problems and cravings over three months. Future research should replicate these results in a larger, fully powered sample with improved follow-up rates designed to test temporal mediation using multimethod assessments of insomnia symptoms and problematic cannabis use.

148,40,40,33215831,"Cannabis has been used as a medicine for millennia. Prohibition in the mid-20th century precluded early scientific investigation. 'Cannabis' describes three separate forms - herbal cannabis, 'hemp' products, pharmaceutical-grade regulated cannabinoid-based medical products (CBMP). In Australia, CBMP became available for prescription in November 2016. Herbal cannabis with Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is illegal, and cannabidiol (CBD) in herbal extracts, are both unregulated and unreliable sources of cannabinoids. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), delineated in the late 1990s, has increased the understanding and interest in research for appropriate clinical indications. The ubiquitous ECS has homeostatic and anti-inflammatory effects and comprises cannabinoid receptors, endocannabinoids and degrading enzymes. Phytocannabinoids are partial agonists of the ECS. In pre-clinical studies, THC and CBD produce beneficial effects in chronic pain, anxiety, sleep and inflammation. Systematic reviews often conflate herbal cannabis and CBMP, confusing the evidence. Currently large randomised controlled trials are unlikely to be achieved. Other methodologies with quality end-points are required. Rich, valuable high-quality real-world evidence for the safe and effective use of CBMP provides an opportunity to examine benefits and potential harms. Evidence demonstrates benefit of CBMP in multiple sclerosis, chronic neuropathic pain, chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting, resistant paediatric epilepsy, anxiety and insomnia. CBMP are well tolerated with few serious adverse events. Additional clinical benefits are promising in many other resistant chronic conditions.

Coffee was found to be the main source of caffeine intake in both men and women (48.9% of total caffeine intake). Higher percentages of women consumed coffee (56.4 vs. 42.1%, p = 0.01) and tea (40.3 vs. 19.8%, p < 0.001), whereas a higher percentage of men consumed energy drinks (18.0 vs. 7.4%, p < 0.001). Main motivations for caffeine intake were those related to cognitive enhancement. Caffeine intake was associated with poorer subjective sleep quality (p < 0.001). In conclusion, undergraduate students that were female and smokers reported higher caffeine intakes. Coffee was found as the main caffeine contributor, with higher contributions of tea in women and energy drinks in men. Universities should consider the implementation of health campaigns and educational programs to educate students of the risks of high caffeine consumption together with associated behaviors such as smoking, alcohol consumption and poor sleep quality to physical health and academic performance.

An electronic, cross-sectional survey was conducted among patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia and treated in Integrative Medicine & Health at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. The survey was constructed with the Symptom Management Theory tool and was sent anonymously via web-based software to patients with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Of 5234 patients with fibromyalgia sent the online survey, 1336 (25.5%) responded and met the inclusion criteria. Survey respondents had a median age of 48 (Q1-Q3: 37.5-58.0) years, and most identified as female. Nearly half of respondents (49.5%, n=661) reported cannabis use since their fibromyalgia diagnosis. The most common symptoms for which respondents reported using cannabis were pain (98.9%, n=654); fatigue (96.2%; n=636); stress, anxiety, or depression (93.9%; n=621); and insomnia (93.6%; n=619). Improvement in pain symptoms with cannabis use was reported by 82.0% (n=536). Most cannabis-using respondents reported that cannabis also improved symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression and of insomnia.

Multiple factors contribute to insomnia among patients with breast cancer including endocrine therapy and hotflashes, pain and discomfort from local therapy, and fear of recurrence. If we do identify insomnia, there are treatment options and strategies available to help patients. In particular, there is now a considerable body of evidence supporting the use of psychosocial interventions and behavioral treatments, such as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), yoga, and mind-body programs.

161,53,53,36467783,"Cannabis and its natural derivatives have emerged as promising therapeutics for multiple pathological and nonpathological medical conditions. For example, cannabinoids, the most popular and biologically active chemicals in cannabis, aid in many clinical ailments, including pain, inflammation, epilepsy, sleep disturbances or insomnia, multiple sclerosis, anorexia, schizophrenia, neurodegenerative diseases, anti-nausea, and most importantly, cancer. Despite the comprehensive benefits, certain aspects of cannabis present unique challenges in the medical cannabis landscape. Recent studies have highlighted the inherent challenges associated with cannabinoids' formulation like low solubility, rapid metabolism, poor bioavailability, and erratic pharmacokinetics - all of which contribute to the limited efficacy of cannabinoids. Several efforts are underway to address the bottlenecks and modify the formulations along with the delivery systems to achieve greater solubility/bioavailability, potency, and efficacy in treatment settings while minding the necessary standards for purity associated with the pharmaceutical industry. The current article presents a perspective on (1) a working knowledge of cannabinoids and their mechanisms of action, (2) the landscape of using medicinal cannabis for cancer-related medical conditions along with adversities, (3) current approaches, formulations, and challenges in medicinal cannabis delivery systems (oral, transdermal, pulmonary, and transmucosal), and lastly, (4) emerging approaches to improve delivery systems.

163,55,55,37068366,"As greater numbers of states in the United States and countries in the world continue to legalize cannabis for medical use, it has become increasingly important to assess patterns of cannabis use in individuals using cannabis for medical symptoms over time. A public health concern is that, like recreational cannabis, some individuals using cannabis for medical reasons may develop detrimental patterns of use, leading to the development of a cannabis use disorder (CUD). In a 9-month longitudinal cohort study following a 12-week randomized, waitlist-controlled trial in 149 adults who used cannabis to alleviate insomnia, pain, depressed mood, or anxiety (RCT: NCT03224468), we assessed whether patterns of cannabis use for the 9 months following the RCT were associated with the development of CUD. We identified five unique trajectories of use; 31 participants (21%) had low stable or no use, 50 (34%) had medium stable use, 19 (13%) had high stable use, 26 (17%) showed de-escalating and 23 (15%) showed escalating use over 9 months following the RCT. Of 149 participants enrolled, 19 (13%) met diagnostic criteria for CUD at 12 months. Only the escalating cannabis use pattern predicted significantly higher rates of CUD compared to the low or no use category (OR = 4.29, 95% CI = 1.21 to 10.87, p = 0.02).

165,57,57,30139415,"Cannabis has been used as a medicinal plant for thousands of years. As a result of centuries of breeding and selection, there are now over 700 varieties of cannabis that contain hundreds of compounds, including cannabinoids and terpenes. Cannabinoids are fatty compounds that are the main biological active constituents of cannabis. Terpenes are volatile compounds that occur in many plants and have distinct odors. Cannabinoids exert their effect on the body by binding to receptors, specifically cannabinoid receptors types 1 and 2. These receptors, together with endogenous cannabinoids and the systems for synthesis, transport, and degradation, are called the Endocannabinoid System. The two most prevalent and commonly known cannabinoids in the cannabis plant are delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol. The speed, strength, and type of effects of cannabis vary based on the route of administration. THC is rapidly distributed through the body to fatty tissues like the brain and is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system to 11-hydroxy-THC, which is also psychoactive. Cannabis and cannabinoids have been indicated for several medical conditions. There is evidence of efficacy in the symptomatic treatment of nausea and vomiting, pain, insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, loss of appetite, Tourette's syndrome, and epilepsy. Cannabis has also been associated with treatment for glaucoma, Huntington's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and dystonia, but there is not good evidence to support its efficacy. Side effects of cannabis include psychosis and anxiety, which can be severe. Here, we provided a summary of the history of cannabis, its pharmacology, and its medical uses.

Few surgeons receive training regarding legal endorsement, reported medicinal benefits, and potential risks, making it difficult to advise patients. Guidelines and additional research are needed. It is legal to recommend cannabis, which can be obtained in states with medical cannabis programs. There are many methods of consumption, oral being the safest. Activity is primarily through Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) via cannabinoid receptors, which may be potentiated when taken together in the plant or plant extract. The known effects of cannabis on inflammation and malignancy are largely limited to laboratory experiments. However, there are higher-quality data to support adjunctive use of cannabis for relief of pain, nausea, and insomnia, which may be useful postoperatively and could potentially decrease reliance on opiates and benzodiazepines. There are prospective trials in surgical patients, but no reported data regarding surgical complications or other surgical outcomes. Currently, cannabis is regulated differently than other controlled substances, and there are issues with purity/homogeneity, making it difficult for surgeons to accept or significantly explore its medical benefits.

Although insomnia is one of the main reasons individuals seek medicinal cannabis, little is known about the profile of cannabinoid use or the perceived benefit of the use of cannabinoids in daily life. We conducted a retrospective study of medicinal cannabis users to investigate the use profile and perceived efficacy of cannabinoids for the management of insomnia. Data were collected using the Strainprint app, which allows medicinal cannabis users to log conditions and symptoms, track cannabis use, and monitor symptom severity pre- and postcannabis use. Our analyses examined 991 medicinal cannabis users with insomnia across 24,189 tracked cannabis use sessions. Sessions were analyzed, and both descriptive statistics and linear mixed-effects modeling were completed to examine use patterns and perceived efficacy. Overall, cannabinoids were perceived to be efficacious across all genders and ages, and no significant differences were found among product forms, ingestion methods, or gender groups. Although all strain categories were perceived as efficacious, predominant indica strains were found to reduce insomnia symptomology more than cannabidiol (CBD) strains (estimated mean difference 0.59, SE 0.11; 95% CI 0.36-0.81; adjusted P<.001) and predominant sativa strains (estimated mean difference 0.74, SE 0.16; 95% CI 0.43-1.06; adjusted P<.001).

In this Mendelian Randomization (MR) study we examine if insomnia causes substance use and/or if substance use causes insomnia. MR uses summary effect estimates from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to create a genetic instrumental variable for a proposed 'exposure' variable and then identifies that same genetic instrument in an 'outcome' GWAS. Using GWASs of insomnia, smoking (initiation, heaviness, cessation), alcohol use (drinks per week, dependence), and cannabis initiation, bi-directional causal effects were tested. Multiple sensitivity analyses were applied to assess the robustness of the findings. There was strong evidence for positive causal effects of liability to insomnia on all substance use phenotypes (smoking traits, alcohol dependence, cannabis initiation), except alcohol per week. In the other direction, there was strong evidence that smoking initiation increased insomnia risk (smoking heaviness and cessation could not be tested as exposures). We found no evidence that alcohol use per week, alcohol dependence, or cannabis initiation causally affect insomnia risk. There were unidirectional effects of liability to insomnia on alcohol dependence and cannabis initiation, and bidirectional effects between liability to insomnia and smoking measures. Bidirectional effects between smoking and insomnia might give rise to a vicious circle. Future research should investigate if interventions aimed at insomnia are beneficial for substance use treatment.

175,67,67,30113101,"Sleep disturbance is one of the hallmarks of cannabis withdrawal. Studies have indicated that treatment of this key symptom may facilitate abstinence. In the present paper we aim to provide a systematic review of the extant literature on pharmacological management of sleep disturbance associated with cannabis withdrawal. We conducted a systematic literature search across five electronic databases including PubMed, Psycinfo, MEDLINE, Cochrane review and Embase. Human studies using a pharmacological treatment for sleep disturbances associated with cannabis withdrawal were included. Review articles, case-series, open trials, posters, and editorials were excluded. Seventeen publications, involving 562 participants, were included in this review. Major limitations involved small sample size, high dropout rate, methodological limitations, and heterogeneity of participants. Most of the studies were at high risk of bias, further downgrading the level of evidence. A meta-analysis was not performed due to lack of quantitative data, marked heterogeneity and low quality of the included studies. There is not sufficient evidence for any of the reviewed treatment options. Methodological limitations in a majority of the studies rendered their findings preliminary. Of the twelve investigated pharmacological agents, Gabapentin, Lofexidine, Mirtazapine, Quetiapine, and Zolpidem showed some primary benefits for treatment of sleep difficulties associated with cannabis withdrawal; however, future prospective studies are required to confirm such results. This review examines the current evidence for potential pharmacological options for treatment of cannabis withdrawal and associated sleep disturbance. It furthers our knowledge and provides groundwork for future research. (Am J Addict 2018;27:453-464).

Indica) has been used as a source of industrial fiber, seed oil, food, medicine for some somatic diseases, and it is also used as a psychoactive substance. Cannabis can be used by smoking, evaporation, as a food ingredient, or as an extract. Acute and chronic cannabis use has been shown to be detrimental to several aspects of psychological and physical health and many experimental studies done on healthy people indicate the potential of Δ9- tetra hydro cannabinoid (THC) in inducing transient, dose-dependent psychotic symptoms, but also affective, behavioral, cognitive, neurovegetative, and psychophysical symptoms. Cannabis is the most commonly used illegal drug globally. In many communities, cannabis is perceived as a low-risk drug, leading to political lobbying to decriminalize its use. The wave of laws and initiatives to liberalize cannabis use continues to spread across the United States and the rest of the world, and there seems to be a political debate in the background about the potential risks and benefits of cannabis use. Aim is to present the possible consequences that the legalization of cannabis would have from the aspect of mental health and mental disorders. Authors reviewed the literature using PubMed resources on the effects of cannabis using the keywords: cannabis use, cannabis use and psychoticism, cannabis use and depression, cannabis use and anxiety, cannabis use and cognition, cannabis use and insomnia, legalization of cannabis. Authors examined the effects of cannabis use on psychiatric disorders and the review of the legal status of cannabis use in the world was also made. The possible consequences of cannabis legalization on the public health system were also considered, based on experiences from countries where legalization has already been done. The evidence cited in this article suggests that strong claims about the need to legalize cannabis are still questionable, and may, even in the long run, remain mixed, inconclusive, or even contradictory. Political interference in this issue can trigger a wide range of unintended but profound and lasting consequences for the health system and the health of the individual. We recommend further research on this topic and data collection with an emphasis on the effects and consequences of cannabis use on mental health, and in particular the benefits and harmful effects of medical cannabis use.

177,69,69,33439370,"The use of the cannabis plant by cancer patients has been rising significantly in the past few years worldwide, primarily driven by public demand. There is an obvious need for more reliable scientific data, pharmacology information, a better understanding of its mode of action, and available clinical evidence supporting its robust use. Physicians must complete a thorough medical assessment, screening for potential drugs, or treatment contraindications before allowing its consumption. In light of the growing popularity of cannabis usage, it is highly essential that, in the near future, the medical community will be able to provide practical recommendations and explicit guidelines, including doses, and that cannabinoid concentrations in the used products are defined regarding its prescription before any medical procedure involving its usage is authorized. Here, we review and describe the favorable outcomes demonstrating the benefits of cannabis as an adjunctive treatment to conventional medicines for chemotherapy-induced nausea, vomiting, and cancer-related pain (primarily refractory chronic or neuropathic pain). Although not yet substantial enough, the treatment of anorexia, insomnia, depression, and anxiety is also seemingly favorable. To date, reports regarding its anti-neoplastic effects or its potent immunosuppressive properties influencing response to immunotherapy are still very conflicting and controversial. Thus, with the current state of evidence, cannabis use is not advisable as initial treatment, as an adjunct or an advanced line of care. In the coming years, we expect that preclinical data and animal models will shift to the clinical arena, and more patients will be recruited for clinical trials, and their reports will advance the field. Thus, physicians should prescribe cannabis only if careful clarification and consideration is provided together with a follow-up response evaluation.

However, an increasing number of jurisdictions are making it possible for patients to obtain the botanical for medicinal use. For the cancer patient, cannabis has a number of potential benefits, especially in the management of symptoms. Cannabis is useful in combatting anorexia, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, pain, insomnia, and depression. Cannabis might be less potent than other available antiemetics, but for some patients, it is the only agent that works, and it is the only antiemetic that also increases appetite. Inhaled cannabis is more effective than placebo in ameliorating peripheral neuropathy in a number of conditions, and it could prove useful in chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. A pharmacokinetic interaction study of vaporized cannabis in patients with chronic pain on stable doses of sustained-release opioids demonstrated no clinically significant change in plasma opiates, while suggesting the possibility of synergistic analgesia. Aside from symptom management, an increasing body of in vitro and animal-model studies supports a possible direct anticancer effect of cannabinoids by way of a number of different mechanisms involving apoptosis, angiogenesis, and inhibition of metastasis. Despite an absence of clinical trials, abundant anecdotal reports that describe patients having remarkable responses to cannabis as an anticancer agent, especially when taken as a high-potency orally ingested concentrate, are circulating.

181,73,73,38612615,"The post-COVID condition (PCC) is a pathology stemming from COVID-19, and studying its pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment is crucial. Neuroinflammation causes the most common manifestations of this disease including headaches, fatigue, insomnia, depression, anxiety, among others. Currently, there are no specific management proposals; however, given that the inflammatory component involves cytokines and free radicals, these conditions must be treated to reduce the current symptoms and provide neuroprotection to reduce the risk of a long-term neurodegenerative disease. It has been shown that cannabis has compounds with immunomodulatory and antioxidant functions in other pathologies. Therefore, exploring this approach could provide a viable therapeutic option for PCC, which is the purpose of this review. This review involved an exhaustive search in specialized databases including PubMed, PubChem, ProQuest, EBSCO, Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Clinical Trials. Phytocannabinoids, including cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG), and Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), exhibit significant antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties and have been shown to be an effective treatment for neuroinflammatory conditions. These compounds could be promising adjuvants for PCC alone or in combination with other antioxidants or therapies. PCC presents significant challenges to neurological health, and neuroinflammation and oxidative stress play central roles in its pathogenesis.

This study sought to characterize cannabis use among patients seen in radiation oncology in a state that has legalized adult nonmedical use cannabis and to identify key cannabis-related educational topics. Cannabis history was documented by providers using a structured template at patient visits in an academic radiation oncology practice October 2020 to November 2021. Cannabis use data, including recency/frequency of use, reason, and mode of administration, were summarized, and logistic regression was used to explore associations between patient and disease characteristics and recent cannabis use. A multivariable model employed stepwise variable selection using the Akaike Information Criterion. Of 3143 patients total, 91 (2.9%) declined to answer cannabis use questions, and 343 (10.9%) endorsed recent use (≤1 month ago), 235 (7.5%) noted nonrecent use (>1 month ago), and 2474 (78.7%) denied history of cannabis use. In multivariable analyses, those ≥50 years old (odds ratio [OR], 0.409; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.294-0.568; P < .001) or with history of prior courses of radiation (OR, 0.748; 95% CI, 0.572-0.979; P = .034) were less likely, and those with a mental health diagnosis not related to substance use (OR, 1.533; 95% CI, 1.171-2.005; P = .002) or who smoked tobacco (OR, 3.003; 95% CI, 2.098-4.299; P < .001) were more likely to endorse recent cannabis use. Patients reported pain, insomnia, and anxiety as the most common reasons for use. Smoking was the most common mode of administration. Patients are willing to discuss cannabis use with providers and reported recent cannabis use for a variety of reasons.

183,75,75,30828459,"Physical and psychological symptom burden in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) is significantly debilitating; yet, it is often inadequately treated. Legalization of cannabis in Canada may attract increasing interest from patients for its medical use in refractory symptom management, but its indications and long-term adverse health impacts are poorly established, creating a challenge for clinicians to support its use. In this review, we summarize key clinical studies and the level of evidence for nonsynthetic cannabinoids in the treatment of common symptoms encountered in advanced stages of CKD, including chronic pain, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, pruritus, and insomnia. Medline and Embase. A search was conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE (inception to March 1, 2018) on cannabis and CKD symptoms of interest, complemented with a manual review of bibliographies. Studies that examined synthetic cannabinoids that are manufactured to mimic the effects of ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol such as dronabinol, levonantradol, nabilone, and ajulemic acid were excluded. We focused on studies with higher level of evidence where available, and quality of studies was graded based on the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence (1a to 5). Based on studies conducted in patients without renal impairment, those treated with nonsynthetic cannabinoids were 43% to 300% more likely to report a ≥30% reduction in chronic neuropathic pain compared with placebo. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend nonsynthetic cannabinoids for other medical indications, although preliminary investigation into topical endocannabinoids for uremia-induced pruritus in end-stage renal disease is promising. Finally, any benefits of cannabis may be offset by potential harms in the form of cognitive impairment, increased risk of mortality post-myocardial infarction, orthostatic hypotension, respiratory irritation, and malignancies (with smoked cannabis). Nonsynthetic cannabinoid preparations were highly variable between studies, sample sizes were small, and study durations were short. Due to an absence of studies conducted in CKD, recommendations were primarily extrapolated from the general population. Until further studies are conducted, the role of nonsynthetic cannabinoids for symptom management in patients with CKD should be limited to the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain. Clinicians need to be cognizant that nonsynthetic cannabinoid preparations, particularly smoked cannabis, can pose significant health risks and these must be cautiously weighed against the limited substantiated therapeutic benefits of cannabis in patients with CKD. Les symptômes physiques et psychologiques ressentis par les patients souffrant d’insuffisance rénale chronique (IRC) sont particulièrement débilitants, et souvent traités inadéquatement. La légalisation du cannabis au Canada pourrait susciter un intérêt croissant chez ces patients avec l’emploi médical de cette substance pour le traitement de ces symptômes. Cependant, les indications thérapeutiques du cannabis et ses effets nocifs sur la santé à long terme sont mal connus, rendant difficile son soutien par les cliniciens. L’article présente l’état des preuves et une synthèse des principales études cliniques portant sur l’usage des cannabinoïdes non synthétiques dans le traitement des symptômes fréquemment observés aux stades avancés de l’IRC, soit la douleur chronique, les nausées, les vomissements, l’anorexie, le prurit et l’insomnie. Medline et Embase. On a procédé à une recherche dans MEDLINE et EMBASE (de leur création jusqu’au 1 Des études menées chez des patients non atteints d’insuffisance rénale montraient que les sujets recevant des cannabinoïdes non synthétiques étaient 43 à 300 % plus susceptibles de rapporter une réduction d’au moins 30 % de la douleur neuropathique chronique comparativement aux sujets recevant un placebo. Mais pour l’heure, les preuves permettant de recommander les cannabinoïdes non synthétiques à d’autres fins médicales sont insuffisantes; quoique des résultats préliminaires soient prometteurs avec les endocannabinoïdes topiques dans le traitement du prurit provoqué par l’urémie en contexte d’IRC. Cependant, tout bienfait du cannabis pourrait se voir neutralisé par de potentiels effets nocifs tels que troubles cognitifs, risque accru de mortalité après un infarctus du myocarde, hypotension orthostatique, irritation des voies respiratoires ou tumeurs malignes (dues à l’inhalation). Les préparations de cannabinoïdes non synthétiques employées dans les études retenues étaient très variables, les échantillons étaient faibles et les études de courte durée. En absence d’études menées en contexte d’IRC, les résultats présentés sont principalement extrapolés d’une population générale. Jusqu’à ce que d’autres études soient menées, l’utilisation des cannabinoïdes non synthétiques chez les patients atteints d’IRC devrait se limiter au soulagement des douleurs neuropathiques chroniques. Les cliniciens doivent comprendre que les cannabinoïdes non synthétiques, particulièrement lorsqu’ils sont inhalés, comportent des risques significatifs pour la santé et que ceux-ci doivent être examinés avec prudence en regard des bienfaits thérapeutiques limités du cannabis chez les patients atteints d’IRC.

184,76,76,34225825,"The use of cannabinoids in mental health has gained strength in recent years due to emerging scientific evidence and the lifting of prohibitionist laws that prevailed for years in many countries, including Colombia. This study describes the results of a survey of Colombian psychiatrists on some aspects of medicinal cannabis, such as attitudes towards its potential use, perceived knowledge, and beliefs surrounding its regulation and safety. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 145 psychiatrists in 14 territories of Colombia between November 2019 and July 2020. The survey consisted of 28 items on topics related to medicinal cannabis, including attitudes and clinical experience (4 items), perceived knowledge (4 items), indications for use in psychiatric pathologies (6 items), indications for use in nonpsychiatric pathologies (8 items), and concerns and awareness about safety and efficacy (6 items). The results were summarized using descriptive statistics. In addition, possible associations among variables were examined using Fisher's exact test. Eighty-two percent of the psychiatrists agreed that medical cannabis should be available for different medical conditions, and 73.1% stated that they wanted to be able to prescribe it. However, 66.2% said they did not know how to help their patients legally access it, and only 25% understood the legal status of medicinal cannabis in the country. The mental health indications that received the highest approval levels for cannabis use were insomnia (35.2%), anxiety disorders (29%), and agitation in dementia (18.6%). The greatest disapproval of cannabis use was indicated for schizophrenia, with 66.9%. The most approved nonpsychiatric medical conditions were cancer-related chronic pain (87.6%), chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting (78.6%), and chronic pain not associated with cancer (72.4%). Multinomial stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that female psychiatrists who did not agree with MC to treat psychiatric symptoms were more likely to agree with non-psychiatric use. Our results showed that this sample of Colombian psychiatrists have a favorable attitude towards the prescription of medicinal cannabis; however, there is a serious lack of knowledge of the legal status of medicinal cannabis in the country and the methods through which patients can gain access to government-regulated products. Most of them approve the use of MC for nonpsychiatric conditions and, in general, disapprove of its use in mental illnesses. They generally consider medicinal cannabis as a safe treatment compared to other psychotropic drugs and medications with potential risk of dependence, such as opioids and/or benzodiazepines.

To better understand this high-risk behavior, a sample of 290 young adults (ages 18-25; 45.6% female) were recruited from two U.S. universities in January and February of 2020 to complete a survey about their cannabis use and self-medication. Results: seventy-six percent endorsed using cannabis to reduce problems such as anxiety, sleep, depression, pain, loneliness, social discomfort, and concentration. When predicting reasons for self-medication with cannabis, logistic regression models showed that lower CUDIT-R scores, experiencing withdrawal, living in a state where cannabis was illegal, and being female were all associated with higher rates of self-medication. Withdrawal symptoms were tested to predict self-medication with cannabis, and only insomnia and loss of appetite were significant predictors. To further explore why young adults self-medicate, each of the original predictors were regressed on seven specified reasons for self-medication. Young adults experiencing withdrawal were more likely to self-medicate for pain. Participants living where cannabis is legal were less likely to self-medicate for anxiety and depression. Living where cannabis is illegal also significantly predicted self-medicating for social discomfort-though the overall model predicting social discomfort was statistically non-significant. Finally, female participants were more likely to self-medicate for anxiety. These results suggest widespread self-medication among young adults with likely CUD and underscore the complexity of their cannabis use. The findings have implications for understanding why young adults use cannabis in relation to psychological and physical distress and for accurately treating young adults with cannabis use disorder.

187,79,79,39480147,"Cannabis is a psychoactive substance the availability and use of which, in various forms, has been liberalized in many countries across the world. Cannabis use, including by women of reproductive age, has become increasingly common, with (in some studies) >5% of women using the substance even during pregnancy to self treat nausea, vomiting, stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, chronic pain, and other conditions. Women who use cannabis during pregnancy are more likely to have a medical or mental health condition; they are commonly unaware that cannabis is associated with pregnancy related risks. These risks arise from effects of cannabis on cannabinoid receptors in the placenta as well as from cannabis constituents that cross the placenta and act on receptors in the developing fetal brain; other mechanisms may also operate. This article examines recent cohort studies and meta-analyses on specific maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes associated with gestational exposure to cannabis. Maternal cannabis use during pregnancy is associated with small to moderately increased risks of gestational hypertension, gestational weight gain less than as well as greater than guidelines, and placental abruption. Maternal cannabis use during pregnancy is also associated with small to moderately increased risks of preterm birth (<36 weeks, <34 weeks, and <32 weeks), small for gestational age, low birth weight, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and fetal death. The risk of some of these adverse outcomes is greater with greater frequency of cannabis use. These adverse outcomes have been identified even in women who do not use other substances during pregnancy. Other adverse outcomes, such as major congenital malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders, are also reported (but are not discussed in this article). For these and other reasons, many professional bodies across the world are already discouraging women from using cannabis during pregnancy.

Significant reductions in ESAS-r scores were observed over time in the domains of drowsiness (p = .013) and tiredness (p = .031), but not pain (p = .106) or well-being (p = .274). Significant reductions in BPI-SF scores over time were observed for worst pain (p = .010), average pain (p = .012), and overall pain severity (p = 0.009), but not pain right now (p = .052) or least pain (p = .141). Overall, results suggest medical cannabis was safe, well-tolerated, and associated with clinically meaningful reductions in pain in this sample of older adults.

An additional aim was to determine whether individuals who used cannabis for chronic pain, as well as those who reported greater within-group pain levels, demonstrated a species preference (i.e., sativa, indica, hybrids) and the extent to which species preference was associated with cannabis use problems. Participants were 163 medical cannabis users (77% male), recruited from a medical marijuana dispensary in California, who completed assessments of medical cannabis use motives, history, preferences (species type), and problems, as well as current pain level. Individuals who used cannabis to manage chronic pain experienced fewer cannabis use problems than those who did not use it for pain; among those who used it for pain, the average pain level in the past week was not associated with cannabis use problems. Furthermore, individuals who used cannabis for chronic pain were more likely to use indica over sativa. Preference for indica was associated with fewer cannabis use problems than preference for hybrid species. Individuals who use cannabis to manage chronic pain may be at a lower risk for cannabis use problems, relative to individuals who use it for other indications, potentially as a function of their species preference.

The purpose of this study was to measure sleep in individuals enrolled in treatment for CUD, and to determine whether use of hypnotic medication during treatment increased abstinence rates. The study enrolled 127 adults seeking treatment for CUD in a 12-week clinical trial and randomized to receive extended-release zolpidem (zolpidem-XR) or placebo. All participants received computerized behavioral therapy and abstinence-based contingency management. The study conducted in-home ambulatory polysomnography (PSG) assessments at baseline and during treatment to objectively measure sleep. Self-report measures of recent sleep, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and drug use (Timeline Follow-Back) were collected at each study visit, and the study confirmed self-reported abstinence via quantitative urine drug testing. Participants randomized to placebo, but not zolpidem-XR exhibited significant sleep disturbance during week 1 of treatment. Sleep disturbance emerged in the zolpidem-XR group after study medication was stopped at the end of treatment. Though participants assigned to the zolpidem-XR condition had qualitatively greater rates of abstinence compared with placebo (27 % versus 15 % negative at end of treatment), the difference was not statistically significant. Treatment retention was poor (about 50 % drop out in both groups) and medication adherence was a challenge without the use of contingent incentives. Results from this randomized controlled trial suggest that zolpidem-XR can attenuate abstinence-induced sleep disturbance early in treatment for CUD, but that sleep problems are likely to emerge after the medication is stopped. Further research should identify alternative pharmacotherapies and behavioral treatments for CUD and elucidate the role of sleep disturbance in the development and maintenance of CUD.

Much of the media coverage surrounding medical cannabis has been positive in nature, leading to Canadians potentially underestimating the adverse effects of medical cannabis use. In recent years, there has been a large increase in clinic websites advertising the use of medical cannabis for health indications. However, little is known about the quality of the evidence used by these clinic websites to describe the effectiveness of cannabis used for medical purposes. We aimed to identify the indications for medical cannabis reported by cannabis clinics in Ontario, Canada, and the evidence these clinics cited to support cannabis prescription. We conducted a cross-sectional web search to identify all cannabis clinic websites within Ontario, Canada, that had physician involvement and identified their primary purpose as cannabis prescription. Two reviewers independently searched these websites to identify all medical indications for which cannabis was promoted and reviewed and critically appraised all studies cited using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence rubric. A total of 29 clinics were identified, promoting cannabis for 20 different medical indications including migraines, insomnia, and fibromyalgia. There were 235 unique studies cited on these websites to support the effectiveness of cannabis for these indications. A high proportion (36/235, 15.3%) of the studies were identified to be at the lowest level of evidence (level 5). Only 4 clinic websites included any mention of harms associated with cannabis. Cannabis clinic websites generally promote cannabis use as medically effective but cite low-quality evidence to support these claims and rarely discuss harms. The recommendation of cannabis as a general therapeutic for many indications unsupported by high-quality evidence is potentially misleading for medical practitioners and patients. This disparity should be carefully evaluated in context of the specific medical indication and an individualized patient risk assessment.

We used linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) to analyze genetic correlations between sleep deficits and cannabis use behaviors.

Summary statistics came from existing genome-wide association studies of European ancestry that were focused on sleep duration, insomnia, chronotype, lifetime cannabis use, and cannabis use disorder (CUD). A target sample for PRS prediction consisted of high-risk participants and participants from twin/family community-based studies (European ancestry; n = 760, male = 64%; mean age = 26.78 years). Target data consisted of self-reported sleep (sleep duration, feeling tired, and taking naps) and cannabis use behaviors (lifetime ever use, number of lifetime uses, past 180-day use, age of first use, and lifetime CUD symptoms). Significant genetic correlation between lifetime cannabis use and an eveningness chronotype (rG = 0.24, p < 0.001), as well as between CUD and both short sleep duration (<7 h; rG = 0.23, p = 0.017) and insomnia (rG = 0.20, p = 0.020). Insomnia PRS predicted earlier age of first cannabis use (OR = 0.92, p = 0.036) and increased lifetime CUD symptom count (OR = 1.09, p = 0.012).

Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) glutamate and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) were measured with proton MRS at baseline and on abstinent days 7 and 21 in conjunction with measures of cannabis withdrawal and craving (MCQ), sleep difficulties (PSQI) and mood state. We used ANOVA to examine group differences in glutamate and GABA from baseline through day 21 and used linear regression to evaluate correlations between intra-individual glutamate and withdrawal symptoms. We found that self-reported anxiety severity (HAMA) was correlated with urinary THC/Cr ratios at baseline (r = 0.768, p = 0.000076) and abstinent day 7 (r = 0.5636, p = 0.0097), dACC glutamate was significantly lower in the users compared with the controls from baseline through day 21 (F = 5.90, p = 0.022), changes in glutamate between baseline and abstinent day 21 had a significantly negative correlation with corresponding changes in craving (r = -0.72, p = 0.005) after adjusting for age, consumption of alcohol/cigarettes, sleep difficulties, and urinary THC levels. These findings provide preliminary evidence that dACC glutamate is associated with the cannabis withdrawal syndrome.

207,99,99,26187404,"Cannabis is the most frequently used illicit substance in the United States resulting in high rates of cannabis use disorders. Current treatments for cannabis use are often met with high rates of lapse/relapse, tied to (1) behavioral health factors that impact cannabis use such as poor sleep, and (2) access, stigma, supply, and cost of receiving a substance use intervention. This pilot study examined the feasibility, usability, and changes in cannabis use and sleep difficulties following mobile phone-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) in the context of a cannabis cessation attempt. Four male veterans with DSM-5 cannabis use disorder and sleep problems were randomized to receive a 2-week intervention: CBT-I Coach mobile app (n=2) or a placebo control (mood-tracking app) (n=2). Cannabis and sleep measures were assessed pre- and post-treatment. Participants also reported use and helpfulness of each app. Changes in sleep and cannabis use were evaluated for each participant individually. Both participants receiving CBT-I used the app daily over 2 weeks and found the app user-friendly, helpful, and would use it in the future. In addition, they reported decreased cannabis use and improved sleep efficiency; one also reported increased sleep quality. In contrast, one participant in the control group dropped out of the study, and the other used the app minimally and reported increased sleep quality but also increased cannabis use. The mood app was rated as not helpful, and there was low likelihood of future participation. This pilot study examined the feasibility and initial patient acceptance of mobile phone delivery of CBT-I for cannabis dependence. Positive ratings of the app and preliminary reports of reductions in cannabis use and improvements in sleep are both encouraging and support additional evaluation of this intervention.

208,100,100,32433200,"Despite substantial controversies concerning patients' reports of benefits from cannabis for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and inconsistent research findings regarding its efficacy and adverse risks, some states have already recognized PTSD as a qualifying condition for medical cannabis. Consequently, medical cannabis can also be provided for patients with complex PTSD who experience additional posttraumatic symptoms of affective dysregulation, negative perception of the self, and difficulties in relationships due to a history of repetitive trauma. In this article, we explore cannabis use in relation to benefits versus harms that might occur relative to specific complex PTSD symptoms and comorbidities. Whereas some symptoms related to PTSD per se (e.g., anxiety, insomnia, nightmares) may be benefited, others that are more characteristic of complex PTSD (e.g., dissociation, reckless behavior, and substance abuse associated with dysregulated affect) may be aggravated. Therefore, clinicians treating patients with complex PTSD who use or seek cannabis should carefully assess patients' motivations and the impacts of particular use patterns on specific symptoms. Clinicians and patients should be aware of and fully discuss the significant number of potential adverse effects of cannabis use, several of which might impede patients' participation in beneficial psychotherapeutic, social, and medical interventions.

However, there is little information comparing the reasons for MC use and its perceived effectiveness between Veterans and non-Veterans. We compared MC use among a convenience sample of Canadian Veterans and with non-Veteran controls, including demographics, reasons and patterns of use, and perceived effectiveness. Between November and December 2021, Canadian Veterans using cannabis were invited to participate in a survey using a national press release, social media, and announcements on online platform dedicated to promoting health among Canadian Veterans and non-Veterans during the pandemic (www.MissionVav.com). The survey was also mentioned in a monthly newsletter from Veteran Affairs Canada. Self-reported effectiveness was evaluated using a 0 to 10 visual analogue scale (0 being not all effective, 10 being the most effective). The survey was completed by 157 people, including 108 (69%) males and 49 (31%) females. The mean age was 57 years (range 19 to 84). Among responders, 90 (63%) identified as Veterans. The most common reasons for MC use among Veterans included: insomnia (80%), anxiety (73%), and depression (52%). Veterans reported medical conditions such as chronic pain (88%) and arthritis (51%). Compared with non-Veterans, Veterans were significantly more likely to be male (83% vs. 49%), have a higher BMI (35.2 vs. 30.9), to report problems with sleep, anxiety, depression, and PTSD, and to use cannabis in edible form (51% vs. 22%). Self-reported mean effectiveness scores for MC were highest for PTSD (8.4), insomnia (8.2), anxiety (8.1), depression (8.0), and chronic pain (7.6). We found important differences in user characteristics and cannabis use patterns between Canadian Veterans and non-Veterans.

This narrative review synthesised evidence on lifestyle and integrative oncology interventions for cancer-related fatigue, insomnia and sleep disturbances in cancer survivors. There is strong evidence in support of aerobic and strength exercise for the relief of cancer-related fatigue. Yoga, massage therapy, acupuncture, Tai Chi and qigong can also be recommended for cancer-related fatigue. The evidence on yoga, acupuncture and massage therapy for sleep disturbances in cancer is mixed, while exercise appears to have a modest favourable effect. There is insufficient evidence on nutrient supplements or dietary interventions for cancer-related fatigue or insomnia and other sleep disturbances after cancer. Beyond alleviating cancer-related fatigue and insomnia-related symptoms, integrative oncology and lifestyle interventions have potential to effect multiple other benefits, such as improvement in symptoms such as pain and menopausal symptoms.

In order to discover the benefits and adverse effects perceived by medical cannabis patients, especially with regards to chronic pain, we hand-delivered surveys to one hundred consecutive patients who were returning for yearly re-certification for medical cannabis use in Hawai'i. The response rate was 94%. Mean and median ages were 49.3 and 51 years respectively. Ninety-seven per cent of respondents used cannabis primarily for chronic pain. Average pain improvement on a 0-10 pain scale was 5.0 (from 7.8 to 2.8), which translates to a 64% relative decrease in average pain. Half of all respondents also noted relief from stress/anxiety, and nearly half (45%) reported relief from insomnia. Most patients (71%) reported no adverse effects, while 6% reported a cough or throat irritation and 5% feared arrest even though medical cannabis is legal in Hawai'i. No serious adverse effects were reported. These results suggest that Cannabis is an extremely safe and effective medication for many chronic pain patients.

United States-based members of the Breastcancer.org and Healthline.com communities with a self-reported diagnosis of breast cancer within 5 years (age ≥ 18 years) were invited to participate in an anonymous online survey. After informed consent was obtained, nonidentifiable data were collected and analyzed. Of all participants (n = 612), 42% (n = 257) reported using cannabis for relief of symptoms, which included pain (78%), insomnia (70%), anxiety (57%), stress (51%), and nausea/vomiting (46%). Furthermore, 49% of cannabis users believed that medical cannabis could be used to treat cancer itself. Of those taking cannabis, 79% had used it during treatment, which included systemic therapies, radiation, and surgery. At the same time, few (39%) had discussed it with any of their physicians. A significant percentage of survey participants (42%) used cannabis to address symptoms; approximately half of these participants believed that cannabis could treat cancer itself. Most participants used cannabis during active cancer treatment despite the potential for an adverse event during this vulnerable time. Furthermore, most participants believed that cannabis was safe and were unaware that product quality varied widely and depended on the source. This study reviews the research on medicinal cannabis in the setting of these findings to help physicians to recognize its risks and benefits for patients with cancer. Almost half of patients with breast cancer use cannabis, most commonly during active treatment to manage common symptoms and side effects: pain, anxiety, insomnia, and nausea.

While the use of cannabis for medical purposes is growing in Australia, underlying consumer behaviours and patterns of use, particularly around sleep disorders, are poorly understood. We conducted a subanalysis of the cross-sectional ""Cannabis as Medicine Survey"" 2020-2021 (CAMS-20) (N = 1600), to explore the characteristics of a sample of Australians who were using prescribed and/or illicit medical cannabis to treat a self-reported sleep disorder.

Only 165 (16.8%) respondents selected a self-reported sleep disorder as the main health condition being treated. Relative to other health conditions, use of medical cannabis for a self-reported sleep disorder was associated with younger age, increased likelihood of using both prescribed and illicit forms of medical cannabis, inhaled routes of administration, and THC-dominant products. Most respondents reported a reduction in the use of benzodiazepines and alcohol since starting medical cannabis. Binary logistic regression showed that respondents who predominantly used inhaled routes of administration, and concomitant use of medical cannabis for pain, mental health and/or substance use disorder, or a gastrointestinal disorder, were significantly more likely to also use medical cannabis to treat a self-reported sleep disorder. Overall, these results suggest that self-reported sleep disorders are often being treated with medical cannabis alongside other health conditions (often pain or a mental health disorder) and that use of inhaled methods, THC-dominant products, and illicit sources of medical cannabis are common among people with self-reported sleep disorders in Australia.

The aim of the current study was to use machine learning methods to investigate predictors of perceived symptom change across various mental health symptoms with acute cannabis use in a large naturalistic sample. Data from 68,819 unique observations of cannabis use from 1307 individuals using cannabis to manage mental health symptoms were analyzed. Data were extracted from Strainprint®, a mobile app that allows users to monitor their cannabis use for therapeutic purposes. Machine learning models were employed to predict self-perceived symptom change after cannabis use, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value plots were used to assess feature importance of individual predictors in the model. Interaction effects of symptom severity pre-scores of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and gender were also examined. The factors that were most strongly associated with perceived symptom change following acute cannabis use were pre-symptom severity, age, gender, and the ratio of CBD to THC. Further examination on the impact of baseline severity for the most commonly reported symptoms revealed distinct responses, with cannabis being reported to more likely benefit individuals with lower pre-symptom severity for depression, and higher pre-symptom severity for insomnia. Responses to cannabis use also differed between genders. Findings from this study highlight the importance of several factors in predicting perceived symptom change with acute cannabis use for mental health symptom management. Mental health profiles and baseline symptom severity may play a large role in perceived responses to cannabis.

220,112,112,38612415,"The endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS) plays a critical role in the regulation of various physiological functions, including sleep, mood, and neuroinflammation. Phytocannabinoids such as Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinomimimetics, and some N-acylethanolamides, particularly palmitoyethanolamide, have emerged as potential therapeutic agents for the management of sleep disorders. THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis, may initially promote sleep, but, in the long term, alters sleep architecture, while CBD shows promise in improving sleep quality without psychoactive effects. Clinical studies suggest that CBD modulates endocannabinoid signaling through several receptor sites, offering a multifaceted approach to sleep regulation. Similarly, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), in addition to interacting with the endocannabinoid system, acts as an agonist on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). The favorable safety profile of CBD and PEA and the potential for long-term use make them an attractive alternative to conventional pharmacotherapy. The integration of the latter two compounds into comprehensive treatment strategies, together with cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), represents a holistic approach to address the multifactorial nature of sleep disorders. Further research is needed to establish the optimal dosage, safety, and efficacy in different patient populations, but the therapeutic potential of CBD and PEA offers hope for improved sleep quality and general well-being.

Pragmatic effectiveness studies with electronic daily diaries that capture person-specific patterns of cannabis use and health symptoms may help clarify risks and benefits. As part of a larger, randomized trial (NCT03224468), adults (N = 181) seeking cannabis for insomnia, pain, or anxiety or depressive symptoms were randomized to obtain a medical cannabis card immediately (MCC) or a waitlist control (WLC) and completed 12-weeks of daily web-based surveys on cannabis use and sleep, pain, and depressive symptoms. Completion rates of daily surveys were moderate to high (median completed: 72 out of 90 days). Daily reports of cannabis use were consistent with monthly interview assessments and urinalysis. The MCC group increased cannabis use frequency in the 12 weeks following randomization, while WLC did not. Among the MCC group, self-reported sleep quality was significantly higher on cannabis use days, compared to nonuse days. The MCC group displayed long-term sleep improvements, consistent with increasing cannabis frequency. No improvements were found for pain or depressive symptoms. Cannabis use is associated with same day improvements in self-reported sleep quality, but not pain or depressive symptoms, although sleep improvements occurred in the context of increased frequency of cannabis use, raising the risk for cannabis use disorder. Daily web-based assessments of cannabis appear valid and feasible in adults seeking cannabis for health concerns, providing a flexible, complementary method for future real-world effectiveness studies with expanded and objective measures.

222,114,114,33636612,"To survey the pattern and benefits of medical cannabis use (MCU) in a cross section of persons with multiple sclerosis (PWMS). One hundred and fifteen subjects completed a 36-question survey online or on paper which queried aspects of their use of cannabis, including frequency of use, effect on symptoms, and changes in their use of prescription medications, as well asa number of key demographic variables such as age, gender, disease duration and clinical course, etc. All subjects were treated at a multiple sclerosis (MS) clinic in Connecticut and enrolled in the Connecticut Medical Marijuana Program (CTMMP). Self-reported benefit from cannabis use for two or more symptoms of MS was associated with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) vs progressive (PMS) (OR 3.043, 95% CI 1.026-9.028, p=0.038) and less benefit for two or more symptoms for those who required a wheelchair vs. those who ambulated without assistance (OR .246, 95% CI .195-.797, p=0.016). General benefit from cannabis use was reported for mood disorders (p<0.001), insomnia (p<0.001), sensory symptoms, including pain (p<0.001), and muscle cramps and spasms (p<0.001). Furthermore, benefit was also significantly associated with symptom severity in the case of insomnia (OR 9.735, 95% CI 2.751-34.445, p<0.001), and cramps and spasms (OR 5.234, 95% CI 1.261-21.729, p=0.014). A significant proportion of respondents had stopped or reduced prescription medications (86% vs. 55%, p<0.001) as a function of finding cannabis more effective than prescription medications. These included opioids, benzodiazepines, muscle relaxers and other pain medications. MCU among PWMS can lead to the reduction or discontinuation of several categories of prescription medications for symptoms of MS. Persons reporting the most benefit from MCU tended to have a milder form of MS with less disability, in contrast to previous studies. This study confirms the benefit of cannabis in several common MS symptoms, extending these findings to show that benefit can be related to baseline severity of some symptoms.

223,115,115,35930902,"Legalization of recreational, or non-medical, cannabis in Canada in 2018 was followed by significant increase in use among older adults. Non-medical cannabis is often used medicinally in this population for issues such as pain, insomnia, and appetite stimulation. The purpose of this study was to explore new cannabis use among older adults within an evolving socio-legal context. Normalization theory provided the theoretical foundation and qualitative description was the guiding methodology. A convenience sample of twelve participants (ten women, two men) aged 71 to 85 years old was recruited. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and analyzed thematically. Findings illustrate factors that influenced participants' beliefs and contributed to their decisions to begin using cannabis in later life. The most important factor was legalization, which sparked a shift in beliefs around using cannabis and shaped the beginning of de-stigmatization around using this substance. Increasing acceptance in their social networks and visibility of cannabis in the media also informed decision-making. However, using cannabis for non-medicinal or social reasons remained stigmatized. This research indicates that older adults' beliefs about cannabis use are shifting and this is likely related to legalization and broader social acceptance of cannabis. As a consequence, increased public health education is needed to improve health literacy about cannabis use during this stage of the life-course.

To test whether 1 year of cannabis use for medical symptoms after obtaining a medical cannabis card was associated with increased brain activation during working memory, reward, and inhibitory control tasks, areas of cognition affected by cannabis. This cohort study was conducted from July 2017 to July 2020 among participants from the greater Boston area who were recruited as part of a clinical trial of individuals seeking medical cannabis cards for anxiety, depression, pain, or insomnia symptoms.

Medication therapy is often initiated to address these symptoms but is limited by variable efficacy and high pill burden. There is interest among clinicians and patients to explore cannabis and cannabinoids as an alternative treatment to manage symptoms related to kidney disease. The objectives were to characterize cannabis use among patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis (HD), to describe patient perspectives on cannabis, and to explore patient experiences with their kidney health care team related to cannabis. This was a descriptive, cross-sectional paper-based patient survey. Patients receiving maintenance HD at Toronto General Hospital in the ambulatory setting between July and August 2020 were included. A 33-item questionnaire was developed to address the study questions based on existing cannabis questionnaires and input from kidney specialist physicians, pharmacists, kidney nurse practitioners, and patients. The questionnaire was distributed to patients during their in-center HD session. Patients who chose to participate in the study completed the questionnaire and returned it to the study team. In total, there were 52 respondents, of which 11 (21%) reported cannabis use in the preceding 3 months, and 23 (44%) reported historical cannabis use. Baseline characteristics were similar between those who used cannabis and those who did not, with a possible trend of cannabis users being younger. The most commonly reported reasons for using cannabis were recreation and symptom management. Those who reported using cannabis for symptom management were doing so without medical authorization or documentation. Common symptoms that cannabis was used to self-treat were insomnia, anxiety, and/or non-neuropathic pain. Dried flower was the most common type of product used, and smoking was the most common route. Care gaps and opportunities to improve patient care related to cannabis use were identified, related to monitoring and management of adverse effects, management of drug interactions, harm reduction strategies, informed decision-making, and prescriber education. The overall participation rate was low, at approximately 17%, possibly related to the COVID-19 pandemic, lack of interest, or fear of revealing cannabis use. Non-response bias is a possible limitation as this was a voluntary survey. The questionnaire was limited to multiple-choice and Likert scale questions, therefore limiting the depth of patient responses. Our study showed that cannabis use among patients receiving HD is common and comparable with the general population. Patients may be using cannabis to self-manage symptoms related to kidney disease, without the involvement of the health care team.

Le cannabis était consommé pour l’auto-traitement de symptômes courants comme l’insomnie, l’anxiété et/ou la douleur non neurogène. Le plus souvent, le cannabis était fumé, et la fleur séchée était le produit le plus utilisé. Des lacunes dans les soins et des occasions d’améliorer les soins aux patients ont été identifiées en lien avec la consommation de cannabis, celles-ci concernaient la surveillance et la gestion des effets indésirables, la gestion des interactions médicamenteuses, les stratégies de réduction des risques, la prise de décisions éclairées et l’éducation des prescripteurs. Le taux de participation global a été faible (environ 17%), possiblement en raison de la pandémie de COVID-19, d’un manque d’intérêt ou de la réticence à révéler la consommation de cannabis. La participation était volontaire, un biais de non-réponse est donc possible. Le questionnaire n’était constitué que de questions à choix multiples et à échelle de Likert, ce qui limite la profondeur des réponses. Notre étude montre que la consommation de cannabis chez les patients sous HD est courante et comparable à celle de la population générale. Les patients peuvent consommer du cannabis pour soulager les symptômes liés à l’insuffisance rénale sans intervention de l’équipe de soins. Le sondage a permis d’identifier plusieurs occasions d’améliorer les soins aux patients en lien avec la consommation de cannabis.

There is little evidence to support their use for most indications in palliative care. This study aims to assess a 1:20 delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol (THC/CBD) cannabinoid preparation in the management of symptom distress in patients with advanced cancer undergoing palliative care. One hundred and fifty participants will be recruited across multiple sites in Queensland, Australia. A teletrial model will facilitate the recruitment of patients outside of major metropolitan areas. The study is a pragmatic, multicenter, randomised, placebo-controlled, two-arm trial of escalating doses of an oral 1:20 THC/CBD medicinal cannabinoid preparation (10 mg THC:200 mg CBD/mL). It will compare the efficacy and safety outcomes of a titrated dose range of 2.5 mg THC/50mgCBD to 30 mg THC/600 mg CBD per day against a placebo. There is a 2-week patient-determined titration phase, to reach a dose that achieves symptom relief or intolerable side effects, with a further 2 weeks of assessment on the final dose. The primary objective is to assess the effect of escalating doses of a 1:20 THC/CBD medicinal cannabinoid preparation against placebo on change in total symptom distress score, with secondary objectives including establishing a patient-determined effective dose, the effect on sleep quality and overall quality of life. Some patients will be enrolled in a sub-study which will more rigorously evaluate the effect on sleep. MedCan-3 is a high-quality, adequately powered, placebo-controlled trial which will help demonstrate the utility of a THC:CBD 1:20 oral medicinal cannabis product in reducing total symptom distress in this population. Secondary outcomes may lead to new hypotheses regarding medicinal cannabis' role in particular symptoms or in particular cancers. The sleep sub-study will test the feasibility of using actigraphy and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) in this cohort.

Using similar indicators in both studies, our goal was to affirm the potential for nationally representative cross-sectional analyses (HBSC) to replicate findings found in a longitudinal non-representative data source (COMPASS), enhancing opportunity for causal inferences. Data were collected from grade 9 and 10 Canadian students participating in the 2017/18 HBSC (n=8462) and 2017/18 to 2018/19 waves of COMPASS (n=32,023). Using multivariable Poisson regression models, the strength and statistical significance of the effects of mental health indicators on cannabis use outcomes were estimated within both studies and compared for consistency. Using a 2-year linked sample of students participating in COMPASS, models examining the impact of mental health indicators on cannabis use initiation and maintenance over time were similarly fit using Poisson regression to estimate relative risk. Similar associations between mental health problems and cannabis use were observed in both data sources. The direction, magnitude, and precision of the estimates for restless sleep, loneliness, poor wellbeing, and cannabis use were highly comparable across both studies. Worse mental health was consistently associated with current and lifetime cannabis use among youth. Cross-sectional and longitudinal findings from two large methodologically diverse studies in Canada demonstrate a replicable association between indicators of mental health and youth cannabis use. Similarities were identified and two generalizations may be concluded: 1) potentially causal etiological relationships inferred from HBSC data were supported in longitudinal findings based on COMPASS, and 2) longitudinal COMPASS data aligns with nationally representative data from HBSC.

241,133,133,34052339,"Medical cannabis access has been legalized in more than 30 countries worldwide and popularity among patients is increasing rapidly. Cannabinoid-based treatments have been shown to be beneficial for several symptoms such as chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, spasticity, chronic pain, intractable seizures and insomnia, yet high-quality clinical trials are still limited. As millions of patients now have legal access to medical cannabis, little information is available about the development of best clinical practices and an effective medical cannabis clinic model. A medical cannabis clinic is an innovative and emergent practice model that may be necessary to bridge the gap between patient and healthcare provider interest and existing barriers to the prescription of medical cannabis treatments, such as limited medical education, lack of high-quality clinical research and challenging or evolving regulatory frameworks. In this paper, we describe the model of care and organization of a dedicated medical cannabis clinic operating in Quebec, Canada since 2014. We share the principles of medical cannabis practice, including the structure of its medical and support team, clinic organisation and procedure guidelines. Key clinic statistics and patient demographics are shared with year by year comparison. Operating since 2014, the clinic has endured a rapidly changing regulatory landscape in Canada, overcoming numerous challenges including medical and social stigma, limited funding, resources and institutional support combined with a high demand for services. To support medical cannabis leaders globally, an important knowledge-sharing is required. The clinic has expanded to a network of four clinic sites across Quebec and offers continuing education and preceptorships to health care providers and trainees as well as research services to both academic and industry partners. The description of the clinic offers guidance on medical cannabis treatment and care and discusses possible solutions to associated challenges. The clinic model of care can be adapted to different healthcare settings and regulatory frameworks; it may assist physicians and health care providers in the development of medical cannabis clinics or the implementation of best practices as medical cannabis access continues to evolve.

The age groups were compared on several measures of cannabis use, motives and medical conditions using one-way ANOVAs, chi-square tests and linear regression analyses. All three age groups had similar frequency of cannabis use over the past month; however, the quantity of cannabis used and rates of problematic cannabis use were higher among younger users relative to middle-aged and older adults. The association between age and problematic cannabis use was moderated by age of regular use initiation such that earlier age of regular cannabis use onset was associated with more problematic use in the younger users, but not among older users. Middle-aged adults were more likely to report using medical cannabis for insomnia, while older adults were more likely to use medical cannabis for chronic medical problems such as cancer, glaucoma and HIV/AIDS. Younger participants reported cannabis use when bored at a greater rate than middle-aged and older adults. Findings suggest that there is an age-related risk for problematic cannabis use among medical cannabis users, such that younger users should be monitored for cannabis use patterns that may lead to deleterious consequences.

249,141,141,30822492,"The use of Cannabis for medical purposes is rapidly expanding and is usually employed as a self-medication for the treatment of insomnia disorder. However, the effect on sleep seems to depend on multiple factors such as composition of the Cannabis, dosage and route of administration. Vaporization is the recommended route for the administration of Cannabis for medical purposes; however, there is no published research about the effects of vaporized Cannabis on sleep, neither in laboratory animals, nor in humans. Because previous reports suggested that low doses of THC have sedating effects, the aim of the present study was to characterize in rats, the acute effects on sleep induced by the administration of low doses of THC by means of vaporization of a specific type of Cannabis (THC 11.5% and negligible amounts of other cannabinoids). For this purpose, polysomnographic recordings in chronically prepared rats were performed during 6 h in the light and dark phases. Animals were treated with 0 (control), 40, 80 and 200 mg of Cannabis immediately before the beginning of recordings; the THC plasma concentrations with these doses were low (up to 6.7 ng/mL with 200 mg). A quantitative EEG analyses by means of the spectral power and coherence estimations was also performed for the highest Cannabis dose. Compared to control, 200 mg of Cannabis increased NREM sleep time during the light phase, but only during the first hour of recording. Interestingly, no changes on sleep were observed during the dark (active) phase or with lower doses of Cannabis. Cannabis 200 mg also produced EEG power reductions in different cortices, mainly for high frequency bands during W and REM sleep, but only during the light phase. On the contrary, a reduction in the sleep spindles intra-hemispheric coherence was observed during NREM sleep, but only during the dark phase. In conclusion, administration of low doses of THC by vaporization of a specific type of Cannabis produced a small increment of NREM sleep, but only during the light (resting) phase. This was accompanied by subtle modifications of high frequency bands power (during the light phase) and spindle coherence (during the dark phase), which are associated with cognitive processing. Our results reassure the importance of exploring the sleep-promoting properties of Cannabis.

Breakdown of the mucosal barrier (mucositis) is a common and early side effect of many anti-cancer agents, known to contribute (in part) to a range of highly burdensome symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, infection, malnutrition, fatigue, depression, and insomnia. Here, we outline a rationale for how, based on its already documented effects on the gastrointestinal microenvironment, medicinal cannabis could be used to control mucositis and prevent the constellation of symptoms with which it is associated.

Between-person analyses showed that individuals who used MC products with higher CBD concentrations reported fewer early awakenings. These preliminary results indicate that future research should test causal relations between MC use and sleep problems in PTSD patients. Future research is warranted in order to explore causal relationships between MC use, nightmares and insomnia in PTSD patients.

However, the shared genetic basis and potential causal relationships between sleep-related traits and brain disorders are yet to be fully elucidated. Utilizing linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and bidirectional two-sample univariable Mendelian Randomization (UVMR) analyses with large-scale GWAS datasets, we investigated the genetic correlations and causal associations across six sleep traits and 24 prevalent brain disorders. Additionally, a multivariable Mendelian Randomization (MVMR) analysis evaluated the cumulative effects of various sleep traits on each brain disorder, complemented by genetic loci characterization to pinpoint pertinent genes and pathways. LDSC analysis identified significant genetic correlations in 66 out of 144 (45.8 %) pairs between sleep-related traits and brain disorders, with the most pronounced correlations observed in psychiatric disorders (66 %, 48/72). UVMR analysis identified 29 causal relationships (FDR<0.05) between sleep traits and brain disorders, with 19 associations newly discovered according to our knowledge. Notably, major depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, cannabis use disorder, and anorexia nervosa showed bidirectional causal relations with sleep traits, especially insomnia's marked influence on major depression (IVW beta 0.468, FDR = 5.24E-09). MVMR analysis revealed a nuanced interplay among various sleep traits and their impact on brain disorders. Genetic loci characterization underscored potential genes, such as HOXB2, while further enrichment analyses illuminated the importance of synaptic processes in these relationships.

Models adjusted for sociodemographic, health behavior, and clinical characteristics were stratified by race-ethnicity and by race-ethnicity along with sex/gender, and age, separately. Over half of adults reported cannabis use (52%-ever/lifetime vs 48%-never). We identified two latent classes: multiple sleep disturbances with daytime sleepiness and no sleep disturbances with some daytime sleepiness. Prevalence of multiple sleep disturbances with daytime sleepiness was higher among participants reporting lifetime cannabis use (23% vs 20%).

257,149,149,33509412,"Veterans have high rates of cannabis use, and rates of cannabis use disorder (CUD) are rising among this population. These rising rates are particularly true for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is common among veterans of recent conflicts, Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND). Although prior work has documented links between PTSD and cannabis use, a better understanding of the intersection among CUD, PTSD, and other disorders in real-world clinical practice can inform prevention and treatment efforts. This study examined the prevalence and comorbidities of CUD and PTSD in OFE/OIF/OND veterans. The study analyzed data from the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse (2010-2016) for returning war veterans who were diagnosed with CUD (N = 46,268). The study determined prevalence of PTSD, and examined additional differences in comorbidities. The prevalence of a comorbid PTSD diagnosis among OEF/OIF/OND veterans with a CUD diagnosis was 72.3%. Further analysis revealed additional co-occurring disorders. Veterans with a diagnosis of CUD and PTSD were more likely to have a comorbid diagnosis of depression (odds ratio, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.62-1.71), panic disorder (odds ratio; 1.58; 95% CI, 1.43-1.75), alcohol use disorder (odds ratio; 1.30; 95% CI, 1.24-1.35), opioid use disorder (odds ratio; 1.52; 95% CI, 1.43-1.62), and insomnia (odds ratio; 1.74; 95% CI, 1.65-1.84) than veterans without a PTSD diagnosis. Findings highlight that the majority of returning war veterans with CUD are highly complex.

259,151,151,30361897,"About 30% of regular cannabis users report withdrawal symptoms on cessation of prolonged use, such as irritability, insomnia, decreased appetite, depressed mood, anxiety, and restlessness. However, among highly dependent and/or in-treatment users, the incidence of withdrawal can be even higher, reaching up to 50-95% of individuals. This syndrome was only recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) as a diagnosis with specific criteria in 2013. The treatment options are poor, with high rates of relapse and non-responders. In this scenario, agonist replacement therapy with cannabinoids has demonstrated potential as a promising therapeutic intervention, with a series of studies having been carried out in recent years. This review sought to summarize trials with cannabinoid agonist replacement therapy for cannabis withdrawal symptoms with the aim of evaluating the efficacy of this pharmacological intervention. We entered the following search terms on the PubMed, Web of Science and PsycINFO databases: (marijuana OR marihuana OR cannabis OR THC OR tetrahydrocannabinol OR hashish OR pot) AND (treatment OR medication) AND (withdrawal OR abstinence) AND (dronabinol OR nabilone OR nabiximols OR sativex OR cesamet OR synthetic cannabinoid). The date of the most recent search was September 2017. Original trials, published in English, performed on humans and dealing with cannabis users who were treated for cannabis withdrawal symptoms using synthetic cannabinoids were all included in the present systematic review. Quality and risk of bias across studies were assessed using a Cochrane tool. The first, second, and last authors read the abstracts of all studies found in the search (n = 243). The inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, and 233 articles were excluded. The first and second authors independently developed a data extraction sheet based on the included articles. The present review included ten original articles. Despite the limited number of studies and methodological differences, our findings demonstrate that the use of dronabinol, nabilone, or nabiximols, either alone or in combination with other drugs, shows promise in reducing cannabis withdrawal symptoms, probably with a dose-dependent effect. This has also been considered a safe group of medications with good tolerability and few adverse effects. No method of handling data and combining results of studies was carried out, representing a limitation of the review. Cannabinoids appear to be a promising group of drugs for the treatment of cannabis withdrawal symptoms. These medications may help decrease the rate of relapse in the treatment of cannabis dependence due to withdrawal symptoms occurring within the first few weeks of treatment.

Depending on the estrous cycle phase, the transcription of prepro-orexin mRNA, post-translational modification of orexin peptide, and abundance of orexin receptors change in a brain region-specific manner. The most dramatic changes occur in the hypothalamus, which is considered the starting point of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis as well as the hub of orexin-producing neurons. Thus, hypothalamus-regulated behaviors, including arousal, feeding, reward processing, and the stress response depend on coordinated efforts between E2, progesterone, and the orexin system.

We examined differences between those providing data pre- and post-university closure via linear and negative binomial regressions. Alcohol and cannabis use days were 13 % and 24 % higher, respectively, from pre-to post-university closure; also, prevalence of any 30-day alcohol use and alcohol use consequences were both higher in the post-closure sample (odds ratios = 1.34 and 1.31, respectively). In contrast, days of binge alcohol use were 4 % lower in the post-closing sample. Depressive symptoms and anger were both modestly higher in post-closing participants (d < 0.1), with no differences in anxiety symptoms or insomnia. The modest differences in substance use and mental health from pre-closure through two months post-college closure suggest unexpected resilience in a large and diverse sample of students.

This review aims to synthesize recent literature on the impacts of MC use in older adults and identify critical knowledge gaps to be addressed in future research. Recent literature showed that older adults often face financial and/or educational barriers and stigma associated with MC access. Emerging data showed that MC may have therapeutic effects on symptoms of conditions such as chronic pain, insomnia, anxiety/depression, dementia, nausea, and vomiting. However, available evidence is inconsistent and tends to rely on self-report and uncontrolled studies. While some adverse events associated with MC use were reported, it is generally well tolerated in older adults. Neurocognitive and psychological consequences and cardiovascular risks have been reported but again only in limited studies with inconsistent findings. There is a need for more systematic and rigorous research on MC in older adults to determine its safety and efficacy.

A cross-sectional survey was administered to a convenience sample of English-speaking pregnant women receiving prenatal care at Geisinger, May-June 2019. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to construct three scores (overwhelmed/exhausted, happy/optimistic, and health worries) based on 10 questions regarding common experiences during pregnancy (e.g., nausea/vomiting, pain, exhaustion, mood). A score based on four questions regarding cannabis safety during pregnancy was also constructed. From a maximum of 300 surveys distributed, 284 were completed (95%). Most participants were white (87%), married (49%) or living with a partner (38%), and had private health insurance (62%). Most women indicated it was unsafe to use alcohol and tobacco products during pregnancy (> 90%), but that proportion dropped to 82% and 63% regarding recreational cannabis and medical cannabis, respectively. Only women with prior cannabis use (23% of sample) continued to do so during pregnancy: 57% of women reporting daily cannabis use prior to pregnancy continued to use cannabis during pregnancy with 33% reporting daily use. Two thirds of users during pregnancy indicated they were self-medicating for: nausea (90%), anxiety (70%), insomnia (30%), and pain management (30%). Many (56%) of the women who used cannabis during pregnancy believed it is safe. Younger women and women who were overwhelmed/exhausted or less happy/optimistic were more likely to believe cannabis use is safe. Women valued healthcare provider advice more than advice from family and friends. Study strengths include a high response rate. Weaknesses include self-report and that is was a convenience sample; however, the demographics of the sample were similar to past studies. Women with a history of cannabis use, especially daily use, are at risk of continuing during pregnancy and should receive counseling.

Due to a further increase in tics, the parents therefore decided to implement a regular treatment with a combination of vaporized medicinal cannabis (up to 0.1 g cannabis per day, varieties Bedrocan and Amnesia Haze, corresponding to 22 mg THC/day) plus orally administered oil-based THC drops (maximum daily dose = 12.5 mg THC) resulting in a marked tic reduction. During a visit in our clinic, we were able to observe the reported beneficial effects 30 min after vaporization of 0.15 g cannabis (Amnesia Haze, equivalent to 33 mg THC; in addition, 7 mg oral THC were taken at home 6 h before the visit): tics, premonitory urges, and overall impairment significantly improved according to self-ratings, parent and clinician questionnaires. Importantly, no adverse events were reported. From this single case study, it is suggested that cannabis-based medicines and their combination (such as oral THC plus vaporized medicinal cannabis) are effective and safe in the treatment of severe tics in minors with TS. However, long-term follow-up is needed to confirm the beneficial treatment effects. We want to emphasize that in this boy treatment with cannabis was initiated by the parents before a consultation in our clinic has taken place. In our opinion, treatment with cannabis-based medicine in children should be regarded as a last-line treatment, when well-established treatments have failed to improve tics.

Supraphysiologic-dose AAS induces androgen abnormalities and excess oxidative stress, which have been linked to increased and decreased expression or activity of proteins that synthesize and eliminate, respectively, Aβ and tau-P. Aβ and tau-P accumulation may begin soon after initiating supraphysiologic-dose AAS use, which typically occurs in the early 20s, and their accumulation may be accelerated by other psychoactive substance use, which is common among non-medical AAS users. Accordingly, the widespread use of supraphysiologic-dose AAS may increase the numbers of people who develop dementia. Early diagnosis and correction of sex-steroid level abnormalities and excess oxidative stress could attenuate risk for developing AD/ADRD in supraphysiologic-dose AAS users, in people with other substance use disorders, and in people with low sex-steroid levels or excess oxidative stress associated with aging.

This study examines the time elapsed between cannabis use and sleep start time and its association with two of the main indicators of sleep continuity: (1) sleep onset latency (SOL) and (2) number of awakenings (NOA) throughout the night. Each morning, for 7 consecutive days, daily cannabis users (n = 54) reported on the timing of previous night's cannabis use and sleep indicators on their smartphones. Mixed effects models examined the relations of within- and between-subjects' time elapsed between previous night cannabis use and sleep start time, with (1) SOL and (2) NOA. Within subjects, shorter time elapsed between cannabis use and sleep start time was associated with shorter SOL (β = 0.519, p = 0.010), but not NOA (β = -0.030, p = 0.535). Furthermore, between individuals, the time gap between the previous night cannabis use and sleep start time was not associated with SOL or NOA (p > 0.05). It is possible that cannabis use proximal to bedtime is associated with shorted sleep onset latency but not nighttime awakenings. Cannabis users should be informed about both the potential sleep aid effects of cannabis and its limitations.

We also searched for on-going studies via ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal. All searches included also non-English language literature. All relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the safety and efficacy of cannabis (including extracts and tinctures) compared with placebo or other pharmacological agents were included. Three authors independently evaluated the titles and abstracts of studies identified in the literature searches for their eligibility. For studies considered eligible, we retrieved full texts. Three investigators independently extracted data. For the assessment of the quality of evidence, we used the standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane and GRADE working Group. 41 trials (4,550 participants) were included; 15 studies considered efficacy and safety of cannabis for patients with multiple sclerosis, 12 for patients with chronic pain, and 14 for patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy. The included studies were published between 1975 and 2015, and the majority of them were conducted in Europe. We judged almost 50% of these studies to be at low risk of bias. The large majority (80%) of the comparisons were with placebo; only 8 studies included patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy comparing cannabis with other antiemetic drugs. Concerning the efficacy of cannabis (compared with placebo) in patients with multiple sclerosis, confidence in the estimate was high in favour of cannabis for spasticity (numerical rating scale and visual analogue scale, but not the Ashworth scale) and pain. For chronic and neuropathic pain (compared with placebo), there was evidence of a small effect; however, confidence in the estimate is low and these results could not be considered conclusive. There is uncertainty whether cannabis, including extracts and tinctures, compared with placebo or other antiemetic drugs reduces nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer requiring chemotherapy, although the confidence in the estimate of the effect was low or very low. In the included studies, many adverse events were reported and none of the studies assessed the development of abuse or dependence. there is incomplete evidence of the efficacy and safety of medical use of cannabis in the clinical contexts considered in this review. Furthermore, for many of the outcomes considered, the confidence in the estimate of the effect was again low or very low.

Outcome measurements including DASS-21 (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress subscales); Insomnia Severity Index (ISI); and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), were performed at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12 and 24. Each was analysed as continuous outcomes and as binary cases based on validated clinical cut-offs. Among those whose DASS and ISI scores were in the moderate to severe range at baseline, after controlling for cannabis use, there was a gradual decrease in severity of symptoms over the course of the trial. BPI decreased significantly until week 12 and then rose again in the post-treatment period during weeks 12-24. Neither pharmacotherapy type (nabiximols vs placebo) nor number of counselling sessions contributed significant explanatory power to any of the models and were excluded from the final analyses for both continuous and categorical outcomes. Participants in this trial who qualified as cases at baseline had elevated comorbidity symptoms.

We sought to explore how different intentions for cannabis use relate to social, structural, and behavioural factors among PWUD in Vancouver, Canada. We used data from cannabis-using participants in two community-recruited prospective cohort studies of PWUD. Using latent class analysis, we identified discrete cannabis-using groups based on self-reported intentions for use. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine correlates of class membership. Between June 2016 and December 2018, 2,686 observations from 897 participants cannabis-using PWUD were analyzed. Four latent classes of cannabis use emerged: Class 1 (31.6%), characterized by non-medical purposes; Class 2 (37.5%), characterized by non-pain therapeutic use (e.g., stress, nausea/loss of appetite, and insomnia); characterized by Class 3 (21.9%) predominantly pain relief; and Class 4 (9.0%), characterized by a wide range of therapeutic uses in addition to pain management, including insomnia, stress, nausea/loss of appetite, and harm reduction. Class-specific structural, substance-, and health-related differences were observed, including indicators of better physical and mental health among the ""recreational"" class, despite evidence of more structural vulnerabilities (e.g., homelessness, incarceration).

When inhaled or delivered orally or transdermally, cannabinoids (the psychoactive components of unrefined marijuana and various derivative products) activate endogenous cannabinoid receptors, modulating neurotransmitter release and producing a wide range of central nervous system effects, including increased pleasure and alteration of memory processes. Those effects provide a pharmacologic rationale for the use of cannabinoids to manage the three core PTSD symptom clusters: reexperiencing, avoidance and numbing, and hyperarousal. A literature search identified 11 articles pertaining to cannabis use by military veterans who met standard diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Cross-sectional studies have found a direct correlation between more severe PTSD symptomatology and increased motivation to use cannabis for coping purposes, especially among patients with difficulties in emotional regulation or stress tolerance. Data from 4 small studies suggested that cannabinoid use was associated with global improvements in PTSD symptoms or amelioration of specific PTSD symptoms such as insomnia and nightmares. Large well-designed controlled trials are needed in order to better delineate the potential role of cannabinoids as an adjunct or alternative to conventional approaches to PTSD management. While further research into cannabinoid treatment effects on PTSD symptoms is required, the evaluated evidence indicates that substantial numbers of military veterans with PTSD use cannabis or derivative products to control PTSD symptoms, with some patients reporting benefits in terms of reduced anxiety and insomnia and improved coping ability.

Using cross-sectional data, this study examined negative mood as a mediator of the association between insomnia and marijuana problems among male and female college students. Undergraduate students (n = 267; 61% female) reporting marijuana use in the past month completed an online survey assessing insomnia symptoms, negative mood and marijuana problems. Controlling for relevant covariates, negative mood was examined as a mediator of the association between insomnia and marijuana problems using bootstrapped significance tests for indirect effects (n-boot = 1,000). Results indicated that higher levels of insomnia were associated with greater levels of negative mood (regardless of sex), which in turn were associated with greater marijuana-related problems. In conclusion, insomnia symptoms are associated with more negative mood among college students who use marijuana, and this effect on negative mood accounts for a large part of the association of insomnia symptoms with marijuana-related problems. Research is needed to determine if these associations are maintained prospectively.

General practitioners (GPs) are at the forefront of MC prescribing and recent years have seen substantial increases in prescription numbers. This study examined the current knowledge, experiences, and attitudes of Australian GPs around MC. We also compared our findings to those of an earlier 2017 investigation. We conducted a cross-sectional study using a 42-item on-line questionnaire adapted from our earlier 2017 survey. The current survey was completed by GPs attending an on-line, multi-topic educational seminar. Australian GPs (n = 505) completed the survey between November 2021 and February 2022. Data were synthesised using descriptive statistics. MC 'prescribers' and 'non-prescribers' responses were compared using Pearson's χ2 tests. While most GPs (85.3%) had received patient enquiries about MC during the last three months, only half (52.3%) felt comfortable discussing MC with patients. Around one fifth (21.8%) had prescribed a MC product. GPs strongly supported MC prescribing for palliative care, cancer pain, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and epilepsy, more so than in our 2017 survey. Prescribing for mental health conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety) and insomnia received less support. Opioids, benzodiazepines, and chemotherapy drugs were rated as more hazardous than MC. GPs correctly endorsed concerns around Δ Acceptance of MC as a treatment option has increased among Australian GPs since 2017.

A descriptive, cross-sectional correlational study with internal comparisons was conducted during the 26 The final sample population consisted of 232 nurses and midwives (response rate of 46.4%). In total, 67(28.9%) participants were male, and 165(71.1%) were female. Cypriot nurses and midwives reported lack of knowledge regarding the risks and benefits about MC use to patients. However, specific number of participants believed MC use was considered acceptable for the patients with persistent muscle spasms, insomnia/sleeping disorders, mental health conditions, and terminal illnesses. The vast majority of the participants believed that formal training on MC should be integrated into academic programs, and expressed the necessity of urgent training under the current curriculum, as well as, educational training programs about MC use should be integrated into the practice/clinical practice. Concerning the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants, gender had a statistically significant positive effect on participants' attitudes and beliefs about MC (p < 0.01, 26.8% vs. 13.4%).

293,185,185,17101054,"Cannabis, in herbal form, is widely used as self-medication by patients with diseases such as HIV/AIDS and multiple sclerosis suffering from symptoms including pain, muscle spasticity, stress and insomnia. Valid clinical studies of herbal cannabis require a product which is acceptable to patients in order to maximize adherence to study protocols. We conducted a randomized controlled crossover trial of 4 different herbal cannabis preparations among 8 experienced and authorized cannabis users with chronic pain. Preparations were varied with respect to grind size, THC content and humidity. Subjects received each preparation on a separate day and prepared the drug in their usual way in a dedicated and licensed clinical facility. They were asked to evaluate the products based on appearance (smell, colour, humidity, grind size, ease of preparation and overall appearance) and smoking characteristics (burn rate, hotness, harshness and taste). Five-point Likert scores were assigned to each characteristic. Scores were compared between preparations using ANOVA. Seven subjects completed the study, and the product with highest THC content (12%), highest humidity (14%) and largest grind size (10 mm) was rated highest overall. Significant differences were noted between preparations on overall appearance and colour (p = 0.003).

For instance, the percentage of the aging population accessing cannabis is growing substantially, outpacing other age groups. The goals of this study were to describe the acute effects of cannabis, subjective experiences of withdrawal, and beliefs around the addictiveness of cannabis, as well as to determine whether these effects differ as a function of age or reason for use (medical vs. recreational use). It was hypothesized that medical users and younger users would report fewer adverse effects. Survey responses from 2905 cannabis users were analyzed. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses were used to compare group percentages after statistically controlling for confounding differences in their demographic and cannabis use characteristics. The most commonly endorsed acute effects were improved sleep, more calm/peaceful, desire to eat, more creative, and dry mouth; while the most commonly endorsed withdrawal symptoms were irritability, insomnia, and anxiety. Relative to recreational users, medical users were less likely to report undesirable acute effects but were more likely to report undesirable withdrawal symptoms. Older (50+) individuals reported fewer undesirable acute effects and withdrawal symptoms compared with younger users (18-29). Only 17% of the total sample reported believing that cannabis is addictive, and this did not vary as a function of reason for use. Older people and medical users appear to experience acute and withdrawal effects of cannabis differently than recreational and younger users, perhaps because these groups benefit more from the medicinal properties of cannabis.

296,188,188,33970291,"The therapeutic potential of medical cannabis to treat a variety of conditions is becoming increasingly recognised. Globally, a large number of countries have now legalised cannabis for medical uses and a substantial number of patients are able to access their medications. Yet in the UK, where medical cannabis was legalised in November 2018, only a handful of NHS prescriptions have been written, meaning that most patients are unable to access the medicine. Reasons for this are manyfold and include the perceived lack of clinical evidence due to the challenges of studying medical cannabis through randomised controlled trials. In order to develop the current evidence base, the importance of incorporating real-world data (RWD) to assess the effectiveness and efficacy of medical cannabis has gradually become recognised. The current paper provides a detailed outline of Project Twenty21 (T21), the UK's first medical cannabis registry, launched in August 2020. We provide the rationale for T21 and describe the methodology before reporting the characteristics of the 'first patients' enrolled in the registry. We describe the health status of all patients enrolled into the project during its first 7 months of operation and the sociodemographic characteristics and primary presenting conditions for these patients, as well as details of the medical cannabis prescribed to these individuals. By 12th March 2021, 678 people had been enrolled into T21; the majority (64%) were male and their average age was 38.7 years (range = 18-80). The most commonly reported primary conditions were chronic pain (55.6%) and anxiety disorders (32.0%) and they reported high levels of multi-morbidity, including high rates of insomnia and depression. We also present preliminary evidence from 75 patients followed up after 3 months indicating that receipt of legal, prescribed cannabis was associated with a significant increase in self-reported health, assessed using the visual analogue scale of the EQ-5D-5L (Cohen's d = .77, 95% CI = .51-1.03). Our initial findings complement reports from other large-scale databases globally, indicating that the current RWD is building up a pattern of evidence. With many clinicians demanding better and faster evidence to inform their decisions around prescribing medical cannabis, the current and future results of T21 will expand the existing evidence base on the effectiveness of cannabis-based medical products (CBMPs).

A battery of five instruments was computer-administered daily to measure psychological, sensory, and physical symptoms associated with cannabinoid intoxication and withdrawal. Plasma and oral fluid specimens were concurrently collected and analyzed for cannabinoids. Outcome variables were evaluated as change from admission (Day 0) with regression models. Most abstinence effects, including irritability and anxiety were greatest on Days 0-3 and decreased thereafter. Cannabis craving significantly decreased over time, whereas decreased appetite began to normalize on Day 4. Strange dreams and difficulty getting to sleep increased over time, suggesting intrinsic sleep problems in chronic cannabis smokers. Symptoms likely induced by residual drug effects were at maximum intensity on admission and positively correlated with plasma and oral fluid cannabinoid concentrations on admission but not afterward; these symptoms showed overall prevalence higher than cannabis withdrawal symptoms. The combined influence of residual/offset drug effects, withdrawal, and craving was observed in chronic cannabis smokers during monitored abstinence. Abstinence symptoms were generally more intense in the initial phase, implying importance of early intervention in cannabis quit attempts.

The primary aim of the study was to establish in a large sample whether insomnia and paranoia are associated more strongly than by chance. Cross-sectional data on paranoia, insomnia, anxiety, worry, depression, irritability, and cannabis use were obtained from the second British National Survey of Psychiatric Morbidity, a general population survey of adults aged 16-74 years living in Great Britain (N = 8580). It was found that insomnia was associated with an approximately two to threefold increase in paranoid thinking. Paranoia and insomnia were both strongly associated with the presence of anxiety, worry, depression, irritability and cannabis use. In a path analysis the association of paranoia and insomnia was partially explained by the affective symptoms, and, to a much lesser degree, cannabis use. The results are consistent with recent developments in the cognitive understanding of persecutory delusions, in which insomnia, negative affect, and substance use are identified as key factors. Longitudinal studies of insomnia and paranoia, and tests of the effects of sleep interventions on levels of paranoia, are now required to examine causality.

Survey of 95 non-randomly assigned MC users. A two-sided chi-square test followed by Bonferroni post hoc multiple comparison and Fisher exact test were used to determine correlations. The Cronbach α was used to determine internal consistency. Announcements on 13 MC websites with links to SurveyMonkey.com. Self-identified MC users. Web survey. Species effects were compared regarding health symptoms, conditions, purpose, route, and trust in product label. Trust in the purity, the route of administration, or the purpose (recreational vs. medicinal) did not differ between the two species. A preference for C. indica was statistically significant for pain management (p=0.001), helping with sedation (p=0.015), and sleep (p<0.001). C. sativa was preferred for euphoria (p<0.001) and enhancing energy (p=0.022). The conditions reaching statistical significance for C. indica preference were: nonmigraine headaches (p=0.042), glaucoma (p=0.036), neuropathy (p=0.024), spasticity (p=0.048), seizures (p=0.031), insomnia (p<0.001), and joint pain (p=0.048). For C. sativa, no conditions reached significance. The MC websites' descriptions of effects that agreed with the survey results are listed. Some conditions had very few respondents. The internal consistency/reliability (Cronbach α) was adequate for the condition scale but not for the symptom survey.

Tolerance to cannabis-induced cardiovascular and autonomic changes, decreased intraocular pressure, sleep and sleep EEG, mood and behavioral changes is acquired and, to a great degree, lost rapidly with optimal conditions. Mechanisms appear more functional than metabolic. Acquisition rate depends on dose and dose schedule. Dependence, manifested by withdrawal symptoms after as little as 7 days of THC administration, is characterized by irritability, restlessness, insomnia, anorexia, nausea, sweating, salivation, increased body temperature, altered sleep and waking EEG, tremor, and weight loss. Mild and transient in the 120 subjects studied, the syndrome was similar to sedative drug withdrawal. Tolerance to drug side effects can be useful. Tolerance to therapeutic effects or target symptoms poses problems. Clinical significance of dependence is difficult to assess since drug-seeking behavior has many determinants.

Both trials had the primary aim of establishing the HIV prevention efficacy of long-acting injectable cabotegravir pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) compared with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine daily oral PrEP. Long-acting PrEP was associated with diagnostic delays and integrase strand-transfer inhibitor (INSTI) resistance. This report presents findings from the first unblinded year of the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 083 study. The HPTN 083 randomised controlled trial enrolled HIV-uninfected cisgender men and transgender women at elevated HIV risk who have sex with men, from 43 clinical research sites in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the USA. Inclusion criteria included: a negative HIV serological test at the screening and study entry, undetectable HIV RNA levels within 14 days of study entry, age 18 years or older, overall good health as determined by clinical and laboratory evaluations, and a creatinine clearance of 60 mL/min or higher. Participants were randomly allocated to receive long-acting injectable cabotegravir or daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine PrEP. After study unblinding, participants remained on their original regimen awaiting an extension study. HIV infections were characterised retrospectively at a central laboratory. Here we report the secondary analysis of efficacy and safety for the first unblinded year. The primary outcome was incident HIV infection. Efficacy analyses were done on the modified intention-to-treat population using a Cox regression model. Adverse events were compared across treatment groups and time periods (blinded vs unblinded). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02720094. Of the 4488 participants who contributed person-time to the blinded analysis, 3290 contributed person-time to the first unblinded year analysis between May 15, 2020, and May 14, 2021. Updated HIV incidence in the blinded phase was 0·41 per 100 person-years for long-acting injectable cabotegravir PrEP and 1·29 per 100 person-years for daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine PrEP (hazard ratio [HR] 0·31 [95% CI 0·17-0·58], p=0·0003). HIV incidence in the first unblinded year was 0·82 per 100 person-years for long-acting PrEP and 2·27 per 100 person-years for daily oral PrEP (HR 0·35 [0·18-0·69], p=0·002). Adherence to both study products decreased after study unblinding. Additional infections in the long-acting PrEP group included two with on-time injections; three with one or more delayed injections; two detected with long-acting PrEP reinitiation; and 11 more than 6 months after their last injection. Infection within 6 months of cabotegravir exposure was associated with diagnostic delays and INSTI resistance. Adverse events were generally consistent with previous reports; incident hypertension in the long-acting PrEP group requires further investigation. Long-acting injectable cabotegravir PrEP retained high efficacy for HIV prevention in men and transgender women who have sex with men during the first year of open-label follow-up, with a near-identical HR for HIV risk reduction between long-acting injectable cabotegravir and daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine PrEP during the first year after unblinding compared with the blinded period.

315,7,7,32992787,"Most myeloid lineage cells express the receptor and coreceptors that make them susceptible to infection by primate lentiviruses (SIVs and HIVs). However, macrophages are the only myeloid lineage cell commonly infected by SIVs and/or HIVs. The frequency of infected macrophages varies greatly across specific host and virus combinations as well as disease states, with infection rates being greatest in pathogenic SIV infections of non-natural hosts (i.e., Asian nonhuman primates (Asian NHPs)) and late in untreated HIV-1 infection. In contrast, macrophages from natural SIV hosts (i.e., African NHPs) are largely resistant to infection due to entry and/or post-entry restriction mechanisms. These highly variable rates of macrophage infection may stem from differences in the host immune environment, entry and post-entry restriction mechanisms, the ability of a virus to adapt to efficiently infect macrophages, and the pleiotropic effects of macrophage-tropism including the ability to infect cells lacking CD4 and increased neutralization sensitivity. Questions remain about the relationship between rates of macrophage infection and viral pathogenesis, with some evidence suggesting that elevated levels of macrophage infection may contribute to greater pathogenesis in non-natural SIV hosts. Alternatively, extensive infection of macrophages may only emerge in the context of high viral loads and immunodeficiency, making it a symptom of highly pathogenic infections, not a primary driver of pathogenesis.

In the US, nearly one-fifth of all new HIV infections occur among women, and women from racial and ethnic minority communities experience disproportionately high rates of new HIV infections. Thus, there is a need to develop and implement effective HIV prevention strategies for women in the US and internationally, with a specific need to advance strategies in minority communities. Previous studies have demonstrated that oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), the use of antiretroviral medications by HIV-uninfected persons to prevent HIV acquisition, can reduce HIV incidence among women who are adherent to PrEP. However, to date, awareness and uptake of PrEP among women have been very limited, suggesting a need for innovative strategies to increase the knowledge of and access to PrEP among women in diverse settings. This narrative review summarizes the efficacy and safety data of PrEP in women, discusses considerations related to medication adherence for women who use PrEP, and highlights behavioral, social, and structural barriers to maximize the effectiveness of PrEP in women. It also reviews novel modalities for PrEP in women which are being developed and tested, including topical formulations and long-acting injectable agents that may offer advantages as compared to oral PrEP and proposes a community-oriented, social networking framework to increase awareness of PrEP among women. If women are provided with access to PrEP and support to overcome social and structural barriers to adhere to PrEP, this prevention strategy holds great promise to impact the HIV epidemic among women in the US and globally.

Challenges facing current drugs that are part of the established life-long antiretroviral therapy (ART) include toxicity, development of drug resistant HIV-1 strains, the cost of treatment, and the inability to eradicate the provirus from infected cells. For these reasons, novel anti-HIV-1 therapeutics that can prevent or eliminate disease progression including the onset of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are needed.

The current paper systematically reviews the literature on medical mistrust among people at risk for or living with HIV infection. The bulk of evidence from 17 studies supports medical mistrust as a barrier to HIV testing, engagement in prevention and care services, treatment uptake and adherence, and clinical outcomes. While findings mostly indicate that medical mistrust is a barrier to HIV prevention and care, some studies report null results and others suggest that medical mistrust may actually improve some HIV-related outcomes. Additionally, most of the reviewed literature was cross-sectional. Thus longitudinal, theory-driven research is needed to reconcile inconsistent findings and determine long term outcomes of medical mistrust. Interventions may then be developed to reduce the negative consequences associated with medical mistrust.

Observational studies among HIV-1 serodiscordant couples have associated ART initiation with a reduction in HIV-1 transmission risk of 80-92%, and a recent randomized trial demonstrated that earlier initiation of ART (that is, at CD4(+) T-cell counts between 350 and 550 cells/mm(3)), in the context of virological monitoring and adherence support, resulted in a 96% reduction in HIV-1 transmission. A number of ongoing and recently-completed clinical trials have assessed the efficacy of PrEP for HIV-1 prevention as pericoitally administered or daily-administered 1% tenofovir gel and daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and combination emtricitabine (FTC)/TDF.

Adherence is likely the key to efficacy of antiretrovirals for HIV-1 prevention, both as ART and PrEP. Critical unanswered questions for successful delivery of antiretroviral-based HIV-1 prevention include how to target ART and PrEP to realize maximum population benefits, whether HIV-1-infected individuals at earlier stages of infection would accept ART to reduce their risk for transmitting HIV-1 and whether highest-risk HIV-1-negative persons would use PrEP, and whether high adherence could be sustained to achieve high effectiveness.

334,26,26,36973419,"The development of persistent cellular reservoirs of latent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a critical obstacle to viral eradication since viral rebound takes place once anti-retroviral therapy (ART) is interrupted. Previous studies show that HIV persists in myeloid cells (monocytes and macrophages) in blood and tissues in virologically suppressed people with HIV (vsPWH). However, how myeloid cells contribute to the size of the HIV reservoir and what impact they have on rebound after treatment interruption remain unclear. Here we report the development of a human monocyte-derived macrophage quantitative viral outgrowth assay (MDM-QVOA) and highly sensitive T cell detection assays to confirm purity. We assess the frequency of latent HIV in monocytes using this assay in a longitudinal cohort of vsPWH (n = 10, 100% male, ART duration 5-14 yr) and find half of the participants showed latent HIV in monocytes. In some participants, these reservoirs could be detected over several years. Additionally, we assessed HIV genomes in monocytes from 30 vsPWH (27% male, ART duration 5-22 yr) utilizing a myeloid-adapted intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA) and demonstrate that intact genomes were present in 40% of the participants and higher total HIV DNA correlated with reactivatable latent reservoirs. The virus produced in the MDM-QVOA was capable of infecting bystander cells resulting in viral spread. These findings provide further evidence that myeloid cells meet the definition of a clinically relevant HIV reservoir and emphasize that myeloid reservoirs should be included in efforts towards an HIV cure.

Although frequently accompanied by local inflammatory reactions detectable in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), CNS HIV-1 infection usually is not clinically apparent. In a minority of patients, CNS HIV-1 infection evolves into encephalitis during the late stages of systemic infection, which compromises brain function and presents clinically as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome dementia complex (ADC). Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has had a major impact on all aspects of CNS HIV-1 infection and disease. In those with asymptomatic infection, ART usually effectively suppresses HIV-1 in CSF and markedly reduces the incidence of symptomatic ADC. In those presenting with ADC, ART characteristically prevents neurological progression and leads to variable, and at times substantial, recovery. Similarly, treatment has reduced CNS opportunistic infections. With better control of these severe disorders, attention has turned to the possible consequences of chronic silent infection and the issue of whether indolent, low-grade brain injury might require earlier treatment intervention.

El número de encuentros de PrEP disminuyó pero no fue significativamente diferente con el paso del tiempo (ps > .05). Los pacientes aún pudieron acceder a los servicios clínicos de PrEP durante la pandemia de COVID-19. La implementación de enfoques de entrega de PrEP que eran flexibles y oportunos en este entorno probablemente minimizó la interrupción de la atención médica de la PrEP durante COVID-19.

This critical review analyzes the current state of PrEP implementation in the United States, by reviewing barriers and innovative solutions to enhance PrEP access and uptake. Clinical care settings, public health programs, and community-based organizations (CBOs). Critical review of recent peer-reviewed literature. More than 100 papers were reviewed. PrEP is currently provided in diverse settings. Care models include sexually transmitted disease clinics, community health centers, CBOs, pharmacies, and private primary care providers (PCPs). Sexually transmitted disease clinics have staff trained in sexual health counseling and are linked to public health programs (eg, partner notification services), whereas PCPs and community health centers may be less comfortable counseling and feel time-constrained in managing PrEP. However, PCPs may be ideal PrEP providers, given their long-term relationships with patients, integrating PrEP into routine care. Collaborations with CBOs can expand PrEP care through adherence support and insurance navigation. Pharmacies can deliver PrEP, given their experience with medication dispensing and counseling, and may be more accessible for some patients, but to address other health concerns, liaisons with PCPs may be needed. PrEP implementation in the United States is moving forward with the development of diverse models of delivery. Optimal scale-up will require learning about the best features of each model and providing choices to consumers that enhance engagement and uptake.

This study examines documentation rates of pre-existing HIV/ AIDS among inpatients within psychiatric hospitals in New York State. Retrospective cohort study to examine recognition of pre-existing HIV/AIDS among psychiatric inpatients. Patient-level Medicaid claims records were linked with hospital and regional data for people admitted to psychiatric inpatient units in New York State. Presence of HIV/AIDS diagnoses prior to psychiatric hospitalization was coded for each inpatient (n = 14 602). Adjusted odds ratios of undocumented HIV/AIDS diagnoses at the time of discharge were calculated using logistic regression analyses. About 5.1% (741/14 602) of unique psychiatric inpatients had pre-existing HIV/AIDS diagnoses. Of these inpatients, 58.3% (432/741) were not coded as having HIV/AIDS upon discharge. Higher rates of missed detection were associated with younger age, non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity, shorter length of stay, more distal coding of an HIV/AIDS diagnosis, and fewer HIV/AIDS-related Medicaid claims in the past year. Hospitals with higher readmission rates also had higher rates of undetected HIV/AIDS diagnoses. Over half of inpatients previously diagnosed with HIV/AIDS did not have their HIV-positive status noted upon discharge from psychiatric hospitalization. This finding underscores how frequently clinically significant medical comorbidities fail to be incorporated into psychiatric treatment and treatment planning.

A cluster analysis was performed using data obtained from a survey administered to 128 trans women residing in Philadelphia, PA and the San Francisco Bay area, CA. Six items assessing feelings of community belongingness among trans women produced three distinct clusters. Associations were examined between cluster membership and perceptual items including beliefs about PrEP, experiences with healthcare, patient self-advocacy, and perceived trusted sources for PrEP information. Clusters were demographically comparable apart from age. There were significant differences noted between trust in various communication channels and perceptions of PrEP; the least community-connected cluster had less trust and more negative perceptions of PrEP. Analyses suggest that psychographic differences exist based on perceived community belongingness in this population, and this in turn may be consequential in determining how information about PrEP is communicated and diffused to trans women for whom PrEP may be indicated.

358,50,50,36044375,"The HIV-1 often evades a robust antiretroviral-mediated immune response, leading to persistent infection within anatomically privileged sites including the CNS. Continuous low-level infection occurs in the presence of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) in CD4+ T cells and mononuclear phagocytes (MP; monocytes, macrophages, microglia, and dendritic cells). Within the CNS, productive viral infection is found exclusively in microglia and meningeal, perivascular, and choroidal macrophages. MPs serve as the principal viral CNS reservoir. Animal models have been developed to recapitulate natural human HIV-1 infection. These include nonhuman primates, humanized mice, EcoHIV, and transgenic rodent models. These models have been used to study disease pathobiology, antiretroviral and immune modulatory agents, viral reservoirs, and eradication strategies. However, each of these models are limited to specific component(s) of human disease. Indeed, HIV-1 species specificity must drive therapeutic and cure studies. These have been studied in several model systems reflective of latent infections, specifically in MP (myeloid, monocyte, macrophages, microglia, and histiocyte cell) populations. Therefore, additional small animal models that allow productive viral replication to enable viral carriage into the brain and the virus-susceptible MPs are needed. To this end, this review serves to outline animal models currently available to study myeloid brain reservoirs and highlight areas that are lacking and require future research to more effectively study disease-specific events that could be useful for viral eradication studies both in and outside the CNS.

Data from sexual and gender minority youth (16-24 years) who were prescribed PrEP across nine domestic sites were evaluated (N = 235). Descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, and correlation coefficients are reported. Results yielded a three-factor solution (PrEP Disapproval by Others, Enacted PrEP Stigma, and PrEP User Stereotypes) with strong factor loadings and Cronbach's alphas ranging from 0.83 to 0.90, suggesting excellent internal consistency. Correlations between this Scale, anticipated HIV stigma, perceived HIV risk, and disclosure of sexual identity were significant, indicating potential for robust application. Given the persistence of HIV infections among youth, stigma as a barrier to prevention, and expansion of PrEP modalities, the Youth PrEP Stigma Scale could enhance intervention and mechanistic research among youth at elevated risk for HIV acquisition.

Early studies of CAB LA for HIV prevention offered promising pharmacokinetic data and paved the way for phase 2 studies, which have now been completed. On the basis of phase 2 data, dosing of CAB LA at 8-week intervals consistently delivers target trough concentrations in both men and women. Recent studies have shown no required dose adjustments for hepatic or renal disease and minimal drug--drug interactions. Additionally, injectable PrEP is desired by potential PrEP candidates. Still, gaps in knowledge remain with respect to implementation and delivery, the clinical significance of the pharmacologic tail, and dosing in key populations. Phase 3 trials are underway that are anticipated to inform some of these questions and provide efficacy and safety data to support regulatory submissions for CAB LA as a potential PrEP agent. Recent studies have defined an appropriate CAB LA dosing interval and offered insight into its safety profile. Phase 3 studies will provide much-anticipated efficacy data. If efficacious, CAB LA may provide a desirable PrEP option for those who face challenges to daily pill adherence.

Six themes emerged related to anticipated and enacted PrEP stigma: (1) Perception that PrEP users engage in risky sexual behaviors; (2) PrEP-induced conflict in relationships; (3) Perception that PrEP users are HIV-positive; (4) Generational differences in attitudes toward HIV prevention; (5) Experiences of discomfort, judgment, or homophobia from medical providers; and (6) Gay stigma related to PrEP disclosure to family. Manifestations of stigma included disapproving judgment, negative labeling, rejection, and devaluing individuals. The social consequences associated with using PrEP may deter uptake and persistence among Latino MSM.

368,60,60,33617771,"Men who have sex with men (MSM) in the USA were the first population to be identified with AIDS and continue to be at very high risk of HIV acquisition. We did a systematic literature search to identify the factors that explain the reasons for the ongoing epidemic in this population, using a social-ecological perspective. Common features of the HIV epidemic in American MSM include role versatility and biological, individual, and social and structural factors. The high-prevalence networks of some racial and ethnic minority men are further concentrated because of assortative mixing, adverse life experiences (including high rates of incarceration), and avoidant behaviour because of negative interactions with the health-care system. Young MSM have additional risks for HIV because their impulse control is less developed and they are less familiar with serostatus and other risk mitigation discussions. They might benefit from prevention efforts that use digital technologies, which they often use to meet partners and obtain health-related information. Older MSM remain at risk of HIV and are the largest population of US residents with chronic HIV, requiring culturally responsive programmes that address longer-term comorbidities. Transgender MSM are an understudied population, but emerging data suggest that some are at great risk of HIV and require specifically tailored information on HIV prevention. In the current era of pre-exposure prophylaxis and the undetectable equals untransmittable campaign, training of health-care providers to create culturally competent programmes for all MSM is crucial, since the use of antiretrovirals is foundational to optimising HIV care and prevention. Effective control of the HIV epidemic among all American MSM will require scaling up programmes that address their common vulnerabilities, but are sufficiently nuanced to address the specific sociocultural, structural, and behavioural issues of diverse subgroups.

Short-term and sustained adherence were measured by urine tenofovir concentration and pharmacy refills, respectively. Optimal adherence was defined as having both urine tenofovir concentration consistent with dose ingestion within 48 h and pharmacy refills consistent with ≥ 4 doses per week use. Participants completed semi-structured interviews exploring adherence barriers and facilitators. Participants (n = 31) were primarily African-American (68%), mean age 22 years (SD: 1.8), and 48% had optimal adherence. Adherence barriers included stigma, health systems inaccessibility, side effects, competing stressors, and low HIV risk perception. Facilitators included social support, health system accessibility, reminders/routines, high HIV risk perception, and personal agency.

Latent class analysis grouped providers with similar patterns of HIV prevention- and treatment-related care and tested for associations with demographics and PrEP-related factors. Three distinct classes of providers emerged: (1) PrEP naïve, (2) PrEP aware, and (3) PrEP prescribers.

CCR5 antagonists bind to CCR5 to prevent viral entry. Maraviroc (MVC) is the only CCR5 antagonist currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, the European Commission, Health Canada, and several other countries for the treatment of patients infected with R5-tropic HIV-1. MVC has been shown to be effective at inhibiting HIV-1 entry into cells and is well tolerated. With expanding MVC use by HIV-1-infected humans, different clinical outcomes post-approval have been observed with MVC monotherapy or combination therapy with other antiretroviral drugs, with MVC use in humans infected with dual-R5- and X4-tropic HIV-1, infected with different HIV-1 genotype or infected with HIV-2. This review discuss the role of CCR5 in HIV-1 infection, the development of the CCR5 antagonist MVC, its pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, drug-drug interactions, and the implications of these interactions on treatment outcomes, including viral mutations and drug resistance, and the mechanisms associated with the development of resistance to MVC.

Little research has directly examined the influence of psychobiologic factors on the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying HIV progression. However, basic research in neuroimmune interactions indicates that activation of the sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis can influence several immunologic processes relevant to HIV pathogenesis and the body's ability to resist the progress of infection. A small number of observational natural history studies indicate that certain psychosocial characteristics may be associated with differential disease progression (e.g., subjective responses to highly threatening events, and inhibited psychosocial characteristics). We address some of the methodologic and conceptual issues critical to the interpretation of current results as evidence that psychobiologic processes influence HIV progression, and we conclude by highlighting promising areas for future inquiry.

Recently, the Bangkok Tenofovir Study has shown that PrEP may be effective at reducing new HIV infections among this high-risk group. This randomized controlled trial was the first study to specifically examine the efficacy of PrEP among PWIDs. In this review, we present the current state of evidence regarding the use of PrEP to prevent HIV infection in PWID populations, and set an agenda for future research to inform the most effective implementation of PrEP in the context of existing evidence-based HIV prevention strategies. Despite positive trial results confirming that PrEP may prevent HIV transmission among PWIDs, there remain many questions regarding the interpretation of these results, as well as obstacles to the implementation of PrEP regimens within highly diverse drug-using communities. Aside from the Bangkok Tenofovir Study, we identified only one other published study that has collected empirical data to inform the use of PrEP among PWIDs. The large gap in research regarding the use and implementation of PrEP for PWIDs signals the need for further research and attention. We recommend that future research efforts focus on elucidating the generalizability of the Bangkok Tenofovir Study results in other injection drug-using populations, examining the willingness of PWIDs to use PrEP in diverse contexts, identifying barriers to adherence to PrEP regimens and determining the most effective ways to implement PrEP programmes within the context of existing evidence-based prevention strategies, including opioid substitution therapy and needle and syringe distribution programmes.

Participants (n = 25) had a mean age of 21.2 years (standard deviation 2.2, range 17-24) and were predominately multiracial (36%) and of HIV-negative or unknown status (68%). Most participants (64%) reported prior knowledge of PrEP, and 28% reported current use or intent to use PrEP. Three major content themes that emerged were variability of PrEP awareness, barriers and facilitators to PrEP uptake, and emotional benefits of PrEP. Among participants without prior PrEP knowledge, participants reported frustration that PrEP information has not been widely disseminated to YTW, particularly by health care providers. Attitudes toward PrEP were overwhelmingly positive; however, concerns were raised regarding barriers including cost, stigma, and adherence challenges. Both HIV-positive and negative participants discussed emotional and relationship benefits of PrEP, which were felt to extend beyond HIV prevention alone.

386,78,78,19768553,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of the central nervous system (CNS) can result in neurological dysfunction with devastating consequences in a significant proportion of individuals with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. HIV-1 does not infect neurons directly but induces damage indirectly through the accumulation of activated macrophage/microglia (M/M) cells, some of which are infected, that release neurotoxic mediators including both cellular activation products and viral proteins. One mechanism for the accumulation of activated M/M involves the development in infected individuals of an activated peripheral blood monocyte population that traffics through the blood-brain barrier, a process that also serves to carry virus into CNS and establish local infection. A second mechanism involves the release by infected and activated M/M in the CNS of chemotactic mediators that recruit additional monocytes from the periphery. These activated M/M, some of which are infected, release a number of cytokines and small molecule mediators as well as viral proteins that act on bystander cells and in turn activate them, thus amplifying the cascade. These viral proteins and cellular products have neurotoxic properties as well, both directly and through induction of astrocyte dysfunction, which ultimately lead to neuronal injury and death. In patients effectively treated with antiretroviral therapy, frank dementia is now uncommon and has been replaced by milder forms of neurocognitive impairment, with less frequent and more focal neuropathology. This review summarizes key findings that support the critical role and mechanisms of monocyte/macrophage activation and inflammation as a major component for HIV-1 encephalitis or HIV-1 associated dementia.

We assessed HIV-1 incidence and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) interest in men who have sex with men exclusively (MSME), men who have sex with men and women (MSMW) and TGW in coastal Kenya. HIV-1-seronegative individuals who had participated in an HIV testing study in 2016 were traced and retested in 2017 according to Kenyan guidelines. All participants were assigned male sex at birth and had male sex partners; additional data on gender identity and sexual orientation were obtained. We assessed the factors associated with HIV-1 acquisition using Poisson regression and calculated HIV-1 incidence in MSME, MSMW and TGW. PrEP interest was assessed through focus group discussions to characterize subcategories' perceived PrEP needs. Of the 168 cohort participants, 42 were classified as MSME, 112 as MSMW and 14 as TGW. Overall, HIV-1 incidence was 5.1 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.6 to 9.8) per 100 person-years (PY): 4.5 (95% CI: 1.1 to 17.8] per 100 PY among MSME, 3.4 (95% CI: 1.3 to 9.1) per 100 PY among MSMW and 20.6 (95% CI: 6.6 to 63.8] per 100 PY among TGW. HIV-1 acquisition was associated with exclusive receptive anal intercourse (aIRR 13.0, 95% CI 1.9 to 88.6), history of an STI in preceding six months (aIRR 10.3, 95% CI 2.2 to 49.4) and separated/divorced marital status (aIRR 8.2 (95%: 1.1 to 62.2). Almost all (98.8%) participants were interested in initiating PrEP. MSME and TGW felt that PrEP would lead to increases in condomless anal or group sex. TGW had a very high HIV-1 incidence compared with MSME and MSMW. Subcategories of MSM anticipated different PrEP needs and post-PrEP risk behaviour.

393,85,85,14595004,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-associated dementia is a neuroinflammatory brain disorder that is fueled by viral infection and immune activation of brain mononuclear phagocytes (MP; macrophages and microglia). MP serve as a reservoir for persistent viral infection, a vehicle for viral dissemination throughout the brain, and a major source of neurotoxic products that when produced in abundance, affect neuronal function. Such neurotoxic substances secreted by MP lead to clinical neurological impairment (cognitive, behavior, and motor abnormalities), which occurs usually years after the initial viral infection. How HIV-1 evades the immune function characteristic for MP as a first line of defense, including phagocytosis and intracellular killing, is not well understood despite more than two decades of study. In this report, we review the complex role(s) played by MP in the neuropathogenesis of HIV-1 infection.

Several clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy of oral PrEP for HIV prevention among groups at high risk for HIV, with adherence closely associated with level of risk reduction. In the United States (US), three groups have been prioritized for initial implementation of PrEP-injection drug users, men who have sex with men at substantial risk for HIV, and HIV-negative partners within serodiscordant heterosexual couples. Numerous demonstration projects involving PrEP implementation among MSM are underway, but relatively little research has been devoted to study PrEP implementation in HIV-serodiscordant heterosexual couples in the US. Such couples face a unique set of challenges to PrEP implementation at the individual, couple, and provider level with regard to PrEP uptake and maintenance, adherence, safety and toxicity, clinical monitoring, and sexual risk behavior.

The role of chemokines and their receptors in viral infections including HIV-1 was predicted from the early studies of HIV-1 co-receptor CCR5 and its ligands and a divergent role of C-C chemokines in HIV-1 pathogenesis has been established. For example, CCL3 (MIP-1α), CCL4 (MIP-1β) and CCL5 (RANTES) have been shown to possess antiviral effects by binding to the HIV-1 co-receptor CCR5, whereas CCL2, a pro-inflammatory chemokine, supports HIV-1 replication despite being a member of same chemokine family. Furthermore, the well-established role of CCL2 in driving the Th2 immune response supports its potential role in HIV-1/AIDS. Recent reports suggest multiple pathways of CCL2 affect HIV-1 infection.

408,100,100,26091454,"The Chinese national observational cohort study suggests that the treatment-as-prevention (TasP) approach can be an effective public health HIV-1 prevention strategy. However, results from that study may have been biased because the follow-up time of index patients prior to their initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) was excluded. In this study, we correct for such bias by using an extended time-dependent Cox regression model to conduct a cohort study analysis of serodiscordant couples in Guangxi of China, inclusive of all follow-up time. During the follow-up of this observational cohort study of HIV-1 sero-discordant couples, the positive index partners may have never be treated with ART, or enter untreated but subsequently began treatment, or may have been treated immediately upon entry into the public health system. The treatment effectiveness of ART in HIV-1 acquisition among HIV-negative partners is assessed by the extended Cox regression model with treatment status as a time-varying covariate. A total of 6548 sero-discordant couples were included in the cohort study analysis. Among them, 348 negative partners sero-converted. HIV seroincidence was significantly higher among the nontreated (4.3 per 100 person-years, 3.7-4.9) compared with those receiving ART (1.8 per 100 person-years, 1.5-2.0). An overall 35% reduction in risk of HIV transmission was associated with receiving ART (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51-0.83), and the yearly risk reduction was also significant in the first 3 consecutive years of follow-up. Moreover, ART was found to be significantly inversely associated with multiple baseline characteristics of index partners. TasP may be feasible on a national or regional scale. In addition to other proven preventive strategies such as the use of condoms, ART adherence to maintain viral suppression would then be the key challenge for successful TasP implementation.

411,103,103,32109141,"Increasing prescription of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is imperative to ending the HIV epidemic in the United States. The objective of this review was to identify health care provider barriers to PrEP implementation. A systematic review was conducted in February 2019 using PubMed to identify barriers to PrEP prescribing practices in the United States. Targeted search terms surrounding PrEP and providers resulted in 222 original studies, 28 of which were ultimately included in our review, with data collected between 2011 and 2018. Six themes were identified across reviewed studies: (i) a lack of PrEP knowledge, (ii) the presence of the Purview Paradox, which refers to discordance in beliefs between HIV specialists and primary care providers on who should prescribe PrEP, (iii) concerns about PrEP costs, (iv) concerns about behavioral and health consequences, (v) interpersonal stigma, and (vi) concerns about patient adherence. A majority of providers were lacking knowledge regarding PrEP, resulting in discomfort in prescribing PrEP, or limited awareness and understanding of PrEP clinical guidelines. Discrepant opinions were identified regarding whether PrEP was best managed within primary care or specialty clinics. Other barriers included concerns about cost, patient adherence, and follow-up maintenance care. Finally, concerns about risk compensation and discomfort discussing sexual activities with patients who would benefit most from PrEP were apparent. Additional work is needed to prepare providers to prescribe and manage patients on PrEP, optimize PrEP delivery, and reduce provider bias. Future research is needed to identify providers' attitudes and beliefs regarding innovations in PrEP dosing, task shifting, and novel strategies for PrEP care.

412,104,104,31609925,"Optimal adherence to oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention involves aligning consistent PrEP use with periods of risk to achieve prevention-effective adherence. Prevention-effective adherence is predicated on individuals discontinuing PrEP during periods without expected risk. For stable, serodiscordant couples, antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence by the HIV-positive partner markedly decreases HIV transmission risk, potentially obviating the need for continued PrEP use; yet little is known about actual lived experiences of discontinuing PrEP. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with HIV-uninfected PrEP users in serodiscordant couples taking part in the Partners Demonstration Project at IDI-Kasangati, Kampala, Uganda. Open-ended interviews elicited information on the partnered relationship; understandings of PrEP; prevention strategies; and experiences of PrEP discontinuation. An inductive, thematic, content-analytic approach was used to analyze study data. Uninfected partners experienced PrEP as a valued resource for preventing HIV acquisition. Despite ongoing ART use by HIV-positive partners for a period of time consistent with viral suppression, discontinuation of PrEP was experienced as a loss of protection and a corresponding increase in risk of HIV acquisition. Uninfected partners responded with strategies aimed at offsetting this subjective sense of increased risk, specifically: (1) changing sexual practices; (2) prioritizing fidelity in the relationship; (3) increasing reliance on condoms; and (4) seeking evidence of partners' ART adherence. These experiences highlight the challenges PrEP users in serodiscordant couples face in discontinuing PrEP for prevention-effective adherence. Flexible interventions that support individuals during this transition may increase comfort with discontinuing PrEP when alternative prevention strategies provide protection, such as a partner's consistent adherence to ART.

PrEP adherence has generally been higher in recent trials, open-label extensions, and demonstration projects compared with the initial clinical trials; potential explanations include known PrEP efficacy and different motivations to take PrEP. Recent studies have explored adherence monitoring through electronic pill containers, short message service (SMS), and drug concentrations in hair and dried blood spots. The few PrEP adherence interventions developed to date include combinations of enhanced counseling, feedback of objective adherence measurement, and SMS. Conceptualization of PrEP adherence is evolving. The goal is not 100% adherence indefinitely, as it was in clinical trials. PrEP adherence should be defined with respect to HIV exposure, which varies over time by sexual behavior and use of other prevention strategies. PrEP adherence beyond clinical trials has generally been high enough to achieve reliable HIV prevention. Future efforts to measure and support PrEP adherence should focus on the context of risk for HIV acquisition, accounting for dynamic behaviors and choices among HIV prevention options.

Studies are underway to determine how to assist busy clinicians to determine which of their patients could benefit from PrEP.

Latent class analysis was used to explore heterogeneity of preferences and estimate preference shares. The median age was 21 (interquartile range 19-22), and 47% were men who have sex with men. Duration was the most important product attribute. Latent class analysis identified 3 classes: ""duration-dominant decision makers"" (46%) were the largest class, defined by significant preference for a longer duration product. ""Comprehensive decision makers"" (36%) had preferences shaped equally by multiple attributes and preferred implants.

We conducted a systematic literature review to understand the evidence on HIVST use for PrEP delivery. After screening 1055 records, we included eight: three randomized trials and five values and preferences studies. None measured PrEP initiation. Most studies occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa (7/8) and included different populations. One trial found that HIVST use between quarterly clinic visits as part of an adherence package with biofeedback slightly increased adherence; the other two trials found that HIVST use between or in lieu of quarterly clinic visits had no significant or non-inferior effects on adherence. HIVST to support PrEP delivery was acceptable, feasible, and preferred. HIVST use for PrEP continuation largely resulted in similar outcomes to standard-of-care delivery and was perceived acceptable and feasible.

427,119,119,31272495,"The introduction of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) prevention in Africa presents new challenges for health systems that are already overburdened because PrEP delivery requires frequent clinic visits (generally every 3 months) for HIV-1 testing and PrEP refills. HIV-1 self-testing (HIVST) has the potential to improve the efficiency of PrEP delivery by decreasing the number of clinic visits. Here, we describe the rationale and design of a randomized, noninferiority trial designed to test the effectiveness and safety of using HIVST to support PrEP delivery in Kenya. The JiPime-JiPrEP (Kiswahili for 'Test Yourself, PrEP Yourself') study is a three-arm randomized trial taking place in Thika, Kenya. Participants (n = 495) are eligible for enrollment if they are at least 18 years old, HIV-1 seronegative, and have been taking PrEP for 1 month. Three distinct participant types will be enrolled: men (n = 165) and women (n = 165) who are in mutually disclosed HIV-1 serodiscordant relationships, and women (n = 165) who are at HIV-1 risk and not in a known serodiscordant relationship. Participants in each of these subpopulations will be 1:1:1 randomized to: 1) the standard of care, with quarterly clinic visits; 2) oral HIVST, with biannual clinic visits plus oral HIVSTs to use at the quarters between those visits; or 3) blood-based HIVST, with biannual clinic visits plus blood-based HIVSTs. All participants will complete quantitative surveys and provide blood samples for the objective measurement of PrEP adherence at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. The primary outcomes are PrEP adherence, PrEP continuation, and HIV-1 testing, measured at 6 months and secondarily at 12 months. The findings from this trial can help to understand how HIVST-a new HIV-1 testing technology-can support health systems in sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, the findings can inform policy aimed at improving the efficiency of PrEP implementation and scale-up in Kenya. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03593629 .

429,121,121,1997729,"In conclusion, there is overwhelming evidence that within the CNS the primary sites of active HIV-1 infection are microglia. CNS infection may be related to the normal repopulation of the CNS by monocytes (microglial turnover) that carry latent infection into the CNS. Activation of viral infection may depend upon microglial differentiation, soluble factors (cytokines), and/or coexistent infections. Infection of microglia may disturb the normal hemostatic balance that exists between microglia and other glia, and between microglia and neurons, processes that are only recently being explored at the molecular level. The impact that HIV infection of microglia may have on synaptic integrity is unknown. Cytokines appear to be prime candidates as mediators of some of the adverse effects of microglial infection on other CNS cells, myelin and endothelial cells.

We measured the fidelity of this model (ie, delivery as intended) in a pilot study in Kenya. Five private, retail pharmacies in Kisumu and Thika Counties. Trained pharmacy providers delivered PrEP services, including identifying eligible clients, counseling on HIV risk, assessing PrEP safety, testing for HIV, and dispensing PrEP. Pharmacy clients completed surveys that assessed the fidelity of the services received after each visit. Standardized client actors (ie, mystery shoppers) were trained on 4 different case scripts, then made unannounced pharmacy visits, and then completed a 40-item checklist that assessed the fidelity and quality of service delivery components. From November 2020 to December 2021, 287 clients initiated and 159 (55%) refilled PrEP. At initiation, most clients were counseled on PrEP adherence (99%, 284 of 287) and potential side effects (97%, 279 of 287) and all received provider-assisted HIV self-testing before PrEP dispensing (findings consistent across refill visits). Nine standardized client actors completed 15 pharmacy visits. At each visit, most actors were asked about their behaviors associated with HIV risk (80%, 12/15) and all were counseled on PrEP safety and side effects. All actors reported that pharmacy providers treated them with respect. In this first pilot study of pharmacy-delivered PrEP services in Africa, the fidelity of service delivery was high, suggesting that trained providers at private pharmacies can deliver quality PrEP services.

435,127,127,8423065,"Microglia are associated with central nervous system (CNS) pathology of both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In AD, microglia, especially those associated with amyloid deposits, have a phenotype that is consistent with a state of activation, including immunoreactivity with antibodies to class II major histocompatibility antigens and to inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1-beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha). Evidence from other studies in rodents indicate that microglia can be activated by neuronal degeneration. These results suggest that microglial activation in AD may be secondary to neurodegeneration and that, once activated, microglia may participate in a local inflammatory cascade that promotes tissue damage and contributes to amyloid formation. In AIDS, microglia are the primary target of retroviral infection. Both ramified and ameboid microglia, in addition to multinucleated giant cells, are infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). The mechanism of microglial infection is not known since microglia lack CD4, the HIV-1 receptor. Microglia display high affinity receptors for immunoglobulins, which makes antibody-mediated viral uptake a possible mechanism of infection. In AIDS, the extent of active viral infection and cytokine production may be critically dependent upon other factors, such as the presence of coinfecting agents. In the latter circumstance, very severe CNS pathology may emerge, including necrotizing lesions. In other circumstances, HIV infection of microglia probably leads to CNS pathology by indirect mechanisms, including release of viral proteins (gp120) and toxic cytokines. Such a mechanism is the best hypothesis for the pathogenesis of vacuolar myelopathy in adults and the diffuse gliosis that characterizes pediatric AIDS, in which very little viral antigen can be detected.

The pathogenic mechanism of HIV-1-associated cardiomyopathy is unknown, but has been presumed to be mediated indirectly, owing to the absence of productive HIV-1 replication in cardiomyocytes. We sought to investigate the effect of the HIV-1 auxiliary protein, Nef, which is suspected of extracellular release by infected CD4+ T cells on protein quality control and autophagy in cardiomyocytes. After detection of Nef in the serum of HIV-1 positive patients and the accumulation of this protein in human and primate heart tissue from HIV-1/SIV-infected cells we employed cell and molecular biology approaches to investigate the effect of Nef on cardiomyocyte-homeostasis by concentrating on protein quality control (PQC) pathway and autophagy. We found that HIV-1 Nef-mediated inhibition of autophagy flux leads to cytotoxicity and death of cardiomyocytes. Nef compromises autophagy at the maturation stage of autophagosomes by interacting with Beclin 1/Rab7 and dysregulating TFEB localization and cellular lysosome content. These effects were reversed by rapamycin treatment.

In a 2017 online survey of Planned Parenthood patients drawn from the 3 cities with the highest numbers of new HIV infections in Connecticut, 597 heterosexually active, HIV-negative, PrEP-inexperienced women reported background characteristics, 2 dimensions of anticipated PrEP stigma (PrEP-user stereotypes and PrEP disapproval by others), and 3 indicators of potential PrEP uptake (interest in learning more about PrEP, intention to use PrEP, and comfort discussing PrEP with a provider). Participants commonly perceived PrEP-user stereotypes, with many believing that others would regard them as promiscuous (37%), HIV-positive (32%), bad (14%), or gay (11%) if they used PrEP. Thirty percent would feel ashamed to disclose PrEP use. Many participants expected disapproval by family (36%), sex partners (34%), and friends (25%). In adjusted analyses, perception of PrEP-user stereotypes was uniquely associated with less comfort discussing PrEP with a provider. Expected PrEP disapproval by others was uniquely associated with less PrEP interest, less intention to use PrEP, and less comfort discussing PrEP with a provider. Exploratory moderation analyses suggested that intention to use PrEP was greatest when participants anticipated low levels of both PrEP-user stereotypes and PrEP disapproval by others. Findings highlight the need for positive messaging targeting potential PrEP users and their social networks to increase PrEP acceptance and uptake.

Higher HIV risk perception, intimacy motivations for condomless sex, recent condomless anal sex with outside partners, education, and age were each independently associated with PrEP adoption intentions. In a multivariate model, only age, education, and intimacy motivations for condomless sex were significantly associated with PrEP adoption intentions. Intimacy motivations may play a central role in PrEP adoption for MSM couples. Incorporating relationship dynamics into biomedical strategies is a promising avenue for research and intervention.

After excluding for confounding comorbidities, 67 individuals from a rural cohort in Guinea-Bissau (22 HIV-2 participants, 45 seronegative controls) were evaluated. HIV + individuals were divided into CD4 < 350 and CD4 ≥ 350 for analysis. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), assessed by the International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS), distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSPN), and myelopathy were the main outcome variables. In univariate analysis, there was no difference in IHDS scores among groups. When analyzed by primary education attainment, IHDS scores were nonsignificantly higher (p = 0.06) with more education. There was no significant difference in DSPN prevalence among groups; overall, 45% of participants had DSPN. There were no cases of myelopathy. In multivariate linear regression, higher IHDS scores were significantly correlated with older age (coefficient = -0.11, p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that older age (odds ratio (OR) 95% CI 1.04-1.20), lower CD4 count (OR 95% CI 0.996-0.999), and higher BMI (OR 95% CI 1.02-1.43) significantly predicted the presence of DSPN. While a significant increase in cognitive impairment was not observed in HIV-2-infected individuals, the study suggests the IHDS may be a less effective screening tool for HAND in settings of lower educational attainment as encountered in rural Guinea-Bissau. Similar to HIV-1, DSPN seems to occur with lower CD4 counts in HIV-2. Further study of the viral-host interactions in HIV-2 and its consequent neurological diseases may provide an avenue for understanding the epidemic problems of HIV-1.

449,141,141,18040840,"Invasion of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) into the central and peripheral nervous system produces a wide range of neurological symptoms, which continue to persist even with adequate therapeutic suppression of the systemic viremia. The development of therapies designed to prevent the neurological complications of HIV require a detailed understanding of the mechanisms of virus penetration into the nervous system, infection, and subsequent neuropathogenesis. These processes, however, are difficult to study in humans. The identification of animal lentiviruses similar to HIV has provided useful models of HIV infection that have greatly facilitated these efforts. This review summarizes contributions made from in vitro and in vivo studies on the infectious and pathological interactions of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) with the nervous system. In vivo studies on FIV have provided insights into the natural progression of CNS disease as well as the contribution of various risk factors. In vitro studies have contributed to our understanding of immune cell trafficking, CNS infection and neuropathogenesis. Together, these studies have made unique contributions to our understanding of (1) lentiviral interactions at the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier within the choroid plexus, (2) early FIV invasion and pathogenesis in the brain, and (3) lentiviral effects on intracellular calcium deregulation and neuronal dysfunction. The ability to combine in vitro and in vivo studies on FIV offers enormous potential to explore neuropathogenic mechanisms and generate information necessary for the development of effective therapeutic interventions.

Children are much more susceptible to HIV-1 neurological impairments than adults, which can be exacerbated by coinfections. Neurological characteristics of pediatric HIV-1 infection suggest dysfunction in the frontal cortex as well as the hippocampus; limited MRI data indicate global cerebral atrophy, and pathological data suggest accelerated neuronal apoptosis in the cortex. An obstacle to pediatric HIV-1 research is a human representative model system. Host-species specificity of HIV-1 limits the ability to model neurological consequences of pediatric HIV-1 infection in animals. Several models have been proposed including neonatal intracranial injections of HIV-1 viral proteins in rats and perinatal simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of infant macaques. Nonhuman primate models recapitulate the complexity of pediatric HIV-1 neuropathogenesis while rodent models are able to elucidate the role specific viral proteins exert on neurodevelopment. Nonhuman primate models show similar behavioral and neuropathological characteristics to pediatric HIV-1 infection and offer a stage to investigate early viral mechanisms, latency reservoirs, and therapeutic interventions.

Of seven trials with available HIV endpoints, three different products have been tested: tenofovir 1% vaginal gel, oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) tablets, and TDF/emtricitabine tablets. Six of these trials were conducted exclusively in sub-Saharan Africa; all found the products to be well tolerated, and four demonstrated effectiveness. Furthermore, the HIV Prevention Trial Network (HPTN) 052 trial recently confirmed that antiretroviral treatment leads to 96% reduction in transmission to HIV-negative partners in HIV-serodiscordant couples. These results, along with human and animal data, provide substantial evidence for the efficacy of antiretroviral-based HIV prevention. Yet assessment of oral TDF/emtricitabine in the FEM-PrEP study and of oral and vaginal tenofovir in the Microbicide Trial Network (MTN)-003 trial (VOICE) was stopped for futility. How do we make sense of these discrepant results? We believe that adherence is a key factor, although it cannot be the only factor. Expanding upon a recent editorial in the Lancet, we discuss the impact of suboptimal product adherence on PrEP efficacy in the context of variable drug concentration at the exposure site, integrity of the vaginal epithelium, and the role of acute infection.

Most providers counselled PrEP initiators to always use both PrEP and condoms, except when trying to conceive. However, others reported contexts and rationales for not emphasizing condom use. Providers reported that PrEP users were sometimes confused, even frustrated, with their insistence on using condoms in addition to PrEP. PrEP users generally regarded PrEP as a more feasible and desirable HIV prevention method than condoms, enabling increased sexual pleasure and conception, and reducing the conflict and stigma associated with condom use.

However, simultaneous identification of factors that contribute to resilience in the face of risks is also needed. A greater understanding of modifiable protective processes that contribute to resilience in the mental health of children affected by HIV can inform the design of interventions that bolster naturally occurring supports and contribute to early prevention or better management of risks. We reviewed the recent literature on mental health and resilience in children and adolescents affected by HIV/AIDS. Literature searches of PsycInfo and PubMed were conducted during July-December 2011 consistent with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standards. Qualitative and quantitative studies were included for review if primary research questions pertained to mental health and coping or protective processes in children and families affected by HIV/AIDS. All studies subject to full review were evaluated for quality using a modified Systematic Assessment of Quality in Observational Research (SAQOR) rating system. One hundred and seventy one unique studies were returned from online searches of the literature and bibliography mining. Of these, 29 were evaluated as pertaining directly to mental health and resilience in families and children living with HIV/AIDS. Eight studies presented qualitative analyses. Ten quantitative studies examined individual resources contributing to child resilience and four quantitative studies looked at family-level resources. Ten studies also investigated community level interactions. Four presented findings from resilience-focused interventions.

We searched PubMed, CINAHL, LILACS and EMBASE through 2 December 2020. We also searched clinical trial registries and recent HIV conference abstracts. Standardised methods were used to search, screen and extract data from included studies. No studies met the inclusion criteria for the effectiveness review, for either PrEP initiation or continuation. However, six 'case studies' presenting non-comparative data from PrEP pharmacy programmes demonstrated feasibility of this model in the USA. Eleven studies reported values and preferences of end users and health workers. In the USA, Kenya and South Africa, potential PrEP clients generally supported pharmacy access, although some preferred clinics. One study of PrEP pharmacy clients found all would 'definitely recommend' the programme. Six studies found pharmacists were generally supportive of offering PrEP; one study including doctors found more limited favour, while one study of diverse Kenyan stakeholders found broad support. Three studies reported cost data indicating client willingness to pay in the USA and Kenya and initial sustainability of a clinic financial model in the USA. Provision of PrEP through pharmacies has been demonstrated to be feasible in the USA and acceptable to potential end users and stakeholders in multiple settings.

The origins of HIV-1 detected in the CNS compartment are unknown, including whether cells within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) produce virus. We measured viral RNA+ cells in CSF from acutely infected macaques longitudinally and people living with early stages of acute HIV-1. Active viral transcription (spliced viral RNA) was present in CSF CD4+ T cells as early as four weeks post-SHIV infection, and among all acute HIV-1 specimens (N = 6; Fiebig III/IV). Replication-inactive CD4+ T cell infection, indicated by unspliced viral RNA in the absence of spliced viral RNA, was even more prevalent, present in CSF of >50% macaques and human CSF at ~10-fold higher frequency than productive infection. Infection levels were similar between CSF and peripheral blood (and lymph nodes in macaques), indicating comparable T cell infection across these compartments. In addition, surface markers of activation were increased on CSF T cells and monocytes and correlated with CSF soluble markers of inflammation. These studies provide direct evidence of HIV-1 replication in CD4+ T cells and broad immune activation in peripheral blood and the CNS during acute infection, likely contributing to early neuroinflammation and reservoir seeding. Thus, early initiation of antiretroviral therapy may not be able to prevent establishment of CNS viral reservoirs and sources of long-term inflammation, important targets for HIV-1 cure and therapeutic strategies.

No statistically significant associations emerged between either CSF or peripheral viral load and the global deficit score, or any of the seven cognitive domain deficit scores. Among these HIV-1-sero-positive individuals with mainly minor HIV-1-associated cognitive deficits and not receiving HAART, no association between CSF or blood concentration of HIV-1 RNA and cognitive performance could be found. These results suggest that the severity of HIV-1-associated cognitive impairment is not directly related to concurrent viral concentration in the CSF or the peripheral blood.

We conducted an exploratory mixed-methods study among 57 adolescents, 16-17 years of age, living with and without HIV, and 25 clinical service providers in Cape Town, South Africa from 2015 to 2016. Cross-sectional survey and semi-structured qualitative interview data were used to explore (1) willingness to use PrEP and support partner PrEP use among adolescents living with and without HIV, (2) willingness to prescribe or support prescription of PrEP among service providers, and (3) perceptions of barriers and facilitators to PrEP implementation and interpretations of PrEP efficacy messaging for adolescent HIV prevention among all participants. Acceptability of PrEP among participants was high. Support for PrEP uptake was linked to messages that positively framed PrEP's protection potential (i.e., success- versus failure-framed messaging) among both adolescents and providers. Adolescents living without HIV endorsed high willingness to use PrEP and adolescents living with HIV endorsed high support for partner PrEP use. However, both groups noted that potential side effects, stigma, and PrEP's partial efficacy may hinder uptake. Clinical service providers endorsed PrEP for sexually active adolescents and shared stigma and efficacy concerns. Further, service providers expressed desire for adolescent-tailored training and integration of PrEP delivery into primary care and family planning services. Efforts to educate adolescents and service providers about PrEP should consider how message framing may influence acceptability. Community PrEP education and adolescent-friendly delivery should be prioritized to alleviate predicted PrEP stigma and facilitate uptake.

To identify factors that may influence implementation of retail pharmacy-based PrEP delivery in Kenya, we conducted in-depth interviews with 40 pharmacy clients, 16 pharmacy providers, 16 PrEP clients, and 10 PrEP providers from two provinces. Most participants expressed strong support for expanding PrEP to retail pharmacies, though conditioned their acceptance on assurances that care would be private, respectful, safe, and affordable. Participant-reported determinants of feasibility centered primarily on ensuring that the intervention is compatible with retail pharmacy operations (e.g., staffing levels, documentation requirements). Future research is needed to develop and test tailored packages of implementation strategies that are most effective at integrating PrEP delivery into routine pharmacy practice in Kenya and other high HIV prevalence settings. Ya que varios países están ampliando sus programas de profilaxis previa a la exposición al VIH (PrEP, por sus siglas en inglés), se necesitan modelos diversos para ampliar el acceso a poblaciones que no están dispuestos a acceder, o que no pueden acceder, a los servicios de PrEP que se ofrecen en las instalaciones de salud. Para identificar los factores que pueden influir en la prestación de servicios de PrEP a través de farmacias privadas, realizamos entrevistas en profundidad con 40 clientes de farmacia, 16 proveedores de servicios de farmacia, 16 usuarios de PrEP, y 10 proveedores de PrEP. La mayoría de los participantes manifestó su firme apoyo a la propuesta de expandir la provisión de PrEP a las farmacias privadas, aunque condicionó su aceptación a la garantía de que la atención sea privada, respetuosa, segura, y asequible. Según los participantes, los factores determinantes de la viabilidad de ofrecer PrEP en las farmacias privadas se centran en asegurar de que la intervención sea compatible con las operaciones de las farmacias privadas (p. ej., el número de personal, los requisitos de documentación).

HIV-associated dementia (HAD) is marked by progressive brain infection due to recruitment and migration of macrophages in brain tissues; however, the cellular and viral events occurring prior to HAD development and death are under debate. In this study, 66 brain tissues from 11 autopsies were analyzed to assess HIV-1 DNA concentration in brain tissues. In most patients without HAD, it was impossible to amplify HIV-1 from brain tissues. Amplifiable DNA was obtained from three cases of patients on HAART who died due to primary pathology other than HAD: (1) cardiovascular disease, a disease associated with HAART therapy; (2) bacterial infections, including Mycobacterium avium complex, rapid occurrence of extreme dementia; and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related lymphoma with meningeal involvement. HIV-1 DNA was also amplified from multiple tissues of two HAD patients. Analysis of HIV-1 nef, gp120, and gp41 sequences showed reduced viral evolution within brain tissues for the non-HAD cases relative to patients with clinical and histological HAD.

Informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we examined HIV testers' perceived barriers and facilitators to implementing HIV prevention services, including testers' strengths and weaknesses; enabling factors within the inner and outer settings; and willingness to adopt potential implementation strategies. In 2019, the Penn Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) partnered with the Philadelphia Department of Public Health (PDPH) to examine system-level challenges and opportunities experienced by PDPH-funded HIV testers (individuals conducting HIV testing) in Philadelphia. We recruited HIV testers to complete 2 web surveys (n ≈ 40 each) and in-depth interviews (n = 11). Testers self-reported high HIV testing self-efficacy and competence, despite identifying gaps in their knowledge of STI testing, reporting moderate willingness to recommend pre-exposure prophylaxis, and having insufficient cultural competency when working with priority populations. Testers indicated that educational materials and policies within their agencies might require realignment to affirm sexual and gender minority clients. In qualitative interviews, testers noted challenges to implementing PDPH priorities because limited funding fueled competition between local agencies, deterred interagency partnerships, and limited their ability to serve key populations locally. HIV testers are critical partners in addressing agency-level barriers to HIV prevention service provision through multilevel implementation strategies. In partnership with PDPH, we will create and implement a train-the-trainers program consisting of skill-building activities, technical assistance, and capacity-building for all agency personnel to address missed opportunities in HIV prevention. These activities will reinforce scalability and sustainability of PDPH-supported HIV prevention programs.

This study aimed to identify the role of patient-provider communication in PrEP decision-making among women considering PrEP. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 41 PrEP-eligible women in Philadelphia and New York City. A thematic analysis of the responses was conducted, and a conceptual model developed and confirmed as analysis continued. Of the women interviewed, 53.6% were African American and 29.3% were Latina. Women noted that having a trusting relationship with their health care provider, receiving a tailored recommendation for PrEP based upon their specific needs and using their health care provider as support were crucial facilitators of PrEP decision-making. Lack of provider knowledge about PrEP, perceived health care provider stigma about their drug use and sexual activity, and lack of care continuity were all identified as barriers to effective communication.

This was followed by an additional 8 weeks of open-label treatment for modafinil responders and 12 weeks for placebo nonresponders. The primary outcome measure for fatigue and depression was the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale, supplemented by the FSS, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory. Safety was assessed with assays of CD4 cell count and HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load. Visits were weekly for 4 weeks, then biweekly, with a follow-up visit at 6 months. Maximum trial dose of modafinil was 200 mg/d. Data for this study were collected between December 2004 and December 2008. 115 patients were randomly assigned. In intention-to-treat analyses, fatigue response rate to modafinil was 73% and to placebo, 28%. Attrition was 9%. Modafinil did not have an effect on mood alone in the absence of improved energy. At week 4, CD4 cell counts did not change significantly; HIV RNA viral load showed a trend decline for patients taking modafinil but not for those taking placebo. At 6 months, those still taking modafinil had more energy and fewer depressive symptoms than patients who were not taking modafinil, and only those still taking modafinil showed a significant decline from baseline in their HIV RNA viral load. Modafinil appears to be effective and well tolerated in treating fatigue in HIV+ patients.

482,174,174,37196008,"HIV disproportionately affects Black/African American cisgender women (hereafter women) in the United States. Despite its proven effectiveness, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention remains vastly under-prescribed to women based on their need. Increasing PrEP uptake and persistence among women is crucial to reducing HIV transmission; however, there have been few studies designed specifically for women. This article describes the study protocol used to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of implementation strategies to improve PrEP uptake and persistence among Black women in the Midwest and South. PrEP Optimization among Women to Enhance Retention and Uptake (POWER Up) is an evidence-based, woman-focused set of five implementation science strategies that addresses barriers of PrEP utilization at the provider, patient, and clinic levels. POWER Up includes 1) routine PrEP education for patients, 2) standardized provider training, 3) electronic medical record (EMR) optimization, 4) PrEP navigation, and 5) PrEP clinical champions. These strategies will be adapted to specific clinics for implementation, tested via a stepped-wedge trial, and, if effective, packaged for further dissemination. We will utilize a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial (SW-CRT) to measure change in PrEP utilization across diverse geographic areas. Preparation for adapting and implementing the bundle of strategies is needed to determine how to tailor them to specific clinics. Implementation challenges will include adapting strategies with the available resources at each site, maintaining stakeholder involvement and staff buy-in, adjusting the study protocol and planned procedures as needed, and ensuring minimal crossover. Additionally, strengths and limitations of each strategy must be examined before, during, and after the adaptation and implementation processes. Finally, the implementation outcomes of the strategies must be evaluated to determine the real-world success of the strategies. This study is an important step toward addressing the inequity in PrEP service delivery and increasing PrEP utilization among Black women in the U.S. ",POWER Up-Improving pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake among Black cisgender women in the Southern United States: Protocol for a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial (SW-CRT),"Ridgway JP, Devlin SA, Friedman EE, Enaholo OE, Pyra M, Hirschhorn LR, Haider S, Ducheny K, Johnson AK.",PLoS One. 2023 May 17;18(5):e0285858. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0285858. eCollection 2023.,Ridgway JP,PLoS One,2023,2023/05/17,PMC10191268,,10.1371/journal.pone.0285858

There is a paucity of randomized controlled trials testing PEP adherence interventions, and further research is needed.

The most common neurological disorders not directly related to HIV-1 infection include cerebrovascular disease and lymphoma. Global anoxic-ischemic and necrotizing encephalopathies are frequent, while CNS hemorrhages and arteriopathies are less frequent. Opportunistic CNS infections are uncommon, limited predominantly to monilial and cytomegaloviral encephalitides. Only a few cases of CNS toxoplasmosis have been reported in children. CNS lymphomas often occur in the setting of systemic polymorphous, polyclonal B-cell proliferations that have been associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. Intrinsic effects of HIV-1 on the CNS include microcephaly, diffuse gliosis, basal ganglia mineralization, HIV encephalitis, and corticospinal tract degeneration. Although viral antigens can be detected in microglia and multinucleated cells in HIV encephalitis, most of the CNS effects of HIV-1 infection cannot be attributed to detectable levels of viral antigen, suggesting that the pediatric CNS is unusually susceptible to low-level HIV-1 infection or to systemic effects of HIV-1 infection, possibly mediated by soluble factors, including the inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which have been shown to be increased in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of children with AIDS.

However, the extent to which suboptimal PrEP adherence and retention in care may limit successful implementation is unknown. An agent-based model was used to represent the entire population of MSM in Rhode Island from 2013 to 2017. The impact of potential interventions to improve PrEP adherence and retention in care on HIV transmission was evaluated. Demographics, behaviors, and PrEP adherence and retention in care rates were based on local clinical data. We assumed that 20% of HIV-negative MSM had ever taken PrEP. The primary outcome was HIV incidence over the 5-year period. The model included 23,815 MSM with an estimated 4.1% HIV prevalence based on local surveillance data. An estimated 173.1 new infections occurred over 5 years [95% simulation interval (SI): 171.5-174.7], including 29.1 new infections among individuals who had ever initiated PrEP (95% SI: 28.6-29.7). Interventions that improved retention in PrEP care by an odds of 5.0 compared with the base case maximized reductions in HIV incidence among MSM who had ever initiated PrEP by 37.5%. Interventions focusing on improving PrEP adherence had little to no effect on HIV incidence, regardless of intervention efficacy. Retention in care is a critical component of the PrEP care continuum.

498,190,190,8543713,"Curtailing the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic requires the development of effective strategies for helping people reduce high-risk sexual behavior patterns. Because the objective of HIV prevention involves changing how people behave sexually, research findings in human sexuality are extremely pertinent to efforts to promote AIDS risk reduction. Unfortunately, most public health HIV prevention programs rarely reflect findings of human sexuality research. In this article, research is reviewed in the areas of the relationship contexts of sexuality, including variations in monogamy, condom use in affectionate versus casual relationships, sexual communication, and coercion; the modification of sexual behavior repertoires; substance use in relation to sexual intercourse; and sexual schema and scripts relevant to HIV risk. Policy and training issues related to human sexuality may have hindered efforts to incorporate sexuality research findings in HIV prevention programs. Advances and refinements in the success of HIV prevention efforts are likely if research on human sexuality is better integrated in AIDS prevention programs.

500,192,192,8395480,"Psychosocial associations have been observed with level of cervical dysplasia or ""pre-cancer"" and invasive cervical cancer [related to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection]. Psychoneuroimmunological relationships have been observed in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, which is being described in an increasing number of women. Our objective was to review these relationships regarding effects that might be expected in HIV-1 and HPV co-infected women. This review was based on a Medline literature search supplemented by a manual search of selected journals unrepresented in that database. Relationships of psychosocial factors and level of cervical dysplasia were similarly observed with reference to immunological and health status in asymptomatic and early symptomatic HIV-1 infected homosexual men, suggesting that a potentiating effect may occur in HIV-1 and HPV co-infected women. Consistency of relationships across studies appeared to be enhanced by the use of a biopsychosocial model integrating the effects of life stressors, social support and coping style as well as psychiatric disorders. Research is indicated on the relationships between psychosocial factors, immunological status and clinical health status in this group of women. Because of the high prevalence of psychosocial risk factors for chronic psychological distress in these women and the known immunological and health status decrements occurring with progression of these two infections, a clinical screening program based on the biopsychosocial model is recommended as a means of secondary prevention. If effective in generating treatment referrals, such a program would likely improve quality of life and could aid in the determination of relationships with immunological and health status as well.

503,195,195,18202907,"This article reviews recent literature in chronic illness or long-term health management including asthma, contraception, diabetes, HIV disease, and hypertension/cardiovascular disease, mental disorders, pain, and other diseases to determine the relationship between regimen factors and adherence to medications. The authors conducted an electronic literature search to detect articles published between 1998 and 2007. Articles were included if they pertained to a chronic illness or to contraception, included a clear definition of how adherence was measured, and included regimen factors as primary or secondary explanatory variables. Methodology of the studies varied greatly, as did methods of measuring adherence and regimen factors. Surprisingly few of these articles concerned (1) chronic treatment, (2) regimen factors such as dosing, pill burden, and regimen complexity, and (3) adherence measured in a clear manner. Most studies failed to use state-of-the-art methods of measuring adherence. Despite these flaws, a suggestive pattern of the importance of regimen factors, specifically dose frequency and regimen complexity, emerged from this review.

504,196,196,16641237,"CNS abnormalities can be detected during chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, before the development of opportunistic infections or other sequelae of immunodeficiency. However, although end-stage dementia caused by HIV has been linked to the presence of infected and activated macrophages and microglia in the brain, the nature of the changes resulting in the motor and cognitive disorders in the chronic stage is unknown. Using simian immunodeficiency virus-infected rhesus monkeys, we sought the molecular basis for CNS dysfunction. In the chronic stable stage, nearly 2 years after infection, all animals had verified CNS functional abnormalities. Both virus and infiltrating lymphocytes (CD8+ T-cells) were found in the brain. Molecular analysis revealed that the expression of several immune response genes was increased, including CCL5, which has pleiotropic effects on neurons as well as immune cells. CCL5 was significantly upregulated throughout the course of infection, and in the chronic phase was present in the infiltrating lymphocytes. We have identified an altered state of the CNS at an important stage of the viral-host interaction, likely arising to protect against the virus but in the long term leading to damaging processes.

505,197,197,29404757,"In high prevalence environments relationship characteristics are likely to be associated with HIV risk, yet evidence indicates general underestimation of risk. Furthermore uncertainty about partner's risk may challenge PrEP demand among young African women. We conducted quantitative and qualitative interviews with women before and after HIV discussions with partners, to explore how partner's behavior affected risk perceptions and interest in PrEP. Twenty-three women were interviewed once; twelve had a follow-up interview after speaking to their partners. Fourteen women were willing to have their partner contacted; yet two men participated. Several themes related to relationships and risk were identified. These highlighted that young women's romantic feelings and expectations influenced their perceptions of risk within their relationships, consistent with the concept of motivated reasoning. Findings emphasize challenges in using risk to promote HIV prevention among young women. Framing PrEP in a positive empowering way that avoids linking it to relationship risk may ultimately encourage greater uptake. ","Motivated Reasoning and HIV Risk?

However, effective translation of such results to clinical practice, or even to animal models of AIDS, has been challenging. Among the reasons for this failure are uncertainty as to the most effective cell population(s) to target, the diffuseness of these target cells in the body, and ineffective or insufficiently durable gene delivery.
