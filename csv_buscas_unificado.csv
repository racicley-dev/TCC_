To determine whether lower-dose amoxicillin is noninferior to higher dose and whether 3-day treatment is noninferior to 7 days. Multicenter, randomized, 2 × 2 factorial noninferiority trial enrolling 824 children, aged 6 months and older, with clinically diagnosed CAP, treated with amoxicillin on discharge from emergency departments and inpatient wards of 28 hospitals in the UK and 1 in Ireland between February 2017 and April 2019, with last trial visit on May 21, 2019. Children were randomized 1:1 to receive oral amoxicillin at a lower dose (35-50 mg/kg/d; n = 410) or higher dose (70-90 mg/kg/d; n = 404), for a shorter duration (3 days; n = 413) or a longer duration (7 days; n = 401). The primary outcome was clinically indicated antibiotic re-treatment for respiratory infection within 28 days after randomization. The noninferiority margin was 8%. Secondary outcomes included severity/duration of 9 parent-reported CAP symptoms, 3 antibiotic-related adverse events, and phenotypic resistance in colonizing Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. Of 824 participants randomized into 1 of the 4 groups, 814 received at least 1 dose of trial medication (median [IQR] age, 2.5 years [1.6-2.7]; 421 [52%] males and 393 [48%] females), and the primary outcome was available for 789 (97%). For lower vs higher dose, the primary outcome occurred in 12.6% with lower dose vs 12.4% with higher dose (difference, 0.2% [1-sided 95% CI -∞ to 4.0%]), and in 12.5% with 3-day treatment vs 12.5% with 7-day treatment (difference, 0.1% [1-sided 95% CI -∞ to 3.9]). Both groups demonstrated noninferiority with no significant interaction between dose and duration (P = .63). Of the 14 prespecified secondary end points, the only significant differences were 3-day vs 7-day treatment for cough duration (median 12 days vs 10 days; hazard ratio [HR], 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; P = .04) and sleep disturbed by cough (median, 4 days vs 4 days; HR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; P = .03). Among the subgroup of children with severe CAP, the primary end point occurred in 17.3% of lower-dose recipients vs 13.5% of higher-dose recipients (difference, 3.8% [1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to10%]; P value for interaction = .18) and in 16.0% with 3-day treatment vs 14.8% with 7-day treatment (difference, 1.2% [1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to 7.4%]; P value for interaction = .73). Among children with CAP discharged from an emergency department or hospital ward (within 48 hours), lower-dose outpatient oral amoxicillin was noninferior to higher dose, and 3-day duration was noninferior to 7 days, with regard to need for antibiotic re-treatment. However, disease severity, treatment setting, prior antibiotics received, and acceptability of the noninferiority margin require consideration when interpreting the findings.

1,1,1,34662879,"Helicobacter pylori eradication treatments are widely performed to improve gastric mucosal inflammation, promote ulcer healing, and reduce the incidence of gastric cancer. However, there are several issues associated with H. pylori eradication treatment. First, various treatment regimens are currently used worldwide, and the standard treatment varies with region and country. Second, the antimicrobial resistance of H. pylori is increasing due to indiscriminate antibiotic use. Finally, gut microbiota dysbiosis is potentially induced by H. pylori treatment. Based on current international guidelines and a network meta-analysis comparing the effects of various treatment regimens, nonbismuth quadruple therapies for 10-14 days and vonoprazan-based triple therapy for 7 days are the currently recommended H. pylori treatment regimens. These regimens show good eradication rates of approximately 90%, even in areas where antimicrobial-resistant strains are highly prevalent. However, these regimens still have inherent drawbacks that may promote further increases in antimicrobial resistance and induce gut microbiota dysbiosis because of the empiric use of multiple antibiotics. Key Message: The ideal concept for the present and future H. pylori eradication treatment involves ""a simple, cost-effective strategy that fosters compliance without having a negative impact on the gut microbiota or contributing to future antimicrobial resistance."" One interesting possibility that may fulfill this concept is a dual therapy involving vonoprazan and amoxicillin. This is the simplest treatment regimen that provides acceptable eradication rates, improves safety and tolerability, and minimizes the potential for increasing antimicrobial resistance or causing gut microbiota dysbiosis.

4,4,4,34629204,"Helicobacter pylori infection is very common in the Spanish population and represents the main cause of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, and gastric cancer. The last iteration of Spanish consensus guidelines on H. pylori infection was conducted in 2016. Recent changes in therapeutic schemes along with increasing supporting evidence were key for developing the V Spanish Consensus Conference (May 2021). Fourteen experts performed a systematic review of the scientific evidence and developed a series of recommendations that were subjected to an anonymous Delphi process of iterative voting. Scientific evidence and the strength of the recommendation were classified using GRADE guidelines. An eradication therapy, when prescribed empirically, is considered acceptable when it reliably achieves, or preferably surpass, 90% cure rates. Currently, only quadruple therapies (with or without bismuth) and generally lasting 14 days, accomplish this goal in first- and second-line therapies. A non-bismuth quadruple concomitant regimen (proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole) or a quadruple bismuth-based combination (proton pump inhibitor, bismuth, tetracycline, and metronidazole), are recommended as first-line regimens.

5,5,5,36729890,"No study has investigated the efficacy and safety of vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy compared with bismuth quadruple therapy (B-quadruple). This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 10-day vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy as a first-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection compared with B-quadruple and to explore the optimal dosage of amoxicillin in the dual therapy. A total of 375 treatment-naive, H. pylori -infected subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio into 3 regimen groups including VHA-dual (vonoprazan 20 mg twice/day + amoxicillin 750 mg 4 times/day), VA-dual (vonoprazan 20 mg + amoxicillin 1,000 mg twice/day), and B-quadruple (esomeprazole 20 mg + bismuth 200 mg + amoxicillin 1,000 mg + clarithromycin 500 mg twice/day). Eradication rates, adverse events (AEs), and compliance were compared between 3 groups. The eradication rates of B-quadruple, VHA-dual, and VA-dual were 90.9%, 93.4%, and 85.1%, respectively, by per-protocol analysis; 89.4%, 92.7%, and 84.4%, respectively, by modified intention-to-treat analysis; 88.0%, 91.2%, and 82.4%, respectively, by intention-to-treat analysis. The efficacy of the VHA-dual group was not inferior to the B-quadruple group ( P < 0.001), but VA-dual did not reach a noninferiority margin of -10%. The AEs rates of the B-quadruple group were significantly higher than those of the VHA-dual ( P = 0.012) and VA-dual ( P = 0.001) groups. There was no significant difference in medication compliance among 3 treatment groups ( P = 0.995).

6,6,6,32170476,"As one of the most prevalent infections globally, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) continues to present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges for clinicians worldwide. Diagnostically, the ""test-and-treat"" strategy is the recommended approach for healthcare practitioners when managing this potentially curable disease. The choice of testing method should be based on several factors including patient age, presenting symptoms, and medication use, as well as test reliability, availability, and cost. With rising antibiotic resistance, particularly of macrolides, care must be taken to ensure that therapy is selected based on regional resistance patterns and prior antibiotic exposure. In the USA, macrolide antibiotic resistance rates in some areas have reached or exceeded a generally accepted threshold, such that clarithromycin triple therapy may no longer be an appropriate first-line empiric treatment. Instead, bismuth quadruple therapy should be considered, while levofloxacin-based or alternative macrolide-containing therapies are also options. Once treated, it is essential to test for eradication as untreated H. pylori is associated with serious complications including peptic ulcer disease, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and gastric cancer.

7,7,7,14726904,"Treatment guidelines developed by the Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) were originally published in 2000. These guidelines were designed to: (1) educate clinicians and patients (or patients’ families) about the differences between viral and bacterial rhinosinusitis; (2) reduce the use of antibiotics for nonbacterial nasal/sinus disease; (3) provide recommendations for the diagnosis and optimal treatment of ABRS; (4) promote the use of appropriate antibiotic therapy when bacterial infection is likely; and (5) describe the current understanding of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics and how they relate to the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy. The original guidelines are updated here to include the most recent information on management principles, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, and therapeutic options. An estimated 20 million cases of ABRS occur annually in the United States. According to National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) data, sinusitis is the fifth most common diagnosis for which an antibiotic is prescribed. Sinusitis accounted for 9% and 21% of all pediatric and adult antibiotic prescriptions, respectively, written in 2002. The primary diagnosis of sinusitis results in expenditures of approximately $3.5 billion per year in the United States. ABRS is most often preceded by a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI). Allergy, trauma, dental infection, or other factors that lead to inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses may also predispose individuals to developing ABRS. Patients with a “common cold” (viral URI) usually report some combination of the following symptoms: sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, hyposmia/anosmia, facial pressure, postnasal drip, sore throat, cough, ear fullness, fever, and myalgia. A change in the color or the characteristic of the nasal discharge is not a specific sign of a bacterial infection. Bacterial superinfection may occur at any time during the course of a viral URI. The risk that bacterial superinfection has occurred is greater if the illness is still present after 10 days. Because there may be cases that fall out of the “norm” of this typical progression, practicing clinicians need to rely on their clinical judgment when using these guidelines. In general, however, a diagnosis of ABRS may be made in adults or children with symptoms of a viral URI that have not improved after 10 days or worsen after 5 to 7 days. There may be some or all of the following signs and symptoms: nasal drainage, nasal congestion, facial pressure/pain (especially when unilateral and focused in the region of a particular sinus), postnasal drainage, hyposmia/anosmia, fever, cough, fatigue, maxillary dental pain, and ear pressure/fullness. Physical examination provides limited information in the diagnosis of ABRS. While sometimes helpful, plain film radiographs, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging scans are not necessary for cases of ABRS. The most common bacterial species isolated from the maxillary sinuses of patients with ABRS are  The increasing prevalence of penicillin nonsusceptibility and resistance to other drug classes among  These guidelines apply to both adults and children. When selecting antibiotic therapy for ABRS, the clinician should consider the severity of the disease, the rate of progression of the disease, and recent antibiotic exposure. The guidelines now divide patients with ABRS into two general categories: (1) those with mild symptoms who have not received antibiotics within the past 4 to 6 weeks, and (2) those with mild disease who have received antibiotics within the past 4 to 6 weeks or those with moderate disease regardless of recent antibiotic exposure. The difference in severity of disease does not imply infection with a resistant pathogen. Rather, this terminology indicates the relative degree of acceptance of possible treatment failure and the likelihood of spontaneous resolution of symptoms—patients with more severe symptoms are less likely to resolve their disease spontaneously. The primary goal of antibiotic therapy is to eradicate bacteria from the site of infection, which, in turn, helps (1) return the sinuses back to health; (2) decrease the duration of symptoms to allow patients to resume daily activities more quickly; (3) prevent severe complications such as meningitis and brain abscess; and (4) decrease the development of chronic disease. Severe or life-threatening infections with or without complications are rare, and are not addressed in these guidelines. Prior antibiotic use is a major risk factor associated with the development of infection with antimicrobial-resistant strains. Because recent antimicrobial exposure increases the risk of carriage of and infection due to resistant organisms, antimicrobial therapy should be based upon the patient’s history of recent antibiotic use. The panel’s guidelines, therefore, stratify patients according to antibiotic exposure in the previous 4 to 6 weeks. Lack of response to therapy at ≥72 hours is an arbitrary time established to define treatment failures. Clinicians should monitor the response to antibiotic therapy, which may include instructing the patient to call the office or clinic if symptoms persist or worsen over the next few days. The predicted bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of antibiotics in adults and children has been determined according to mathematical modeling of ABRS developed by Michael Poole, MD, PhD, based on pathogen distribution, resolution rates without treatment, and in vitro microbiologic activity. Antibiotics can be placed into the following relative rank order of predicted clinical efficacy for adults: 90% to 92% = respiratory fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), ceftriaxone, high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (4 g/250 mg/day), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (1.75 g/250 mg/day); 83% to 88% = high-dose amoxicillin (4 g/day), amoxicillin (1.5 g/day), cefpodoxime proxetil, cefixime (based on  ",Antimicrobial treatment guidelines for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis,"Anon JB, Jacobs MR, Poole MD, Ambrose PG, Benninger MS, Hadley JA, Craig WA; Sinus And Allergy Health Partnership.",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2004 Jan;130(1 Suppl):1-45. doi: 10.1016/j.otohns.2003.12.003.,Anon JB,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,2004,2004/01/17,PMC7118847,,10.1016/j.otohns.2003.12.003

It can cause indigestion, gastritis, peptic ulcer, and gastric cancer. H. pylori eradication treatment can effectively control disease progression and reduce the risk of the above conditions. However, the escalating trend of antibiotic resistance presents a global challenge for H. pylori eradication. We aim to provide guidance on pharmacological treatment of H. pylori infection. This clinical practice guideline is developed following the World Health Organization's recommended process, adopting Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation in assessing evidence quality, and utilizing Evidence to Decision framework to formulate clinical recommendations, minimizing bias and increasing transparency of the clinical practice guideline development process. We used the Reporting Items for practice Guidelines in HealThcare (RIGHT) statement and The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) as reporting and conduct guides to ensure the guideline's completeness and transparency. Though decreasing in developed countries, the prevalence of H. pylori remains high in developing countries, causing a major public health burden. This clinical practice guideline contains 12 recommendations concerning pharmacological treatment for H. pylori eradication. Among them, it is worth highlighting that bismuth preparations are inexpensive, safe, and effective, consequently making bismuth quadruple therapy a preferred choice for initial and rescue treatment. In empirical treatment, high-dose dual therapy is equally effective compared with bismuth quadruple therapy. The 12 recommendations in this clinical practice guideline are formed with consideration for stakeholders' values and preferences, resource use, feasibility, and acceptability.

14,14,14,34138408,"Background For amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and meropenem to be effective, concentrations must exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration of infecting pathogens. Objective To retrospectively evaluate time windows between both scheduled prescription and administration and reconstitution-preparation and end of administration of intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and meropenem prescriptions. Setting 37 hospital wards at a tertiary hospital, Belgium. Method All adult hospital stays with at least one amoxicillin-clavulanic acid or meropenem administration in 2018 were reviewed. Time windows were deemed acceptable if < 30 min between prescription and administration and < 90 or < 150 min between reconstitution-preparation and end of administration for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and meropenem, respectively. Main outcome measure Time windows between prescription and administration and between reconstitution-preparation and administration. Results For 50 273 administered prescriptions, both time windows were acceptable in 53.7% of first dose and 56.4% of follow-up dose administrations. 43.7% of first doses did not respect the time window between reconstitution-preparation and administration (2.8%) or between prescription and administration (40.9%). These discrepancies equalled 11.1% and 26.3% for follow-up doses, respectively. Large variation across hospital wards was observed. After the first five consecutive administrations, 93.1% of patients had not received their antibiotics within the time windows allowed. The most striking predictor of timely administration with respect to both prescription and reconstitution-preparation time was prescription synchronisation with nursing administration rounds. Conclusion For amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and meropenem, timeliness of reconstitution-preparation and administration was appropriate in approximately half of administrations. Evaluating and safeguarding the timeliness of antibiotic administration should be considered an important aspect of antibiotic stewardship.

17,17,17,31939272,"Background Indonesian Ministry of Health advocate doctors, especially in government-owned healthcare facility, to prescribe generic drugs including amoxicillin. Although BPOM (the National Agency of Drug and Food Control) already guarantees that the generic amoxicillin and the branded one were interchangeable, lack of confidence in generic drugs still remains among patients, pharmacists, and doctors. This issue supported by lack of publication confirmed the therapeutic equivalence of branded and generic drugs. This study aims to evaluate and compare the in vitro microbiological assay of different generic and branded amoxicillin that are available in Indonesian market, especially those used in government-owned healthcare facilities. Methods Microbiological assays for five samples of amoxicillin tablet containing 500 mg amoxicillin available in Indonesia were determined using a method from Indonesia Pharmacopeia. Samples were coded as Products A to E. The assay was carried out by measuring the diameter of the inhibition zones in the plate agar incubated with Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The obtained data were evaluated to determine the sample potency and compared with the amoxicillin reference standard. Results Minor and insignificant differences (p > 0.05) were found in the diameters of the inhibition zones. Potency ratio measured both in E. coli and S. aureus were all between 95% and 105%. The lowest of the tested samples were from Product C, which resulted to ratio potencies of 96.3% and 95.5% in E. coli and S. aureus, respectively. Conclusions All five samples were in the range of the acceptance criteria. Therefore, from the view of the microbiological assay, these products are in equivalence in quality and are interchangeable.

The distribution of low-quality medical products is a serious problem, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has been proposed as the first choice for a screening device. However, preparation of the reference library for the classification training is a highly difficult process. We herein propose a hetero-device classification between training and test devices. In this proposal, Fourier-transform NIR spectrometer and portable wavelength dispersive NIR spectrometer were used as training and test devices, respectively. As the classifier candidates, we examined 13 algorithms and selected 8. We then optimized the hyperparameters for these classifiers by the grid search and cross validation methods. In the final analysis, few classifiers were found to give acceptable prediction results by the hetero-device classification. When using these methods, it is crucial to examine the results by the classification probability, due to the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Finally, we suggest that k-nearest neighbors, extra trees, and gradient boosting classifiers are the optimal algorithms with high classification probability for the substandard and falsified amoxicillin capsules.

The existing evidence still shows inconsistent reports (< 90%) on HDDT therapy except in some Asian countries. We aimed to assess and compare the efficacy of 14-day HDDT by comparing it to 14-day rabeprazole-containing hybrid therapy (HT) and to investigate the host and bacterial factors predicting the treatment outcomes of eradication therapies. In this open-label, randomized controlled trial, we recruited 243 naïve Helicobacter pylori-infected patients from September 1, 2018, to November 30, 2021. They were randomly allocated (1:1) to the HDDT group (rabeprazole 20 mg and amoxicillin 750 mg q.i.d for 14 days, n = 122) and the HT group (rabeprazole 20 mg and amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. for 7 days, followed by rabeprazole 20 mg, amoxicillin 1 g, clarithromycin 500 mg and metronidazole 500 mg b.i.d. for 7 days, n = 121). Twelve patients were absent during follow-up in the HDDT group and 4 in the HT group, resulting in 110 for the HDDT group and 117 for HT group in the per protocol (PP) study. The outcome was determined by urea breath tests 8 weeks later. The eradication rates for the HDDT and HT groups were 77.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 68.5% to 84.1%) and 94.2% (95% CI: 88.4% to 97.6%) (P < 0.001) in intention-to-treat analysis; 85.5% (95% CI: 77.5% to 91.5%) and 97.4% [95% CI: 92.6% to 99.5%] (P = 0.001) in per protocol analysis. The adverse event rates were 7.3% in the HDDT group and 14.5% in the HT group (P = 0.081). The habit of coffee drinking was the dependent factor for eradication failure in the HDDT group (88.2% vs. 68.8%, P = 0.040), but had no influence in the HT group (97.9% versus 95.0%, P = 0.449) in the univariate analysis. This study demonstrated that 14-day rabeprazole-containing HDDT did not achieve > 90% eradication rates for first-line H. pylori eradication as 14-day rabeprazole-containing HT did.

Scanning electron microscopy showed that the drug containing PLGA and PCL nanofibers produced from the electrospinning process was uniform and bead-free in morphology. The obtained nanofibers had a strong structure and resisted external tension according to the tensiometry results. The cytotoxicity results indicated acceptable cell viability (>80%). Quantification by high-performance liquid chromatography showed almost complete in vitro drug release between 7 and 9 days, whereas 14 days were required for complete drug release in vivo. No significant signs of irritation or inflammatory reaction were detected after three weeks of subcutaneous implantation of nanofibers in the animal models, thus indicating suitable compatibility. The results therefore suggest that the designed nanofibers can be used as potential commercial formulations in the treatment of periodontitis as controlled-release intrapocket drug delivery systems that can increase patient compliance. This is due to their ability to reduce the frequency of administration from three times daily in a systemic manner to once weekly as local delivery.

This class of agents provides faster and more potent acid inhibition than proton pump inhibitors. Most strains of Helicobacter pylori are sensitive to amoxicillin. We hypothesized that dual therapy with VPZ and amoxicillin would provide the sufficient eradication rate for H. pylori infection. To evaluate this, we compared the eradication rate by the dual VPZ/amoxicillin therapy with that by the standard triple VPZ/amoxicillin/clarithromycin therapy. Non-inferiority of the eradication rate of H. pylori by the dual therapy with VPZ 20 mg twice daily (bid) and amoxicillin 500 mg 3 times daily (tid) for 1 week to that by the triple therapy with VPZ 20 mg bid, amoxicillin 750 mg bid and clarithromycin 200 mg bid for 1 week was retrospectively studied. Propensity score matching was performed to improve comparability between 2 regimen groups. Successful eradication was diagnosed using the [13C]-urea breath test at 1-2 months after the end of eradication therapy. The intention-to-treat analysis demonstrated that the eradication rate by the dual therapy (92.9%; 95% CI 82.7-98.0%, 52/56) was not inferior to that of the triple therapy (91.9%; 95% CI 80.4-97.0%, 51/56; OR 1.275, 95% CI 0.324-5.017%, p = 0.728).

25,25,25,29489447,"Amoxicillin-clavulanate is extensively used in European hospitals. Whether the hospital use of amoxicillin-clavulanate is associated with nonsusceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins (3GC) in Klebsiella pneumoniae is unknown. Our aim was to assess the relationship between the hospital use of amoxicillin-clavulanate and 3GC nonsusceptibility in K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Yearly data of antibiotic use and 3GC nonsusceptibility in K. pneumoniae and E. coli were obtained from 33 French hospitals between 2011 and 2016. Decreased susceptibility to 3GC and Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) production were modelled from antibiotic use with linear mixed models on years 2011 to 2015, and validated on year 2016. Nonsusceptibility to 3GC increased in K. pneumoniae and E. coli. In a multivariable model that included year and use of 3GC and fluoroquinolones as explanatory variables, amoxicillin-clavulanate use was protective against 3GC nonsusceptibility in K. pneumoniae (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.992 [0.988-0.997]), and with ESBL production in K. pneumoniae (IRR, 0.989 [0.985-0.992]). The correlation coefficient between observed and predicted numbers of 3GC-nonsusceptible K. pneumoniae in 2016 was 0.95 (95% confidence interval, 0.89-0.98). There was no significant association between amoxicillin-clavulanate use and 3GC nonsusceptibility in E. coli. Amoxicillin-clavulanate hospital use was protective against nonsusceptibility to 3GC in K. pneumoniae. Conversely, it was not associated with susceptibility to 3GC in E. coli. To decrease the hospital use of 3GC and fluoroquinolones, and 3GC nonsusceptibility in K. pneumoniae, it may be acceptable to increase the hospital use of amoxicillin-clavulanate.

Periodontitis is associated with specific bacterial species and herpesviruses, and successful prevention and treatment of the disease is contingent upon effective control of these pathogens. This article presents an efficacious, highly safe, minimally invasive, practical and low-cost periodontal therapy that involves professional and patient-administered mechanical therapy and antimicrobial agents. The major components are scaling for calculus removal, periodontal pocket irrigation with potent antiseptics, and treatment with systemic antibiotics for advanced disease. Povidone-iodine and sodium hypochlorite have all the characteristics for becoming the first-choice antiseptics in the management of periodontal diseases. Both agents show excellent antibacterial and antiviral properties, are readily available throughout the world, have been safely used in periodontal therapy for decades, offer significant benefits for individuals with very limited financial resources, and are well accepted by most dental professionals and patients. Four per cent chlorhexidine applied with a toothbrush to the most posterior part to the tongue dorsum can markedly reduce or eliminate halitosis in most individuals. Systemic antibiotics are used to treat periodontopathic bacteria that are not readily reached by topical therapy, such as pathogens within gingival tissue, within furcation defects, at the base of periodontal pockets, and on the tongue, tonsils and buccal mucosae. Valuable antibiotic therapies are amoxicillin-metronidazole (250 mg of amoxicillin and 250 mg of metronidazole, three times daily for 8 days) for young and middle-aged patients, and ciprofloxacin-metronidazole (500 mg of each, twice daily for 8 days) for elderly patients and for patients in developing countries who frequently harbor enteric rods subgingivally.

This study was designed to formulate amoxicillin effervescent tablets, aimed at improved patient compliance and increased drug stability. In this study, nine effervescent tablet formulations were prepared from amoxicillin trihydrate. The effervescent base was comprised of various amounts of citric acid and sodium bicarbonate. Powders and granules were evaluated for their particle size, bulk density, tapped density, compressibility index, Hausner's ratio and angle of repose. The effervescent tablets were then prepared from powders and granules of acceptable quality by direct compression and fusion methods. The tablets were evaluated for weight variation, friability, pH of solution, carbon dioxide (CO2) content, hardness, effervescence time, thickness, assay, content uniformity, water content and equilibrium moisture content. The results indicated better flowability of granules prepared by fusion method as compared with the direct compression. The percent weight variations of tablets were within the acceptable limit of 0.5%. The friability was less than 1% in all formulations. The solution pH of tablets prepared by direct compression and fusion methods ranged from 4.55 to 5.74 and 4.74-5.84, respectively. The CO2 amounts generated by of fusion method tablets were smaller as compared to the direct compression method. The hardness of tablets was 40.66-56 for direct compression method and 60.6-74.6 for fusion method. The tablets produced by the fusion method had a larger thickness and lower water content than tablets produced by direct compression method.

We identified eligible reports from searches of PubMed, Medline®, the Cochrane Library, Imbiomed, LILACS, and Google Scholar. Studies that met our minimum requirements were evaluated using inclusion and exclusion criteria and the Oxford Quality Scale. Those with a score of 3 or more on this Scale were included and their data were extracted and analysed. For evaluation of the risk of infection the absolute risk reduction, number needed to treat, and 95% CI were calculated. For evaluation of the risk of an adverse effect the absolute risk increase, number needed to harm, and 95% CI were calculated using the Risk Reduction Calculator. Each meta-analysis was made with the help of the Mantel-Haenszel random effects model, and estimates of risk (OR) and 95% CI were calculated using the Review Manager 5.3, from the Cochrane Library. A significant risk was assumed when the lower limit of the 95% CI was greater than 1. Probabilities of less than 0.05 were accepted as significant. The results showed that there was no reduction in the risk of infection when amoxicillin was given before or after operation compared with an untreated group or placebo.

The study aim was to compare acceptability, adherence and clinical outcome of amoxicillin DT and amoxicillin oral suspension (OS) in the treatment of children aged 2-59 months with pneumonia in Kenya. We conducted a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial and utilized quantitative methods. The community unit was the unit of randomization. Children aged 2-59 months with pneumonia were enrolled and treated with either amoxicillin DT or OS. Acceptability was defined as the perception of taste of medication as the same or better compared to other medicines and expression of willingness of caregivers to use DT/OS in future, adherence was measured based on the dose, frequency, and duration of treatment, and clinical outcome as complete resolution of symptoms without change of antibiotic treatment. Equivalence was defined as a difference of ≤8% between study arms. We found high levels of acceptability among both DT (93.9%) and OS (96.1%) arms (difference 2.3%, 90% CI -2.6-7.3). The objective measure of adherence on day four and the overall objective measure were significantly higher among children on DT compared to children on OS (88.7% vs. 41.5% (difference 47.2%, 90% CI 31.0-63.3) & 83.5% vs. 39% (difference 44.5%, 90% CI 27.9-60.9), respectively).

The aim of this study was to model efficacious and safe exposure for current neonatal amoxicillin dosing regimens, given a range of assumptions for minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), targeted %fT > MIC, and potential for aminopenicillin-related neurotoxicity. Individual intravenous amoxicillin exposures based on 6 international and 9 Swiss neonatal dosing recommendations, reflecting the range of current dosing approaches, were assessed by a previously developed population pharmacokinetic model informed by neonatal data from an international cohort. Exposure was simulated by attributing each dosing regimen to each patient cohort. End points of interest were %fT > MIC and potential neurotoxicity using Cmax > 140 mg/L as threshold. None of the dosing regimens achieved targets of ≥100%fT > MIC at any of the relevant MICs for a desired probability of target attainment (PTA) of ≥90%. All regimens achieved a PTA ≥90% for Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC 0.25 mg/L) and Listeria monocytogenes (MIC 1 mg/L) when targeting ≤70%fT > MIC. In contrast, none of the regimens resulted in a PTA ≥90% targeting ≥70%fT > MIC for enterococci (MIC 4 mg/L). The maximum amoxicillin concentration associated with potential neurotoxicity was exceeded using 4 dosing regimens (100 mg/kg q12, 60/30 mg/kg q12/8, 50 mg/kg q12/8/6, and 50 mg/kg q12/8/4) for ≥10% of neonates. The acceptability of regimens is highly influenced by efficacy and toxicity targets, the selection of which is challenging.

The aim of this study was to compare quadruple and triple furazolidone-based regimens to achieve an economically affordable regimen with acceptable success rate and fewer side effects. Patients with Helicobacter pylori positive peptic ulcer disease were randomly allocated into two groups: amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d., furazolidone 200 mg b.i.d. and omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d. with or without bismuth subcitrate 240 mg b.i.d. for two weeks (amoxicillin, furazolidone, omeprazole, bismuth and amoxicillin, furazolidone, omeprazole regimens, respectively). Helicobacter pylori eradication was confirmed by 13C-urea breath test 12 weeks after the end of therapy. Eighty-six patients were enrolled, but 16 patients discontinued their therapy or follow-up. The eradication rates with amoxicillin, furazolidone, omeprazole, bismuth and amoxicillin, furazolidone, omeprazole were 85.3% and 61.1% by per-protocol analysis, respectively (p=0.02) and 67.4% and 51.2% by intention-to-treat analysis, respectively (p<0.05). The most frequent adverse effects in the two study groups were weakness, nausea, anorexia, and dizziness, and no significant differences between the groups were shown. Based on the results in this study, furazolidone-based triple therapy (without bismuth) is not recommended for Helicobacter pylori eradication because of the lower eradication rate and unchanged frequency of adverse effects.

The decreased removal in a mixed antibiotic solution was attributed to competition between antibiotics for: firstly, active sites of iron oxide for the adsorption; and secondly, accepted electrons for the degradation in passivation of the nZVI surface. These were confirmed by various characterization techniques. Kinetics studies of mixed antibiotics using B-Fe/Ni confirmed that adsorption and degradation occurred simultaneously as removing of antibiotics in the presence of particles. Furthermore, the stability and durability of B-Fe/Ni applied to remove β-lactam antibiotics was demonstrated. Finally, B-Fe/Ni was used to reduce the concentration of mixed antibiotics from pharmaceutical wastewater, which indicated B-Fe/Ni is a promising material for antibiotics wastewater treatment.

The typical clinical signs are abdominal pain with tenderness and fever. 30% have no signs of peritonitis. Then clinical worsening, encephalopathy, rising serum creatinine levels, and therapy resistant ascites may be the only clinical features. SBP must be differentiated from bacterascites and culture negative neutrocytic ascites by the polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) count in the ascites and the presence of positive culture results, which has prognostic implications. Gram negative rods from the colon play an important etiological role in SBP. Gastrointestinal bleeding, lack of serum complement, a low ascites protein and the extent of intrahepatic shunts predispose to SBP. Then, prophylaxis with the comparable drugs neomycin and norfloxacin is indicated. Coexisting encephalopathy has to be treated by the therefore effective neomycin. Otherwise, norfloxacin is the drug of choice because of better acceptance and lower costs. Chemical parameters of the ascites (pH value less than 7.4; LDH and lactate greater than serum levels; glucose less than 50 mg%) help to assess the severity of peritonitis. The course of ascitic PMN under therapy and the time of persisting positive cultures can discriminate SBP from secondary peritonitis. Antibiotics of choice are amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefotaxime. Short course therapy (5 days) is a effective as long course therapy (10 days).

Claimed advantages of the drug are synergistic activity, bactericidal activity and ability to decrease the rate of emergence of resistance to the individual components. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the drug of choice for treatment of pneumocystosis and an acceptable oral therapy for recurrent urinary tract infections caused by susceptible bacteria. In children with otitis media, it is used as an alternative to ampicillin and amoxicillin and is preferred when these patients are penicillin-sensitive or when the infection is caused by beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae. Hematologic reactions (anemia, thrombocytopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis) to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole occur rarely.

Only a small minority of patients labeled with penicillin allergy will be confirmed to be hypersensitive with the current reference standard test, an oral amoxicillin therapeutic dose challenge. Skin testing has been recommended prior to oral challenges to reduce the risk of severe acute challenge reactions. The rate of severe acute anaphylactic reactions with oral amoxicillin is currently extremely low. Unfortunately, penicillin skin testing, as commonly performed, has a high rate of false positive results. Encouraging skin testing in all individuals with an unconfirmed penicillin allergy, prior to a confirmatory oral challenge, would be technically difficult, make testing all individuals with an unconfirmed penicillin allergy very unlikely, and ultimately increase the risk to patients because of suboptimal antibiotic use. Most patients, who are appropriate candidates for a direct oral amoxicillin challenge, to confirm current penicillin tolerance, can be safely identified by their clinical histories. Higher risk individuals, those with a history of anaphylaxis or other acute onset potentially IgE-mediated reaction such as hives within 6 h of the first dose of the last course of a penicillin, may benefit from properly performed puncture and intradermal skin testing, using commercially available penicilloyl-polylysine, prior to an oral challenge, if skin test negative.

45,45,45,32815909,"Lyme arthritis was described in 1977, after an apparent outbreak of juvenile idiopathic arthritis in Lyme, Connecticut. The evolution of the disease has been meticulously described with presentation dependent on disease duration and previous therapy. Erythema migrans is typically the first manifestation. Untreated patients often develop early disseminated disease, characterized by migratory polyarthralgia, potentially with cardiac and/or neurologic sequelae. If untreated, most patients develop late Lyme arthritis, characterized as a monoarthritis or oligoarthritis, typically involving the knees. Serologies are strongly positive at this stage; if positive, Lyme PCR from synovial fluid confirms the diagnosis. Doxycycline is recommended for late Lyme arthritis, although amoxicillin or ceftriaxone may be considered.Initial antibiotic therapy for late Lyme arthritis is insufficient for a subset of patients. However, serologies and synovial fluid PCR are not useful at determining whether infection persists after oral therapy. As such, ceftriaxone is recommended in patients with inadequate response to doxycycline or amoxicillin.Approximately 10% of patients have persistent arthritis despite antimicrobial therapy, termed postinfectious Lyme arthritis, which is thought to be related to prolonged inflammation and unique microbial and host interaction. Therapy at this stage relies on immunosuppression and/or synovectomy. Lyme arthritis provides unique insights into the complex interplay between microbes and host immunity. The progression from localized erythema migrans to early disseminated disease and late Lyme arthritis allows insight into arthritis initiation, and the study of postinfectious Lyme arthritis allows further insight into mechanisms of arthritis persistence.

46,46,46,36856926,"Helicobacter pylori infects a large percentage of the world's population and is etiologically related to gastric cancer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved two 14-day vonoprazan-containing regimens (vonoprazan-amoxicillin with or without clarithromycin) for H. pylori infections in the United States/Europe. We critically reviewed the trial methods to discover why the results were unacceptable low [i.e., no regimen achieved clinically acceptable (≥ 90%) or even conditionally acceptable cure rates (≥ 85%)]. Cure rates with antibiotic susceptible strains were 84.7 for vonoprazan triple therapy, 78.5 for vonoprazan-amoxicillin, and 78.7 for lansoprazole triple therapy, respectively. As was previously shown in Japan, the benefit from adding clarithromycin to vonoprazan-amoxicillin was minimal and the majority of the clarithromycin administered was unnecessary. The possible reasons for failure to achieve high cure rates discussed include (a) reduced intragastric antibiotic concentrations, (b) an increase in heteroresistance, and (c) failure to achieve an intragastric pH conducive for amoxicillin to eradicate the infection. In addition, there was no pilot study or other attempt to optimize any regimen. The most likely reason for failure was failure to achieve high intragastric concentrations of antibiotics or to achieve an intragastric pH conducive for amoxicillin to be active. Importantly, vonoprazan triple therapy resulted in > 10 tons of unneeded clarithromycin/million courses of vonoprazan triple therapy. Antibiotic misuse combined with low cure rates suggest that vonoprazan-clarithromycin triple therapies should not be prescribed for H. pylori infection. Dual vonoprazan-amoxicillin therapy has proven effective elsewhere and after optimization may eventually prove useful in the U.S./Europe.

Despite this there remains little evidence-based literature on what should be prescribed for any given clinical situation, at what dosage and for how long. Given the current climate of evidence-based research, the need to keep antibiotic prescribing to an acceptable minimum, increasing levels of resistance of micro-organisms and widespread hospital infections with 'superbugs', there is a distinct need for appropriate prescribing guidelines. Considering best practice, an extensive review of the literature and a thorough understanding of current empirical treatment regimes, an attempt has been made to recommend suitable antibiotic prescribing for the adult patient suffering from acute dentoalveolar infections based on evidence.

48,48,48,10828750,"Despite intensive research and widely publicized recommendations from consensus meetings in different continents, the public and primary care physicians are relatively slow in picking up the impact of Helicobacter pylori infection and identifying optimal therapies. The treatment of H. pylori infection has evolved from bismuth-containing regimens, 2-week proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-dual therapies, and now, the widely accepted PPI/ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC) single week triple therapies. There is a wealth of evidence showing that these regimens are highly efficacious and well tolerated by patients. The MACH-2 studies have confirmed that the addition of a PPI to two antimicrobials has significantly improved the cure rate of H. pylori infection and reduced the impact of antimicrobial resistance. Attempts to use shorter regimens ranging from 1 to 3 days should be resisted because of their unacceptably low therapeutic efficacy. In the United States, there are some indications that 10-14 days of treatment may be required. While the first-line therapies for H. pylori infection is well established, we are still struggling with the choice of optimal regimen in retreatment after the first attempt fails. Quadruple therapy combining PPI with bismuth, metronidazole and tetracycline has achieved a respectable success of around 85%. Switching between metronidazole and clarithromycin seems to be a sensible strategy as these two are the most effective anti-Helicobacter agents. Changing between PPI and RBC in the triple therapy would not make much difference without replacing some of the antimicrobials. Rifabutin-containing regimens and high-dose PPI-amoxicillin dual therapy deserve more studies with large-scale studies. Data on anti-Helicobacter therapy for children are few. Most studies based on bismuth derivatives in combination with amoxicillin or tinidazole and were limited by the small number of cases. Recent studies showed 1-week bismuth-based triple therapy and 2-week PPI-based triple therapy are highly efficacious. Reinfection in children > 5 years of age after successful cure is rare. It is worthwhile to refine the optimal therapy for children as the treatment of this group would, theoretically, prevent the development gastric cancer in the long term.

49,49,49,25216741,"Penicillin is the most common beta-lactam antibiotic allergy and the most common drug class allergy, reported in about 8% of individuals using health care in the USA. Only about 1% of individuals using health care in the USA have a cephalosporin allergy noted in their medical record, and other specific non-penicillin, non-cephalosporin beta-lactam allergies are even rarer. Most reported penicillin allergy is not associated with clinically significant IgE-mediated reactions after penicillin rechallenge. Un-verified penicillin allergy is a significant and growing public health problem. Clinically significant IgE-mediated penicillin allergy can be safely confirmed or refuted using skin testing with penicilloyl-poly-lysine and native penicillin G and, if skin test is negative, an oral amoxicillin challenge. Acute tolerance of an oral therapeutic dose of a penicillin class antibiotic is the current gold standard test for a lack of clinically significant IgE-mediated penicillin allergy. Cephalosporins and other non-penicillin beta-lactams are widely, safely, and appropriately used in individuals, even with confirmed penicillin allergy. There is little, if any, clinically significant immunologic cross-reactivity between penicillins and other beta-lactams. Routine cephalosporin skin testing should be restricted to research settings. It is rarely needed clinically to safely manage patients and has unclear predictive value at this time. The use of alternative cephalosporins, with different side chains, is acceptable in the setting of a specific cephalosporin allergy. Carbapenems and monobactams are also safely used in individuals with confirmed penicillin allergy.

Nineteen experts participated, who performed a systematic review of the scientific evidence and developed a series of recommendation that were subjected to an anonymous Delphi process of iterative voting. Scientific evidence and the strength of the recommendation were classified using GRADE guidelines. As starting point, this consensus increased the minimum acceptable efficacy of recommended treatments that should reach, or preferably surpass, the 90% cure rate when prescribed empirically. Therefore, only quadruple therapies (with or without bismuth), and generally lasting 14 days, are recommended both for first and second line treatments.

The aim of this prospective and randomized study was to compare the efficacy of clarithromycin and metronidazole when they were combined with omeprazole and amoxicillin on eradication of H. pylori and ulcer healing in Chinese peptic ulcer patients. A total of 103 subjects with H. pylori-positive peptic ulcer were randomly divided into two groups, and accepted triple therapy with omeprazole 20 mg, amoxicillin 1000 mg and either clarithromycin 500 mg (OAC group, n = 58) or metronidazole 400 mg (OAM group, n = 45). All drugs were given twice daily for 7 d. Patients with active peptic ulcer were treated with omeprazole 20 mg daily for 2-4 wk after anti-H. pylori therapy. Six to eight weeks after omeprazole therapy, all patients underwent endoscopies and four biopsies (two from the antrum and two others from the corpus of stomach) were taken for rapid urease test and histological analysis (with modified Giemsa staining) to examine H. pylori. Successful eradication was defined as negative results from both examination methods. One hundred patients completed the entire course of therapy and returned for follow-up. The eradication rate of H. pylori for the per-protocol analysis was 89.3% (50/56) in OAC group and 84.1% (37/44) in OAM group. Based on the intention-to-treat analysis, the eradication rate of H. pylori was 86.2% (50/58) in OAC group and 82.2% (37/45) in OAM group. There were no significant differences in eradication rates between the two groups on either analysis. The active ulcer-healing rate was 96.7% (29/30) in OAC group and 100% (21/21) in OAM group (per-protocol analysis, P>0.05).

Prevalence of H. pylori was 38.2%. Antibiotic resistance was 80.0% for metronidazole, 11.1% for levofloxacin and no resistance seen in amoxicillin, tetracycline and clarithromycin. Overall eradication rates of 7-day and 14-day regimens were 51.9% and 80.0%, p = 0.02. Female and age ≥40 years had significantly higher eradication rate when receiving 14-day compared to 7-day regimen (94.1% vs. 45.9%, OR = 18.82; 95% CI 2.26-157.02, p = 0.0007 and 86.7% vs. 50.0%, OR = 6.50; 95% CI 1.25-33.91, p = 0.02, respectively). Fourteen-day regimen might be an acceptable regimen for H. pylori eradication in limited resource area such as Bhutan. Female and age ≥40 years should receive longer duration of treatment. This 14-day regimen could at least reduce the risk of developing H. pylori-associated diseases especially peptic ulcer with complications and gastric cancer which lead to many deaths in Bhutan.<br />.

59,59,59,18092706,"Diagnostic criteria for acute otitis media include rapid onset of symptoms, middle ear effusion, and signs and symptoms of middle ear inflammation. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common bacterial isolates from the middle ear fluid of children with acute otitis media. Fever, otalgia, headache, irritability, cough, rhinitis, listlessness, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, and pulling at the ears are common, but nonspecific symptoms. Detection of middle ear effusion by pneumatic otoscopy is key in establishing the diagnosis. Observation is an acceptable option in healthy children with mild symptoms. Antibiotics are recommended in all children younger than six months, in those between six months and two years if the diagnosis is certain, and in children with severe infection. High-dosage amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg per kg per day) is recommended as first-line therapy. Macrolide antibiotics, clindamycin, and cephalosporins are alternatives in penicillin-sensitive children and in those with resistant infections.

61,61,61,8644782,"Helicobacter pylori is probably the most common bacterial infection worldwide and the accepted cause of chronic active gastritis. It has a critical role in duodenal ulcer, where the prevalence of infection is 90-95%. There is a dramatic reduction in the rate of ulcer recurrence after successful eradication of the organism to about 4% per annum compared with up to 80% when the infection persists. What is true for duodenal ulcers is also true for patients with gastric ulcer who are infected with H. pylori. The risk of recurrent ulcer complications with bleeding is virtually abolished following successful eradication of H. pylori; in contrast, the risk of rebleeding is about 33% in patients still harboring the organism. The treatment of H. pylori infection in patients with confirmed peptic ulcer on first presentation or recurrence has been advocated by a Consensus Conference of the National Institutes of Health. The most evaluated regimens include dual therapy with a proton pump inhibitor and either amoxicillin or clarithromycin, and bismuth-based triple therapy with metronidazole and tetracycline. The use of a proton pump inhibitor-containing regimen offers the advantage of rapid symptom relief and the highest rates of duodenal ulcer healing. Moreover, combinations of a proton pump inhibitor and clarithromycin show more predictable and higher eradication rates than amoxicillin combinations. Newer triple therapies with a proton pump inhibitor plus two antibacterial agents given for 7-1O days are being increasingly described and may become the treatment of choice if initial results are confirmed. However, the optimum dosage regimen needs to be established. A new combination of ranitidine bismuth citrate and clarithromycin has also recently been shown to be effective. At this time it is reasonable to consider all patients with confirmed duodenal or gastric ulcer for eradication of H. pylori, and no patient should be considered for elective surgery without first being offered eradication therapy.

63,63,63,26942258,"In patients with gastric or duodenal ulcer associated with Helicobacter pylori, treatment of the infection improves healing and prevents complications and recurrences. The drug regimen generally consists of a high-dose proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) such as omeprazole plus antibiotics. Using the standard Prescrire methodology, we conducted a review of the literature in order to determine the standard empirical antibiotic regimen for H. pylori infection in adults with gastric or duodenal ulcer in France. In 2015, due to an increase in H. pylori resistance to clarithromycin, a 7-day course of the PPI + clarithromycin + amoxicillin combination is effective in only about 70% of cases. A Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of trials involving thousands of patients suggests that prolonging treatment with a PPI + amoxicillin + clarithromycin or a PPI + amoxicillin + metronidazole to 10 or 14 days improves the rate of H. pylori eradication by 5% to 10%. A metanalysis of seven trials including a total of about 1000 patients showed that combination therapy with a PPI + amoxicillin + clarithromycin + metronidazole for 5 days eradicates H. pylori in about 90% of cases, compared to about 80% of cases with a PPI + amoxicillin + clarithromycin given for 7 days. Sequential treatment with amoxicillin for 5 days, followed by clarithromycin + metronidazole for 5 days, has also been tested in thousands of patients. Efficacy and adverse effects were similar to those observed when the same antibiotics were taken simultaneously for 5 days. In randomised trials, replacing clarithromycin or amoxicillin with a fluoroquinolone yielded conflicting results. In 2009, nearly 20% of H. pylori isolates were resistant to levofloxacin in France. Tetracycline has only been evaluated in combination with bismuth. The few available data on doxycycline suggest that its efficacy is similar to that of tetracycline. A fixed-dose combination of bismuth subcitrate potassium + metronidazole + tetracycline is authorised in the European Union for use in combination with omeprazole for 10 days. It seems effective, even in case of clarithromycin resistance. However, bismuth can cause encephalopathy, and its value when added to antibiotics and a PPI is poorly documented. We found no robust comparative data on second-line empirical treatments. In patients with gastric or duodenal ulcer associated with H. pylori, eradication of the bacterium reduces the risk of complications and recurrence. In mid-2015, the choice of antibiotics is based on trials in which the primary endpoint was a negative urea breath test, which is an acceptable surrogate criterion. In previously untreated patients, the first-choice empirical treatment consists of three antibiotics: amoxicillin (2 g daily), clarithromycin (1 g daily) and metronidazole (1 g daily), plus a PPI (in practice, omeprazole 40 mg daily), with each drug taken in two divided doses per day. The antibiotics may be taken either simultaneously for five days, or sequentially (amoxicillin for 5 days, followed by clarithromycin + metronidazole for 5 days). The adverse effects of these antibiotic combinations correspond to those of their component drugs, which mainly consist of gastrointestinal disorders and the disulfiram-like reaction of metronidazole. Amoxicillin can be replaced by a fluoroquinolone in patients allergic to beta-lactam antibiotics, but there is a higher risk of resistance. Tetracycline and doxycycline appear effective, as few H. pylori strains are resistant in vitro. Bismuth can cause encephalopathy and should only be used in special cases.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-amoxicillin dual therapy dosing four times daily (q.i.d.) for 14 days could achieve an eradication rate of more than 85%. It is unclear whether dual therapy with shorter treatment duration or lower dosing frequency could also attain a satisfactory cure rate. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of two modified esomeprazole-amoxicillin dual therapies, 10-day q.i.d. and 14-day three times daily (t.i.d.) dual therapy, and investigate the factors that might affect the eradication rates. A total of 253 patients were screened for eligibility and 208 patients were randomly assigned to 10-day dual therapy (esomeprazole 20 mg and amoxicillin 750 mg, all given four times daily) or 14-day dual therapy (esomeprazole 20 mg and amoxicillin 1000 mg, all given three times daily).

65,65,65,16688818,"H pylori gastric infection is one of the most prevalent infectious diseases worldwide. The discovery that most upper gastrointestinal diseases are related to H pylori infection and therefore can be treated with antibiotics is an important medical advance. Currently, a first-line triple therapy based on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC) plus two antibiotics (clarithromycin and amoxicillin or nitroimidazole) is recommended by all consensus conferences and guidelines. Even with the correct use of this drug combination, infection can not be eradicated in up to 23% of patients. Therefore, several second line therapies have been recommended. A 7 d quadruple therapy based on PPI, bismuth, tetracycline and metronidazole is the more frequently accepted. However, with second-line therapy, bacterial eradication may fail in up to 40% of cases. When H pylori eradication is strictly indicated the choice of further treatment is controversial. Currently, a standard third-line therapy is lacking and various protocols have been proposed. Even after two consecutive failures, the most recent literature data have demonstrated that H pylori eradication can be achieved in almost all patients, even when antibiotic susceptibility is not tested.

69,69,69,9360057,"The nitroimidazole antibiotic metronidazole has a limited spectrum of activity that encompasses various protozoans and most Gram-negative and Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria. Metronidazole has activity against protozoans like Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia and Trichomonas vaginalis, for which the drug was first approved as an effective treatment. Anaerobic bacteria which are typically sensitive are primarily Gram-negative anaerobes belonging to the Bacteroides and Fusobacterium spp. Gram-positive anaerobes such as peptostreptococci and Clostridia spp. are likely to test sensitive to metronidazole, but resistant isolates are probably encountered with greater frequency than with the Gram-negative anaerobes. Gardnerella vaginalis is a pleomorphic Gram-variable bacterial bacillus that is also susceptible to metronidazole. Helicobacter pylori has been strongly associated with gastritis and duodenal ulcers. Classic regimens for eradicating this pathogen have included metronidazole, usually with acid suppression medication plus bismuth and amoxicillin. The activity of metronidazole against anaerobic bowel flora has been used for prophylaxis and treatment of patients with Crohn's disease who might develop an infectious complication. Treatment of Clostridium difficile-induced pseudomembraneous colitis has usually been with oral metronidazole or vancomycin, but the lower cost and similar efficacy of metronidazole, coupled with the increased concern about imprudent use of vancomycin leading to increased resistance in enterococci, have made metronidazole the preferred agent here. Metronidazole has played an important role in anaerobic-related infections. Advantages to using metronidazole are the percentage of sensitive Gram-negative anaerobes, its availability as oral and intravenous dosage forms, its rapid bacterial killing, its good tissue penetration, its considerably lower chance of inducing C. difficile colitis, and expense. Metronidazole has notable effectiveness in treating anaerobic brain abscesses. Metronidazole is a cost-effective agent due to its low acquisition cost, its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, an acceptable adverse effect profile, and its undiminished antimicrobial activity. While its role as part of a therapeutic regimen for treating mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections has been reduced by newer, more expensive combination therapies, these new combinations have not been shown to have any therapeutic advantage over metronidazole. Although the use of metronidazole on a global scale has been curtailed by newer agents for various infections, metronidazole still has a role for these and other therapeutic uses. Many clinicians still consider metronidazole to be the 'gold standard' antibiotic against which all other antibiotics with anaerobic activity should be compared. ",Metronidazole.

72,72,72,21322515,"Acute urinary tract infections are relatively common in children, with 8 percent of girls and 2 percent of boys having at least one episode by seven years of age. The most common pathogen is Escherichia coli, accounting for approximately 85 percent of urinary tract infections in children. Renal parenchymal defects are present in 3 to 15 percent of children within one to two years of their first diagnosed urinary tract infection. Clinical signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection depend on the age of the child, but all febrile children two to 24 months of age with no obvious cause of infection should be evaluated for urinary tract infection (with the exception of circumcised boys older than 12 months). Evaluation of older children may depend on the clinical presentation and symptoms that point toward a urinary source (e.g., leukocyte esterase or nitrite present on dipstick testing; pyuria of at least 10 white blood cells per high-power field and bacteriuria on microscopy). Increased rates of E. coli resistance have made amoxicillin a less acceptable choice for treatment, and studies have found higher cure rates with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Other treatment options include amoxicillin/clavulanate and cephalosporins. Prophylactic antibiotics do not reduce the risk of subsequent urinary tract infections, even in children with mild to moderate vesicoureteral reflux. Constipation should be avoided to help prevent urinary tract infections. Ultrasonography, cystography, and a renal cortical scan should be considered in children with urinary tract infections.

Caregivers of children aged 2-59 months, health service providers and key stakeholders at national and district level. An intervention including training and job aids and user-friendly instructions was introduced in one subdistrict while standard amoxicillin DT packaging and instructions with no training served as the control in the comparison subdistrict. Adherence behaviour of caregivers of children aged 2-59 months for the treatment of childhood pneumonia with amoxicillin DT. We conducted a survey with 56 caregivers in the intervention subdistrict and 38 caregivers in the comparison subdistrict. We also conducted 44 in-depth interviews to evaluate the job aids and user-friendly instructions with healthcare providers and caregivers to assess the feasibility, usability and acceptability of the tools in intervention subdistrict. For 5-day treatment course, 32.1% (95% CI 23.1% to 41.1%) of caregivers in the intervention subdistrict and 2.6% (95% CI 0.3% to 7.8%) in the comparison subdistrict maintained full adherence to the amoxicillin DT treatment for pneumonia. More children under 12 months were given age-appropriate treatment than older children. Key stakeholders and healthcare providers considered the use and integration of the tools into the health system to be feasible and acceptable. The provision of tools for the treatment of childhood pneumonia with amoxicillin DT had a positive influence on adherence behaviours.

Apart from one E. coli, the strains were highly resistant to amoxicillin due to beta-lactamase production. Synergy was demonstrated in all strains by agar dilution. Synergy was detected against the beta-lactamase-producing strains under simulated in vivo conditions with constantly decreasing concentrations simulating in vivo pharmacokinetics. The correlation between antibacterial activity determined by minimum inhibitory concentrations and bacterial kill kinetics in the in vivo simulation model was acceptable. A higher bacterial kill rate was observed when the antibiotic dosage was increased beyond the minimum concentration where an antibacterial effect was seen; this was not demonstrable by traditional agar dilution tests. In combination, a greater relative amount of amoxicillin compared to clavulanic acid allows a reduction in the total amount of antimicrobial agents with the same degree of antibacterial activity.

Symptom diaries documented the infection’s duration and its side effects. Children not in the placebo study were able to participate in another study that documented the same outcomes (an ‘observational study’). We interviewed parents, doctors and nurses about their observations and concerns. Our patient and public involvement and engagement work with parents indicated that a 3-day symptom reduction was required to justify giving antibiotics. After seeing the doctor, parents whose children received antibiotics rated infective symptoms as moderately bad or worse for 5 days, and parents whose children received the placebo rated these for 6 days. Side effects and complications were similar in the two groups. Findings were similar when including the results of the observational study, and for children in whose chest the doctor could hear wheeze or rattles; who had fever; who were rated by the doctor as more unwell, who were short of breath, or who had had bacteria detected in the throat. The costs to the NHS per child were similar (antibiotics, £29; placebo, £26), and the wider costs to society were the same (antibiotics, £33; placebo, £33). Parents found it difficult to interpret their child’s symptoms, and commonly used the sound of the cough to judge severity.

There were no language restrictions when searching for studies. Randomized clinical trials of antibiotic treatment of LNB in adults and children that compared any antibiotic treatment, including combinations of treatments, versus any other treatment, placebo, or no treatment. We excluded studies of entities considered as post-Lyme syndrome. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We identified seven randomized studies involving 450 European participants with LNB for inclusion in this systematic review. We found no trials conducted in the United States. Marked heterogeneity among these studies prevented meta-analysis. None of the studies included a placebo control on the initial antibiotic treatment, and only one was blinded. None were delayed-start studies. All were active comparator studies, and most were not adequately powered for non-inferiority comparison. The trials investigated four antibiotics: penicillin G and ceftriaxone in four studies, doxycycline in three studies, and cefotaxime in two studies. One study tested a three-month course of oral amoxicillin versus placebo following initial treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone. One study was limited to children. The trials measured efficacy using heterogeneous physician- or patient-reported outcomes, or both. In some cases cerebrospinal fluid analysis was included as an indirect biomarker of disease and outcome. None of the studies reported on our proposed primary outcome, 'Improvement in a measure of overall disability in the long term (three or more months).' None of the trials revealed any between-group differences in symptom resolution in response to active treatment. In general, treatment was tolerated well. The quality of adverse event reporting, however, was low. There is mostly low- to very low-quality clinical evidence from a limited number of mostly small, heterogeneous trials with diverse outcome measures, comparing the relative efficacy of central nervous system-penetrant antibiotics for the treatment of LNB. The few existing randomized studies have limited power and lack consistent and well-defined entry criteria and efficacy endpoints. It is not possible to draw firm conclusions on the relative efficacy of accepted antibiotic drug regimens for the treatment of LNB. The majority of people are reported to have good outcomes, and symptoms resolve by 12 months regardless of the antibiotic used. A minority of participants did not improve sufficiently, and some were retreated. These randomized studies provide some evidence that doxycycline, penicillin G, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime are efficacious in the treatment of European LNB. No evidence of additional efficacy was observed when, in one study, an initial antibiotic treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone was followed by additional longer treatment with oral amoxicillin. There is a lack of evidence identified through our high-quality search strategy on the efficacy of antibiotics for treatment of LNB in the United States.

86,86,86,22046084,"With the rising prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, the treatment success of standard triple therapy has recently declined to unacceptable levels (i.e., 80% or less) in most countries. Therefore, several treatment regimens have emerged to cure Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. Novel first-line anti-H. pylori therapies in 2011 include sequential therapy, concomitant quadruple therapy, hybrid (dual-concomitant) therapy and bismuth-containing quadruple therapy. After the failure of standard triple therapy, a bismuth-containing quadruple therapy comprising a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), bismuth, tetracycline and metronidazole can be employed as rescue treatment. Recently, triple therapy combining a PPI, levofloxacin and amoxicillin has been proposed as an alternative to the standard rescue therapy. This salvage regimen can achieve a higher eradication rate than bismuth-containing quadruple therapy in some regions and has less adverse effects. The best second-line therapy for patients who fail to eradicate H. pylori with first-line therapies containing clarithromycin, amoxicillin and metronidazole is unclear. However, a levofloxacin-based triple therapy is an accepted rescue treatment. Most guidelines suggest that patients requiring third-line therapy should be referred to a medical center and treated according to the antibiotic susceptibility test. Nonetheless, an empirical therapy (such as levofloxacin-based or furazolidone-based therapies) can be employed to terminate H. pylori infection if antimicrobial sensitivity data are unavailable.

89,89,89,12765486,"The approaches to diagnosing and treating Lyme disease (LD) have been improved and refined as a result of basic and clinical research, and considerable practical experience. In addition, there have been recent studies that have allowed improvements in the ability to prevent infection with Borrelia burgdorferi. This paper will review the relevant literature and address recent developments in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of LD. Issues specifically related to the management of children will be identified. Controversies regarding treatment approaches will be examined in some detail. Understanding the clinical manifestations, or stage, of LD is crucial when approaching both diagnosis and treatment. Early localized disease is best diagnosed by recognizing the characteristic skin lesion, erythema migrans. Early disease will frequently, but not always, be accompanied by a detectable antibody response, particularly IgM antibody to the spirochete. Late disease, chiefly arthritis, is generally associated with high levels of IgG antibody. Western blot technology allows confirmation of enzyme immunoassay results and is especially useful when the latter is in the low or equivocal range. Early localized disease responds well to oral antibacterial therapy. Early disseminated disease, often associated with neurologic findings, may require parenteral therapy. The arthritis associated with LD frequently responds to oral antibacterials, but some refractory cases may require intravenous therapy, and occasionally surgery. Doxycycline is the oral antibacterial of choice, while amoxicillin and cefuroxime axetil are alternatives that may be preferred in young children. Owing to its long half-life and once daily dose administration, intravenous ceftriaxone has become the accepted standard for parenteral therapy. Tick avoidance has long been the mainstay for preventing LD. Antibacterial prophylaxis, using doxycycline, for tick bites has been shown to be an effective approach to prevention, but its relevance to pediatrics is uncertain. Vaccines designed to prevent infection have also been developed.

91,91,91,25300166,"Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is the third leading cause of death worldwide and the first leading cause of death in low-income countries. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common condition that causes a significant disease burden for the community, particularly in children younger than five years, the elderly and immunocompromised people. Antibiotics are the standard treatment for CAP. However, increasing antibiotic use is associated with the development of bacterial resistance and side effects for the patient. Several studies have been published regarding optimal antibiotic treatment for CAP but many of these data address treatments in hospitalised patients. This is an update of our 2009 Cochrane Review and addresses antibiotic therapies for CAP in outpatient settings. To compare the efficacy and safety of different antibiotic treatments for CAP in participants older than 12 years treated in outpatient settings with respect to clinical, radiological and bacteriological outcomes. We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March week 3, 2014), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2014), CINAHL (2009 to March 2014), Web of Science (2009 to March 2014) and LILACS (2009 to March 2014). We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), fully published in peer-reviewed journals, of antibiotics versus placebo as well as antibiotics versus another antibiotic for the treatment of CAP in outpatient settings in participants older than 12 years of age. However, we did not find any studies of antibiotics versus placebo. Therefore, this review includes RCTs of one or more antibiotics, which report the diagnostic criteria and describe the clinical outcomes considered for inclusion in this review. Two review authors (LMB, TJMV) independently assessed study reports in the first publication. In the 2009 update, LMB performed study selection, which was checked by TJMV and MMK. In this 2014 update, two review authors (SP, SM) independently performed and checked study selection. We contacted trial authors to resolve any ambiguities in the study reports. We compiled and analysed the data. We resolved differences between review authors by discussion and consensus. We included 11 RCTs in this review update (3352 participants older than 12 years with a diagnosis of CAP); 10 RCTs assessed nine antibiotic pairs (3321 participants) and one RCT assessed four antibiotics (31 participants) in people with CAP. The study quality was generally good, with some differences in the extent of the reporting. A variety of clinical, bacteriological and adverse events were reported. Overall, there was no significant difference in the efficacy of the various antibiotics. Studies evaluating clarithromycin and amoxicillin provided only descriptive data regarding the primary outcome. Though the majority of adverse events were similar between all antibiotics, nemonoxacin demonstrated higher gastrointestinal and nervous system adverse events when compared to levofloxacin, while cethromycin demonstrated significantly more nervous system side effects, especially dysgeusia, when compared to clarithromycin. Similarly, high-dose amoxicillin (1 g three times a day) was associated with higher incidence of gastritis and diarrhoea compared to clarithromycin, azithromycin and levofloxacin. Available evidence from recent RCTs is insufficient to make new evidence-based recommendations for the choice of antibiotic to be used for the treatment of CAP in outpatient settings. Pooling of study data was limited by the very low number of studies assessing the same antibiotic pairs. Individual study results do not reveal significant differences in efficacy between various antibiotics and antibiotic groups. However, two studies did find significantly more adverse events with use of cethromycin as compared to clarithromycin and nemonoxacin when compared to levofloxacin. Multi-drug comparisons using similar administration schedules are needed to provide the evidence necessary for practice recommendations. Further studies focusing on diagnosis, management, cost-effectiveness and misuse of antibiotics in CAP and LRTI are warranted in high-, middle- and low-income countries.

Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) is the main bacterial cause. A culture or a rapid antigen-detection test of a throat-swab specimen should only be done on the basis of clinical scores, in order to avoid over-diagnosis of bacterial origin and unnecessary antibiotic prescription. The objectives of treatment are: the reduction of symptoms, reduce the contagious period, and prevent local suppurative and systemic complications. Ideally, only confirmed cases should receive antibiotics. If there is no possibility to perform a rapid antigen-detection test, or in some cases if the result is negative, it is recommended to perform a culture and, if there is high suspicious index, to prescribe antibiotics. Penicillin is the treatment of choice, although amoxicillin is also accepted as the first option. Amoxicillin/clavulanate is not indicated in any case as empirical treatment.

Whereas this approach may be a desirable standard, challenges remain in low-income settings with limited capacity and resources for evidence synthesis and guideline development. We present our experience using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for the recent revision of the Kenyan pediatric clinical guidelines focusing on antibiotic treatment of pneumonia. A team of health professionals, many with minimal prior experience conducting systematic reviews, carried out evidence synthesis for structured clinical questions. Summaries were compiled and distributed to a panel of clinicians, academicians and policy-makers to generate recommendations based on best available research evidence and locally-relevant contextual factors. We reviewed six eligible articles on non-severe and 13 on severe/very severe pneumonia. Moderate quality evidence suggesting similar clinical outcomes comparing amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole for non-severe pneumonia received a strong recommendation against adopting amoxicillin. The panel voted strongly against amoxicillin for severe pneumonia over benzyl penicillin despite moderate quality evidence suggesting clinical equivalence between the two and additional factors favoring amoxicillin. Very low quality evidence suggesting ceftriaxone was as effective as the standard benzyl penicillin plus gentamicin for very severe pneumonia received a strong recommendation supporting the standard treatment. Although this exercise may have fallen short of the rigorous requirements recommended by the developers of GRADE, it was arguably an improvement on previous attempts at guideline development in low-income countries and offers valuable lessons for future similar exercises where resources and locally-generated evidence are scarce.

Only patients with ESBL and carbapenem-resistant GNB-isolated organisms (175 patients) were included. The susceptibility test of GNB was carried out according to the standard recommendations. The identified strains were tested in-vitro against several antimicrobial drugs. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 24. 36(20.6%) of samples were ESBL-producing GNB, whereas 139(79.4%) were carbapenem-resistant GNB. The pooled proportional estimates of ESBL-producing GNB Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and other GNB were 44.4%, 41.6%, and 14.0%, respectively; the pooled proportional estimates of carbapenem resistance GNB Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii complex/hemolyticus and other GNB were 82.8%, 10.8%, and 6.4%, respectively. All ESBL-producing GNB and carbapenem-resistance GNB were multidrug-resistant pathogens.

This study aimed to assess the association between compliance to H. pylori eradication therapy and adverse effects using various drug regimens. Method We conducted an observational study from September 2017 to February 2020 in two tertiary care hospitals in patients with dyspeptic symptoms. H. Pylori detection was done by histopathological examination of gastric mucosa during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy or stool for H. pylori antigen. Patients with positive results were randomly assigned one of the nine different regimens consisting of a combination of proton pump inhibitors along with at least two antibiotics. The antibiotics used in different combinations were amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, doxycycline, levofloxacin, and bismuth sulfate. The treatment groups received standard triple therapy with and without probiotics, sequential, concomitant, levofloxacin-based triple therapy, or sequential and bismuth-based quadruple treatments. All treatments were given for two weeks. At the end of the treatment period, patients were interviewed about completing treatment and any adverse effects they may have experienced during therapy. Data were analyzed using IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). Results A total of 250 patients were included in the study (62% males, 38% females) with a mean age of 37 years ± 13 years (range 12-84 years). Most patients completed the treatment regimen (80.4%), and 19.6% did not complete treatment because of adverse effects (p<0.005). The levofloxacin-based, concomitant, and standard triple regimen with probiotic treatments had the highest tolerance (≥85%). Common adverse effects were abdominal and epigastric pain (11%), alteration of taste, and diarrhea (6.5%). Conclusion H. pylori eradication therapy is always a challenge.

Eligible children with acute otitis media from 21 US centers were randomized to treatment with 10 mg/kg of azithromycin oral suspension on Day 1, followed by 5 mg/kg once daily for the next 4 days or approximately 40 mg/kg/day of amoxicillin/clavulanate suspension in 3 divided doses for 10 days. Clinical efficacy was evaluated on Days 14, 30 and 45. Acceptance and convenience of the medications were assessed on Day 14 by parent interviews with a standardized questionnaire. Of the 263 children enrolled in the study, 233 were evaluable at the primary evaluation 45 days after the start of treatment. Satisfactory clinical response rates (cure, delayed cure and improvement) were 60.5% in patients treated with azithromycin and 64.9% in patients treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate. Satisfactory clinical response rates at secondary evaluations were also comparable: 92.2% vs. 90.0% at Day 14 and 66.7% vs. 72.7% at Day 30 in patients treated with azithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate, respectively. No significant differences in treatment failures, relapses or recurrences were noted with either medication. Azithromycin was significantly better tolerated and caused fewer treatment-related adverse events (7.2%) than amoxicillin/clavulanate (17.1%) (P < 0.001). In response to the interview and questionnaire, parents of children treated with azithromycin noted less need for special arrangements to give medication (2.0% vs. 14.9%). Children liked the taste of azithromycin (89.2%) and did not have to be forced to take the medication (2.4%). Parents of children receiving amoxicillin/clavulanate noted that 61.8% liked the medication and 19.4% of children had to be forced to take it. This study demonstrates that azithromycin was comparable to amoxicillin/clavulanate in achieving satisfactory clinical response rates in children with acute otitis media attending day care or school.

Thus, we aimed to compare the reliability of three routine methods and to evaluate the impact of the ATU. 286 Escherichia coli strains (including 159 AMX-resistant strains) were categorized for the two EUCAST AMX/C breakpoints by disk diffusion (Bio-Rad), the Phoenix automated system (Becton Dickinson) and the Etest (AES) compared to the broth microdilution reference method. By microdilution, 84.2% of strains were AMX/C-susceptible using the urinary breakpoint (MIC ≤32 mg/L) and 62.2% using the systemic breakpoint (MIC ≤8 mg/L), with 63.6% of MICs between 4 and 16 mg/L. For the systemic breakpoint, category agreement (CA) and very major error (VME) were unacceptable for the Etest (71.7% and 27.3%), disk (73.1% and 23.4% at 19-mm cut-off) and to a lesser extent for the Phoenix system (83.6% and 10.5%). For disks, an unacceptable VME rate was observed for diameters up to 22 mm, probably due to overcharged disks. For the Etest, VMEs were high at 6 mg/L (46/63) and 8 mg/L (22/29). For the urinary breakpoint, CA was more acceptable for disk (88.9%) and Etest (84.3%) but was unevaluable for Phoenix. AMX/C susceptibility testing of E. coli for systemic breakpoint was unreliable with the three routine methods, explained mainly by the high prevalence (~60%) of strains with microdilution MICs around the breakpoint (8 mg/L).

During the study period, 18,501 successive AST were included. The risk for S. aureus to be resistant to any antibiotic upon repeated culture was <10% during a follow-up of 30 days. For Enterobacterales, this risk was approximately 10% during a follow-up of 7 days. For P. aeruginosa, this risk was higher. The longer the follow-up period, the higher the risk that the bacteria would show phenotypic resistance. We also found that some drug-bug combinations were more likely to develop phenotypical resistance (i.e., E. coli/amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and E. coli/cefuroxime). A potential consequence of our finding is that if we regard a risk of resistance below 10% as acceptable, it may be feasible to omit follow-up AST within 7 days for the microorganisms investigated in this study. This approach saves money, time, and will reduce laboratory waste. Further studies are needed to determine whether these savings are in balance with the small possibility of treating patients with inadequate antibiotics.

Data from 7 randomized, single-blind, cross-over trials were pooled and analyzed. In each study, children aged 4 to 8 years were asked to taste and smell 2 different antibiotic suspensions and assign preference using a visual smile-face scale. Ratings were converted to a numeric score ranging from 5 (really good) to 1 (really bad). A total of 1011 healthy subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment-order groups; 965 were evaluable for the taste and smell analyses. Baseline demographics of evaluable subjects were similar among test groups. Approximately even proportions of participants were female or male (50.1 % vs 49.9%), most (84.1%) were white, and slightly more participants were aged 7 or 8 years rather than younger (age 4 years, 16.0%; age 5 years, 17.4%; age 6 years, 18.7%; age 7 years, 23.2%; age 8 years, 24.8%). Of the 965 children who tasted both antibiotic suspensions and determined their preference, 798 (82.7%) rated the taste of cefdinir as really good or good (the highest possible ratings); 712 (73.8%) assigned the same ratings to amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium, cefprozil, azithromycin, or generic amoxicillin (P < or = 0.001). With regard to smell, 671 (69.5%) rated the smell of cefdinir as really good or good; 636 (65.9%) assigned these same ratings to the comparator agents (P = NS).

The aim of this study was to investigate Helicobacter pylori eradication rate using a short regimen (7 and 10 days) of triple therapy with clarithromycin, amoxicillin and omeprazole. Twenty-five Hp positive patients who presented severe epigastralgia, were submitted to antimicrobial treatment with amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/day--maximum dose 1 g bid), clarithromycin (30 mg/kg/day--maximum dose 500 mg bid) and omeprazole (0.6 mg/kg/day--maximum dose 20 mg bid) during 7 or 10 days. After 2 months, clinical symptoms were evaluated and gastric biopsies were taken to test Hp eradication. Overall eradication rate was achieved in 16/25 patients (64%--IC(95% = 45-83%), in 11/15 (73%--IC(95%) = 51-95%) patients who used 10 days therapy course and in 5/10 (50%--IC(95%) = 19-81%) who used 7 days therapy course.

106,106,106,9076838,"Respiratory infections in children may occur as a consequence of resistant bacterial pathogens. Streptococcus pneumoniae organisms resistant to penicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and macrolides are increasingly prevalent. Amoxicillin- and macrolide-resistant Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis are also more commonly seen. Traditional agents such as amoxicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole remain acceptable choices for most children with respiratory infections because currently most patients are not infected by resistant pathogens and there is a high spontaneous cure rate associated with these infections. To analyze the criteria for the selection of extended spectrum antimicrobials as empiric therapy for respiratory infections. When an extended spectrum antimicrobial is appropriate for empiric therapy, selection should be based on: (1) efficacy; (2) adverse event profile; and (3) compliance-enhancing features (dosing with meals, once or twice daily administration, good palatability in suspension, shortened course of therapy and affordability). A new agent, ceftibuten, has recently joined other extended spectrum cephalosporins and newer macrolides (clarithromycin and azithromycin) as a choice to be considered for empiric therapy for respiratory infections. These antimicrobials are differentiated from each other and traditional agents by differences in activity in vitro against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, relative beta-lactamase stability against Gram-negative bacteria and pharmacodynamic properties. When resistant organisms are isolated or suspected in community-acquired respiratory infections, cautious use of newer antibiotics may have to be considered.

In a randomised, open-label, equivalence trial at five sites in DR Congo, Kenya, and Nigeria, community health workers followed up all births in the community, identified unwell young infants, and referred them to study nurses. We randomly assigned infants with fast breathing as a single sign of illness or possible serious bacterial infection, whose parents did not accept referral to hospital, to receive either injectable procaine benzylpenicillin-gentamicin once per day or oral amoxicillin treatment twice per day for 7 days. A person who was off-site generated randomisation lists using computer software. Trained health professionals gave injections, but outcome assessors were masked to group allocations. The primary outcome was treatment failure by day 8 after enrolment, defined as clinical deterioration, development of a serious adverse event including death, persistence of fast breathing on day 4, or recurrence up to day 8.

Today, the keratinase enzymes of some Bacillus strains are used to degrade and process raw keratin waste for animal and poultry feed. According to various studies, the probiotic properties of some spore-shaped Bacillus have also been proven. The study aimed to isolation of the keratinolytic Bacillus bacteria that they have probiotic properties for using in the livestock and poultry feed industry. We were able to isolate 8 strains of Bacillus licheniformis with kreatin degrading properties from the soil of Baharan chicken slaughterhouse (Qom city, Iran) applying heat shock, alcohol- and keratin-rich culture medium, and after microscopic and biochemical analysis, 16S rDNA gene was isolated. The measurement results of keratinase activity showed that the three strains of Bacillus licheniformis pvkr6, pvkr 15, and pvkr41 had the highest activity with 124.08, 101.1, and 100.18 U/ml. The results of probiotic properties evaluation also revealed that among all the isolates, only Bacillus licheniformis pvkr15 and Bacillus licheniformis PTCC 1595 (positive control) were γ-hemolytic strains. The percentage of surface hydrophobicity of the strains was obtained from 3.27 to 30.57. It was also shown that, on average, all the strains had acceptable susceptibility to the tested antibiotics except penicillin G. Bacillus licheniformis pvkr15 with highest keratinase activity (101.1U/ml) was considered an optional probiotics due to its abilities such as (biofilm formation, being safe cause of γ-hemolytic activity, high susceptibility to antibiotics such as streptomycin, gentamicin, cefixime, amoxicillin, tetracycline, vancomycin, erythromycin and having a moderate hydrophilic (hydrophobicity: 19.09%), high survivability in pH 2, 2.5 and 3, strong resistance to bile salts and moderate antagonistic activity against pathogenic bacterium like Proteus mirabilis and the ability to grow under anaerobic conditions). By using this strain, after hydrolysis of keratin protein in the feather structure, to replace part of the protein of livestock and poultry feed, not only is no need to separate bacteria from the feed, but also the strain play role of an useful and effective additive in animal growth.

There is variation in practice in timing of switch to oral antibiotics after commencement of empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy. To establish the clinical and cost effectiveness of early switch to oral antibiotics in patients with neutropenic sepsis at low risk of infective complications.

Treatment failure, a composite measure assessed at day 14 based on the following criteria: fever persistence or recurrence within 72 hours of starting intravenous antibiotics; escalation from protocolised antibiotics; critical care support or death. The study was closed early due to under-recruitment with 129 patients recruited; hence, a definitive conclusion regarding non-inferiority cannot be made. Sixty-five patients were randomised to the early switch arm and 64 to the standard care arm with subsequent intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses including 125 (intervention  Non-inferiority for early oral switch could not be proven due to trial under-recruitment. The findings suggest this may be an acceptable treatment strategy for some patients who can adhere to such a treatment regimen and would prefer a potentially reduced duration of hospitalisation while accepting increased risk of treatment failure resulting in re-admission. Further research should explore tools for patient stratification for low-risk de-escalation or ambulatory pathways including use of biomarkers and/or point-of-care rapid microbiological testing as an adjunct to clinical decision-making tools. This could include application to shorter-duration antimicrobial therapy in line with other antimicrobial stewardship studies. This trial is registered as ISRCTN84288963.

Usually patients receive treatment with intravenous antibiotics (antibiotics delivered into a vein) for two or more days. Patients at low risk of complications from their infection may be able to have a shorter period of intravenous antibiotics benefitting both patients and the NHS. The trial compared whether changing from intravenous to oral antibiotics (antibiotics taken by mouth as tablets or liquid) 12–24 hours after starting antibiotic treatment (‘early switch’) is as effective as usual care. Patients could take part if they had started intravenous antibiotics for low-risk neutropenic sepsis. Patients were randomly allocated to ‘early switch’ or to usual care. The main outcome measured was treatment failure. Treatment failure happened if fever persisted or recurred despite antibiotics, if patients needed to change antibiotics, if they needed to be re-admitted to hospital or needed to be admitted to intensive care within 14 days or died. We had originally intended that 628 patients would take part, but after review of the design of the study the number needed to take part was revised to 230. We were not able to complete the trial as planned as unfortunately only 129 patients took part. As the trial was smaller than expected we were not able to draw conclusions as to whether ‘early switch’ is no less effective than usual care. Our findings suggest that ‘early switch’ might result in a shorter time in hospital initially; however, treatment failure was more likely to occur, meaning some patients had to return to hospital for further antibiotics. There were no differences in side effects and no serious complications from treatment or treatment failure (such as intensive care admission or death) among the 65 patients in the ‘early switch’ group. Patients were satisfied with ‘early switch’. Early switch may be a treatment option for some patients with low-risk neutropenic sepsis who would prefer a shorter duration of hospital admission but accept a risk of needing hospital re-admission.

To assess whether adequate exposure may also be achieved with oral antibiotics, we investigated exposure to oral antibiotics and PTA during the acute phase of infection and after defervescence. We enrolled hospitalized, non-critically ill febrile patients treated with IV antibiotics other than amoxicillin or ciprofloxacin. The study consisted of two visits: when patients had received <24 h IV treatment; and when patients had become afebrile. On both visits, patients received one additional dose of 750 mg amoxicillin, or 500 mg ciprofloxacin, depending on the presumed infection, after which serial blood samples were obtained. The primary endpoint was the ratio of the AUC during the febrile and the afebrile phase. The AUCs were considered to be equivalent when the ratio of the mean AUCs and its 90% CI was contained within the acceptance interval of 80%-125%. The secondary endpoint was PTA. Forty-four patients (15 amoxicillin, 29 ciprofloxacin) completed both study visits. The median time between the two study visits was 65.8 h (range 33.8-427.4). The ratio of the mean AUCs (study visit 1/study visit 2) was 97% (90% CI of 80%-117%) for amoxicillin and 112% (90% CI of 108%-116%) for ciprofloxacin. The PTA for amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin did not differ between the two phases and was adequate to treat common pathogens. The acute phase of infection in non-critically ill febrile patients does not influence the exposure to, or PTA of, orally administered amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin.

121,121,121,12416778,"The purpose of this review is to provide the clinician with some practical rationale for the selection and use of antibiotics in the treatment of destructive periodontal diseases. We have attempted to integrate approximately 20 years of periodontal literature describing antibiotic therapy with personal experience and 21st century ideas. This article addresses antibiotic use during treatment of aggressive periodontitis with emphasis on juvenile disease and adult refractory diseases. The literature review revealed few large, controlled studies that compared efficacy of adjunctive antibiotic use to mechanical therapy alone. Even fewer studies evaluated the efficacy of one antibiotic relative to another. However, based on the evidence available, certain conclusions were drawn. Adjunctive use of an antibiotic along with mechanical debridement is recommended for the treatment of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis as an acceptable therapeutic regimen. Due to the emergence of tetracycline-resistant A. actinomycetemcomitans, the combination of metronidazole and amoxicillin may be preferable. In aggressive refractory periodontitis, compelling evidence exists that the use of an appropriate adjunctive antibiotic frequently gives a more favorable clinical response than mechanical therapy alone. Unfortunately, the selection of antibiotic is not as clear and is probably case-dependent. Positive responses have been reported with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clindamycin, metronidazole, and the combination therapy metronidazole plus amoxicillin. The introduction of local delivery antibiotics specifically for the treatment of periodontitis offers a novel concept for the treatment of localized disease. The latter, in particular, may prove useful in the treatment of recurrent disease activity or where only a few individual sites are involved.

Despite several reports in the literature describing the optimal duration of antibiotics, there is no consensus. A ""one for all"" protocol may be impractical and hence the guidelines need to be tweaked to take into consideration local factors. We designed a protocol for prophylactic antibiotics in clean-contaminated head and neck cancer squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) surgeries to prevent unchecked abuse and evaluated its feasibility. Two hundred consecutive patients who underwent a clean-contaminated surgery for HNSCC between January 2017 and December 2019 were included. Single-dose intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate at induction followed by three doses of amoxicillin-clavulanate, metronidazole, and amikacin in the postoperative period was used. Adherence to the antibiotic protocol was assessed from a prospectively maintained database. The mean age was 55.99 ± 11.71 years. The protocol was effective in 70% of the patients with an acceptable surgical site infection (SSI) rate of 12%. Flap-related complications (9.5%) and oro-cutaneous fistula (5%) were common causes of prolonged antibiotics. On univariate analysis, blood transfusion (P = .014), clinical stage at presentation (P = .028), patients undergoing reconstruction (P = .001), longer operative time (P = .009), and pathological T stage (P = 0.03) were at higher chance of deviating from the protocol. On multivariate analysis, age more than 50 years (OR: 2.14, 95% CI: (1.01, 4.52); P value = 0.047) and reconstruction (OR: 3.36, 95% CI: (1.21, 9.32); P value = 0.020) were found to be significant. A three-dose perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in clean-contaminated HNSCC surgeries is feasible. Similar protocols should be developed and validated at other major centers to limit the unnecessary use of antibiotics and prevent the emergence of antibiotic resistance.

The PK/PD parameters described in this paper focus only on blood compartment and S. aureus, (main bacteria implicated in bone and joint tissue infections). All beta-lactamase resistant beta-lactam compounds given by IV route, if they are prescribed at the good dosage and frequency, fulfill these PK/PD parameters. In contrast, by oral route, M penicillins and cefuroxime-axetil should not be considered as acceptable regimens.

129,129,129,36027632,"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) seen in the emergency department are commonly treated as an outpatient with oral antibiotics. Given that antibiotics are available for over-the-counter purchase in Mexico, there is speculation that potential misuse and overuse of antibiotics in United States-Mexico border areas could lead to antibiotic resistance patterns that would render some empiric treatments for UTIs less effective. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guideline-recommended antibiotics for treatment of outpatient UTI diagnosed in the emergency department. Data were collected from a county hospital on the U.S.-Mexico border with a metropolitan area of over 2 million people. Secondary analysis included frequency of urine culture isolated, resistance rates of urine pathogens, and prescriber habits. This study was a retrospective chart review of adult patients diagnosed and treated for UTI from August 1, 2019, to February 29, 2020. Culture results of included patients were analyzed against in vitro-tested antibiotics. Bacterial isolate frequency, resistance rates, and prescribing habits were collected. A total of 985 patient charts were reviewed, of which 520 patients met inclusion criteria for analysis of prescribing habits. Of these, 329 positive bacterial culture growths were included in the analysis of antibiotic resistance rates. Oral antibiotics with comparatively lower resistance rates were amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefdinir, cefuroxime, and nitrofurantoin. Oral antibiotics with notably high resistance rates included trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and cephalexin. Nitrofurantoin was prescribed most frequently for outpatient treatment of UTI/cystitis (41.6%) while cephalexin was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic for outpatient treatment of pyelonephritis (50%). Our findings suggest that, while part of standard IDSA guidelines, fluoroquinolones and TMP-SMX are not ideal empiric antibiotics for treatment of outpatient UTI in the U.S.-Mexico border region studied due to high resistance rates. Although not listed as first line agents per current IDSA recommendations, 2nd and 3rd generation cephalosporins, and amoxicillin/clavulanate would be acceptable options given resistance patterns demonstrated in accordance with IDSA allowance for tailoring selection to local resistance. Nitrofurantoin appears to be consistent with recommendations and demonstrates a favorable resistance profile for treatment of outpatient UTI within this region.

As clarithromycin is a key antibiotic in the eradication of H. pylori, the election of the rescue treatment is a matter of debate. The aim of this study is to systematically review the efficacy of the second-line rescue therapies after the failure of a first-line clarithromycin-containing regimen, and to link this information with the previous first-line treatment. Also, authors performed meta-analyses and inverse variance analyses with studies that met the inclusion criteria: first-line treatment must specify type and dosage; diagnosis and eradication confirmation must be performed by generally accepted tests; and second-line treatment must not be assigned depending on the antibiotic susceptibility or resistance. In a routine clinical practice setting, the most adequate second-line treatment consists in a 10-day regimen of levofloxacin- amoxicillin-PPI given twice daily, unless regional or new data show high quinolone resistance.

Results are presented for amoxicillin packages from Haiti, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Democratic Republic of Congo, India, Papua New Guinea, and Ethiopia collected over the course of 6 months in 2017, including two field trips with the FT-IR to Ghana and Sierra Leone. Canadian samples were used as a control. Regarding drug quality, of 290 individual capsules of amoxicillin analyzed, 13 were found to be substandard with total active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) lying outside the acceptable range of 90-110%. Of these 13, four were below 80% API. The FT-IR reliably identified these outliers and was found to yield results in good agreement with the established pharmacopeia liquid chromatography protocol. We conclude that the portable FT-IR may be suitable to intercept substandard antibiotics in developing countries where more sophisticated techniques are not readily available.

It is now recognized that H pylori is a chronic infection of the stomach causing inflammation. Some patients remain asymptomatic, while others may develop dyspepsia, duodenal or gastric ulcer, gastric cancer or a mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. However, the role of H pylori in contributing to nonulcer dyspepsia or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug gastropathy remains controversial. An effective vaccine against H pylori is years away. Major interest has focused on the questions ""who should be investigated and therefore treated"" and ""what is the latest gold standard for eradication of H pylori""? In Europe, guidelines have been developed to help the practitioner answer these important questions. Canadian guidelines will soon be available. For persons with known peptic ulcer disease there should be unequivocal acceptance that the good clinical practice of eradicating H pylori will result in substantial savings in health care expenses. The original 'classical triple therapy' (bismuth, metronidazole and tetracycline [BMT]) has now been surpassed by the combination of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) plus two antibiotics (metronidazole plus clarithromycin; amoxicillin plus clarithromycin; or amoxicillin plus metronidazole), each given twice a day for one week. In Canada, the regimen of omeprazole plus one antibiotic (amoxicillin or clarithromycin) was approved recently but gives an eradication rate that is lower than the current target of 90%.

A segmented regression on monthly cefazolin use was conducted during the baseline (January 1 to November 30, 2018) and intervention (February 1 to December 31, 2019) periods to evaluate the impact of ACCEPT on the monthly use of perioperative cefazolin in patients with reported beta-lactam allergy undergoing cesarean delivery. The frequency of perioperative allergic reactions and surgical site infections was collected during both periods. Of the 3128 eligible women who underwent a cesarean delivery, 282 (9%) reported a beta-lactam allergy. The most common beta-lactam allergens were penicillin (64.3%), amoxicillin (16.0%), and cefaclor (6.0%). The most frequently reported allergic reactions were rash (38.1%), hives (21.4%), and unknown (11.6%). Use of cefazolin increased from 52% (baseline) to 87% during the intervention period.

Repeated episodes, especially when caused by Haemophilus influenzae (the major pathogen) may be associated with more rapid deterioration in respiratory function. Criteria to identify patients with more severe disease and those who require either hospitalization or intensive care have been developed and can improve mortality. Antibiotic therapy has an accepted place in management, and predictors of the outcome of exacerbations have now been developed that allow severity staging of individual episodes. Nevertheless, despite the recognition of excessive failure rates due to increasing bacterial resistance and poor respiratory kinetics, many patients continue to receive empiric therapy with amoxicillin and other oral beta-lactams. Less empiric management guidelines, produced in Europe and North America and based on such criteria, now provide a framework for rational prescribing. Perhaps more importantly, it is now possible to design and perform placebo- and comparator-controlled studies of new antibacterials, such as the fluoroquinolones and azalides, with improved potency and kinetic properties. This will enable both an assessment of their place in the management of exacerbations in at-risk patients with severe disease and an evaluation of their longer-term role in the prevention of a decline in respiratory function consequent upon repeated and ineffectively treated exacerbations.

Some authors recommend to perform a microbiological investigation in suspected bacterial cases in order to treat the confirmed cases with antibiotics so to prevent suppurative complications and acute rheumatic fever. Differently, other authors consider pharyngitis, even streptococcal one, a benign, self-limiting disease. Consequently they wouldn't routinely perform microbiological tests and, pointing to a judicious use of antibiotics, they would reserve antimicrobial treatment to well-selected cases. It has been calculated that the number of patients needed to treat to prevent one complication after upper respiratory tract infections (including sore throat), was over 4000. Even the use of the Centor score, in order to evaluate the risk of streptococcal infection, is under debate and the interpretation of the test results may vary considerably.

A period of refrigerated storage of filled devices, followed by the CI period, is useful for OPAT services but can present a significant challenge to the stability of drugs. The aims of this study were to review fresh-filled stability data on antimicrobials which would be useful for OPAT services and to identify suitable candidates for further assessment. Searches identified papers relating to stability assessments of antimicrobials for immediate use tested above 31°C using a stability-indicating method. We identified 18 stability studies published in 12 papers between 2015 and 2020, assessing the stability of 10 agents. Aminopenicillins like ampicillin and amoxicillin appear too unstable for CI, while benzylpenicillin may benefit from buffering to improve its stability. Cephalosporins vary in their stability and CI periods of 24 hours may not be achievable. Of the carbapenems, there are insufficient data for doripenem but meropenem has been extensively studied and is unsuitable for CI longer than 6 hours. Voriconazole may be suitable for CI but needs further investigation. Some drugs identified in our review are unlikely to be suitable for continuous infusion in OPAT services due to instability. Using a 'fresh-fill' approach, without refrigerated storage, may make some drugs useful while other agents should be considered for further assessment to Yellow Cover Document standards.

144,144,144,14632104,"Bacterial skin and skin structure infections commonly encountered in children include impetigo, folliculitis, furunculosis, carbuncles, wound infections, abscesses, cellulitis, erysipelas, scarlet fever, acute paronychia, and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. If diagnosed early and treated appropriately, these infections are almost always curable, but some have the potential to cause serious complications such as septicemia, nephritis, carditis and arthritis if diagnosis is delayed and/or treatment is inadequate. During the initial evaluation, it is important to determine whether the infection is superficial or deep, and whether it is localized or spreading. Prompt treatment is essential if the infection appears to be spreading, as the sequelae can be life threatening. Once the proper diagnosis is made, the next important step is selecting the most appropriate therapy. In children presenting with mild or moderately severe bacterial skin and skin structure infections and not requiring inpatient management or urgent operative débridement, prompt provision of oral antimicrobial therapy avoids the risk of worsening infection or hospitalization. Empiric antimicrobial therapy should be directed at the most likely pathogens, (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes), although some infections (e.g. subcutaneous abscesses and cellulitis following animal or human bites) may have a polymicrobial origin. In choosing the appropriate antimicrobial therapy, one must take into account the resistance profile of the target pathogen, the agent's antibacterial profile and intrinsic activity against the target pathogen, and its pharmacokinetic properties (including absorption, elimination, and extent of tissue penetration). Other factors to consider include tolerability of the drug, convenience of the dosing regimen, and acceptability and palatability of the oral formulation administered. Any treatment plan for bacterial skin and skin structure infections should aim to minimize the emergence of resistant organisms so that the risk of their dissemination to others in the community is reduced. Oral antimicrobial agents currently available that may be considered include: beta-lactamase-stable penicillins (e.g. cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium), the macrolides (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin), and the cephalosporins. Cephalosporins are now the most commonly used class, particularly because of increasing resistance among strains of S. pyogenes to erythromycin (and by implication, the other macrolides). The second- and third-generation cephalosporins have many advantages, with their extended spectra of antimicrobial activity, favorable pharmacokinetic and tolerability profiles, and convenient dosage schedules. The third-generation agent, cefdinir, has good activity against a broad range of likely pathogens, including staphylococci, a twice-daily administration schedule, a favorable efficacy and tolerability profile, is well accepted by young children when administered as an oral suspension, and may be an attractive alternative in the pediatric setting.

The individual drugs and the most important eradication regimens are discussed with special regard to their risks. In the past, highly complex multidrug regimens, fear of adverse effects and frequent eradication failures have hampered the broad acceptance of H. pylori-eradication therapies. Recently, new 1-week, low-dose combination regimens of 2 antibacterials with a proton pump inhibitor have consistently achieved eradication rates of 90% and more with an acceptably low rate of adverse effects. One week's standard triple therapy [tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate (or bismuth salicylate plus metronidazole plus tetracycline or amoxicillin) has been shown to be highly effective and tolerated better in combination with a proton pump inhibitor. This regimen is, however, more complex and has more adverse effects. Therefore, it is not recommended as first-line therapy.

148,148,148,22017749,"BACKGROUND  A decrease in the Helicobacter pylori eradication rate after standard triple therapy has been suggested in recent years. AIM  To assess the efficacy of standard triple therapy in the eradication of H. pylori through an epidemiological analysis of all published Spanish trials. A secondary aim was to review the prevalence of clarithromycin resistance in Spain. METHODS  Articles on H. pylori eradication in Spain published in peer-reviewed journals were identified through MEDLINE searches. Studies that included a triple therapy consisting of any proton pump inhibitor with clarithromycin (500 mg b.d.) and amoxicillin (1 g b.d.) for up to 14 days were selected. Spanish studies evaluating the prevalence of clarithromycin resistance were also reviewed. Meta-analysis was performed using the generic inverse variance method. RESULTS The pooled eradication rates by year from Spanish studies evaluating the efficacy of the standard triple regimen revealed a relatively constant rate over the years. Overall, the analysis of the 32 studies (4727 patients) showed a mean H. pylori cure rate of 80% (95% CI = 77-82%) by intention-to-treat and 83% (81-86%) by per-protocol. When only peptic ulcer disease or 7-day regimens were considered, results were similar. Based on 13 studies (3293 patients), mean clarithromycin resistance rate was 8% (5-10%). CONCLUSION Although a decrease in the H. pylori eradication rate after triple therapy has been suggested in recent years, cure rates with this regimen did not change in Spain between 1997 and 2008. However, this by no means indicates that the efficacy of standard triple therapy in Spain is acceptable, as it has been calculated to be around only 80%.

An institution-based cross-sectional study was employed, through interviews and prescription reviews, among 346 patients at the outpatient pharmacy, from 2nd to 20th of May 2016. Data on sociodemographic profile of patients and medicines prescribed to them were collected. A mean of 1.72 medicines per encounter was prescribed, over a third of the total being anti-infectives. Patients were able to get about 85% of these medicines. An unskilled government employee would be required to work more than one and a half day to be able to afford the average priced medicine. Among prescriptions with two or more medicines, more than a third had at least one potential drug-drug interaction (PDDI), the commonest pair containing amoxicillin and doxycycline. Being male, being older (50-59 years), and increased number of medicines were associated with higher likelihood of PDDIs. In conclusion, the number of medicines prescribed per encounter was up to accepted standard. However, their availability fell short, together with considerable cost.

153,153,153,31529855,"Introduction: The main cause for Helicobacter pylori infection treatment failure is antibiotic resistance, where clarithromycin and metronidazole play the main role. In Colombia, primary resistance as a consequence of the use of these two antibiotics and excessive levofloxacin use is above the accepted limit (13.6%, 83%, and 16%, respectively). Despite this fact, empirical therapies that include the combination of these antibiotics are used in patients with previous therapeutic failure. Objective: To determine antibiotic resistance in patients previously treated for H. pylori in Bogotá, Colombia. Materials and methods: We conducted a descriptive study that included ten isolates obtained from five patients with three or four previous failed treatments for H. pylori. Antibiotic resistance to amoxicillin, clarithromycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole was investigated by agar dilution and confirmed by DNA sequencing (Magrogen, Korea). Results: Eight isolates were resistant to two or more antibiotics. All isolates were resistant to levofloxacin. Susceptibility patterns in isolates from the gastric antrum and the body of the stomach were different in three patients. Conclusion: As far as we know, this is the first evidence of multiple H. pylori resistance in Colombia in previously treated patients. Results demonstrated the consequences of using an ineffective antibiotic scheme and the need to assess antibiotic susceptibility in different anatomical sites of the stomach. The consequences of multiple resistance decrease possible antibiotic effectiveness to eradicate H. pylori in the future. Introducción. La resistencia a los antibióticos es la principal causa del fracaso del tratamiento contra Helicobacter pylori; la claritromicina y el metronidazol son los antibióticos que generan mayor resistencia. En Colombia, la resistencia primaria a estos dos antibióticos y el uso excesivo de levofloxacina han alcanzado los límites aceptados (13,6, 83 y 16 %, respectivamente). A pesar de ello, se usa el tratamiento empírico combinando estos antibióticos en pacientes en los que ha fallado anteriormente. Objetivo. Determinar la resistencia a los antibióticos en pacientes previamente tratados para H. pylori en Bogotá, Colombia. Materiales y métodos. Se llevó a cabo un estudio descriptivo en el que se evaluó mediante dilución en agar la resistencia a la amoxicilina, la claritromicina, la levofloxacina y el metronidazol en 10 aislamientos provenientes de 5 pacientes con tres o cuatro tratamientos fallidos para H. pylori. La resistencia a los antibióticos se confirmó mediante secuenciación de ADN (Magrogen, Korea). Resultados. Ocho de los aislamientos presentaron resistencia a dos o más antibióticos y todos fueron resistentes a la levofloxacina. Los patrones de sensibilidad de los aislamientos provenientes del antro pilórico y del cuerpo del estómago, fueron diferentes en tres de los pacientes. Conclusión. Hasta donde se sabe, esta es la primera evidencia de resistencia múltiple de H. pylori en Colombia en pacientes previamente tratados. Los resultados evidenciaron las consecuencias del uso de un esquema ineficaz de tratamiento antibiótico y la necesidad de evaluar la sensibilidad a los antibióticos en diferentes sitios anatómicos del estómago.

We present clinical outcomes and adverse effects of a cohort of children with XDR-TB or pre-XDR-TB treated with Group 5 drugs in Tajikistan. We conducted a retrospective analysis of eight children treated with one or more of the Group 5 drugs available under the Tajikistan National TB Programme-linezolid, amoxicillin-clavulanate, clofazimine and clarithromycin-given in combination with first- and second-line drugs. Time to sputum culture conversion, clinical outcomes and adverse effects were evaluated. Two children were cured, one completed treatment, four achieved favourable interim outcomes and one died. Adverse effects attributable to linezolid that required drug cessation occurred in one child; adverse effects of the other Group 5 drugs were insignificant or absent, requiring no regimen changes. Group 5 drugs can contribute to effective regimens in children with XDR and pre-XDR-TB.

Based on these findings, we decided to compare the efficacy of 10- and 14-day hybrid regimens for H. pylori eradication. Two hundred and seventy patients with peptic ulcer disease and H. pylori infection were enrolled in the study. One hundred and thirty-four patients received 10-day hybrid regimen (PACT-10): pantoprazole, 40 mg, and amoxicillin, 1 g, both twice daily for 10 days; plus clarithromycin, 500 mg, and tinidazole, 500 mg, both twice daily just during the last 5 days.

The influence of susceptibility and host CYP2C19 polymorphisms on the efficacy was also evaluated. Eligible patients were randomly to receive esomeprazole and colloidal bismuth pectin along with clarithromycin and amoxicillin (EBCA), esomeprazole and colloidal bismuth pectin along with levofloxacin and amoxicillin (EBLA), or esomeprazole along levofloxacin and amoxicillin (ELA) for 1 week. The primary outcome was the eradication rate in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses. Overall, 270 patients were randomized. The eradication rates in the above 3 groups were 80.25%, 89.66%, and 81.93% in PP analysis and 72.22%, 86.66%, and 75.56% in ITT analysis, respectively. The eradication rate of EBLA was significantly higher than that of EBCA (P = 0.016) in ITT analysis. No significant differences were found among these groups in terms of adverse effects and compliance. The efficacy was significantly affected by levofloxacin resistance for EBLA (P = 0.01) and ELA (P = 0.04), but not by polymorphisms of CYP2C19 gene for any of the 3 groups.

157,157,157,32957336,"Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection causes many diseases, such as peptic ulcers, gastritis and gastric cancer, and MALToma. It has been gradually accepted that all HP-infected patients should be treated because HP is regarded as an infection. Therefore, the importance of selecting the optimal treatment regimen has increased. Although the 14-day standard triple therapy (STT) is recommended in the current guidelines, prolonging treatment duration is controversial in real practice because of inconsistent results from previous data and the risk of adverse effects. Additionally, the effect of STT using ilaprazole has not been reported until now. We aimed to compare the eradication rate between 7 and 10 days STT using ilaprazole. A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted, which was divided into 2 treatment groups: the control group was 7 days of STT, and the test group was 10 days of STT. The eradication regimen was 10 mg ilaprazole, 500 mg clarithromycin, and 1000 mg amoxicillin twice daily. We included patients who were diagnosed with positive results of H pylori examination. We compared the HP eradication rate according to treatment duration, CYP2C19 subtype and endoscopic diagnosis. We enrolled a total of 254 patients consisting of 127 patients in each treatment arm. The eradication rates of the control and test groups were 65.4% (82/127) and 74.8% (95/127), respectively, in the intention-to-treat analysis (P = .1). In the per-protocol analysis, 70.3% (83/118) and 82.6% (94/115) were eradicated in each group, which was statistically significant (P = .027). The CYP2C19 subtype was examined in 230 patients. The eradication rate was 79.2% (57/72), 75.4% (92/122), and 72.2% (26/36) in each group, which was not significantly different (P = .704).

In this review, we critically examine its safety profile in comparison with other fluoroquinolones and other antibacterial classes sharing similar indications. Data were extracted from published clinical trials, meta-analyses, postmarketing studies, spontaneous report systems and case reports for rare effects. Global analysis did not reveal significantly higher incidences of drug-related adverse effects than for comparators. Tendon rupture was infrequent with moxifloxacin, including when used in elderly patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Severe toxic cutaneous reactions and allergies were very rare. Phototoxicity and CNS adverse effects were less common than with other fluoroquinolones. Although causing a 4-7 msec corrected QT interval prolongation, severe cardiac toxicity was neither seen in large cohorts or clinical trials nor reported to pharmacovigilance systems. Hepatotoxicity was not different from what was observed for other fluoroquinolones (excluding trovafloxacin) and less frequent than reported for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid or telithromycin. The data show that using moxifloxacin, in its accepted indications and following the corresponding guidelines, should not be associated with an excessive incidence of drug-related adverse reactions, provided the clinician takes care in identifying patients with known risk factors and pays due attention to the contraindications and warnings mentioned in the labelling.

This recommendation was based on trial data from limited contexts whose generalisability is unclear. This review aimed to identify which children with chest-indrawing pneumonia in low- and middle-income countries can be safely treated at home, and under what conditions is it safe to do so. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed for observational and interventional studies of home-based management of children (aged 28 days to four years) with chest-indrawing pneumonia in low- or middle-income countries. We included 14 studies, including seven randomised trials, from a variety of urban and rural contexts in 11 countries. Two community-based and two hospital-based trials in Pakistan and India found that home treatment of chest-indrawing pneumonia was associated with similar or superior treatment outcomes to hospital admission. Evidence from trials (n = 3) and observational (n = 6) studies in these and other countries confirms the acceptability and feasibility of home management of chest-indrawing pneumonia in low-risk cases, so long as safeguards are in place. Risk assessment includes clinical danger signs, oxygen saturation, and the presence of comorbidities such as undernutrition, anaemia, or HIV. Pulse oximetry is a critical risk-assessment tool that is currently not widely available and can identify severely ill patients with hypoxaemia otherwise possibly missed by clinical assessment alone. Additional safeguards include caregiver understanding and ability to return for review.

The results of both surveys were evaluated statistically and compared with each other. While in 2017 a total of 238 questionaries were evaluated, 160 could be included in 2020. The three most commonly used antibiotics for systemic therapy were Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid (74.8 % of veterinarians), Enrofloxacin (56.7 %) and Amoxicillin (53.4 %) in 2017; and Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid (88.8 %), Amoxicillin (67.5 %) and Metronidazole (33.8 %) in 2020, respectively.

Veterinarians report a significantly reduced usage of fluoroquinolones and 3 rd and 4th generation cephalosporines in dogs and cats compared to 2017. These changes in prescribing practice could be a consequence of the amendment of the TÄHAV, which dictates a prohibition of rededication as well as an obligation for microbial sensitivity testing for these AB classes.

The aim of this work was to develop an in-house ultra-performance liquid chromatography method with UV detection (UHPLC-PDA) allowing the simultaneous determination of 8 beta-lactams (amoxicillin, aztreonam, cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, meropenem and piperacillin) and linezolid and to cross-validate the linezolid quantification with a new commercial immunoassay (ARK kit) tested on a Cobas analyzer. The main advantages of the immunoassay are a 24/24 h random access assay which is fully automated and results provided within 2 h. The interference due to potential co-administrated drugs was evaluated on both methods. The preanalytical factors (type of matrix, stability) for linezolid were also investigated. The influence of hemolysis, icteria or lipemia on the spectroscopic detection of the immunoassay was assessed. The analytical performances were evaluated using the accuracy profiles approach with acceptance limits fixed at ±30%. Seventy patient samples were measured using both methods. No cross-reaction with the tested anti-infective drugs as well as no influence of hemolysis, lipemia, icteria were observed. The linezolid concentration could be measured on heparinized plasma or serum without a significant difference and remained stable for at least 72h at 4°C.The UHPLC-PDA method performed well in the analytical range investigated (0.25-50 mg/L for meropenem, 0.75-50 mg/L for linezolid and 1-200 mg/L for other beta-lactams) with an intermediate precision and a relative bias below 7.6 and 7.7%, respectively. The analytical range of the immunoassay was narrower, from 0.85 to 18.5 mg/L. The precision and relative bias were lower than 8.1% and 4.2%, respectively. Results obtained on clinical samples showed an acceptable difference between methods with a mean bias of -1.8% [95% confidence interval: -5.2% - 1.6%]. To conclude, both methods showed acceptable performance to perform TDM of linezolid considering the therapeutic through target of 2-8 mg/L. The choice of the method should be made according to the degree of emergency of the response required and the field of application justifying or not the simultaneous quantification of beta-lactams and linezolid.

164,164,164,26345711,"Odontogenic sinusitis and sinonasal complications of dental disease or treatment (SCDDT) play a relevant, often underappreciated role in paranasal sinus infections. Treating SCDDT patients requires tailored medical and surgical approaches in order to achieve acceptable success rates. These approaches differ from common rhinogenic sinusitis treatment protocols mostly because of the different etiopathogenesis. Our study comprehensively evaluated microbiology and antibiotic resistance in SCDDT patients and compared findings with a control group of patients affected by rhinogenic sinusitis. We performed microbiological sampling during surgery on 28 patients with SCDDT and 16 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Colonies were isolated, Gram-stained, and the species identified using classic biochemical methods. These results were confirmed by DNA pyrosequencing, and then the resistance profile of each SCDDT isolate to various antibiotics was tested. Microbial growth was observed in all SCDDT patients, whereas samples from 60% of patients in the control group failed to yield any bacterial growth (p < 0.001). Anaerobes grew in 14% of SCDDT patients as compared to 7% of CRSwNP patients (p = 0.42). Of the isolates from SCDDT patients, 70% were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate, whereas all isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin. Of the staphylococci identified, 80% were capable of producing beta-lactamase. Given the extent of microbiological contamination within the maxillary sinus of SCDDT patients, these infections should be regarded as a different class of conditions from rhinogenic sinusitis. Our findings support the need for different approaches in the treatment of SCDDT patients.

Direct activity costs were calculated for outpatient treatment of PSBI and pneumonia in two districts of India: Palwal, Haryana and Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. These included costs of staff time and consumables for initial assessment, classification, and referrals; recommended treatment of fast breathing (oral amoxicillin for seven days) and PSBI (injection gentamicin and oral amoxicillin for seven days); and daily assessments. Indirect operational costs included staff training; staff time cost for general management, supervision, and coordination; referral transport; and communication. The average cost per young infant treated for recommended and acceptable treatment for PSBI was 16 US dollars (US$) (95% CI = US$15.4-16.3) in 2018-19 and US$18.5 in 2022 (adjusted for inflation) when all direct and indirect operational costs were considered. The average cost of recommended treatment for pneumonia was US$10.1 (95% CI = US$9.7-10.6) or US$11.7 in 2022, per treated young infant. The incremental cost 2018-2019 for supplies, medicines, and operations (excluding staff time costs) per infant treated for PSBI was US$6.1 and US$4.3 and for pneumonia was US$3.5 and US$2.2 in Palwal and Lucknow, respectively. Operation and administrative costs were 25% in Palwal and 12% in Lucknow of the total PSBI treatment costs. The average cost per live birth for treating PSBI in each population was US$5 in Palwal and US$3 in Lucknow. Higher operation costs for social mobilisation activities in Palwal led to the empowerment of families and timely care-seeking. Costs of treatment of PSBI with the recommended regimen in an outpatient setting, when a referral is not feasible, are under US$20 per treated child and must be budgeted to reduce deaths from neonatal sepsis. The investment must be made in activities that lead to successful identification, prompt care seeking, timely initiation of treatment and follow-up.

Antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates were determined by disk diffusion method. Biofilm forming ability of the isolates were investigated by Congo red agar method, standard tube method, and microplate method. The genes responsible for antibiotic resistance, biofilm-forming ability, and adhesion were examined by PCR. Five isolates (4.5%) were identified as methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus by antibiotic susceptibility testing and confirmed by mecA detection. The resistance rates to penicillin, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, enrofloxacin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were 45.5, 39.3, 33, 26.8, 5.4, 0.9, and 0.9%, respectively. All isolates were susceptible against vancomycin and gentamicin. The blaZ (100%), tetK (67.6%), and ermA (70%) genes were the most common antibiotic-resistance genes. Using Congo red agar, microplate, and standard tube methods, 70.5, 67, and 62.5% of the isolates were found to be biofilm producers, respectively. The percentage rate of icaA, icaD, and bap genes in Staph. aureus isolates were 86.6, 86.6, and 13.4%, respectively. The adhesion molecules fnbA, can, and clfA were detected in 87 (77.7%), 98 (87.5%), and 75 (70%) isolates, respectively. The results indicated that Staph. aureus from sublinical bovine mastitis cases were mainly resistant to β-lactams and, to a lesser extent, to tetracycline and erythromycin.

171,171,171,30701937,"The aim is to conduct a comprehensive comparative study of the efficacy and safety of the hybrid scheme of eradication therapy (ET) in patients with peptic ulcer of the stomach or duodenum associated with Helicobacter pylori. Materials and methods. In a prospective, randomized comparative study, 180 patients were divided into three equal groups of 60 people, depending on the prescribed 10-day ET regimen. Group 1 - the standard triple scheme (omeprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin); group 2 - four-component therapy with preparations of bismuth (omeprazole, tetracycline, metronidazole, bismuth tricalium dicitrate); group 3 - hybrid scheme (first 5 days: omeprazole and amoxicillin, the next 5 days: omeprazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole). The effectiveness of ET was determined with the help of a breath test a month after the end of therapy. Adverse events were recorded by patients in specially developed diaries. Pharmacoeconomic analysis was carried out using the &quot;cost-effectiveness&quot; method with calculation of the CER coefficient. Results and discussion. The effectiveness of standard triple therapy was 73.3% (ITT), 75.9% (PP); four-component therapy with bismuth preparations - 78.3% (ITT), 82.4% (PP); hybrid scheme - 85% (ITT), 91% (PP). Hybrid therapy proved to be significantly more effective than standard triple therapy with a odds ratio (OR) of 3.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-9.73 (p=0.043, χ2=4.75, p-level=0.029298). The incidence of adverse events with the use of triple, four-component and hybrid ET regimens was 15; 18.3 and 28.3% respectively. The OR of at least one adverse event in patients receiving a hybrid ET regimen compared with triple therapy was 2.24 (95% CI 0.91-5.53, p=0.0823, χ2=3.14, p-level=0.076394), and compared with the four-component therapy - 1.76 (95% CI 0.74-4.17, p=0.2804, χ2=1.68, p-level=0.194924). According to the results of the pharmacoeconomic analysis, the most profitable from an economic point of view was a hybrid ET scheme with a CER of 20.1. The conclusion. Hybrid therapy showed the greatest effectiveness in comparison with the triple and four-component ET regimens, however, the incidence of side effects in patients receiving the hybrid ET scheme was higher, although it remained within the acceptable level for use in clinical practice. Pharmacoeconomic analysis also showed the advisability of designating a hybrid ET scheme.

We assessed the effectiveness and safety of the combination of bismuth and the standard, clarithromycin-containing triple therapy in eradication of H pylori infection, using data from a large multi-center registry. We performed an interim analysis of data from the European Registry on H pylori Management, a prospective trial registering clinical data and outcomes from infected patients from 27 countries in Europe since 2013. We extracted data on 1141 treatment-naïve patients who received first-line treatment with bismuth salts (240 mg) and a proton pump inhibitor (57% received esomeprazole, 18% received omeprazole, 11% received pantoprazole, and 14% received rabeprazole), amoxicillin (1 g), and clarithromycin (500 mg), all taken twice daily. Intention to treat and per-protocol rates of eradication were 88% and 94%, respectively. Intention to treat eradication increased to 93% in patients who received 14-day treatments. Adverse events occurred in 36% of patients; 76% of these events were mild, with a mean duration of 6 days. In multivariate analysis, eradication was associated with treatment compliance (odds ratio [OR], 13.0), a double dose (equivalent to 40 mg omeprazole) of proton pump inhibitor (OR, 4.7), and 14-day duration of treatment (OR, 2.0). In an analysis of data from a large multi-center registry, we found the addition of bismuth to 14-day standard triple therapy with clarithromycin and amoxicillin to eradicate H pylori infection in more than 90% of patients, based on intention to treat analysis, with an acceptable safety profile and level of adherence.

Hyposalivation, a commonly occurring phenomenon after radiotherapy, leads to a higher caries sensitivity. To keep oral health at an acceptable level as much as possible, teeth are checked by a dentist prior to radiotherapy. Non-essential teeth and teeth with pathology are extracted, in order to prevent future problems. Dental treatment in the area treated with radiation will nevertheless sometimes be necessary after radiotherapy. Because the risk of infection is high and may result in the loss of part of the jaw, antibiotic prophylaxis is started prior to invasive treatment.

We investigated how the pandemic affected the prescribing behavior of dentists in Croatia. Data on prescribing practices for this study were provided by the Croatian Health Insurance Institute. The analysis included the number of prescriptions, costs, and the number of packages prescribed. The World Health Organization's defined daily dose per 1000 inhabitants (DID) per day was used as an objective utilization comparison. During the first pandemic year, prescribing practice changed the most. Wide-spectrum antibiotics, analgesics, and antiseptics showed the highest trend in change. A statistically significant change in prescribing practices during the pandemic period was noted for amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, ibuprofen, and ketoprofen which showed an increase in trend, while cephalexin and diclofenac showed a statistically significant decrease. The highest increase in trend was recorded for azithromycin, at +39.3%. The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a marked increase in medication utilization, especially in the first year of the pandemic. The increase in wide-spectrum antibiotic classes needs to be addressed and regulated so that patients accept that antibiotics are not a substitute for dental treatment and dentists always start treatment with narrow-spectrum antibiotics regardless of specific times, as is the case with the pandemic.

178,178,178,35771738,"Neonates with serious bacterial infections should be treated with injectable antibiotics after hospitalization, which may not be feasible in many low resource settings. In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a guideline for the management of young infants (0-59 days old) with possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) when referral for hospital treatment is not feasible. We evaluated the feasibility of the WHO guideline implementation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to achieve high coverage of PSBI treatment. From April 2016 to March 2017, in a longitudinal, descriptive, mixed methods implementation research study, we implemented WHO PSBI guideline for sick young infants (0-59 dyas of age) in the public health programme setting in five health areas of North and South Ubangi Provinces with an overall population of about 60,000. We conducted policy dialogue with national and sub-national level government planners, decision-makers, academics and other stakeholders. We established a Technical Support Unit to provide implementation support. We built the capacity of health workers and managers and ensured the availability of necessary medicines and commodities. We followed infants with PSBI signs up to 14 days. The research team systematically collected data on adherence to treatment and outcomes. We identified 3050 live births and 285 (9.3%) young infants with signs of PSBI in the study area, of whom 256 were treated. Published data have reported 10% PSBI incidence rate in young infants. Therefore, the estimated coverage of treatment was 83.9% (256/305). Another 426 from outside the study catchment area were also identified with PSBI signs by the nurses of a health centre within the study area. Thus, a total of 711 young infants with PSBI were identified, 285 (40%) 7-59 days old infants had fast breathing (pneumonia), 141 (20%) 0-6 days old had fast breathing (severe pneumonia), 233 (33%) had signs of clinical severe infection (CSI), and 52 (7%) had signs of critical illness. Referral to a hospital was advised to 426 (60%) infants with CSI, critical illness or severe pneumonia. The referral was refused by 282 families who accepted simplified antibiotic treatment on an outpatient basis at the health centres. Treatment failure among those who received outpatient treatment occurred in 10/128 (8%) with severe pneumonia, 25/147 (17%) with CSI, including one death, and 2/7 (29%) young infants with a critical illness. Among 285 infants with pneumonia, 257 (90%) received oral amoxicillin treatment, and 8 (3%) failed treatment. Adherence to outpatient treatment was 98% to 100% for various PSBI sub-categories. Among 144 infants treated in a hospital, 8% (1/13) with severe pneumonia, 23% (20/86) with CSI and 40% (18/45) with critical illness died. Implementation of the WHO PSBI guideline when a referral was not possible was feasible in our context with high coverage. Without financial and technical input to strengthen the health system at all levels, including the community and the referral level, it may not be possible to achieve and sustain the same high treatment coverage.

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has emerged as an alternative to thoracotomy to evacuate these retained collections. This report reviews a recent trauma unit experience with thoracoscopic evacuation of hemothoraces. The records of all trauma patients undergoing surgical intervention for retained hemothoraces over the 30-month period January 2001 to June 2003 were reviewed. The study included 46 patients. All sustained penetrating injuries, 40 with stab and 6 with gunshot wounds. Twenty-two, 17, and 7 patients each had one, two and three attempts at drainage with tube thoracostomy, respectively. In 37 patients (80%), retained infected/uninfected pleural fluid was successfully evacuated thoracoscopically. VATS failed in 9 (20%) patients and the procedure was converted to open thoracotomy. Dense adhesions were present in all 9 of these patients. The mean time interval between injury and thoracoscopy and thoracotomy, was 13.3 days (range 3-46 days) and 14.5 days (range 11-24 days), respectively. The mean volume of pleural fluid evacuated thoracoscopically was 650 mL. The failure of VATS evacuation correlated with the empyema rate. The median postoperative stay was 5 days for both groups.

183,183,183,32727445,"Antibiotic misuse and other types of unnecessary use of antibiotics can contribute to accelerate the process of antibiotic resistance, which is considered a global concern, mostly affecting low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). In Mozambique there is limited evidence on community knowledge and practices regarding antibiotics and antibiotic resistance. As part of the ABACUS project, this paper describes knowledge and practices of antibiotic use among the general population in the semi-rural district of Manhiça to inform evidence-based communication intervention strategies for safer antibiotic use. The study was conducted in Manhiça, a semi-rural district of Southern Mozambique. Sixteen in-depth interviews and four focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with community members to explore lay knowledge and practices regarding antibiotics and awareness of antibiotic resistance. The qualitative data was analysed using a combination of content and thematic analysis. The SRQR guidelines for reporting qualitative studies was performed. Although participants did not hold any consistent knowledge of antibiotics, their visual recognition of amoxicillin (distinct red yellow capsule) was acceptable, but less so for different types and brands of antibiotics. The majority of participants were aware of the term 'antibiotic', yet the definition they gave was rarely backed by biomedical knowledge. Participants associated antibiotics with certain colours, shapes and health conditions. Participants reported common habits that may contribute to resistance: not buying the full course, self-medication, sharing medicines and interruption of treatment. Most had never heard of the term 'antibiotic resistance' but were familiar with the phenomenon. They often understood the term 'resistance' as treatment failure and likened 'resistance' to non-compliance, ineffective medication, disease resistance or to an inability of the physical body to respond to it. There is a broad understanding of the importance of medication compliance but not specifically of antibiotic resistance. In addition, there is a recognized gap between knowledge of responsible drug compliance and actual behaviour. Future qualitative research is required to further explore what determines this behaviour. The existing ability to visually identify amoxicillin by its distinct red and yellow appearance is informative for future awareness and behavioural change campaigns that may incorporate visual aids of antibiotics.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the triple therapy regimen containing two different doses of levofloxacin in the first-line eradication treatment. 110 naïve patients with anti Helicobacter pylori treatment indications according to Maastricht III Consensus Report were included to the study. Patients were randomized into two groups as the patients treated with a levofloxacin (500 mg o.i.d), amoxicillin (1 g b.i.d) and proton pump inhibitor (b.i.d) combination for 10 days (Group 1, n=60) and patients treated with a levofloxacin (500 mg b.i.d), amoxicillin (1 g b.i.d) and proton pump inhibitor (b.i.d) combination for 10 days (Group 2, n=50).

To date, the applicability of existing human BCS criteria has not been evaluated in chickens. The objective of this study was to discuss the feasibility of BCS extrapolation between species and establish a preliminary chicken BCS by classifying seven veterinary commonly used drugs including metronidazole, amoxicillin, sulfamethoxazole, sulfadiazine, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, doxycycline hydrochloride, and trimethoprim. Firstly, we finished the determination of physiological parameters affecting solubility in chickens, including body temperature, gastrointestinal pH, and the fluid volume in the gastrointestinal tract (GI), and the drug is considered highly soluble in chicken BCS when the highest dose strength is soluble in 20.40 ml (fed) or 6.73 ml (fasted) over the pH range of 1-8 at 41°C. Drug solubility classification was based on dose number calculation. Metronidazol and amoxicillin were classed differently under fed and fasted conditions. Secondly, we discussed the effect of ABC transporters (MDCK vs. MDCK-chAbcb1/Abcg2) and pH (5.5 vs. 7.4) on drug permeability and classification. The drug is classified as highly permeable when its permeability is equal to or greater than metoprolol tartrate. Though ABC transporters and pH significantly affected the permeability values of drugs (p < .05), the permeability classification of the drugs has not been changed except for sulfamethoxazole.

186,186,186,37213792,"Preterm premature rupture of membranes accounts for approximately one-quarter of all preterm deliveries and occurs in 2% to 3% of all pregnancies. With subclinical infection being a suspected cause of preterm premature rupture of membranes, the administration of prophylactic antibiotics is an accepted standard of care to extend the latency period. Historically, erythromycin was used in the antibiotic regimen recommended for women with preterm premature rupture of membranes during expectant management; however, azithromycin has recently been shown to be a suitable alternative. This study aimed to evaluate whether extended azithromycin administration affects the latency time in preterm premature rupture of membranes. This was a retrospective multi-institutional cohort study in Washington, District of Columbia, of patients admitted from January 2012 to December 2019 with preterm premature rupture of membranes of singleton pregnancies between 23 0/7 and 33 6/7 weeks of gestation. Patients were excluded if they had multiple pregnancies, had an allergy to penicillin or macrolides, were in labor, had suspected placental abruptions, had overt chorioamnionitis, or had nonreassuring fetal status on presentation indicating the need for prompt delivery. Patients that received limited azithromycin administration (<2 days) and patients that received extended azithromycin administration (7 days) were compared. All patients otherwise received the institutional standard of 2 days of intravenous ampicillin followed by 5 days of oral amoxicillin. The primary outcome was length of gestational latency, defined as the time from membrane rupture to delivery. The selective secondary outcomes that were evaluated were rates of chorioamnionitis and adverse neonatal outcomes, including sepsis, respiratory distress, necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage, and neonatal death. During the study period, 416 cases of preterm premature rupture of membranes were identified. Of the 287 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 165 (57.5%) received limited azithromycin administration, and 122 (42.5%) received extended azithromycin administration. Adjusted median gestational latency was significantly longer for patients who received extended azithromycin administration, extended by >3 days (2.6 days [interquartile range, 2.2-3.1] for limited azithromycin administration vs 5.8 days [interquartile range, 4.8-6.9] for extended azithromycin administration;  Among patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes, extended azithromycin administration was associated with increased latency, without any effect on other maternal or neonatal outcomes.

The proportions of ""satisfactory"" taste judgments showed a significant difference between amoxicillin-clavulanate reference product and its generics (77.9% vs. 65%, p = 0.01). The amoxicillin-clavulanate generics were more likely than the reference product to be spat out at least once (28.7% vs. 19%, p = 0.05). The full treatment course was taken by 91.7% and 82.3% of children prescribed the amoxicillin-clavulanate reference product and its generics, respectively (p = 0.02). The proportions of ""satisfactory"" taste judgments showed no significant difference between amoxicillin reference product and generics (64.3% vs. 72.5%, p = 0.3).

We studied 60 patients in this randomised prospective study, the objective of which was to evaluate metronidazole as part of an empirical antibiotic regimen after drainage of infections of the odontogenic spaces. Samples of pus were sent for culture and testing for sensitivity. Amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole were given to all patients. After incision and drainage the patients were randomly allocated to two groups. In the first group both antibiotics were continued, and in the second metronidazole was withdrawn. The groups were compared both clinically and microbiologically. There were no significant differences between the groups in the resolution of infection. Thirteen patients (n=6 in the 2-antimicrobial group, and n=7 in the amoxicillin/clavulanate group) showed no improvement during the 48 h postoperatively. Overall there was need to substitute another antibiotic for amoxicillin/clavulanate in only 6 cases. Six patients in the amoxicillin/clavulanate group required the addition of metronidazole after drainage.

The patients were randomly assigned to groups given genotypic resistance-guided therapy for 14 days (n = 21 in trial 1, n = 205 in trial 2) or empirical therapy according to medication history for 14 days (n = 20 in trial 1, n = 205 in trial 2). Patients received sequential therapy containing esomeprazole and amoxicillin for the first 7 days, followed by esomeprazole and metronidazole, with levofloxacin, clarithromycin, or tetracycline (doxycycline in trial 1, tetracycline in trial 2) for another 7 days (all given twice daily) based on genotype markers of resistance determined from gastric biopsy specimens (group A) or empirical therapy according to medication history.

This trial was terminated ahead of schedule due to the low rate of eradication in patients given doxycycline sequential therapy (15 of 26 [57.7%]). In trial 2, H pylori infection was eradicated in 160 of 205 (78%) patients receiving genotype resistance-guided therapy and 148 of 205 (72.2%) patients receiving empirical therapy (P = .170), according to intent to treat analysis. The frequencies of adverse effects and compliance did not differ significantly between groups. Properly designed empirical therapy, based on medication history, is an acceptable alternative to genotypic resistance-guided therapy for eradication of refractory H pylori infection after consideration of accessibility, cost, and patient preference.

Hypoxaemia is a life-threatening complication among children under 5 with pneumonia. Hypoxaemia increases risk of mortality by 4.3 times in children with pneumonia than those without hypoxaemia. Prevalence of hypoxaemia varies with geography, altitude and severity (9%-39% Asia, 3%-10% African countries). In this protocol paper, we describe research methods for assessing impact of Lady Health Workers (LHWs) identifying hypoxaemia in children with signs of pneumonia during household visits on acceptance of hospital referral in district Jamshoro, Sindh. A cluster randomised controlled trial using pulse oximetry as intervention for children with severe pneumonia will be conducted in community settings. Children aged 0-59 months with signs of severe pneumonia will be recruited by LHWs during routine visits in both intervention and control arms after consent. Severe pneumonia will be defined as fast breathing and/or chest in-drawing, and, one or more danger sign and/or hypoxaemia (Sa02 <92%) in PO (intervention) group and fast breathing and/or chest in-drawing and one or more danger sign in clinical signs (control) group.

Embase, Ovid Emcare and MEDLINE were searched for studies from inception to January 2023. All studies, except case reports, focusing on the antibiotic treatment of LRTI in children, with neurodisabilities were included. Outcomes included length of stay, intensive care admission and mortality. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria (5115 patients). All the studies were of low quality. The shortest length of stay was with anaerobic and gram-positive cover. Five studies used anaerobic, gram-positive and gram-negative cover (e.g., amoxicillin-clavulanic acid), which was frequently adequate. In one large study, it was better than gram-positive and gram-negative cover alone (e.g. ceftriaxone). Those unresponsive or more unwell at presentation improved faster on Pseudomonas aeruginosa cover (e.g., piperacillin-tazobactam). In this context, anaerobic, gram-positive and gram-negative cover is just as effective as P. aeruginosa cover, supporting empiric treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. If there is a failure to improve, broadening to include P. aeruginosa could be considered. This is consistent with a consensus statement on the treatment of LRTI in children with neurodisability. An accepted definition for what constitutes LRTI in this cohort is required before designing prospective randomised trials.

Forty extracted bovine incisors were collected and discoloured with triple antibiotic pastes (TAP) with minocycline, doxycycline, amoxicillin and cefaclor throughout 30 days. The specimens were then randomly divided into two subgroups and each group received different bleaching materials: 35% hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate. Spectrophotometric measurements were obtained on the buccal surfaces of the crown, firstly in the beginning, then on the 4th, 8th and 12th days after the placement of the bleaching materials. The acceptability threshold was set to 3.5. The ∆E values were calculated and the data was analysed using the repeated measures analysis of variance (P = .05). All the test groups induced colour changes exceeding the acceptability threshold 30 days after the antibiotic pastes were placed. The 35% hydrogen peroxide was more effective than sodium perborate in the whitening of discoloured teeth by antibiotic pastes (P = .001). The whitening effect after the 8th and 12th days was significantly more than after 4 days of treatment (P <.001). The discolouration caused by the TAP with minocycline and cefaclor showed greater whitening compared to the TAP with doxycycline and amoxicillin groups (P <.05). The whitening treatment effect of 35% hydrogen peroxide on teeth discoloured by antibiotic pastes seems to have significantly outperformed the sodium perborate treatment. Both bleaching agents were allowed to bleach the teeth gradually each day and the effects on the 8th and 12th days were superior to the one on the 4th day. The use of 35% hydrogen peroxide could be advantageous to bleach the teeth discoloured with antibiotic pastes compared to sodium perborate.

Patients who are heterozygotes for the mutation, but especially homozygotes, have a much slower metabolism, which will result in more profound acid suppression. Studies have been published, that suggest that the success rate of anti-Helicobacter therapy is in part related to the CYP2C19 genotype of the patient. However, it is important to keep in mind that most studies that have evaluated this have been carried out in Asia, in particular in Japan, where the prevalence of poor metabolizers (PM) is much higher than, for example, in Caucasians. The systematic review published in this issue suggests that particularly for omeprazole in combination with amoxicillin or amoxicillin and clarithromycin the success rate is much lower when compared to other proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). However, there was marked heterogeneity when the results were pooled in formal meta-analysis. Study quality was suboptimal and other factors such as resistance to antibiotics may explain the observed differences in success rates.

198,198,198,29501295,"Acute otitis media (AOM) is predominantly a disease of childhood and one of the common reasons for prescribing antibiotics. Ear pain is the main symptom of AOM, with the result that parents frequently seek immediate medical assistance for their children. Antibiotic therapy for AOM does not provide symptomatic relief in the first 24 hours, and analgesics are commonly recommended for relieving the pain associated with AOM. The aims of the present study were to assess pediatricians' attitudes toward AOM and ear pain management in Turkey. This multicenter descriptive questionnaire study was conducted in 20 centers from different geographic locations in Turkey, with 977 pediatricians, between June 2015 and December 2016. The questionnaire comprised 20 questions focusing on the pediatricians' sociodemographic variables, experiences, and treatment related to AOM and ear pain. Of the pediatricians, 58.2% were residents, 36.5% were specialists, and 4.3% were lecturers. Most participants were working in a university hospital (54.8%) or education and research hospital (32.2%). In general daily practice, the AOM diagnosis rates were between 6% and 20% in outpatient clinics, and 52.3% of the participants stated the patients complained about ear pain in pediatric clinics. The watchful waiting (WW) rate, as opposed to immediate antibiotic treatment, was 39.8% for all the pediatricians. The pediatric residents used the WW strategy less than the specialists and lecturers did (p = 0.004). The rates of the WW strategy were higher in outpatient clinics where AOM was commonly diagnosed (p < 0.001). The most common antibiotic prescribed for AOM was amoxicillin clavulanate (76.7%). The mean recommended treatment period for AOM was 9.3 ± 2.2 days. The choices for systemic ear pain treatment were acetaminophen (26.8%), ibuprofen (29.4%), and alternating between ibuprofen and acetaminophen (43.9%). Moreover, 34.6% of the participants recommended topical agents for otalgia. Topical agents were more commonly recommended by the pediatric residents than specialists or lecturers (p < 0.001). Finally, 58.3% of pediatricians had experiences of the parents' usage of a variety of herbal and folk remedies, such as breast milk or olive oil, for their children's ear pain. Amoxicillin clavulanate was the most frequently prescribed antibiotic for AOM. WW was approved by the pediatricians, and having more AOM patients was a significant factor in the physicians' choice of WW; nevertheless, the WW rate was poor. Implementation of educational intervention strategies will help pediatricians in improving their compliance with evidence-based guidelines for AOM treatment. Otalgia is taken seriously by parents and pediatricians, and otalgia treatment seems to be well accepted in Turkey for providing symptomatic relief and enhancing the patients' quality of life.

To evaluate efficacy and safety of the antibiotic in maxillary sinusitis, its use was compared with amoxicillin/clavulanate (amox/clav), which is a well-accepted beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotic. In this investigator-blinded multicenter phase III clinical study, 569 patients were randomly assigned to one of three treatment regimens: one daily dose of cefdinir 600 mg (OD), cefdinir 300 mg every 12 h (BD), and amox/clav 500/125 mg every 8 h. All antibiotics were administered orally for 10 days. Maxillary sinusitis was documented by typical clinical signs and symptoms and was confirmed by X-ray imaging. Before treatment, the genus and species of any pathogens were determined from sinus aspirates. Cultures were tested for beta-lactmase production and in vitro resistance to cefdinir and amox/clav. The effectiveness of antibiotic treatment was evaluated 7-14 days after therapy and whether or not recurrent clinical symptoms or persistent infection was determined 21-35 days post-therapy. The appearance of any adverse events was classified as associated or not associated with the medication of the study. Present findings showed that the in vitro susceptibility of pathogens to cefdinir and amox/clav was similar. Cefdinir OD or BD was therapeutically as effective as or better than amox/clav, although cefdinir BD was not as useful as amox/clav clinically. Cefdinir OD and BD and amox/clav were well tolerated.

Chemotherapy-induced neutropenic fever is a potentially life-threatening circumstance in high-risk patients. The standard of care for neutropenic fever is inpatient treatment with i.v. broad-spectrum antibiotics. Within the past 5-10 years, there has been growing interest in oral therapy and outpatient treatment for carefully selected low-risk patients. Outpatient treatment has the potential to avoid patient exposure to multidrug-resistant organisms found in the hospital, provide a more comfortable environment for the patient and his or her family, and achieve significant cost savings. Two risk-assessment tools have been developed to identify patients with a low risk of developing complications from neutropenic fever. A limited number of clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate outpatient treatment of low-risk patients. The evidence from well-designed randomized controlled trials comparing the safety and efficacy of outpatient therapy with standard therapy is not extensive. However, some centers have reported successful outpatient therapy in low-risk patients with febrile neutropenia. The greatest amount of evidence for outpatient treatment of neutropenic fever is available for the combination regimen of ciprofloxacin plus amoxicillin-clavulanate.

In children who take oral form, the palatability and the frequency of administration seem to be factors important to good compliance. This observational study was designed to assess the acceptability of oral antibiotics (including generics) commonly prescribed to children by primary care physicians in France. It was given to 50 pediatricians and 50 GPs in private practice. For each patient, the physician and parents completed a questionnaire, and parents filled out a log for each drug intake. Between September 2006 and September 2007, 91 physicians enrolled 2400 children and 1482 patient records are fully assessable. The two factors that improve significantly compliance are administration in two doses by day (OR 2.2 [95% CI 1 6-3]) and acceptability ≥80% (OR 2.6, [95% CI 1.9-3.7]). The acceptability was better for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 65.4% (95% CI [57.6 to 72.4]) than for cefpodoxime 47.1% (95% CI [43.8-50.4]) or cefuroxime axetil 26% (95% [CI 15.9-39.6]). Conversely, cefpodoxime proxetil obtained a better score for compliance 91.8% (95% CI [89.8 to 93.4) as amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 84.6% (95%CI 80.8 to 87.8) because of its mode of administration in two doses per day. There is no difference between the amoxicillin clavulanic acid reference product and its generics as a whole, however a large variability exists between generics. If, for antibiotics prescribed in two doses per day, the two administrations by day are roughly equidistant, it is not the same for those prescribed three times a day: indeed, while the doses taken are identical, only four hours separate the first intake of the morning from the second intake in mid-day and more than 12 hours between the evening dose from the next morning intake. This study confirms the disparity in terms of acceptability among the different antibiotics prescribed for children even for the same drug, warranting evaluation for marketing of future generic drugs pediatric oral suspension.

The aim was to assess the outpatient usage of antibiotics in teaching hospitals in various parts of capital city of Iran, Tehran and its association with resistance. 600 outpatient antibiotic prescriptions between December 2011 and May 2012 were reviewed in our teaching hospitals. All prescriptions were scrutinized in order to evaluate the antibiotic prescribing. The medical doctors from all grades were asked to note the chief complaints and the most possible diagnosis on each prescription. Clinical data, patient demographic and ultimately the total quantities of antibiotics were recorded. Our data was then compared against the major antibiotic guidelines and similar studies in other countries. The most common prescribed antibiotics are Penicillins (Penicillin, Co-Amoxiclav and Amoxicillin) (40 %), Cephalosporins (Cefixime, Cephalexin and Ceftriaxone) (24.5 %) and Macrolides (particularly Azithromycin) (15.3 %). In total, 18.2 % of cases were combinational antibacterial therapies (≥ 2). The most common diagnosis was upper respiratory tract infections as common cold (29.2 %) and sore throat (11.8 %).

So we designed a study to compare a sequential regimen with a bismuth-based quadruple therapy that contains a short course of furazolidone, in Iran. Two hundred and ninety-six patients with duodenal ulcer and naïve H. pylori infection were randomized into two groups: 148 patients received (PAB-F) pantoprazole (40mg-bid), amoxicillin (1g-bid), and bismuth subcitrate (240mg-bid) for 2weeks and furazolidone (200mg-bid) just during the first week. And 148 patients received (PA-CT) pantoprazole (40mg-bid) for 10days, amoxicillin (1g-bid) for the first 5days, and clarithromycin (500mg-bid) plus tinidazole (500mg-bid) just during the second 5days. C(14) -urea breath test was performed 8weeks after the treatment. Two hundred and sixty-one patients completed the study (137 patients in the PA-CT and 124 in the PAB-F group). The results were not statistically different between the two groups in the eradication rates and the severity of side effects. The intention to treat eradication rate was 80.4% in the PAB-F group and 83.7% in the PA-CT group. Per-protocol eradication rates were 88.7% and 89.1%, respectively. Because the two regimens showed acceptable and similar abilities in H. pylori eradication and because of much higher cost of clarithromycin in Iran, the furazolidone containing regimen seems to be superior.

210,210,210,35273972,"Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been widely performed for ulcerative colitis (UC) treatment at the clinical trial stage. Previous reports have used multiple FMT methods to enhance the colonization of healthy donor microbiota in the recipient's intestines. FMT following triple antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin, fosfomycin, and metronidazole (A-FMT) is not only effective but also requires only one FMT, which improves dysbiosis caused by reduced Bacteroidetes diversity in patients with UC. Alginate and its derivatives have the potential to induce the growth of intestinal bacteria including Bacteroides members and produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are beneficial in regulating overactive autoimmunity. Our trial aims to investigate whether post-intervention with alginate, which can improve the intestinal environment, will enhance the therapeutic effect of A-FMT in UC and increase the long-term remission rate. This trial is a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel assignment trial. Patients with UC and fecal donation candidates will undergo strict screening before being involved in the trial. Eligible patients are randomly divided into two groups: one group will drink one bottle of alginate twice a day for 8 consecutive weeks after A-FMT, while the other group will take a placebo instead of the alginate drink. The primary endpoints are the changes in the Total Mayo Score at 8 weeks after study initiation and A-FMT from baseline. The secondary endpoint is the comparison of clinical features, microbiota, and metabolomic analysis before and after 8 weeks of study food intake. Changes at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after A-FMT will be assessed. Finally, a subpopulation analysis of the relationship between patients and donors is an exploratory endpoint. The FMT post-treatment used in this study is an oral alginate drink that is easily accepted by patients. If the regimen achieves the desired results, it can further improve the A-FMT regimen and provide evidence for clinical practice guidelines for UC. https://jrct.niph.go.jp/latest-detail/jRCTs031200103, identifier: jRCTs031200103.

These labels are associated with harm from use of broad-spectrum non-penicillin antibiotics. Current testing guidelines incorporate both skin and challenge tests; this is prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to deliver on a large scale. We aimed to establish the feasibility of a rapid access de-labelling pathway for surgical patients, using direct oral challenge. 'Penicillin allergic' patients, recruited from a surgical pre-assessment clinic, were risk-stratified using a screening questionnaire. Patients at low risk of true, immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergy were offered direct oral challenge using incremental amoxicillin to a total dose of 500 mg. A 3-day course was completed at home. De-labelled patients were followed up to determine antibiotic use in surgery, and attitudes towards de-labelling were explored. Of 219 patients screened, 74 were eligible for inclusion and offered testing. We subsequently tested 56 patients; 55 were de-labelled. None had a serious reaction to the supervised challenge, or thereafter. On follow-up, 17 of 19 patients received appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis during surgery. Only three of 33 de-labelled patients would have been happy for the label to be removed without prior specialist testing. Rapid access de-labelling, using direct oral challenge in appropriately risk-stratified patients, can be incorporated into the existing surgical care pathway. This provides immediate and potential long-term benefit for patients. Interest in testing is high among patients, and clinicians appear to follow clinic recommendations.

We implemented the World Health Organization PSBI management guideline when referral is not feasible within the public health system in Pune, India to evaluate feasibility, barriers and facilitators for its implementation. A national-level consultative meeting between government officials and study partners resulted in a consensus on adaptation and implementation in four demonstration sites in selected states in India. At the state and district levels, similar meetings to plan the implementation strategy and roles were held between KEM Hospital Research Centre (KEMHRC) Pune and the public health system Pune, Maharashtra. The public health system was responsible for implementation of the intervention at eight tribal primary health centres (PHC) in Pune district, India, including delivering the intervention and ensuring supplies of all commodities while KEMHRC was responsible for technical support including training of health workers, assistance in PSBI identification and management, data collection and documentation of the implementation strategy. A total of 175 young infants with PSBI were identified and managed. Of these, 34 had critical illness (CI), 46 had clinical severe infection (CSI) and 10 were infants aged 0-6 days with fast breathing (FB) while 85 infants aged 7-59 days had fast breathing. Assuming a 10% incidence of PSBI among all live births, with 3071 live births recorded, the actual incidence of PSBI found in the study was 5.7%, resulting in an actual coverage was of 57%. Among the 90 infants with CI, CSI and FB in 0-6 days, who were advised referral to government tertiary care centre as per the PSBI guideline algorithm, 81 (90%) accepted referral while 9 (10%) refused and were offered treatment at primary health centres (PHC) with a seven-day course of injectable gentamicin and oral amoxicillin. All infants with FB in 7-59 days were offered treatment at PHCs as per the PSBI guideline algorithm with a seven-day course of oral amoxicillin. All except six infants who died and one with FB in 7-59 days, who was lost to follow-up, were successfully cured. Of the six who died, five had CSI and one had CI. Among the 81 infants with CI, CSI and FB in 0-6 days who accepted referral; 48(53%) were successfully referred to government tertiary facility while 33 (36.6%) preferred to visit a private tertiary health facility. The implementation strategy demonstrated a relatively high fidelity, acceptance and intervention penetration. Lack of training and confidence of the public health staff were major challenges faced, which were resolved to a large extent through supportive supervision and re-trainings. Management of PSBI is feasible to implement in out-patient facilities in the public health system, but technical support to the health system is required to jump-start the process. Fast breathing in 7-59 days old infants can be managed with oral amoxicillin without referral. A sustainable adoption of this intervention by the health system can lead to decrease in neonatal mortality and morbidity.

In the amoxicillin group, 63 of 64 women (98.4%) had negative cervical cultures after treatment, compared with 55 of 58 women (94.8%) treated with erythromycin base. Vertical transmission to the infants was assessed by culture and/or persistent or rising immunoglobulin G antichlamydial antibody.

216,216,216,22225738,"An association between herpes virus reactivations and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) is accepted. We report six cases of DRESS with viral reactivation occurring within a single 1-month period. We attempted to find a common factor for these six cases and carried out clinical and virological examinations. Before and after this ""epidemic"", the mean number of cases of DRESS seen at the same centre was one per quarter, making the occurrence of six cases within a single month all the more remarkable and prompting us to seek an explanation. All six patients had taken a partly causative medication from different drug classes three to six weeks prior to the start of symptoms and herpes virus was detected in the blood of all of these subjects at the time of DRESS onset (four reactivations and two primary infections), and one patient subsequently displayed herpetic meningoencephalitis 95 days after the initial episode, associated with recurrence of DRESS. There was no common denominator among these six DRESS patients in terms of either drug class or reactivation of a particular type of herpes virus, which raises the possibility of a single unidentified environmental agent. DRESS does not appear fully explainable in terms of a cellular response to drug antigens but seems rather to result from complex interactions between the drug-induced immune response, viral reactivation and antiviral immune response. Several investigators have reported sequential reactivation of herpes viruses in DRESS. A viral epidemic could thus cause a ""DRESS epidemic"" in patients on medication. These cases point to the possible existence of a shared initial environmental factor (infectious or not) that favours reactivation of herpes viruses and induces DRESS in patients on medication.

217,217,217,33784321,"Neonatal infections contribute substantially to infant mortality in Nigeria and globally. Management requires hospitalization, which is not accessible to many in low resource settings. World Health Organization developed a guideline to manage possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) in young infants up to two months of age when a referral is not feasible. We evaluated the feasibility of implementing this guideline to achieve high coverage of treatment. This implementation research was conducted in out-patient settings of eight primary health care centres (PHC) in Lagelu Local Government Area (LGA) of Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. We conducted policy dialogue with the Federal and State officials to adopt the WHO guideline within the existing programme setting and held orientation and sensitization meetings with communities. We established a Technical Support Unit (TSU), built the capacity of health care providers, supervised and mentored them, monitored the quality of services and collected data for management and outcomes of sick young infants with PSBI signs. The Primary Health Care Directorate of the state ministry and the local government led the implementation and provided technical support. The enablers and barriers to implementation were documented. From 1 April 2016 to 31 July 2017 we identified 5278 live births and of these, 1214 had a sign of PSBI. Assuming 30% of births were missed due to temporary migration to maternal homes for delivery care and approximately 45% cases came from outside the catchment area due to free availability of medicines, the treatment coverage was 97.3% (668 cases/6861 expected births) with an expected 10% PSBI prevalence within the first 2 months of life. Of 1214 infants with PSBI, 392 (32%) infants 7-59 days had only fast breathing (pneumonia), 338 (27.8%) infants 0-6 days had only fast breathing (severe pneumonia), 462 (38%) presented with signs of clinical severe infection (CSI) and 22 (1.8%) with signs of critical illness. All but two, 7-59 days old infants with pneumonia were treated with oral amoxicillin without a referral; 80% (312/390) adhered to full treatment; 97.7% (381/390) were cured, and no deaths were reported. Referral to the hospital was not accepted by 87.7% (721/822) families of infants presenting with signs of PSBI needing hospitalization (critical illness 5/22; clinical severe infection; 399/462 and severe pneumonia 317/338). They were treated on an outpatient basis with two days of injectable gentamicin and seven days of oral amoxicillin. Among these 81% (584/721) completed treatment; 97% (700/721) were cured, and three deaths were reported (two with critical illness and one with clinical severe infection). We identified health system gaps including lack of staff motivation and work strikes, medicines stockouts, sub-optimal home visits that affected implementation. When a referral is not feasible, outpatient treatment for young infants with signs of PSBI is possible within existing programme structures in Nigeria with high coverage and low case fatality. To scale up this intervention successfully, government commitment is needed to strengthen the health system, motivate and train health workers, provide necessary commodities, establish technical support for implementation and strengthen linkages with communities.

220,220,220,11328254,"Triple therapies with proton pump inhibitor/ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC), clarithromycin (C) and either amoxicillin (A) or a nitroimidazole (I) are widely accepted as treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection. However, it is not clear which of these antibiotic combinations should be preferred. To evaluate whether there is a difference in efficacy between triple therapies with proton pump inhibitor/RBC, clarithromycin and either amoxicillin or a nitroimidazole. The literature was examined for randomized trials comparing proton pump inhibitor/RBC-C-A and proton pump inhibitor/RBC-C-I. Studies were grouped according to the type of acid inhibitor used (proton pump inhibitor or RBC) and differences between pooled cure rates were calculated. Forty-seven studies were identified: seven using RBC, 39 using proton pump inhibitor, one using both. RBC-C-I was somewhat superior to RBC-C-A, although this difference only reached statistical significance in intention-to-treat analysis. Overall, proton pump inhibitor-C-I and proton pump inhibitor-C-A were equally effective, but in nitroimidazole-susceptible strains, proton pump inhibitor-C-I performed better, in nitroimidazole-resistant strains, proton pump inhibitor-C-A performed better. No serious side-effects were reported and pooled drop-out rates were equal. In general, proton pump inhibitor-C-I and proton pump inhibitor-C-A are equally effective and therefore other factors such as local prevalence of resistant strains, cost of therapy and options for second-line treatment should determine which regimen should be preferred. When using RBC, the RBC-C-I combination is somewhat superior to RBC-C-A.

221,221,221,35326792,"Using poor-quality antibiotics leads to increased risk of the development of microorganism-resistant strains, treatment failure, loss of confidence in health systems, and associated socio-economic impacts. The prevalence of poor-quality antibiotics has been found to be high in some of the Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), but no data were available on the situation in Rwanda. This study was conducted to obtain data and inform health professionals on the quality of the 12 most-used selected antibiotics from private retail pharmacies in Rwanda. The investigation was conducted on 232 batches collected from randomly selected private retail pharmacies in all provinces of Rwanda, and concerned only with visual inspection and assay tests. Visual inspection was performed using a tool adopted by the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) to identify manufacturing defects. An assay test quantified the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) in each collected batch using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with an ultraviolet-visible (UV) detector, and the results were reported as the percentage content of the amount of APIs stated on the label. A total of 232 batches were analyzed, manufactured in 10 countries; the main country of manufacture was Kenya, with almost half of the batches (49.6%). The results of the visual inspection did not show the presence of counterfeit/ falsified antibiotics on the Rwandan market in this study but revealed weaknesses in labeling: more than 90% of the analyzed batches of the 12 antibiotics did not present the dosage statement on their label, and the complete list of excipients was missing in more than 20% of the analyzed batches. The assay test using HPLC confirmed the presence of APIs in 100% of the analyzed batches. However, moderate deviations from acceptable ranges of the API content defined by M. M. Nasr & C. M. Stanley in 2006 for erythromycin and the United States Pharmacopoeia 2018 for the other 11 molecules were found. The failure rate to meet the quality requirements in terms of the percentage content of active pharmaceutical ingredients declared on the labels was estimated at 8.2% in total, with 3.9% and 4.3% containing more and less than the amount of APIs stated on the labels respectively. The most-represented antibiotics on the Rwandan market were amoxicillin, co-trimoxazole and cloxacillin. No counterfeit antibiotics were found in this study. However, substandard batches with moderate deviations were found, suggesting that regular quality control of antibiotics is needed in Rwanda.

However, manysick newborns in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia do not have access to inpatientcare. A World Health Organization (WHO) guideline recommends simplified antibiotic treatment atan outpatient level for young infants up to two months of age with possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI), when referral is not feasible.We implemented this guidelinein Ethiopia to increase coverage of treatment and to learn about potential facilitating factors and barriers for implementation. We conducted implementation research in two districts (Tiro Afata and Gera) in Jimma Zone, Ethiopia, to learn about the feasibility of implementing the WHO PSBI guideline within a programme setting using the existing health care structure. We conducted orientation meetings and policy dialogue with key stakeholders and trained health extension workers and health centre staff to identify and manage sick young infants with PSBI signs at a primary health care unit. We established a Technical Support Unit (TSU) to facilitate programme learning, built health workers' capacity and provided support for quality control, monitoring and data collection.We sensitized the community to appropriate care-seeking and supported the health care system in implementation. The research team collected data using structured case recording forms. From September 2016 to August 2017, 6185 live births and 601 sick young infants 0-59 days of age with signs of PSBI were identified. Assuming that 25% of births were missed (total births 7731) and 10% of births had an episode of PSBI in the first two months of life, the coverage of appropriate treatment for PSBI was 77.7% (601/773). Of 601 infants with PSBI, fast breathing only (pneumonia) was recorded in 432 (71.9%) infants 7-59 days of age; signs of clinical severe infection (CSI) in 155 (25.8%) and critical illnessin 14 (2.3%). Of the 432 pneumonia cases who received oral amoxicillin treatment without referral, 419 (97.0%) were successfully treated without any deaths. Of 169 sick young infants with either CSI or critical illness, only 110 were referred to a hospital; 83 did not accept referral advice and received outpatient injectable gentamicin plus oral amoxicillin treatment either at a health post or health centre. Additionally, 59 infants who should have been referred, but were not received injectable gentamicin plus oral amoxicillin outpatient treatment. Of infants with CSI, 129 (82.2%) were successfully treated as outpatients, while two died (1.3%). Of 14 infants with critical illness, the caregivers of five accepted referral to a hospital, and nine were treated with simplified antibiotics on an outpatient basis. Two of 14 (14.3%) infants with critical illness died within 14 days of initial presentation. In settings where referral to a hospital is not feasible, young infants with PSBI can be treated on an outpatient basis at either a health post or health centre, which can contribute to saving many lives. Scaling-up will require health system strengthening including community mobilization. Trial is registered on Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials registry (ANZCTR) ACTRN12617001373369.

225,225,225,11478749,"Helicobacter pylori is a serious, chronic, progressive, and transmissible infection associated with a significant morbidity and mortality, which alone emphasizes the priority of developing adequate prophylactic or therapeutic measures. What was previously termed ""asymptomatic H. pylori infection"" is now recognized as a latent infection, and it is now accepted that the presence of an H. pylori infection is an indication for eradication therapy. Successful cure of H. pylori infection requires 2 or more antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance is the major impediment of cure. The ideal duration of therapy is unknown, but in general, 1 week therapy is less effective than longer durations. Compliance is important for the success of treatment; therefore, the favored regimen should have the least side effects. At present, a proton pump inhibitor (or ranitidine bismuth citrate)-clarithromycin triple therapy with either amoxicillin or metronidazole, for at least 10 days is considered first-line therapy. The alternative is quadruple therapy containing a proton pump inhibitor, bismuth, tetracycline, and a higher dose of metronidazole.

227,227,227,33108920,"To gain an overview of the current management of patients with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) in Swiss maternity hospitals. We conducted a survey among all maternity hospitals in Switzerland from January to December 2018, irrespective of their annual birth rate and level of complexity. The survey consisted of an 11-item questionnaire, which was developed to retrieve information relevant to different areas of PPROM management. Of 64 questionnaires distributed by email, 36 (56.3%) centers responded to the survey. Up to 12 different antibiotic regimens were reported. Among these, 91.7% included a beta-lactam, with amoxicillin as the preferred agent (55.6%). Combined antibiotic schemes were used in 30.6% of hospitals. All centers considered the use of corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity if PPROM occurred before 34 weeks, although 36.1% would consider their use until 37 weeks' gestation in the presence of an increased risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Maternity hospitals who accept deliveries at any gestational age usually used magnesium sulfate as fetal neuroprotection when delivering babies <32 weeks, with the exception of two hospitals where it was either not used or only indicated if maternal preeclampsia was present. Concerning the time to delivery, 58.3% centers tended to wait until 37 weeks' gestation, while the others considered that it was not necessary to go beyond 34 weeks. Our survey shows that the current management of PPROM in Switzerland appears to be mostly in line with international recommendations. However, some heterogeneity exists, thus reflecting a lack of international consensus across guidelines, together with the absence of national Swiss guidelines, and this needs to be addressed to ensure high quality care for all patients and neonates.

Reference lists of included studies were searched, alongside the Open Grey database and hand searches in Journal of Dental Research, Journal of Periodontology, Journal of Clinical Periodontology and Journal of Periodontal Research. The editor of each journal was contacted to enquire about relevant accepted and forthcoming articles.Study selection Two independent reviewers screened for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up of at least six months. The main outcome was the change in periodontal pocket depths (PPD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) six months after treatment, where patients were divided according to adjunctive treatment (antimicrobial vs placebo) as well as the pre-treatment detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria.Data extraction and synthesis Data was extracted from all selected papers using a standardised form, including treatment methods, antimicrobial regime and bacterial detection methods. The Cochrane Collaborations tool was used to assess risk of bias. The weighted mean difference (WMD) of treatment effects between bacterial detection groups was obtained and pooled. A two-stage, fixed-effects meta-analysis was performed, and statistical heterogeneity was described using the Q-statistic and I2 index.Results Following the screening of 643 papers and author contact, five placebo-controlled studies were included in the systematic review. All had a low risk of bias. They varied in patient sample sizes, periodontal diagnoses, subgingival debridement protocols, antimicrobial regimes, as well as baseline microbial analysis methods. The meta-analysis of four studies, using amoxicillin and metronidazole as adjuncts, revealed a significant increase in the reduction of PPDs compared to placebo. It also showed no significant difference in the clinical effect on PPDs ≥5 mm when prescribing adjunctive amoxicillin and metronidazole based on the pre-treatment detection of A. actinomycetemcomitans (WMD = 1.16, 95% CI [-5.37, 7.68], I2 = 37.8%).Conclusions Although data on baseline periodontopathogenic bacteria was limited to A. actinomycetemcomitans, this systematic review suggests that there is not enough evidence to support the use of pre-treatment analysis of subgingival bacteria as a criterion for prescribing adjunctive antibiotics.

237,237,237,26089185,"Severe delayed drug-induced skin reactions in children are not common but potentially serious. This article describes aspects concerning the etiology, pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of these processes; it presents three paediatric cases, namely STS (Steven Johnson Syndrome), TEN (toxic epidermal necrolysis), probably related to amoxicillin/clavulanate and ibuprofen and DRESS (a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) secondary to phenytoin; and in relation to them, the diagnosis and the treatment of these processes are discussed and reviewed. The AGEP (acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis) is also reviewed. The aetiological diagnosis of severe non-immediate reactions is difficult, and the value of current allergological testing is not well defined in these cases. Diagnosis is based on clinical history, the empirical risk of drugs to trigger SJS/TEN or DRESS, and the in vivo and in vitro testing of the suspect drug. Skin biopsy confirms that the clinical diagnosis and delayed hypersensitivity tests, especially the patch test and the lymphoblastic transformation test (LTT), may be important to confirm the aetiological diagnosis, in our cases emphasising the latter. These diseases can be life threatening (especially DRESS and TEN) and/or have a high rate of major complications or sequelae (SJS/TEN). The three cases described progressed well without sequelae.

The objective of this study was to develop and validate a sensitive and reliable liquid chromatography with UV detection (LC-UV) method for the simultaneous determination of seven multiclass antibiotic residues (amoxicillin, ampicillin, penicillin, sulfamethoxazole, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and erythromycin) in chicken tissues. The liquid chromatography method with UV detection was optimized for complete separation of the seven selected antibiotic compounds with reversed phase and isocratic elution using Hypersil BDS-C18 (3 µm, 100 mm × 4 mm) column. The mobile phase consisted a ratio of 0.05 M Na All the seven standard compounds were eluted within 14 min. The results for: linearity, precision, sensitivity, accuracy, specificity, decision limit (CCα), detection capability (CCβ), suitability and method robustness were validated according to the criteria of Commission Decision 2002/657/EC guidelines. Calibration plot correlation coefficients ranged from 0.9983 to 0.9998 and the percent relative standard deviations for repeated analysis were below 5% indicating acceptable method precision.

We aimed to evaluate the impact of treatment duration (7 vs 14 days) on successful H. pylori eradication with P-CAB-based triple therapy in Korea, where clarithromycin resistance rate is high. We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients who received first-line treatment for H. pylori infection with tegoprazan-based triple therapy (50 mg tegoprazan + 1000 mg amoxicillin + 500 mg clarithromycin twice daily for 1 or 2 weeks). The primary endpoint was the eradication rate in intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Of the 948 patients included in the study, 435 and 513 received 7-day and 14-day tegoprazan-based triple therapy, respectively.

240,240,240,8032405,"Clinicians all too often face the difficult dilemma of deciding whether a bone fracture in a young child was intentional. A structured expert consensus process suggests that all rib fractures; midshaft or metaphyseal fractures of the humerus; and fractures of the radius, ulna, tibia, or fibula in children younger than 1 year of age are highly likely to have been caused by abuse. Abused children are more likely to have negative social relationships with other children than their school-aged peers. Research on the causes of sudden infant death syndrome is still confounded by the likelihood that some deaths for which the label was misapplied are included in many studies; however, the presence of smokers in the household in the postnatal period appears to be yet another factor associated with increased risk. Congenital syphilis is on the rise. Detection of infants who have been infected is incomplete. Lack of prenatal care is strongly associated with infection. Cord serology is not sensitive enough to detect all possible cases. Testing of both maternal and neonatal sera results in detection of more infants at risk. Current tests still result in the treatment of some infants who are not themselves infected. Amoxicillin clavulante given twice daily rather then thrice, cefixime given once a day, and a single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone have all shown acceptable--though not exceptional--cure rates for otitis media. Price is a consideration. Fewer courses of antibiotics would be necessary if more infants were breastfed.

Eradication was confirmed with (13)C-urea breath test or histology 4 weeks after treatment. Adverse events (AEs) and compliance were evaluated with questionnaires and residual medication count. 338 consecutive patients were randomised. Mean age was 47 years, 60% were women, 22% smokers and 20% had peptic ulcer.

243,243,243,15536782,"That chronic periodontitis is an infectious disease is now firmly established, and the primary role of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis and Treponema denticola is generally accepted. Treatment by mechanical means such as scaling and root planing or surgery generally results in significant clinical improvement but may not arrest the progress or recurrence of disease. Several studies have shown that the probability of achieving lasting stability as measured by the arrest of progressive attachment loss and bone loss by primary mechanical therapy is a function, in major part, of whether pathogenic microorganisms are still present at local subgingival sites at the completion of active therapy. The infecting bacterial species are susceptible to killing by several antibiotics including, among others, tetracycline-class drugs, amoxicillin and metronidazole as well as by local exposure to chlorhexidine. Randomized clinical trials have shown that use of systemically administered antibiotics as an adjunct to mechanical therapies significantly enhances clinical outcomes and stability. Several slow-release devices that deliver anti-microbial drugs directly into periodontal pockets have been developed and are now on the market. Use of these devices permits local delivery of long-lasting, high concentrations of doxycycline (Atridox) minocycline (Arestin), and chlorhexidine (PerioChip) directly into periodontal pockets. Although these devices differ with regard to ease of use, concentration of drug delivered and length of time high drug concentrations can be maintained, randomized clinical trials have shown that their use as an adjunctive treatment to scaling and root planing results in a significantly greater reduction of periodontal pocket depth and an average increase in clinical periodontal attachment level of about 0.8 mm. Gain in clinical attachment is greater in deeper pockets than in shallower pockets. Locally delivered adjunctive anti-microbial therapy is an effective means to enhance therapeutic outcomes.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibiotic resistance patterns of E.coli strains isolated from urine cultures by a meta-analysis in published medical literature between the years of 1996-2012 in Turkey. The study was planned and conducted in accordance with the declaration of PRISMA and describes the methods of literature search, the determining criteria for inclusion and evaluation of articles, data collection and statistical analysis. To find the published series Google Scholar and PubMed international databases were used to access published manuscripts evaluated according to the determined criteria for acceptance and rejection. For each study, general data and antibiotic resistance rates were collected as a common unit. Publications considered as lacking in appropriate content was eliminated from the study. Statistical analysis of the data obtained were 95% confidence intervals, and p≤ 0.05 value was considered as significant difference. A total of 228 articles were found to be published during 1996-2012 period, while 101 of them were included in the meta-analysis according to the eligibility criteria. The analyses indicated that nitrofurantoin and piperacillin resistance rates have been decreased, whereas ciprofloxacin, cefepime, co-trimoxazole and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) positivity rates have been increased during the study period. The increases in the rates of ciprofloxacin and cefepime resistance and and ESBL production were statistically-significant (p< 0.05). A significant reduction in resistance rates for ampicilin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and amikacin was noted in pediatric patients between 2002-2012. Ceftriaxone, imipenem, gentamicin and amikacin resistance were not homogenous between the geographical regions, and statistically significant differences were observed for amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime and ciprofloxacin resistance rates (p< 0.05). Antibiotic resistance rates, except for imipenem, in bacterial strains, isolated from hospitalized patients were found significantly higher in strains obtained from outpatients. The differences between those groups were significant in terms of ampicilin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, amikacin and cefepime resistances (p< 0.05). It has been noted that antibiotic resistance patterns of E.coli strains isolated from urine cultures between 1996-2012 demonstrated significant variability, and many studies were based only on laboratory data. The results of this meta-analysis demonstrated that the resistance rates in commonly-used antibiotics for empirical therapy were high.

249,249,249,31157066,"To study the impact of clinical pharmacist interventions (PIs) on antimicrobial prescriptions in terms of physician acceptance rates, clinical benefits and antimicrobial use/cost outcomes. This study retrospectively analysed the impact of antimicrobial PIs over a 2-year period (October 2012 to October 2014) in a private non-teaching 164-bed hospital without a formal antimicrobial stewardship programme. Excluded from the study were outpatients and patients admitted to the intensive care unit or the emergency department. The PIs focused on appropriate indication and appropriate dosage; drug adverse events, allergies, intolerance and interactions; sequential therapy; therapeutic de-escalation; excessive duration of treatment and therapeutic drug monitoring. Carbapenems and linezolid were classified as special-vigilance drugs. Amoxicillin-clavulanic, piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin were classified as preferred drugs. Clinical benefits evaluated in accordance with internal guidelines, were classified as enhancing appropriate antimicrobial prescription or potentially reducing toxicity. Antimicrobial use and expenditure were compared with that of the previous 2-year period. 386 PIs were implemented in 303 patients. The overall acceptance rate was 83.4%. The acceptance rate for appropriate prescription PIs was significantly lower than for toxicity PIs (73.7% vs 90.9%; p<0.0001). Significant reductions in the use of special-vigilance drugs (from 39.9 (22.2-86.0) to 28.0 (6.0-43.4) defined daily doses (DDD)/1000 patient-days; p=0.0003) were seen and increases in the use of piperacillin-tazobactam (from 13.2 (0-22.9) to 17.2 (6.9-44.8) DDD/1000 patient-days; p=0.007) and of cephalosporins (from 123.5 (61.8-196.6) to 149.1 (80.3-228.2) DDD/1000 patient-days; p=0.027). Overall cost savings were 5.1%. PIs on antimicrobial prescriptions may be effective in enhancing appropriate use of antimicrobials, reducing their toxicity, reducing the use of special-vigilance drugs and reducing overall antimicrobial cost.

These rules are frequently cited in the literature, but much controversy still exists with regards to their use. The pediatric drug dosage was calculated by utilization of the aforementioned rules and using the drugs Paracetamol, Dipyrone, Diclofenac Potassium, Nimesulide, Amoxicillin and Erythromycin, widely employed in Pediatric Dentistry. Weight and body surface areas were considered of children with ages between 1 and 12 years old as well as the dosage for the adult. The pediatric dosages achieved were compared to the predetermined dosages in mg kg-1 herein-named standard dosages. The results were submitted to the parametric test ANOVA and to the Tukey test (p<0,05). The antibiotics and Diclofenac provides acceptable utilization of the rules in pediatric dentistry, however for the Dipyrone, the dosages obtained by the rules suggest their clinical ineffectiveness. For the Paracetamol, the Penna's rule and the BSA formula should not be clinically employed, especially for children between 1 and 5 years old, once such dosages were much close to the hepatotoxic dosage of the drug. It can be concluded that the use of the rules for safe calculation of the pediatric drug dosage is possible and it depends on the used drug and age group.

This cost-effectiveness analysis was based on results shown in a randomized controlled trial conducted in 1995 in patients with a duodenal ulcer (OA group, 46 patients; AMT group, 43 patients) and treated at class grade III A hospitals in Shanghai, China. The costs of treatment in the AMT group were less than those in the OA group for ulcer healing (￥546.25 vs ￥1296.76 per case, P < 0.01), Hp eradication (￥702.32 vs ￥1742.53 per case, P < 0.01), and decreasing ulcer recurrence (￥640.39 vs 1424.54 per case, P < 0.01). Direct costs comprised the major cost involved in treatment of duodenal ulcers. The difference in the cost of treating ulcers in the two groups was primarily due to the costs of the different drugs. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding their direct non-medical costs and indirect costs. When based on therapeutic effectiveness and financial costs, AMT therapy was more cost-efficient than OA therapy. AMT therapy is recommended for its low cost, acceptable ulcer healing rates, ability to cure of an Hp infection, and especially when treating patients with an ulcer < 1 cm in diameter.

253,253,253,18955527,"Rational dosing of antibiotics in neonates should be based on pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters assessed in specific populations. PK studies of neonates are hampered by the limited total plasma volume, which restricts the sample volume and sampling frequency. Available drug assay methods require large sample volumes and are labor-intensive or time-consuming. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid ultra-performance liquid chromatographic method with tandem mass spectrometry detection for simultaneous quantification of amoxicillin, meropenem, cefazolin, cefotaxime, deacetylcefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin in 50 microl of plasma. Cleanup consisted of protein precipitation with cold acetonitrile (1:4) and solvent evaporation before reversed-phase chromatographic separation and detection using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Standard curves were prepared over a large dynamic range with adequate limits of quantitation. Intra- and interrun accuracy and precision were within 100% +/- 15% and 15%, respectively, with acceptable matrix effects. Coefficients of variation for matrix effects and recovery were <10% over six batches of plasma. Stability in plasma and aqueous stocks was generally sufficient, but stability of meropenem and ceftriaxone in extracts could limit autosampler capacity. The instrument run time was approximately 3.50 min per sample. Method applicability was demonstrated with plasma samples from an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-treated neonate. Different beta-lactam antibiotics can be added to this method with additional ion transitions. Using ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, this method allows simple and reliable quantification of multiple antibiotics in 50 microl of plasma for PK studies of neonates.

Hormozgan Province has high rates of H. pylori infection and its related disorders. A total of 100 patients diagnosed with dyspepsia and H. pylori infection as documented by the (13)C-urea breath test (UBT) or rapid urease test (RUT) were treated with the following quadruple regimen: bismuth subcitrate (120 mg, 2 tablets/q12h), amoxicillin (500 mg/q8h), metronidazole (250 mg/q8h) and omeprazole (20 mg/q12h) for a two-week period. Our primary efficacy outcome was H. pylori eradication as established by a negative UBT at least four weeks after the end of treatment. Eradication rates were 79%.and 82.3%, respectively, based on the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. Quadruple therapy had a similar effect in women (81%) and men (83.3%) for the eradication of H. pylori, which was not statistically significant.

Against beta-lactamase non-producing strains of S. aureus and E. coli, the MICs of both drugs were nearly equal, however, against beta-lactamase producing strains of these species and K. pneumoniae, BRL 25000 was superior to AMPC. The blood levels of AMPC and CVA after single oral administration of approximately 15 mg/kg of BRL 25000 granules to fasted children were studied in 3 subjects. The mean levels of AMPC and CVA peaked about 1 hour after administration at values of 11.40 and 5.49 micrograms/ml, respectively, with half-lives of 0.91 and 1.02 hours, and AUCs of 23.52 and 12.66 hr X micrograms/ml, respectively.

Additionally, the genetic variability of Spanish APP isolates has been assessed to decipher antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants, toxin presence, serotype, and phenotype/genotype concordance of AMR. A total of 169 isolates from clinical cases of porcine pleuropneumonia with known antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were sequenced. Additionally, 48 NCBI assemblies were included to perform a phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed high association between phylogenetic clusters, serotypes, and presence of toxins that are associated within vertically integrated systems by its epidemiological link. Concordance between presence of AMR determinants (genotype) vs in-vitro antimicrobial susceptibility pattern (phenotype) was acceptable for amoxicillin, florfenicol, oxytetracycline, and enrofloxacin using epidemiological cut-off values (ECOFFs), but low concordance was observed for doxycycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (T/S). On the other hand, using CLSI clinical breakpoints (CBPs), concordance was acceptable for florfenicol and enrofloxacin and not evaluated for doxycycline, oxytetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (T/S), and amoxicillin because no CBP are available for them.

This is particularly important in the treatment of infants and children, as well as elderly people, who are more sensitive to dosage errors. Previous studies revealed significant dosage inaccuracies with measuring spoons. Oral syringes are therefore generally recommended instead. There is no data on the efficacy of standard cleaning techniques, and consequently on the degree of microbial contamination associated with the repeated use of oral syringes. This study aimed to investigate the level and types of microorganisms found in oral dispensers subjected to simulated in-use conditions. In addition, the dosing accuracy of the oral dispensers is compared with that of measuring spoons supplied and designed for use with specific medications. Exadoral 5 mL oral dispensers from B. Braun Melsungen AG (Melsungen, Germany) were subjected to simulated in-use conditions and microbial assay. Six different liquid medications representing different substance classes were included. The test lasted 4-15 days with two to four doses withdrawn according to dosage recommendations. Dosing accuracy was assessed using six representative amoxicillin suspensions available on the German market after withdrawing 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mL that correspond to ¼, ½ and full measuring spoons. Low counts of Micrococcus luteus, Micrococcus lylae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus chromogenes as well as Bacillus species and Candida lusitaniae may contaminate the interior surface of the oral dispenser, but the microbial count was below the accepted limit of microbial counts permissible for drinking water over the whole test period. Hence, oral dispensers may be considered safe, provided that cleaning procedures are followed exactly. Moreover, oral dispensers, although not specifically designed for the tested medication, showed much higher dosing accuracy in comparison with the specifically designed measuring spoons. The present study revealed that oral dispensers are accurate measuring devices for the safe administration of liquid medication.

A recently sanctioned change in the definition of susceptibility to amoxicillin is helpful in eliminating the paradox for this drug, but it may create further confusion by implying that, on a microgram basis, amoxicillin is substantially more effective than penicillin or third-generation cephalosporins. This article examines definitions of susceptibility and resistance of pneumococci, highlighting areas that have led to confusion and proposing a new way of understanding them.

The purpose of this pilot study was to determine whether peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF) can be used to detect early changes around implants placed with one-stage surgical protocol following 1 week of healing. Twenty subjects (11 males and nine females; aged 22 to 72 years; two smokers) were included. Exclusion criteria were allergies to amoxicillin and systemic conditions that may affect healing. Subjects had a healthy periodontium and needed a single implant; eight received antibiotic prophylaxis, and 12 served as controls. Clinical healing was evaluated with plaque and gingival indices (PI and GI, respectively). Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) from the surgical site was obtained prior to the surgery, whereas PICF was collected at the 1-week visit. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine GCF/PICF interleukin (IL)-1beta and -8 concentrations. Peripheral blood and GCF antibiotic levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Postoperative PI and GI were slightly increased. Total GCF and PICF volumes did not show a significant difference between appointments. There was an increase in PICF IL-1beta and -8 levels at 1 week postoperatively. Mean amoxicillin serum concentration was 5.1 +/- 2 microg/ml at 1 to 4 hours following the initial dose, whereas GCF amoxicillin levels were below the limit of detection. Antibiotic prophylaxis had a modest effect on clinical indices (PI and GI) and no appreciable effect on biomarkers. PICF content can be studied as early as 1 week following one-stage implant placement. The results raise doubts regarding the clinical usefulness of amoxicillin prophylaxis.

268,268,268,32287262,"Neonatal sepsis is a leading cause of mortality, yet the recommended inpatient treatment options are inaccessible to most families in low-income settings. In 2015, the World Health Organization released a guideline for outpatient treatment of young infants (0-59 days of age) with possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) with simplified antibiotic regimens when referral was not feasible. If implemented widely, this guideline could prevent many deaths. Our implementation research evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of implementing the WHO guideline through the existing health system in Malawi. A prospective cohort study was conducted in 12 first-level health facilities in Ntcheu district. Trained health workers identified and treated young infants with PSBI signs with injection gentamicin for 2 days and oral amoxicillin for 7 days, whereas those with only fast breathing were treated with oral amoxicillin for 7 days. Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) were trained to promote care-seeking and to conduct home visits on day 3 and 6 to assess infants under treatment, encourage treatment adherence and remind the caregiver to return for facility follow up. Infants receiving outpatient treatment were followed up at health facility on day 4 and 8. The primary outcome was proportion of outpatient cases completing treatment per protocol. A total of 358 infants received outpatient treatment (202 clinical severe infection, 156 only fast breathing) from February to September 2017. Of these, 92.7% (332/358) met criteria for treatment completion and 88.8% (318/358) completed the day 4 follow-up. Twelve (3.4%) young infants clinically failed treatment with no reported deaths in those treated at outpatient level. This treatment failure rate was lower than those reported for the simplified regimens tested in the SATT (8-10%) and AFRINEST (5-8%) equivalency trials. More than half of infants (58.1%; 208/358) received HSA follow-up visits on days 3 and 6.

270,270,270,33544712,"Neonatal bacterial infections are a common cause of death, which can be managed well with inpatient treatment. Unfortunately, many families in low resource settings do not accept referral to a hospital. The World Health Organization (WHO) developed a guideline for management of young infants up to 2 months of age with possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) when referral is not feasible. Government of Ethiopia with WHO evaluated the feasibility of implementing this guideline to increase coverage of treatment. The objective of this study was to implement a simplified antibiotic regimen (2 days gentamicin injection and 7 days oral amoxicillin) for management of sick young infants with PSBI in a programme setting when referral was not feasible to identify at least 80% of PSBI cases, achieve an overall adequate treatment coverage of at least 80% and document the challenges and opportunities for implementation at the community level in two districts in Tigray, Ethiopia. Using implementation research, we applied the PSBI guideline in a programme setting from January 2016 to August 2017 in Raya Alamata and Raya Azebo Woredas (districts) in Southern Tigray, Ethiopia with a population of 260884. Policy dialogue was held with decision-makers, programme implementers and stakeholders at federal, regional and district levels, and a Technical Support Unit (TSU) was established. Health Extension Workers (HEWs) working at the health posts and supervisors working at the health centres were trained in WHO guideline to manage sick young infants when referral was not feasible. Communities were sensitized towards appropriate home care. We identified 854 young infants with any sign of PSBI in the study population of 7857 live births. The expected live births during the study period were 9821. Assuming 10% of neonates will have any sign of PSBI within the first 2 months of life (n = 982), the coverage of appropriate treatment of PSBI cases in our study area was 87% (854/982). Of the 854 sick young infants, 333 (39%) were taken directly to a hospital and 521 (61%) were identified by HEW at health posts. Of the 521 young infants, 27 (5.2%) had signs of critical illness, 181 (34.7%) had signs of clinical severe infection, whereas 313 (60.1%) young infants 7-59 days of age had only fast breathing pneumonia. All young infants with critical illness accepted referral to a hospital, while 117/181 (64.6%) infants with clinical severe infection accepted referral. Families of 64 (35.3%) infants with clinical severe infection refused referral and were treated at the health post with injectable gentamicin for 2 days plus oral amoxicillin for 7 days. All 64 completed recommended gentamicin doses and 63/64 (98%) completed recommended amoxicillin doses. Of 313 young infants, 7-59 days with pneumonia who were treated by the HEWs without referral with oral amoxicillin for 7 days, 310 (99%) received all 14 doses. No deaths were reported among those treated on an outpatient basis at health posts. But 35/477 (7%) deaths occurred among young infants treated at hospital. When referral is not feasible, young infants with PSBI can be managed appropriately at health posts by HEWs in the existing health system in Ethiopia with high coverage, low treatment failure and a low case fatality rate. Moreover, fast breathing pneumonia in infants 7-59 days of age can be successfully treated at the health post without referral. Relatively higher mortality in sick young infants at the referral level health facilities warrants further investigation.

271,271,271,20027983,"A first urinary tract infection (UTI) in childhood is more prevalent in females < 5-years-old. Circumcision generally protects males from UTI, however, during the month following the procedure, the prevalence of infection increases up to 12 times in circumcised boys when compared with those not circumcised. Almost all the infections are caused by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria of which E. coli are responsible for 70-90% of the cases. Signs and symptoms of UTI vary in different age groups. Factors associated with the likelihood of UTI are: non-circumcised male, fever > 40 degrees C, and a fever > 39 degrees C for more than 48 hours with no other focus of infection on physical examination. Urinalysis and urine microscopy are screening tests for UTI. In children with clinical symptoms and signs suggesting UTI, the results of these tests have a positive predictive value (if both are positive), or negative predictive value (if both are negative) approximating 100%. The definitive diagnosis of UTI is based on the urine culture. Bag urine culture is associated with a very high rate of contamination. Therefore, in non-toilet trained children, urine culture should be obtained directly from the urinary bladder either by supra pubic aspiration or in and out transurethral catheterization. Mid stream clean voided urine specimens obtained from circumcised males in the first months of life are also acceptable. Depending on the clinical presentation, oral therapy can begin from as early as two months of age, and the recommended empiric drugs for first febrile UTI are cefuroxime axetil, or amoxicillin clavulanate.

The general antibiotic treatments are not always indicated but when they are, they must take into account the resistance of two main species of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes), the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamic parameters and the severity and type of infection. Two situations should be treated by topical treatements: limited impetigo and furonculosis. The two topical antibiotics used preferentially are mupirocine and fucidic acid. Soon, a third topical antibiotic, reptamuline will complete these.

279,279,279,24565898,"Covalent TiO(2)-co-pectin microspheres containing Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles were developed through an ultrasound-induced crosslinking/polymerization reaction between the glycidyl methacrylate from vinyl groups in TiO(2) and in pectin. ζ-potentials became less negative in the nanostructured microspheres, caused by the presence of both inorganic particles in the negatively charged pectin. The nanostructured pectin microspheres showed an amoxicillin release rate slower than that of pure pectin microspheres. The proposed microspheres were found to be a sustained release system of amoxicillin in the acid medium. Furthermore, the antibiotic release may be modulated by exposition of the microspheres to a remote magnetic field. In practical terms, the nanostructured microspheres could deliver a larger proportion of their initial load to specific site of action. The cytotoxic concentrations for 50% of VERO cells (CC(50)), calculated as the concentration required to reduce cell viability by 50% after 72h of incubation, for pectin-only microspheres and nanostructured pectin microspheres were 217.7±6.5 and 121.5±4.9μgmL(-1), respectively. The obtained CC(50) values indicated acceptable cytotoxic levels for an incubation period of 72h, showing that the pectin microspheres have a great pharmacological potential for uses in biological environments, even after the introduction of both Fe(3)O(4) and TiO(2).

Dental procedures may lead to IE in high-risk patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the knowledge of general dentists and dental students concerning the prevention of IE in Hamadan, Iran. In this cross-sectional study, the awareness of general dentists and dentistry students concerning the prevention of IE was evaluated during 2010. A questionnaire was prepared and administered to 58 final-year dental students and 96 general dental practitioners in Hamadan. A total of 154 persons completed the questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of some demographic questions and questions about awareness of IE in three sections. The gathered data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics, Pearson's chi-square test, Mann-Whitney test, and independent t-tests. The gathered data showed that dentistry students answered the questions about awareness of the prevention of IE more correctly than did general dentists. The overall knowledge of endocarditis prophylaxis among students and dentists was about 65% and 56%, respectively. The students' knowledge was better because 94.9% of the students had desired (acceptable) and relatively desired knowledge; this result for dentists, however, was 82.3%. In our study, the overall awareness level of the study population was moderate. Dentist and students believed that patients with prosthetic valves and previous IE were the most common cardiac disease cases that required prophylaxis. The most common prophylactic regimen was in accordance with the guidelines of the American Heart Association and was a single dose of 2 g amoxicillin 1 hour before treatment. The results indicated that gender had no effect on the level of knowledge; however, there was a statistically significant relationship between age and level of knowledge.

We report the case of a 58-year-old man, who presented to surgery department A of the Charles Nicolle hospital, complaining of a wide inflammatory lesion in the anterior abdominal wall evolving for two weeks. Patient's anamnestic data included smoking, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus with poor compliance. The patient underwent flattening with excision of necrotic tissues and surgical drainage using a DELBET blade. Empirical antibiotic therapy with imipenem 1gx3/d, teicoplanin 400 mg 1 inj x2/d and gentamicin 400 mg 1 inj/d was administered pending bacteriological results. The bacteriological examination of a sample of necrotic tissue, after 72 h of incubation at 37 °C in anaerobic atmosphere, was able to detect a Gram-negative coccus, that the VITEK2 ANC system identified as Actinomyces canis with an accuracy of 80%. Whole genome sequencing was subsequently performed, that identified Acidaminococcus sp. AM33-14BH and demonstrated the following resistance genes: cfxa, tet(X) and tet(Q). An antibiogram for anaerobes was performed showing that the strain was resistant to amoxicillin but sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin-tazobactam, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem and rifampin.

283,283,283,18416582,"As with other bacterial infections, successful treatment of Helicobacter pylori infections depends on the use of antibacterial agents to which the organism is susceptible. In this article, we use the proposed report card grading scheme (i.e. grade A, B, C, D, F) for the outcome of clinical trials, where intention-to-treat cure rates >95% = A, 90-95% = B, 85-89% = C, 81-84% = D and <81% = F. The goal of therapy is to consistently cure >95% of patients (e.g. provide grade A results). Like tuberculosis, H. pylori infections are difficult to cure and successful treatment generally requires the administration of several antibacterial agents simultaneously. Duration of therapy is also important and depends upon whether resistance is present; 14 days is often best. With few exceptions, worldwide increasing macrolide resistance now undermines the effectiveness of the legacy triple therapy (e.g. a proton pump inhibitor [PPI], clarithromycin and amoxicillin) and, in most areas, cure rates have declined to unacceptable levels (e.g. grade F). The development of sequential therapy was one response to this problem. Sequential therapy has repeatedly been shown in head-to-head studies to be superior to legacy triple therapy. Sequential therapy, as originally described, is the sequential administration of a dual therapy (a PPI plus amoxicillin) followed by a Bazzoli-type triple therapy (a PPI plus clarithromycin and tinidazole) and has been shown to be especially useful where there is clarithromycin resistance. However, the cure rates of the original sequential treatment are grade B and can probably be further improved by changes in dose, duration or administration, such as by continuing the amoxicillin into the triple therapy arm. The sequential approach may also be more complicated than necessary, based on the fact that the same four drugs have also been given concomitantly (at least nine publications with >700 patients) as a quadruple therapy with excellent success. This article discusses the approach to therapy in the modern era where antimicrobial resistance is an increasing problem and legacy triple therapy is no longer an acceptable initial choice. Methods to achieve acceptable eradication rates (e.g. grade A or B results) are discussed and, specifically, sequential therapy is considered both conceptually and practically. Suggestions are provided regarding how sequential therapy might be improved to become a grade A therapy as well as how to identify situations where it can be expected to yield unacceptable results. New uses for current drugs are discussed and suggestions for subsequent randomized comparisons to overcome phenotypic and genotypic resistance are given. We propose a change in focus from comparative studies (designed to prove that a new therapy is superior to a known inferior therapy) to demanding that efficacious therapies meet or exceed a pre-specified level of success (i.e. grade A or B result). To do so, coupled with less concern about the effect of recommendations on the pharmaceutical industry, should provide clinicians with much higher quality information, and improve the quality of medical care and recommendations regarding treatment. Ultimately, there is little or no justification for comparative testing that includes an arm with known unacceptably low results. H. pylori gastritis is an infectious disease and should be approached and treated as such.

A Technical Support Unit supported the programme to operationalize guidelines, built capacity of health workers through training, monitored their clinical skills, mentored them and assured quality. The community-based health workers visited households to identify sick infants and referred them to the nearest BHU for further management. The research team collected data. Of 17 600 identified livebirths, 1860 young infants with any sign of PSBI sought care at BHUs and 1113 (59.8%) were brought by families.

285,285,285,7792129,"Most authorities continue to recommend penicillin as the treatment of choice for group A streptococcal pharyngitis. If penicillin is used, 10 days of treatment are necessary to achieve a clinical and bacteriologic cure. The usually recommended penicillin V dose is 250 mg (400,000 IU) three times daily. Twice daily dosing is acceptable to some authorities if compliance is good. However, oral penicillin fails to eradicate group A streptococci from the pharynx in up to 17% of cases; in some studies 30% failure rates have been reported. Several European and United States studies indicate that a variety of oral cephalosporins, when used for 10 days, are significantly superior to penicillin V in eradicating group A streptococci from the pharynx. For example cefpodoxime proxetil given twice daily for 10 days is comparable to penicillin V given three times daily for 10 days in achieving a clinical cure and appears to be significantly superior to penicillin in eradicating group A streptococci from the pharynx. Preliminary studies from Europe and the United States strongly suggest that 5-day therapy with cefpodoxime (or other selected oral cephalosporins) is at least as effective, clinically and microbiologically, as 10-day therapy with penicillin V. Further clinical trials are warranted to confirm the adequacy of 5-day treatment and to assess the efficacy of cefpodoxime and other agents in preventing rheumatic fever.

The antibiotic consumption was low from an international perspective. The resistance to the antibiotics was lower than expected from patient sample studies, especially for clarithromycin, most probably due to a restrictive prescription policy in the area.

Recent studies have also suggested an association between H. pylori infection and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). In this study, an H. pylori eradication treatment was administered to 20 ITP patients and elucidated for its effectiveness. Among those 20 patients, H. pylori infection was confirmed in 17 (85%) through a C14 urea breath test, a rapid urease test, or a culture examination of a biopsied sample obtained by gastrointestinal endoscopy. Although the other 3 were negative to H. pylori, the H. pylori eradication treatment was also attempted because no other effective treatments had been established at the time of this study. In the H. pylori eradication treatment, lansoprazole (LPZ) 60 mg bid, amoxicillin (AMPC) 1500 mg bid, and clarithromycin (CAM) 400 mg bid were given to each patient for 7 days. For 4 cases, CAM was replaced with metronidazole (MNZ) 750 mg bid. The patients whose H. pylori infection was not eradicated after the first treatment received the re-eradication treatment with LPZ 60 mg bid, AMPC 1500 mg bid, and MNZ 750 mg bid for 7 days. After the treatments, the success of eradicating H. pylori was confirmed in all 17 H. pylori positive patients. In addition, platelet recovery was obtained in 11/20 patients (55%), which included 2 H. pylori negative patients and 2 patients whose H. pylori eradication was not successful after the first treatment. No relationship was found between the eradication effectiveness and the following clinical parameters: age, gender, previous therapies, disease duration, presence of anti-nucleus antibody, endoscopic atrophic change in the stomach, or kinds of antibiotics used for the treatment. These results support the efficacy of an H. pylori eradication treatment for ITP patients. A noteworthy result of this study was that an increase of platelet count was observed not only in H. pylori positive ITP patients, but also in 2 out of 3 H. pylori negative ITP patients after H. pylori eradication.

There is a paucity of data comparing these methods using the same clinical isolates in eastern and north-eastern parts of India. The present study was designed to compare the capacity of six phenotypic methods to detect ESBLs in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. A total of 206 non-duplicate clini-cal isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, obtained over a period of six months (July to December, 2012), were tested by the Vitek 2, double disk synergy tests (30 mm, 20 mm, and modified method), combined disk test, and ESBL Etest to evaluate their ability to detect ESBLs. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) by the agar dilution method was used as the reference method. The reference method detected ESBLs in 57 (27.7%) isolates. Among the six methods, the combined disk test demonstrated an overall agreement of 100% with the MIC. The Vitek 2 showed a sensitivity and specificity of 91.8% and 97.24%, respectively, with a positive predictive value of 93.33%. The sensitivities of the conventional methods ranged from 83% to 94%. The highest sensitivity and specificity were shown by combined disk (93.44%) and double disk synergy (100%) techniques, respectively. In our setting, Vitek 2 showed an acceptable capacity to detect ESBL isolates as it improved the turnover time (6 to 8 hours) in comparison to conventional phenotypic methods, which took a minimum of 24 hours. However, the combined disk test achieved the highest sensitivity.

294,294,294,31060997,"This study aims at evaluating the mean eradication rate by a systematic compilation of the studies which involved the standard triple therapy (STT) in first-line Helicobacter pylori (Hp) eradication in Turkey over a period of 10 years between 2004 and 2013 using the meta-analysis method. The systematic compilation and meta-analysis were carried out according to the PRISMA standards defined in the Cochrane handbook. The results of full-text studies published in national and international journals in English and Turkish languages on Turkish population in a period of 10 years, from 2004 to 2013, are included in this study. The studies include open-label trials, controlled trials, treatment arms, and case series that included a triple therapy regimen consisting of standard doses of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI; omeprazole 20 mg BID, lansoprazole 30 mg BID, pantoprazole 40 mg BID, esomeprazole 40 mg BID, or rabeprazole 20 mg BID) along with clarithromycin 500 mg BID and amoxicillin 1 g BID for 7-14 days. They were scanned electronically via the search engines Google Scholar, PubMed, and the Turkish Medicine Index using specific keywords. The related keywords used were Turkey, Helicobacter pylori, infection, standard triple treatment, first-line therapy, eradication, omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, esomeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin. Studies carried out with adults were included in the evaluation. The publication year of the studies and the included number of patients, their age, gender, treatment duration (7, 10, and 14 days), and PPIs used were evaluated by two separate gastroenterologists and biostatisticians. Studies that used at least one reliable method (histology, urea breath test (UBT), or Helicobacter pylori stool antigen (HpSA) test) four weeks after completing the treatment for the control of Hp eradication were included. Only naive patients were accepted, and patients who had previously received eradication treatment were excluded. The effectiveness of the Hp eradication was analyzed using an intention-to-treat (ITT) or per-protocol (PP) analysis. The STT regime of 45 studies complying with the inclusion criteria was evaluated. A total of 3715 patients were included in the study. Of the 3010 patients whose gender information was available, 55% were women and 45% were men; the weighted age average given explicitly in the studies was 42.14±0.67. The treatment lasted for 14 days in 42 studies, for 7 days in six studies, and for 10 days in 1 study. The eradication rates evaluated according to the ITT and PP analyses were 60% (95% CI: 56%-63%) and 57% (95% CI: 51%-62%), respectively. The rates for 7 days of treatment were 57% (95% CI: 46%-68%) and 60% (95% CI: 51%-67%) and for 14 days of treatment were 60% (95% CI: 56%-63%) and 56% (95% CI: 50%-62%), respectively. The ITT eradication rate of the only 10-day study was 78% (95% CI: 66%-86%). In the meta-regression analysis, the treatment duration, PPI, age, and gender ratio (women/men) used for the ITT analysis had no effect. The gender ratio and age were not considered in this analysis because they were not clearly stated in studies using the PP analysis. The duration of treatment and the PPI used had no effect. A systematic meta-analysis of studies conducted during the period 2004-2013 in Turkey revealed that the rate of first-line Hp eradication using STT was unacceptably low, and the duration of treatment and PPI used made no difference.

296,296,296,20100746,"Observation without initial antibiotic therapy was accepted as an option for acute otitis media (AOM) management in the 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians clinical practice guideline. The guideline also recommended amoxicillin as the first-line treatment for most children, and analgesic treatment to reduce pain if it was present. Our objective was to compare the management of AOM after publication of the 2004 guideline. We analyzed the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 2002-2006 (N = 1114), which occurred in US physicians' offices. The patients were children aged 6 months to 12 years who were diagnosed with AOM. The time comparisons were the 30-month periods before and after the guideline. The main outcome was the encounter rate at which no antibiotic-prescribing was reported. Secondary outcomes were the identification of factors associated with encounters at which no antibiotic-prescribing was reported and antibiotic- and analgesic-prescribing rates. The rate of AOM encounters at which no antibiotic-prescribing was reported did not change after guideline publication (11%-16%; P = .103). Independent predictors of an encounter at which no antibiotic-prescribing was reported were the absence of ear pain, absence of reported fever, and receipt of an analgesic prescription. After guideline publication, the rate of amoxicillin-prescribing increased (40%-49%; P = .039), the rate of amoxicillin/clavulanate-prescribing decreased (23%-16%; P = .043), the rate of cefdinir-prescribing increased (7%-14%; P = .004), and the rate of analgesic-prescribing increased (14%-24%; P = .038). Although management of AOM without antibiotics has not increased after the publication of the 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians clinical practice guideline, children who did not receive antibiotics were more likely to have mild infections. In accordance with the guideline, the prescribing of amoxicillin and analgesics has increased.

In order to examine community perceptions and acceptability of iCCM, post-intervention focus groups and key respondent interviews involving caregivers, health workers, CHWs and local leaders were carried out by experienced facilitators using semi-structured interview guides. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis techniques. Respondents reported increased access to health care for children as a result of iCCM. Access was reportedly closer to home, available more hours in a day, and the availability of CHWs was perceived as more reliable. CHW care was reported to be trustworthy and caring. Families reported saving money especially due to reduced transportation costs, and less time away from home. Respondents also perceived better health outcomes.

Neutropenia was expected to be present for no more than 10 days in these patients, and they had to have no other underlying conditions. Patients were assigned to receive either oral ciprofloxacin plus amoxicillin-clavulanate or intravenous ceftazidime. They were hospitalized until fever and neutropenia resolved. A total of 116 episodes were included in each group (84 patients in the oral-therapy group and 79 patients in the intravenous-therapy group). The mean neutrophil counts at admission were 81 per cubic millimeter and 84 per cubic millimeter, respectively; the mean duration of neutropenia was 3.4 and 3.8 days, respectively. Treatment was successful without the need for modifications in 71 percent of episodes in the oral-therapy group and 67 percent of episodes in the intravenous-therapy group (difference between groups, 3 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -8 percent to 15 percent; P=0.48). Treatment was considered to have failed because of the need for modifications in the regimen in 13 percent and 32 percent of episodes, respectively (P<0.001) and because of the patient's inability to tolerate the regimen in 16 percent and 1 percent of episodes, respectively (P<0.001).

In both arms, volunteers and government-employed Health Extension Workers (HEWs) conducted home visits to pregnant and newly delivered mothers; assessed newborns; and counseled caregivers on prevention of newborn illness, danger signs, and care seeking. Volunteers referred sick newborns to health posts for further assessment; HEWs referred newborns with PSBI signs to health centers.

318,318,318,39378891,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Escherichia coli is a global problem associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. AMR-associated genes are typically annotated based on similarity to variants in a curated reference database, with the implicit assumption that uncatalogued genetic variation within these is phenotypically unimportant. In this study, we evaluated the performance of the AMRFinder tool and, subsequently, the potential for discovering new AMR-associated gene families and characterising variation within existing ones to improve genotype-to-susceptibility phenotype predictions in E coli. In this cross-sectional study of international genome sequence data, we assembled a global dataset of 9001 E coli sequences from five publicly available data collections predominantly deriving from human bloodstream infections from: Norway, Oxfordshire (UK), Thailand, the UK, and Sweden. 8555 of these sequences had linked antibiotic susceptibility data. Raw reads were assembled using Shovill and AMR genes (relevant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and trimethoprim) extracted using the National Center for Biotechnology Information AMRFinder tool (using both default and strict [100%] coverage and identity filters). We assessed the predictive value of the presence of these genes for predicting resistance or susceptibility against US Food and Drug Administration thresholds for major and very major errors. Mash was used to calculate the similarity between extracted genes using Jaccard distances. We empirically reclustered extracted gene sequences into AMR-associated gene families (≥70% match) and antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs; 100% match) and categorised these according to their frequency in the dataset. Accumulation curves were simulated and correlations between gene frequency in the Oxfordshire and other datasets calculated using the Spearman coefficient. Firth regression was used to model the association between the presence of bla The performance of the AMRFinder database for genotype-to-phenotype predictions using strict 100% identity and coverage thresholds did not meet US Food and Drug Administration thresholds for any of the seven antibiotics evaluated. Relaxing filters to default settings improved sensitivity with a specificity cost. For all antibiotics, most explainable resistance was associated with the presence of a small number of genes. There was a proportion of resistance that could not be explained by known ARGs; this ranged from 75·1% for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid to 3·4% for ciprofloxacin. Only 18 199 (51·5%) of the 35 343 ARGs detected had a 100% identity and coverage match in the AMRFinder database. After empirically reclassifying genes at 100% nucleotide sequence identity, we identified 1042 unique ARGs, of which 126 (12·1%) were present ten times or more, 313 (30·0%) were present between two and nine times, and 603 (57·9%) were present only once. Simulated accumulation curves revealed that discovery of new (100% match) ARGs present more than once in the dataset plateaued relatively quickly, whereas new singleton ARGs were discovered even after many thousands of isolates had been included. We identified a strong correlation (Spearman coefficient 0·76 [95% CI 0·73-0·80], p<0·0001) between the number of times an ARG was observed in Oxfordshire and the number of times it was seen internationally, with ARGs that were observed six times in Oxfordshire always being found elsewhere. Finally, using the example of bla We highlight substantial uncatalogued genetic variation with respect to known ARGs, although a relatively small proportion of these alleles are repeatedly observed in a large international dataset suggesting strong selection pressures. The current approach of using fuzzy matching for ARG detection, ignoring the unknown effects of uncatalogued variation, is unlikely to be acceptable for future clinical deployment. The association of synonymous mutations with potentially important phenotypic differences suggests that relying solely on amino acid-based gene detection to predict resistance is unlikely to be sufficient. Finally, the inability to explain all resistance using existing knowledge highlights the importance of new target gene discovery.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the H. pylori eradication rate in patients resistant to standard therapies when treated with a triple therapy of pantoprazole, rifabutin and amoxicillin. Ninety-two consecutive patients diagnosed with H. pylori infection resistant to two previous treatment regimens were treated with pantoprazole, rifabutin and amoxicillin for 10 days. The persistence or eradication of H. pylori was determined by a 13C-urea breath test performed 4 weeks after the treatment. Per protocol eradication was achieved in 62.2% of patients and the intention-to-treat eradication was 60.8%. Only two patients were excluded for adverse events related to the treatment. The eradication rate is acceptable as a third-line therapy, particularly in centers with high cure rate for first line therapy. Another important value of this study is the good tolerance for the treatment observed in our patients. It is possible that rifabutin-based triple therapy may be of use in hospital centers that do not have disposable culture and susceptibility methods against H. pylori.

323,323,323,21965436,"Antibiotic resistance is directly related to the loss of efficacy of currently accepted Helicobacter pylori therapies. Knowledge of the antibiotic susceptibility in a local area can contribute to the design of specific 'à la carte' treatments. The aim of this study was to analyse the susceptibility of H. pylori isolates to six conventional antibiotics currently used in a northern region of Spain. Seventy-one isolates were obtained from gastric biopsies of 76 consecutive adult patients suffering from peptic ulcer disease, dyspepsia or familial gastric cancer and known to be infected with H. pylori by conventional methods. Susceptibility testing was performed for amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, clarithromycin, metronidazole and tetracycline using the Etest method. The prevalence rates of resistance were as follows: amoxicillin, 1.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.0-7.6]; clarithromycin, 14.7% (95% CI 7.3-25.4); ciprofloxacin, 14.3% (95% CI 7.1-24.7); levofloxacin, 14.5% (95% CI 7.2-25.0); metronidazole, 45.1% (95% CI 33.2-57.3); and tetracycline, 0% (95% CI 0.0-5.1). Our study confirms an increasing rate of resistance to levofloxacin that equals that of clarithromycin in our healthcare area. This fact may reflect a wide and indiscriminate use of the former antibiotic and could account for a loss of clinical effectiveness of levofloxacin-containing regimens. Moreover, clarithromycin resistance rates remain stable, which could allow us to maintain its use in our area.

324,324,324,30159072,"Rosacea is a common, chronic disorder that can present with a variety of cutaneous or ocular manifestations. Skin involvement primarily affects the central face, with findings such as persistent centrofacial redness, papules, pustules, flushing, telangiectasia, and phymatous skin changes. The pathways that lead to the development of rosacea are not well understood. The relationship of pyoderma faciale (also known as rosacea fulminans) to rosacea also is uncertain. We aimed to write this article with the aim of showing how a pregnant patient who has been aggravated by the degree of lesions on the face during the first trimester of pregnancy is treated and to show what is in the literature in this issue. A 22-year-old woman complained of painful erythema, papules and pustules on the face. She had fever and malaise during the sixth week of her first pregnancy and a history of the mild eruption and seborrhea before her pregnancy with flaring over the preceding 4 weeks. Dermatologic examination revealed red erythema of all involved facial areas; the lesions consisted of papules, pustules and nodules. The case was diagnosed as rosacea fulminans (pyoderma faciale) by these findings. In the literature, there are some effective therapeutic options such as retinoids, tetracyclines, antiandrogenic contraceptives, and dapsone and these were not used because they are contraindicated in pregnancy. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 1 gr/day, wet compresses, and a fusidic acid cream were started. After the activity of the disease had been suppressed for 10 days, antibiotic was stopped, and the other treatment options were applied topically for the next month. One month after cessation of treatment, the lesions had disappeared with only mild erythema remaining. There was minimally flushing on the face and no telangiectasia. In conclusion, there is no substantial evidence as to the mechanism by which pregnancy may trigger this conditioner whether the gender of the fetus influences the development of rosacea fulminans, but is generally accepted that hormonal changes in pregnancy play an important role. The pathogenesis of rosacea fulminans remains uncertain, but it is obvious that the further basic and clinical research is required to optimise the management of this rare facial dermatosis.

Thus, we have analyzed TD management conducted by local health professionals. Practicing physicians recommended to tourists in Goa (India), Mombasa (Kenya), and Phuket (Thailand) were invited to participate in a cross-sectional questionnaire survey. Three TD case descriptions were presented, and suggested diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were analyzed. In each of the three locations, approximately 20 physicians (59 in total, response rate 95%) completed the questionnaires. Oral rehydration was proposed by more than 80% of the physicians for mild cases of TD and for TD with vomiting, while 73% of them would have treated febrile TD patients orally and 17% would have used intravenous (IV) fluids. Antimicrobials, primarily fluoroquinolones, would have been prescribed for 61, 73, and 95%, respectively, of these three cases. Cephalosporins, aminoglycosides (usually IV gentamicin), IV amoxicillin, and once co-trimoxazole were recommended. Many medical doctors added nitroimidazole to the antibiotic therapy. Multiple symptomatic drugs would have been prescribed. The rate of invasive procedures (infusions, injections, and diagnostic venipuncture) would have ranged from 20% to 86% in the scenarios of the different patients. Mainly practitioners who owned a clinic would have hospitalized patients with TD. Many physicians in destination countries treat TD patients similarly to the treatments prescribed in the ""Western world."" A minority uses obsolete antimicrobials. Polypharmacy and the high rate of invasive procedures with a theoretical risk of nosocomial infection are of concern.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether weight, height, or age bands can be created that would lead to greater than 95% of children receiving a therapeutic dose of 6 commonly prescribed essential drugs, including paracetamol, iron sulfate, amoxicillin, co-trimoxazole (i.e., trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole), ciprofloxacin, and co-artemether (i.e., artemether/lumefantrine). Using World Health Organization growth standards, we created 4 weight bands and then matched them to height and age 50th percentile growth curves. The resulting weight, height, and age bands were then applied to Ugandan and Bangladeshi anthropometric data sets, and the percentage of children who would have received a correct therapeutic dose based upon weight, height, or age was determined. This percentage was interpreted as acceptable if >95%, marginal if 90% to 95% and unacceptable if <90%. Applying the 4 weight bands to the 6 selected drugs, greater than 95% of children would have received an acceptable therapeutic dose across the 4 weight bands for each of the 6 drugs tested. None of the drugs tested would deliver an acceptable therapeutic dose across all bands based upon height or age among Ugandan children, and only co-trimoxazole would have been delivered at acceptable therapeutic levels based upon these bands in Bangladeshi children. For the 6 drugs tested, dispersible tablets prescribed on the basis of a 4-dose regimen determined by weight bands would deliver an acceptable therapeutic dose greater than 95% of the time.

Based on evidence-based medicine, epidemiology, clinical medicine, evidence-based pharmacy, pharmacoeconomics, and health technology evalua-tion(HTA), the clinical value of Reyanning Mixture was evaluated using multi-criteria decision analysis(MCDA) model, Chinese patent medicine clinical evidence, and value evaluation software(CSC v2.0). The SRS monitoring data, Meta-analysis, and other safety evidence showed that the main adverse reactions of Reyanning Mixture were nausea, diarrhea, and rash, and no serious adverse reactions were found. The pharmacovigilance system was sound, and the system was perfect. There was no recall, notification, or interview for unqualified products. Based on the existing research, the evidence was sufficient, and the risk was controllable. Hence, its safety was grade A. Meta-analysis showed that in the treatment of acute upper respiratory tract infection, Reyanning Mixture combined with Amoxicillin Capsules was better than Amoxicillin Capsules alone in shortening the complete fever relief time and improving the cure rate. Besides, it was superior to Shuanghuanglian Granules in shortening the complete fever relief time, cough relief time, nasal congestion relief time, and pharyngeal congestion relief time. The Meta-analysis was conducted based on AMSTAR standard, and its ove-rall quality was proved good. The evidence quality in GRADE system evaluation was medium and low. The quality of evidence was medium, and the clinical value was obvious. Hence, its effectiveness was grade A. The results of pharmacoeconomic research showed that compared with Amoxicillin Capsules, Reyanning Mixture alone or in combination with Amoxicillin Capsules had cost-effectiveness advantages in the treatment of acute upper respiratory tract infection, and the results were stable in sensitivity analysis. According to the CASP economic evaluation checklist, the research problems were clear and the results were reliable. As revealed by the comprehensive evaluation, the evidence quality was sufficient and the result was clear. Its economy was grade B. Reyanning Mixture had multiple therapeutic targets like anti-virus, anti-bacteria, antipyresis, and anti-cough, with good clinical innovation. There were many innovative initiatives in ensuring drug supply, especially at the grass roots, drug safety, and effectiveness, and also multiple innovative contributions to production technology, quality control, scientific and technological research and development, and enterprise management and marketing. Therefore, its innovation was grade B. The dosage form of Reyanning was mixture, which made it convenient for storage and transportation. The usage was easy to be mastered and accepted by doctors and nurses, exhibiting good suitability for clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and patients who received this drug and basically meeting the needs of clinical medication. The suitability was grade B. The average daily cost of this drug was 8.082 yuan, and the price was low. The treatment cost accounted for a small proportion of the annual disposable income of urban and rural residents, indicating that it was affordable. Reyanning Mixture was available in 31 provinces, cities and autonomous regions, covering 6 910 hospitals. The allocation of hospitals at all levels was more than 50%. There was no shortage or supply restriction of medicinal material resources. The annual production capacity was sufficient to meet the supply demand, so its accessibility was grade A. Reyanning Mixture, sourced from &quot;pneumonia Ⅲ&quot;, has been subjected to a real-world study of its clinical application, with 4 367 cases involved, and the characteristic of TCM was grade B. The comprehensive evaluation results demonstrated that the clinical value score of Reyanning Mixture in the treatment of acute upper respiratory tract infection(heat-toxin attacking lung syndrome) was 0.80, making it rated class A.

330,330,330,32615269,"The disk diffusion test is very popular but for anaerobes the main pitfalls arise from the significant variation of diameters for an individual MIC and the weak correlation observed between the MIC's values and diameters zone that generates many major and very major errors. without any change in the methodology and revisiting only new diameter breakpoints, we try to improve the previous French recommendations and therefore decrease number of errors by introducing recent EUCAST concepts such as ECOFF and ATU Zone. MIC determination by agar dilution was done on 100 anaerobes against 6 antibiotics. Clinical categorization was based on EUCAST Breakpoints. Disk-diffusion method was realized on the same Brucella blood agar incubated in an anaerobic chamber. 550 categorizations by both methods could be done as amoxicillin was not tested on the 50 B. fragilis group. As anaerobic infections are severe and treated by antibiotics at higher dosage, we focus on resistance breakpoint to avoid mainly very major errors (VME). Distribution of inhibition zones for each MIC allow us to fix the zone diameter breakpoints. These results were matched to a large data on distribution of zone diameters for each antibiotic collected from two French hospitals from 1990 to 2005. As example for metronidazole and the B. fragilis group, we calculated the cut-off diameter (15 mm) from a wild type population, at a time when there was no resistance to this antibiotic and observed that it was identical to the diameter breakpoint for susceptibility. For an individual value of MIC, the distribution of diameters is wider for anaerobes especially for clindamycin and metronidazole. Using a 15 mm breakpoint for these two antibiotics limits dramatically the number of very major errors but slowly increases the number of major errors that could be overcome by MIC determination if inhibition zone is less than 15 mm. ATU zones (Area of technical uncertainty) were introduced for amoxicillin-clavulanate (17-20 mm), piperacillin-tazobactam (17-20 mm), imipenem (18-23 mm). Categorization inside the ATU requires MIC determination. Finally, out of 550 determinations, VME were observed in 1.45% of cases, an acceptable rate. in combination with introduction of ATU zones disk diffusion method allows to detect resistant strains with little MIC determinations and very major errors.

We aimed to assess whether use of simplified antibiotic regimens to treat young infants with clinical signs of severe infection was as efficacious as an injectable procaine benzylpenicillin-gentamicin combination for 7 days for situations in which hospital referral was not possible. In a multisite open-label equivalence trial in DR Congo, Kenya, and Nigeria, community health workers visited all newborn babies at home, identifying and referring unwell young infants to a study nurse. We stratified young infants with clinical signs of severe infection whose parents did not accept referral to hospital by age (0-6 days and 7-59 days), and randomly assigned each individual within these strata to receive one of the four treatment regimens. Randomisation was stratified by age group of infants. An age-stratified randomisation scheme with block size of eight was computer-generated off-site at WHO. The outcome assessor was masked. We randomly allocated infants to receive injectable procaine benzylpenicillin-gentamicin for 7 days (group A, reference group); injectable gentamicin and oral amoxicillin for 7 days (group B); injectable procaine benzylpenicillin-gentamicin for 2 days, then oral amoxicillin for 5 days (group C); or injectable gentamicin for 2 days and oral amoxicillin for 7 days (group D).

In the per-protocol analysis, 828 infants were included in group A, 826 in group B, 862 in group C, and 848 in group D. 67 (8%) infants failed treatment in group A compared with 51 (6%) infants in group B (risk difference -1·9%, 95% CI -4·4 to 0·1), 65 (8%) in group C (-0·6%, -3·1 to 2·0), and 46 (5%) in group D (-2·7%, -5·1 to 0·3). Treatment failure in groups B, C, and D was within the similarity margin compared with group A. During the 15 days after random allocation, 12 (1%) infants died in group A, compared with ten (1%) infants in group B, 20 (2%) infants in group C, and 11 (1%) infants in group D. An infant in group A had a serious adverse event other than death (injection abscess).

336,336,336,22367351,"Aeromonas species are environmental organisms that are responsible for numerous infections in humans and animals. Their antimicrobial susceptibility is usually evaluated using Enterobacteriaceae breakpoints. Although disk diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)-based methods are important for infectious disease management and epidemiological surveys of resistance, comparisons between these two methods have not been extensively studied for Aeromonas isolates. We propose the first extensive comparison of agar dilution and disk diffusion susceptibility testing methods, performed for 20 antimicrobial agents, including unevaluated or incompletely evaluated antibiotics (ticarcillin with or without clavulanic acid, ertapenem, tigecycline), on 146 Aeromonas isolates affiliated with six Aeromonas species via molecular means. We evaluated the level of agreement between Enterobacteriaceae breakpoints-based methods. Reliable agreement (>95%) was observed for piperacillin, cefotaxime, cefepime, nalidixic acid, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, amikacin, tetracycline and cotrimoxazole, whereas marked inconsistencies between the methods were noted for carbapenems, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ticarcillin, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, tobramycin and tigecycline. The results indicate that beta-lactam and aminoglycoside susceptibility testing should be limited to piperacillin, cephems, gentamicin and amikacin. Co-amoxiclav should be avoided given the lack of agreement between the two methods. Adjusting the zone diameter breakpoints for tigecycline and cefoxitin could also improve the agreement to >95% and reduce the error rates to acceptable levels.

Most commonly prescribed PLM in Pune district were selected as opined by 50 pediatricians. The selected medicaments were Syr. Augmentin® Duo, Syr. Valparin®, Syr. Combiflam®, Syr. Visyneral and Syr. Orofer®. An estimation of pH, percentage of sucrose concentration and calcium dissolving capacity of these preparations was carried out. The results as obtained were subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS v 17.0 for windows. The statistical test as undertaken was Pearson's correlation coeffcient(r). Sucrose was seen to be present in Syr. Combiflam® (35.75% ± 0.25%) and Syr. Visyneral (18.48% ± 0.43%). Acidic pH was observed for Syr. Visyneral (mean pH 3.63 ± 0.04), Syr.

The sample size is 750 evaluable infants enrolled per treatment group, and results will be reported at the end of 2013. The trial builds upon previous studies of community case management of clinical severe infections in young infants conducted by our research team in Bangladesh.

In Greece, a region with >20% clarithromycin resistance where bismuth is unavailable, the 10-day quadruple concomitant scheme has already been adopted as the accepted first-line Helicobacter pylori eradication treatment. Our prospective randomized study included 364 patients with newly diagnosed H. pylori infection, randomized to receive a 10-day or a 14-day nonbismuth quadruple concomitant scheme. Treatment outcome was assessed by C-urea breath test and/or histology at least 4 weeks after therapy. Intention to treat and per protocol analyses of the eradication rates were performed. Secondary endpoints included patient adherence, safety, and the impact of prior antibiotic exposure in treatment efficacy. The overall eradication rates of the 2 treatments were 87.9% versus 87.4% in the intention to treat analysis, P=1.000, and 93% versus 94.1%, P=0.859, in the per protocol analysis for the 10-day and the 14-day treatment group, respectively. Both groups displayed excellent compliance rates (99.5% for the 10-day vs. 96.2% for the 14-day treatment duration, P=0.067). As regards treatment safety, serious adverse events that led to the discontinuation of both regimens were few, with no statistical difference between the 2 groups (0.5% in the 10-day group and 2.2% in the 14-day group, P>0.05).

As a model for the intestinal epithelium excised rat jejunum, mounted in side-by-side diffusion cells, was used. Amoxicillin was actively transported across the intestine in the serosal-to-mucosal direction, but only if glucose was present at the mucosal side. This effect of glucose was abolished by a multridrug resistance associated protein (MRP) inhibitor benzbromarone (0.04 mM), but not by verapamil (0.2 mM). Among the tested pharmaceutically acceptable excipients only sodium lauryl sulfate (0.2 mg/ml) increased the permeability of amoxicillin in the mucosal-to-serosal direction, which was accompanying with the abolishment of the secretory oriented transport of amoxicillin. Other excipients (0.07 2mg/ml Pluronic F68, 0.2 mg/ml Lutrol F127, 0.2 mg/ml Cremophor EL or 0.2 mg/ml Carbopol 934) have no influence on the permeability of amoxicillin. The effect of sodium lauryl sulfate on the active secretion of amoxicillin was mainly attributed to the reversible cellular ATP depletion.

Records of these patients were reviewed to identify patients with radiographic findings of pneumonia. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of these patients were then studied in detail. Forty-two patients who met the criteria for B. catarrhalis pneumonia were identified. Most patients were elderly (over 65 years; 55 percent), malnourished (69 percent), and had severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or another serious underlying disease (98 percent). The seasonal incidence of this pneumonia was October through April (88 percent), with the annual number of cases having increased since 1982. The clinical presentation was typically mild. Interstitial or mixed interstitial-alveolar infiltrates superimposed on pre-existing chronic lung disease was the most common radiographic finding. Approximately 90 percent of sputa were acceptable for Gram stain and contained 10 to more than 50 gram-negative cocci/1,000 x field. All cultures produced a heavy growth of B. catarrhalis, with 67 percent of strains positive for beta-lactamase. No patient had identified bacteremia (zero of 25 tested). Therapy with numerous agents including cefotaxime, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resulted in a good clinical and bacteriologic response. However, 45 percent of patients died of their underlying diseases on this admission or within three months. These findings provide a good profile of B. catarrhalis pneumonia. Despite the mild character of the illness, the pneumonia occurs in patients with end-stage pulmonary or malignant disease and almost 50 percent of patients die of their underlying diseases within three months.

351,351,351,29514268,"To determine whether local trainer-led TARGET antibiotic interactive workshops improve antibiotic dispensing in general practice. Using a McNulty-Zelen-design randomized controlled trial within three regions of England, 152 general practices were stratified by clinical commissioning group, antibiotic dispensing rate and practice patient list size, then randomly allocated to intervention (offered TARGET workshop that incorporated a presentation, reflection on antibiotic data, promotion of patient and general practice (GP) staff resources, clinical scenarios and action planning, 73 practices) or control (usual practice, 79 practices). The primary outcome measure was total oral antibiotic items dispensed/1000 patients for the year after the workshop (or pseudo-workshop date for controls), adjusted for the previous year's dispensing. Thirty-six (51%) intervention practices (166 GPs, 51 nurses and 101 other staff) accepted a TARGET workshop invitation. In the ITT analysis total antibiotic dispensing was 2.7% lower in intervention practices (95% CI -5.5% to 1%, P = 0.06) compared with controls. Dispensing in intervention practices was 4.4% lower for amoxicillin/ampicillin (95% CI 0.6%-8%, P = 0.02); 5.6% lower for trimethoprim (95% CI 0.7%-10.2%, P = 0.03); and a non-significant 7.1% higher for nitrofurantoin (95% CI -0.03 to 15%, P = 0.06). The Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE) analysis, which estimates impact in those that comply with assigned intervention, indicated 6.1% (95% CI 0.2%-11.7%, P = 0.04) lower total antibiotic dispensing in intervention practices and 11% (95% CI 1.6%-19.5%, P = 0.02) lower trimethoprim dispensing. This study within usual service provision found that TARGET antibiotic workshops can help improve antibiotic use, and therefore should be considered as part of any national antimicrobial stewardship initiatives.

In this study, the presence of enterotoxin genes (bft) in clinical B. fragilis strains has been investigated and the antimicrobial resistance patterns of bft positive and negative isolates have been compared. B. fragilis strains isolated from different clinical samples were identified by conventional methods and API 20A system, and the presence of bft genes were searched by using BF3/BF4 primers in polymerase chain reaction. A total of 100 B. fragilis strains of which 50 bft gene positive and 50 bft gene negative were included to the study, and their antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined by agar dilution method as recommended by NCCLS (M11-A4). Of 100 strains, 71 (34 bft negative, 37 bft positive) have been isolated from the stool, and 29 (16 bft negative, 13 bft positive) have been isolated from other specimens (blood, abscess, pleural and peritoneal fluids). beta-lactamase production was detected in 96% of enterotoxigenic B. fragilis (ETBF) and 95% of non-toxigenic strains, and all tested strains were found to be susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, imipenem and metronidazole. The resistance rates (with MIC90 values) of bft positive isolates against the other antibiotics were as follows; 96% (256 microg/ml) for ampicillin, 16% (256 microg/ml) for piperacillin, 8% (32 microg/ml) for cefoxitin, 24% (> 256 microg/ml) for clindamycin, 74% (64 microg/ml) for tetracycline and 0% (8 microg/ml) for chloramphenicol.

The purpose of this study was to examine the use of antibiotics and other prescription medications for the common cold in a Medicaid population seen in ambulatory care settings. A cross-sectional sample of Kentucky Medicaid claims from July 1, 1993, through June 30, 1994, was analyzed. Subjects were patients seen in an ambulatory setting for the common cold, defined as acute nasopharyngitis. A total of 1439 individuals were seen for 2171 separate outpatient and emergency department encounters for the common cold. Outpatient visits accounted for 99% (2144) of the encounters. Patients in 35% (752) of the encounters did not fill a prescription for medication, 6% (129) filled a prescription for an antihistamine or other symptomatic medication, and 60% (1290) filled a prescription for an antibiotic for the common cold. Nineteen different antibiotics, 54% of which were amoxicillin, were prescribed for the common cold. Less than 2% of the encounters had a secondary diagnosis of either acute sinusitis or otitis media. These encounters were not more likely than the total sample to receive antibiotics. Adults were more likely than children to receive an antibiotic (P<.001), and urban physicians were more likely than rural physicians to prescribe antibiotics (P=.02). A conservative estimate of the annual cost of antibiotic prescribing for the common cold in the United States was $37.5 million. A majority of persons receiving medical care for the common cold are given prescriptions for an unnecessary antibiotic. Unchecked, this practice may lead to greater antibiotic resistance and unnecessary use of health care resources. Future research should focus on the ability to institute behavioral changes for treatment of the common cold in both closed systems (eg, managed care) and open systems (eg, general community of physicians).

Two hundred and ninety-seven patients with H. pylori positive duodenal ulcer were enrolled and randomly allocated into one of the five treatment groups: 1) group A: received lansoprazole 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks plus amoxicillin (AM) 500 mg and metronidazole (MZ) 500 mg twice daily for one week in the first week; 2) group B: the AM in group A was replaced by clarithromycin (CM) 250 mg; 3) group C: the MZ in group A was replaced by CM 250 mg; 4) group D: the AM and CM in group C was used for 2 wk; 5) group E: the CM in group D was doubled to 500 mg twice daily. All patients received endoscopies pre- and 4-6 weeks post termination of treatment. H. pylori was detected by culture, histology and rapid urease test (CLO test). 13C-urea breath test was performed if the patients refused the second endoscopy. The E-test was adopted to evaluate the MZ and CM resistance of H. pylori. Totally, 253 patients completed the study. The eradication rate of groups A, B, C, D and E were 75%, 80%, 78%, 92%, and 96%, respectively. The eradication rate of group E was significantly higher than that of groups A, B, or C. There were no significant differences of eradication rates between the groups D and E. Sixty-seven cases (28.8%) were MZ-resistant. The difference of eradication rates between MZ-S and MZ-R patients was significant in group A (85.3% vs. 42.9%) and in the combination of groups A and B (83.8% vs. 59.4%). Good compliance (defined as taking > 90% of medications) was seen in more than 90% of cases in each group. Triple therapy containing lansoprazole 30 mg once daily, AM 500 mg and CM 250 mg twice daily for two weeks is a promising regimen which reaches a high eradication rate, avoids MZ resistance, and has very good patient compliance at an acceptable cost.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of self-medication with antibiotics amongst dental outpatients in Iranian population. One thousand and two hundred of dentistry patients, who were referred to dental school clinics in ten major provinces of Iran, participated in this study. A valid self-administered questionnaire regarding self-medication with antibiotics in case of dental pain was used to collect data. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and Logistic regression analysis. In our study population, the prevalence of self-medication was 42.6%. Amongst the Iranian cities, the highest prevalence of self-medication with antibiotics belonged to the city of Bandar Abbas (64%) and the lowest was seen in the city of Kerman (27.3%). Men were more likely to take antibiotics. Amoxicillin was the mostly used antibiotic. Severe pain, previous self-medications and high costs of dental visits were the most common reasons for self-medication with antibiotics in the investigated population. In addition, the present study showed that marriage, acceptable financial status and high level of education could decrease self-medication with antibiotics. In the current investigation, an alarming fact was that self-medication for dental problems seemed very common amongst the studied population. One of its most important consequences was bacterial resistance. Therefore, there should be plans to promote and prioritize public health awareness and encourage general public's motivation to reduce the practice of self-medication.

This study produces evidence to confirm that one available bovine intramammary preparation, when infused into milking sheep, produced a withholding time approximately three times as long as that defined for the cow. Following a course of three infusions over a period of 24 hours after consecutive milkings, milk was not acceptable for human consumption or for the production of cheese and yoghurts until 136 hours following the final infusion.

Its higher performance has recently been confirmed using a halved clarithromycin dose in peptic ulcer disease. To evaluate whether an acceptable eradication rate could also be obtained by halving the clarithromycin dose in dyspeptic patients and to assess the role of possible factors affecting the outcome of therapy. In a prospective, open-label study, 162 patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia and Helicobacter pylori infection, assessed by rapid urease test and histology, were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive either 10-day sequential therapy, comprising rabeprazole 20 mg b.d. plus amoxicillin 1 g b.d. for the first 5 days, followed by rabeprazole 20 mg b.d., clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. and tinidazole 500 mg b.d. for the remaining 5 days (low-dose therapy), or a similar schedule with clarithromycin 500 mg b.d.

361,361,361,26106466,"BACKGROUND The eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection, commonly prevailing in the stomach, has been important since its introduction. Adequate preparations should be made in finding alternatives when faced with first-line treatment failures. Currently, ideal second-line treatments are indistinct and varied among countries as result of different antibiotic resistance patterns. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a clarithromycin-containing bismuth-based quadruple regimen as a second-line treatment. METHODS Forty-eight H.pylori-positive patients with proven gastric or duodenal ulcers and/or erosions who had previously failed to respond to furazolidone-containing regimens were enrolled. They received pantoprazole (40 mg-bid), amoxicillin (1gr-bid), bismuth subcitrate (240 mg-bid), and clarithromycin (500mg-bid) for 10 days. Eight weeks after treatment, a (14)C-urea breath test was performed for the re-evaluation of H. pylori eradication. RESULTS Forty-three patients completed the study. H.pylori eradication rates were 79.2% (95% CI=65.00-89.53) and 88.4% (95% CI=74.91-96.11) according to intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses, respectively. All patients had excellent compliance to treatment and one did not continue therapy because of adverse effects. CONCLUSION In developing countries such as Iran, a ten-day clarithromycin-containing bismuth-based quadruple regimen is encouraged as a second-line treatment because of the acceptable rate of eradication and low adverse effects.

A shorter course would be cheaper and could be as effective. This study was designed to investigate the efficacy of three 5-day regimens based on lansoprazole (L). 168 dyspepsia patients with H. pylori infection were randomized to receive a 5-day course of either LCM, LAC or CALM, and a 13C-urea breath test was performed after 4 weeks to assess eradication. 160 patients completed the study. Intention-to-treat eradication rates were as follows: LCM 81%, LAC 59%, CALM 88%. LCM and CALM gave significantly better eradication rates than LAC. There was no significant difference in adverse events across the three groups. Logistical regression analysis showed that the specific regimen used and the age of the patient were the only factors influencing eradication outcome. Five days of CALM yields acceptable eradication rates, and is cheaper than conventional 7-day proton pump inhibitor-triple therapy. It appears to offer good results in metronidazole-resistant strains of H. pylori. A randomized trial comparing 5-day CALM with conventional 7-day therapy is needed before this regimen can be recommended for routine use.

Secondary end points included patient compliance and safety. The concomitant therapy group achieved statistically significant higher eradication rates when compared with the sequential treatment group, both in the ITT and in the PP analysis (84.6% versus 70.9%, p = 0.002, and 90.6% versus 78.1%, p = 0.001, respectively), after adjusting for age, gender, smoking status, and the presence or not of ulcer and/or non-ulcer dyspepsia. Both groups displayed excellent compliance rates (99.5% for the concomitant therapy group and 96.2% for the sequential therapy group, p = 0.067). Regarding treatment safety, major adverse events that led to the discontinuation of both regimens were few, with no statistical difference between the two groups (7.0% for the concomitant therapy group and 2.9% for the sequential therapy group). Concomitant therapy led to statistically significant higher eradication rates over sequential therapy. Both therapies showed excellent compliance and an acceptable safety profile.

364,364,364,26774460,"The objectives of our study were to analyse the prescriptions of antibiotics and assessing the relevance of pharmacist interventions (PI) in outpatient consultations in a pediatric unit of a Teaching Hospital of Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study from May to December 2013. The analysis of antibiotic prescriptions was documented. The tool of PI classification validated by the French Society of Clinical Pharmacy was used. The PI rating was made by prescribers. This rating evolved from PI0 to PI3 depending on the severity of the clinical impact of the problem and to the severity of clinical consequences avoided by the PI. The relevance was evaluated by the PI acceptance rate by physicians and clinical evaluation of their impact. Our study included 150 patients with a mean age of 11.75 months and a sex ratio (M/F) of 2. The amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (27.2 %) and amoxicillin (22.3 %) were the most prescribed antibiotics. Sixty-three drug-related problems (DRPs) were detected on the antibiotic prescriptions. They were non-optimal drug administration plan (88.9 %) and underdose (11.1 %). The amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (61.9 %) and josamycin (17.4 %) were the most affected by these DRPs. PI were related to the precision of modes of drug administration (88.9 %) and dose adjustments (11.1 %). The prescribers accepted 93.7 % of PIs. All accepted PIs was rated PI1 (significant clinical impact). PIs performed on antibiotic prescription were relevant with a high rate of acceptance and a significant clinical impact.

Recently, a generic drug for omeprazole was introduced to the market, but its efficacy as a PPI was questioned. The aim of the study was to compare eradication efficacy of triple therapy-based regimens with Losec (Astra-Zeneca, Sweden) and the generic form, Omepradex (Dexxon, Israel). People belonging to Clalit Health Services (CHS), the biggest health insurance provider in Israel, and receiving omeprazole (Losec or Omepradex) for 7 days (assumed to be Helicobacter pylori eradication purposes), between 1.1.2001 and 31.12.2001, were retrieved from the CHS central computer. Of 450 patients (287 in the Losec group and 163 in the Omepradex group), 97 (21.6%) underwent 13C-urea breath test (13CUBT) for validation of Helicobacter pylori successful eradication and participated in the study. They were all treated with triple therapy with omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin, and were stratified according to the PPI used: Group A, Losec; and Group B, Omepradex. Positivity of 13CUBT was computed. Sixty-one (21.25%) and 36 (22.08%) patients in Groups A and B, respectively, underwent 13 CUBT for validation of successful Helicobacter pylori eradication (NS). In Group A 41 of 61 patients (67.21%) had a negative 13CUBT, in comparison with 26 of 36 (72.22%) in Group B (NS). Using logistic regression analysis all confounding factors were found to be noncontributory to the discrimination between negative (successful eradication) and positive (failed eradication) 13CUBT.

The objective was to evaluate antibiotic chemoprophylaxis in incisional herniorrhaphy with the implantation of prosthetic material. A prospective non-randomized study (1990-1998) was conducted to analyse 216 patients undergoing surgery for abdominal incisional hernia who required a prosthesis (polypropylene) in the reconstruction and who met the criteria for clean surgery. Risk factors were observed in 31.5%, the most frequent being diabetes and obesity. The incisional hernia was located mostly in the abdominal midline and in 64.4% measured over 10 cm. Antibiotic prophylaxis was administered in 140 patients (64.8%) via the systemic route, the antibiotics being first- or second-generation cephalosporins or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Surgical wound infection occurred in 39 patients (18.1%), 19 who had received antibiotic prophylaxis (13.6%) and 20 who had not (26.3%). In multivariate analysis using logistic regression, the variables with statistical significance for local septic infection were antibiotic prophylaxis and number of risk factors.

367,367,367,19667290,"Serious Enterococcus faecalis infections usually require combination therapy to achieve a bactericidal effect. In orthopedic infections, the prognosis of enterococcal etiology is considered poor, and the use of aminoglycosides is questioned. The ampicillin-ceftriaxone combination has recently been accepted as alternative therapy for enterococcal endocarditis. After one of our patients with endocarditis and vertebral osteomyelitis was cured with ampicillin-ceftriaxone, we started a pilot study of orthopedic infections. Patients with infections due to E. faecalis (with two or more surgical samples or blood cultures) diagnosed during 2005 to 2008 were recruited. Polymicrobial infections with ampicillin- and ceftriaxone-resistant microorganisms were excluded. Patients received ampicillin (8 to 16 g/day)-ceftriaxone (2 to 4 g/day) and were followed up prospectively. Of 31 patients with E. faecalis infections, 10 received ampicillin-ceftriaxone. Including the first patient, 11 patients were treated with ampicillin-ceftriaxone: 3 with prosthetic joint infections, 3 with instrumented spine arthrodesis device infections, 2 with osteosynthesis device infections, 1 with foot osteomyelitis, and 2 with vertebral osteomyelitis and endocarditis. Six infections (55%) were polymicrobial. All cases except the vertebral osteomyelitis ones required surgery, with retention of foreign material in six cases. Ampicillin-ceftriaxone was given for 25 days (interquartile range, 15 to 34 days), followed by amoxicillin (amoxicilline) being given to seven patients (64%). One patient with endocarditis died within 2 weeks (hemorrhagic stroke) and was not evaluable. For one patient with prosthesis retention, the infection persisted; 9/10 patients (90%) were cured, but 1 patient was superinfected. Follow-up was for 21 months (interquartile range, 14 to 36 months). Ampicillin-ceftriaxone may be a reasonable synergistic combination to treat orthopedic infections due to E. faecalis.

Costs and consequences over 21 days were evaluated based on clinical cure rates 5 to 7 days after treatment and health resource use reported for the TARGET multinational, prospective, randomized, open-label trial. This trial compared sequential i.v./po monotherapy with moxifloxacin (400 mg qd) to i.v./po co-amoxiclav (1.2 g i.v./625 mg po tid) with or without clarithromycin (500 mg bid) for 7 to 14 days in hospitalized patients with CAP. Since no country-by-treatment interaction was found in spite of some country differences for length of hospital stays, resource data (antimicrobial treatment, hospitalization, and out-of-hospital care) from all centers were pooled and valued using German and French unit prices to estimate CAP-related cost to the German Sickness Funds and French public health-care sector, respectively. Compared to AMC +/- CLA, treatment with moxifloxacin resulted in 5.3% more patients achieving clinical cure 5 to 7 days after therapy (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 11.8%), increased speed of response (1 day sooner for median time to first return to apyrexia, p = 0.008), and a reduction in hospital stay by 0.81 days (95% CI, - 0.01 to 1.63) within the 21-day time frame. Treatment with moxifloxacin resulted in savings of 266 euro and 381 euro for Germany and France respectively, primarily due to the shorter length of hospital stay. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves show moxifloxacin has a > or = 95% chance of being cost saving from French and German health-care perspectives, and higher probability of being cost-effective at acceptability thresholds up to 2,000 euro per additional patient cured. i.v./po monotherapy with moxifloxacin shows clinical benefits including increased speed of response and is cost-effective compared to i.v./po AMC +/- CLA in the treatment of CAP.

Simulated patient (SP) visits combined with a qualitative study using in-depth interviews was conducted among community pharmacy professionals in Gondar town, Northwest Ethiopia. Scenarios of three different minor ailments (uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection, back pain and acute diarrhea) were selected and results were reported as percentages. Pharmacy professionals were also interviewed about the barriers in the management of minor ailments. Out of 66 simulated visits, 61 cases (92.4%) provided one or more medications to the SPs. Pharmacy professionals in 16 visits asked SPs information on details of symptoms and past medical and medication history. Ibuprofen alone or in combination with paracetamol was the most commonly dispensed analgesics for back pain. Oral rehydration fluid (ORS) with zinc was the most frequently dispensed medication (33.3%) for the management of acute diarrhea followed by mebendazole (23.9%). Moreover, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid capsule (35%) followed by Amoxicillin (25%) were the most commonly dispensed antibiotics for uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection. Lack of clinical training and poor community awareness towards the role of community pharmacists in the management of minor ailments were the main barriers for the provision of minor ailment management by community pharmacy professionals. Overall, community pharmacists provided inadequate therapy for the simulated minor ailments. Lack of access to clinical training and poor community awareness were the most commonly cited barriers for providing such services.

Moreover, evidence is accumulating that the risk of a duodenal ulcer complication, such as, bleeding, is reduced following successful eradication of H. pylori. The treatment of duodenal ulcer patients with H. pylori eradication treatment has been advocated by an international working party who met first in Sydney at the 1990 World Congress and subsequently in Athens during the First European Gastroenterology Week. The most recent recommendation suggests that the infection should be treated in any duodenal ulcer patient after the first recurrence, and that a triple therapy regimen or a proton pump inhibitor combined with either amoxicillin or clarithromycin may be prescribed. The combination of a proton pump inhibitor and an antibiotic can eradicate H. pylori in over 80% of cases and simultaneously offers the advantage of rapid symptom relief and the highest rates of duodenal ulcer healing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) ",The current role of Helicobacter pylori eradication in clinical practice,"Hunt RH, Mohamed AH.",Scand J Gastroenterol Suppl. 1995;208:47-52.,Hunt RH,Scand J Gastroenterol Suppl,1995,1995/01/01,,,
380,380,380,15270741,"Re-infection with Helicobacter pylori is more common in children than adults, and it is generally accepted that the family unit plays a significant role in primary childhood infection. We investigated whether the family unit plays a significant role in pediatric re-infection and if eradication of H. pylori from the entire family reduces the risk of childhood re-infection. Fifty families, each with an H. pylori-infected pediatric index case (mean age 9.48 years), were recruited. A 13carbon urea breath test was performed on all family members in the same house as the index case. Each family unit was randomized into a 'family unit treatment' group (all infected family members treated) or an 'index case treatment' group (index case only treated). At long-term follow-up (mean 62.2 months), there were three re-infected children in the 'index case treatment' group compared with one in the 'family unit treatment' group. The re-infection rate was 2.4% per patient per year in the 'index case treatment' group and 0.7% per patient per year in the 'family unit treatment' group (p = .31). This study is the first to evaluate the effect of total family unit H. pylori eradication on pediatric re-infection rates and reports the longest period of re-infection follow-up in children. In childhood, re-infection with H. pylori is not significantly reduced by family unit H. pylori eradication.

A very effective, new sequential treatment schedule has recently been described. However, all studies published to date were performed in Italy; it is mandatory to confirm these results in other settings. To assess the cure rate and the acceptability of a new sequential treatment regimen through a pilot study. A hundred and thirty-nine patients (60% men, mean age 49.6 +/- 15.7 yr) were recruited from six centers. H. pylori status was assessed by histology, urease test or urea breath test. Sequential regime consisted of a 10-day treatment including a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) b.d. plus amoxicillin 1 g b.d. for the first 5 days, followed by a PPI b.d. clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. and metronidazole 500 mg b.d for the next 5 days. Eradication was determined 8 wk after the end of treatment by urea breath test or histology. Eradication rates were calculated both per protocol and by intention-to-treat. Eradication was achieved in 117 out of 129 patients who returned for a follow-up test. The intention-to-treat eradication rate was thus 84.2% (95%CI: 77%-90%) and the per-protocol cure rate 90.7% (95%CI: 84%-95%). The treatment was well tolerated. Only 14 patients complained of mild side effects. Sequential treatment seems highly effective for eradicating H. pylori.

They were randomized for a 7-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled H. pylori eradication treatment with amoxicillin, clarithromycin and omeprazol or placebo. H. pylori eradication was assessed by a second 13C urea breath test six weeks after the end of treatment. We observed a significant improvement of more than 70 % of CIU; baseline clinical score was seen in 4 of the 9 (44 %) patients who eradicated H. pylori after active treatment and in 1 of the 7 (12,3 %) of those who did not (p = 0.19). No clinical differences in CIU characteristics were found between patients with and without improvement. No serious adverse effects were observed in either treatment group.

Therefore treatment approaches that reduce the cost of managing otitis media can have a large impact on overall health care costs. In this study cost effectiveness factors of various antimicrobial agents, such as adverse events and overall patient acceptance, were examined. Decreased patient acceptance and higher incidence of adverse events had a negative impact on the cost of treatment. Amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefprozil, erythromycin/sulfisoxazole and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were found to be associated with decreased patient acceptance compared with cefixime. Cefixime also had the lowest number of adverse events of any of the drugs used. Amoxicillin had the lowest total cost for a single course of treatment, exclusive of costs of recurrence, which were examined in a previous study. This study concluded that in cases in which several antibiotics may be clinically effective, comparative tolerability and patient acceptance data should be considered for selection of appropriate therapy.

Despite only weak evidence from Hp eradication studies, screening for Hp infection is still recommended in several CSU guidelines. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Hp eradication in combination with standard CSU treatment in Hp-positive compared with Hp-negative patients, applying the latest guidelines for both diseases. 138 consecutive patients with CSU were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. All patients underwent gastroscopy and Hp status was determined by urease testing and histologic examination. Seventy-five patients were diagnosed as Hp negative and 47 patients fulfilled criteria for definite Hp infection, 45 of whom received eradication therapy. Sixteen patients who received eradication therapy without an appropriate indication served as the medication control. All patients received symptomatic treatment with antihistamines and/or glucocorticoids regardless of Hp status. Partial response (PR) was defined as subjective amelioration of CSU symptoms; patients returning for further CSU treatment within 6 months were considered non-responders/relapsers (NRs). The prevalence of Hp infection was comparable with Hp seroprevalence data reported for healthy western populations. Standard treatment of CSU led to relief of symptoms independent of Hp status. Hp eradication by standard triple therapy had no additional effect on PR (p = 0.32) or NR (p = 0.50). Hp eradication has no discernible effect on CSU beyond that of standard CSU therapy. Therefore, Hp eradication should only be initiated in accordance with currently accepted indications of Hp treatment guidelines.

The retreatments included (i) triple therapy (TT): colloidal bismuth subcitrate, metronidazole, amoxicillin (or tetracycline); (ii) quadruple therapy (QT): TT and a PPI; or (iii) high doses of both a PPI and clarithromycin combined with a further 1-3 individually selected antimicrobials. The eradication results were determined after 6-12 months. The 1st retreatment was successful in 70 of 120 patients. The 2nd retreatment cured 25 of the remaining 42 patients, the 3rd 13 of 17, and the 4th the last 4 patients. The cumulative eradication rate (ITT) was 93% (95% CI: 88.9%-97.9%; 8 patients withdrew after a failed 1st retreatment) and the rate was 100% in the remaining 112 patients who accepted several retreatments. The 1st retreatment with TT cured 23% (95% CI: 12%-34%) of 57 patients and QT 85% (95% CI: 74%-96%) of 41 patients who had initially undergone a failed metronidazole-based treatment. All retreatments were well tolerated. In this study, high doses of a PPI and clarithromycin combined with 1-3 antimicrobials according to susceptibility data proved to be the best drug combination in the cure of H. pylori infection after failed primary treatment.

In collecting urine samples from a one year old child, 80% of respondents recommended the use of a urine collection bag and the remaining 20% recommended collection of a clean catch sample. Respondents differed greatly in their practice with regard to detailed investigation and specialist referral after a first episode of UTI. Co-amoxiclav was the most frequently used antibiotic for the treatment of cystitis, with most doctors prescribing a five day course. In general, this study reveals a high level of clinical knowledge amongst doctors treating children with UTI in primary care in the catchment area of County Mayo. However, it also demonstrates wide variation in practice with regard to detailed investigation and specialist referral. The common practice of prescribing long courses of antibiotics when treating lower urinary tract infection is at variance with NICE's recommendation of a three day course of antibiotics for cystitis in children over three months of age when there are no atypical features.

396,396,396,24213913,"Guideline recommendations on empirical antibiotic treatment are based on the literature, expert opinion, expected pathogens and resistance data, but their adequacy in the real-life setting is often unknown. We investigated the adequacy of the Dutch evidence-based guideline-recommended treatment options for patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) 2 years after guideline publication and, additionally, the adequacy of actually prescribed empirical therapy for patients treated with guideline-adherent versus non-guideline-adherent therapy. A retrospective, observational multicentre study in the Netherlands included 810 patients with a complicated UTI without special conditions and 174 with a urinary catheter. The susceptibility patterns of cultured uropathogens were compared with guideline-recommended treatment options, which included specific recommendations for patients with a catheter, and with actually prescribed empirical therapy. We considered inadequate coverage rates below 10% as acceptable. Of the recommended regimens for patients with a UTI without other conditions, only the guideline-recommended combination of amoxicillin-gentamicin was acceptable (inadequate coverage rate 6%). For patients with a catheter, inadequate coverage rates of recommended regimens ranged from 3 to 24%. In patients with a UTI without other conditions, actually prescribed guideline-adherent therapy resulted in less broad-spectrum but not in less adequate therapy; in patients with a catheter, actually prescribed guideline-adherent therapy resulted in a higher coverage rate than those prescribed non-guideline-adherent therapy. Due to the continuously changing resistance rates and differences between the epidemiologies of uropathogens assumed in the guideline and those in real life, regular real-life assessments of recommended treatment options are necessary. Guideline adherence seems to be effective for increasing coverage rates without prescribing unnecessarily broad regimens.

397,397,397,22615163,"An innovative versatile strategy using Total Error has been proposed to decide about the method's validity that controls the risk of accepting an unsuitable assay together with the ability to predict the reliability of future results. This strategy is based on the simultaneous combination of systematic (bias) and random (imprecision) error of analytical methods. Using validation standards, both types of error are combined through the use of a prediction interval or β-expectation tolerance interval. Finally, an accuracy profile is built by connecting, on one hand all the upper tolerance limits, and on the other hand all the lower tolerance limits. This profile combined with pre-specified acceptance limits allows the evaluation of the validity of any quantitative analytical method and thus their fitness for their intended purpose. In this work, the approach of accuracy profile was evaluated on several types of analytical methods encountered in the pharmaceutical industrial field and also covering different pharmaceutical matrices. The four studied examples depicted the flexibility and applicability of this approach for different matrices ranging from tablets to syrups, different techniques such as liquid chromatography, or UV spectrophotometry, and for different categories of assays commonly encountered in the pharmaceutical industry i.e. content assays, dissolution assays, and quantitative impurity assays. The accuracy profile approach assesses the fitness of purpose of these methods for their future routine application. It also allows the selection of the most suitable calibration curve, the adequate evaluation of a potential matrix effect and propose efficient solution and the correct definition of the limits of quantification of the studied analytical procedures.

The primary outcome was the eradication rate in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analysis. The eradication rates of the above 3 groups using ITT analysis were RBAL 83.8%, RBMT 88.3%, and RAL 74.8% compared with 91.2, 92.5, and 79.2%, respectively, using PP analysis. The eradication rate using RBMT was significantly higher than that of RAL (p = 0.029 in ITT analysis and p = 0.017 in PP analysis).

They were not pre-treated with a gastric acid inhibitor. After 8 weeks, H. pylori status was assessed by 13C urea breath test. 974 out of 1114 patients referred for gastroscopy were screened by biopsy urease test. 140 patients were not screened either because they were anticoagulated or for technical reasons. 334 patients were H. pylori-positive: 154 were excluded mostly because of allergy to penicillin and personal reasons but 180 were randomized to treatment All regimens were well tolerated. For LTdbCA (n=60), RbcCA (n=59), and OCM (n=61) the H. pylori cure rates (95% CI) were 23% (12-34), 14% (5-23) and 87% (79-95), respectively, using intention-to-treat analysis and 25% (14-36), 15% (6-24) and 88% (80-96), respectively, if analysed per protocol.

Patients were also supplied with forms that invited them to report adverse reactions, and their perceptions were compared with those of a panel of experts, who were informed of all clinical events that had been reported during the detailed telephone interviews. Patients were more conservative than the experts in attributing clinical events to drug treatment. The extent of agreement varied and was notably poor for skin and bowel complaints (kappa = 0.13 in each case). The performance of event report forms and reaction report forms as instruments of detection was compared in a hypothetical situation in which the experts' views represented the ""truth"" about adverse reactions to a new drug. Event reporting had a higher sensitivity than reaction reporting (42% v 24%) but a lower specificity (58% v 98%).

An estimated 20% to 40% of the Canadian population is infected with H pylori; however, clinically relevant disease is present in only approximately 10% to 20% of these individuals. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the diseases for which eradication of H pylori is beneficial to ensure that patients do not receive unnecessary treatment. In patients with ulcers induced by long term treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, preliminary results suggest that eradication of H pylori may reduce the risk of peptic ulcer bleeding. Furthermore, a benefit has been observed for the eradication of H pylori before patients commence therapy with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. An association between the presence of H pylori and specific dyspeptic symptoms has yet to be established; however, there may be a subset of patients with functional dyspepsia who benefit from the eradication of H pylori. The relationship between gastroesophageal reflux disorder and H pylori infection remains unclear. In Canada, the recommended therapy for the eradication of H pylori is seven days of twice-daily treatment with a proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin or metronidazole.

410,410,410,17671053,"In 2004, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians released a clinical practice guideline on the management of acute otitis media that included endorsement of an observation option for selected cases and recommendations of specific antibiotics. We sought to describe primary care physicians' current management of acute otitis media to compare it with the guideline's recommendations and describe trends since 2004. We used a mail survey from March through June 2006 within the Slone Center Office-Based Research Network, a national practice-based pediatric research network. The response rate was 299 (62.7%) of 477. The observation option was considered reasonable by 83.3%, compared with 88.0% in 2004, and was used in a median of 15% of acute otitis media cases over the previous 3 months. The most common physician-identified barriers to the use of the observation option were parental reluctance (83.5%) and the cost and difficulty of follow-up of children who do not improve (30.9%). In terms of antibiotic choices for acute otitis media, agreement with the guideline's antibiotic recommendation for 4 common clinical scenarios was as follows: high-dose amoxicillin for acute otitis media with nonsevere symptoms (57.2%), high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate for acute otitis media with severe symptoms (12.7%), high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate for cases that failed to respond to amoxicillin (42.8%), and intramuscular ceftriaxone for cases that failed to respond to treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate (16.7%). Each of these proportions declined from 2004. Most primary care physicians accept the concept of an observation option for acute otitis media but use it only occasionally. Antibiotics prescribed for acute otitis media differ markedly from the guideline's recommendations, and the difference has increased since 2004.

411,411,411,8590144,"Chronic Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis is now widely accepted as one of the most important pathogenic factors in duodenal ulcer disease. However, little is known about for how long patients remain free of duodenal ulcer relapses after H. pylori infection has been cured. In the present study, we investigated remission time during a 5-year follow-up period after anti-H. pylori treatment. The patients were randomly allocated to treatment with either a combination of 3 x 600 mg bismuth subsalicylate and 2 x 1000 mg amoxycillin or 3 x 600 mg bismuth subsalicylate monotherapy. Endoscopy, including histological and microbiological examination of biopsies, was performed 4 weeks after termination of treatment and after 1 and 2 years. During the third, fourth and fifth years of the follow-up period, patients were monitored twice a year for symptoms compatible with ulcer relapse and for their use of anti-ulcer medication. Endoscopic and histological examinations were carried out whenever symptoms occurred. Of 56 evaluated patients, 47 showed healing of ulcers after bismuth subsalicylate plus amoxycillin compared with 44 of 57 after bismuth subsalicylate monotherapy. H. pylori infection was cured in 52% (29 of 56) of the patients after combined therapy and in 4% (2 of 57) after the monotherapy. The cumulative duodenal ulcer relapse rates after 5 years were 38% (18 of 47) after the combined therapy and 75% (33 of 44) after the monotherapy. In patients who were cured of H. pylori infection, the cumulative duodenal ulcer relapse rate after 5 years was 9.7% (3 of 31), compared with 81.7% (49 of 60) in those patients who remained H. pylori-positive after treatment (P < 0.001). In two of the three patients who suffered duodenal ulcer relapse after being cured of H. pylori infection, H. pylori was present again at the time of relapse. The data suggest that curing H. pylori infection results in long-term cure of duodenal ulcer disease and that duodenal ulcer relapses in successfully treated patients are most often associated with H. pylori reinfection.

412,412,412,11307304,"Helicobacter pylori(H. pylori) infection is recognized to be a pathogen of various gastro-duodenal diseases. Eradication therapy of H. pylori reduces the recurrence of gastro-duodenal ulcer, and improves gastritis histologically. Recently, proton pump inhibitor(PPI) based triple therapy, that combining PPI, clarithromycin, amoxicillin is widely accepted throughout the world, and shows high eradication rate which ranged about 80-90%. In Japan, one week triple therapy is recommended for the treatment of gastro-duodenal ulcer, though it is expected the improvement of recurrent peptic ulcer. In the present studies, the rate of clarithromycin resistant strains has been increased gradually, and this fact may lead to the development of failure of PPI based triple therapy. Another problem is suggested by several studies that gastro-esophageal reflux disease(GERD) may increase after successful eradication of H. pylori. Reflux esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus are recognized as precancerous lesion of esophageal adenocarcinoma, but the association of newly occurrence of GERD after H. pylori eradication and increase of esophageal adenocarcinoma is not clear.

We analyzed the urine cultures positive for Escherichia coli obtained from samples collected at the 10 primary health care centers of the health-care area of El Bierzo and Laciana (Leon, Spain) between the years 2002 and 2007. In vitro resistances of these germs to several common use antibiotics were determined: fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin, tobramycin, cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cotrimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ampicillin. The existence of statistically significant (p < 0.05) differences in sensitivity comparing the years 2002 and 2007, including all antimicrobials except cefixime, was analyzed by the chi-square test. For cefixime we compared the results between 2002 and 2005. An increase of the resistance of Escherichia coli isolated in urine to all antimicrobials under study has occurred, except for nitrofurantoin, being the differences statistically significant in most cases. Nevertheless, resistances to fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin have remained below 6% throughout the study period. Resistances to tobramycin and cefuroxime were slightly over 10% and cefixime below 3.4%, although in the last one we only have data until 2005. Resistances to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, initially low, have progressively increase reaching 20.6% in 2007.

416,416,416,12969091,"Several studies have shown that Helicobacter pylori eradication rates with standard 7-day triple therapy are unsatisfactory. A novel 10-day sequential treatment regimen recently achieved a significantly higher eradication rate. To improve the pharmacotherapeutic cost, we evaluated whether an acceptable eradication rate could be achieved in peptic ulcer patients by halving the dose of clarithromycin. In a prospective, open-label study, 152 duodenal ulcer patients with H. pylori infection, assessed by rapid urease test and histology, were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive either a 10-day sequential treatment comprising rabeprazole 20 mg b.d. plus amoxicillin 1 g b.d. for the first 5 days, followed by rabeprazole 20 mg b.d., clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. and tinidazole 500 mg b.d. for the remaining 5 days (high-dose therapy), or a similar schedule with the clarithromycin doses halved to 250 mg b.d. (low-dose therapy). No further antisecretory drugs were offered. Four to six weeks after therapy, H. pylori eradication and ulcer healing rates were assessed by endoscopy. Similar H. pylori eradication rates were observed following high- and low-dose regimens for both per protocol (97.3% vs. 95.9%; P = N.S.) and intention-to-treat (94.7% vs. 92.2%; P = N.S.) analyses. No major side-effects were reported. At repeat endoscopy, peptic ulcer healing was observed in 93% and 93% of patients following high- and low-dose therapy, respectively.

The prevalence of H. pylori was detected by Giemsa stain, followed by the urea breath test (UBT). H. pylori(+) patients were scheduled to undergo 7-day triple therapy and the success of eradication was investigated by UBT. Forty-five (44%) patients were positive for H. pylori. Forty of them underwent triple therapy and 39 (98%) patients completed the treatment. Eradication was successful in 32 (82%) and unsuccessful in 7 (18%) patients. There was no significant difference between these groups in age, gender, endoscopic findings or HD, and only previous treatment was significant for eradication failure by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Side effects were observed in 2 (15%) of 13 HD(+) and 3 (11%) of 27 HD(-) patients, and one HD(-) patient had to stop medication because of severe nausea and vomiting.

Combinations of antibiotics with bismuth (triple therapy) eradicate the organism in around 90% of cases, but the regimens are complicated, and poor compliance and significant side effects are frequently seen. The observation that omeprazole in combination with a single antibiotic provides eradication rates of over 80% is an important advance, as this combination is a simple regimen and is well tolerated. In this article, the role of omeprazole in eradication therapy is discussed, the published data are reviewed and hypotheses relating to the mode of action of omeprazole are presented.

This study aimed to test T. mesenterica (Tm) efficacy in vivo on eradication of Hp. This IRB-approved study included 52 consenting patients diagnosed with Hp infections. The patients were selected for 10-day treatments with one of the three arms of the protocol, namely, (i) Tm 2 g, (ii) Tm given with omeprazole 20 mg, or (iii) omeprazole 20 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, and amoxicillin 1000 mg (all regimens given twice daily). The Tm submerged cultivated mycelium in the form of tablets (1 g) was supplied free of charge to patients. Three weeks after completing the therapy, breath testing was assessed for Hp eradication. The patients who took the standard triple therapy had a 70% (n = 14) eradication rate of Hp. Of the patients taking Tm, with and without omeprazole, only one had a breath test indicative of eradication of Hp, p < 0.000. Tm-treated patients had fewer adverse events and equivalent symptomatic relief. Limitations of this study include the brief duration of Tm therapy. Longer treatment might achieve better results, but was judged to be not warranted, so as to not excessively further delay accepted therapy. Ten-day Tm was not found to be effective in vivo in eradicating Hp, whether if given with or without omeprazole. Significant symptomatic relief found among Tm-treated patients suggests that further study of Tm is well justified. ","Yellow brain culinary-medicinal mushroom, Tremella mesenterica Ritz.:Fr.

428,428,428,16595135,"A sensitive and reliable method using liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry has been developed and validated for the trace determination of beta-lactam antibiotics in natural and wastewater matrices. Water samples were enriched by solid-phase extraction. The analytes included amoxicillin (AMOX), ampicillin (AMP), oxacillin (OXA), cloxacillin (CLOX) and cephapirin (CEP). Average recoveries of beta-lactams (BLs) in fortified samples were generally above 75% (except amoxicillin) with the standard deviations lower than 10% in water matrices. Amoxicillin was not quantified due to poor recovery (less than 40%) in the investigated water matrices. Matrix effects were found to be minimal when measuring these compounds in water matrices. The accuracy, within- and between-run precision of the assay fell within acceptable ranges of 15% absolute. The method detection limit (MDL) was estimated to range between 8 and 10 ng/L in surface water, 13 and 18 ng/L in the influent and 8 and 15 ng/L in the effluent from a wastewater treatment plant. A large number of actual water samples were analyzed using this method in order to evaluate the occurrence of the beta-lactams in a river and a wastewater treatment plant in northern Colorado. Most of the samples were negative for all analytes. These compounds were found at 15-17 ng/L in the three influent samples and at 9-11 ng/L in three surface water samples out of a total of 200 samples.

The objective of the study was to determine if comparable quality control results for Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, a beta-lactamase-producing strain, would be produced for the three beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor agents with Haemophilus test medium and Mueller-Hinton medium. The criteria used in this study to determine if Haemophilus test medium was acceptable for quality control testing of E. coli ATCC 35218 was that 100% of the results obtained with an antimicrobial agent-methodology combination needed to be within the acceptable NCCLS ranges established with Mueller-Hinton medium. The MIC testing results obtained by the broth microdilution and E-test methods with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and piperacillin-tazobactam were all within the NCCLS ranges; however, the results obtained with ampicillin-sulbactam by both methods were not within the NCCLS ranges.

430,430,430,15930204,"The widespread use of antibiotics for treatment of acute otitis media (AOM) has resulted in the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens that are difficult to treat. However, it has been shown that most children with nonsevere AOM recover without ABX. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety, efficacy, acceptability, and costs of a non-ABX intervention for children with nonsevere AOM. Children 6 months to 12 years old with AOM were screened by using a novel AOM-severity screening index. Parents of children with nonsevere AOM received an educational intervention, and their children were randomized to receive either immediate antibiotics (ABX; amoxicillin plus symptom medication) or watchful waiting (WW; symptom medication only). The investigators, but not the parents, were blinded to enrollment status. Primary outcomes included parent satisfaction with AOM care, resolution of symptoms, AOM failure/recurrence, and nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains resistant to ABX. Secondary outcomes included medication-related adverse events, serious adverse events, unanticipated AOM-related office and emergency department visits and telephone calls, the child's absence from day care or school resulting from AOM, the parent's absence from school or work because of their child's AOM, and costs of treatment. Subjects were defined as failing (days 0-12) or recurring (days 13-30) if they experienced a higher AOM-severity score on reexamination. A total of 223 subjects were recruited: 73% were nonwhite, 57% were <2 years old, 47% attended day care, 82% had experienced prior AOM, and 83% had not been fully immunized with heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine. One hundred twelve were randomized to ABX, and 111 were randomized to WW. Ninety-four percent of the subjects were followed to the 30-day end point. Parent satisfaction with AOM care was not different between the 2 treatment groups at either day 12 or 30. Compared with WW, symptom scores on days 1 to 10 resolved faster in subjects treated with immediate ABX. At day 12, among the immediate-ABX group, 69% of tympanic membranes and 25% of tympanograms were normal, compared with 51% of normal tympanic membranes and 10% of normal tympanograms in the WW group. Parents of children in the ABX group gave their children fewer doses of pain medication than did parents of children in the WW group. Subjects in the ABX group experienced 16% fewer failures than subjects in the WW group. Of the children in the WW group, 66% completed the study without needing ABX. Immediate ABX resulted in eradication of S pneumoniae carriage in the majority of children, but S pneumoniae strains cultured from children in the ABX group at day 12 were more likely to be multidrug-resistant than strains from children in the WW group. More ABX-related adverse events were noted in the ABX group, compared with the WW group. No serious AOM-related adverse events were observed in either group. Office and emergency department visits, phone calls, and days of work/school missed were not different between groups. Prescriptions for ABX were reduced by 73% in the WW group compared with the ABX group. Costs of ABX averaged $47.41 per subject in the ABX group and $11.43 in the WW group. Sixty-six percent of subjects in the WW group completed the study without ABX. Parent satisfaction was the same between groups regardless of treatment. Compared with WW, immediate ABX treatment was associated with decreased numbers of treatment failures and improved symptom control but increased ABX-related adverse events and a higher percent carriage of multidrug-resistant S pneumoniae strains in the nasopharynx at the day-12 visit. Key factors in implementing a WW strategy were (a) a method to classify AOM severity; (b) parent education; (c) management of AOM symptoms; (d) access to follow-up care; and (e) use of an effective ABX regimen, when needed. When these caveats are observed, WW may be an acceptable alternative to immediate ABX for some children with nonsevere AOM.

431,431,431,11247866,"To assess the cost effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for haematogenous bacterial arthritis in patients with joint disease. In a decision analysis, data from a prospective study on bacterial arthritis in 4907 patients with joint disease were combined with literature data to assess risks and benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis. Effectiveness and cost effectiveness calculations were performed on antibiotic prophylaxis for various patient groups. Grouping was based on (a) type of event leading to transient bacteraemia-that is, infections (dermal, respiratory/urinary tract) and invasive medical procedures-and (b) the patient's susceptibility to bacterial arthritis which was increased in the presence of rheumatoid arthritis, large joint prostheses, comorbidity, and old age. Of the patients with joint disease, 59% had no characteristics that increased susceptibility to bacterial arthritis, and 31% had one. For dermal infections, the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis was maximally 35 quality adjusted life days (QALDs) and the cost effectiveness maximally $52 000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY). For other infections, the effectiveness of prophylaxis was lower and the cost effectiveness higher. Prophylaxis for invasive medical procedures seemed to be acceptable only in patients with high susceptibility: 1 QALD at a cost of $1300/QALY; however, the results were influenced substantially when the level of efficacy of the prophylaxis or cost of prophylactic antibiotics was changed. Prophylaxis seems to be indicated only for dermal infections, and for infections of the urinary and respiratory tract in patients with increased susceptibility to bacterial arthritis. Prophylaxis for invasive medical procedures, such as dental treatment, may only be indicated for patients with joint disease who are highly susceptible.

The contamination rate of the MSU samples varied from 46 to 69% between the different hospitals, indicating that in the postpartum period positive MSU findings would necessitate more thorough examination in order to confirm the diagnosis of urinary tract infection. In our study, suprapubic aspiration was found to be a simple and acceptable method without any side effects. Confirmed bacteriuria occurred in 3.2% of the women. Operative delivery (Cesarean section, forceps and vacuum extractor delivery), epidural anesthesia and bladder catheterization increased the risk of bacteriuria in the postpartum period. Only 27% of the women with positive bladder urine complained of dysuria and this symptom was significantly more common in women who had been catheterized. 230 patients with confirmed bacteriuria with amoxycillin-sensitive bacterias participated in a randomized short-course treatment trial: 114 women received 3 days treatment with amoxycillin (1.5 g/day), 116 received the traditional 10 days therapy (750 mg amoxycillin/day).

To establish a nationwide status quo of compliance of German ambulatory pediatric patients with oral antibiotics prescribed for various bacterial infections. In this study, organized and financed by the German Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases, 42 pediatricians in private practice who were selected to represent the 3 main regions of Germany and residence in large cities or small towns, respectively, enrolled consecutive patients who had bacterial infections that required therapy with oral antibiotics. Choice of agent and duration of treatment were left to the study physicians. Compliance was measured by a standardized telephone interview on the penultimate day and a urine bioassay for antibacterial activity on the last day of the planned treatment period. Parents did not know the true purpose of the study. Five hundred eight-four patients were fully evaluable. The most frequent diagnoses included tonsillopharyngitis (n = 231), otitis media (n = 170) and lower respiratory tract infections (n = 114). Most frequently prescribed antibiotics included amoxicillin (n = 102), potassium penicillin V (n = 81) and clarithromycin (n = 67). Overall compliance (positive urine test) on the last day of therapy was 69.5% (406 of 584 patients). Compliance was not significantly influenced by the region of residence or the underlying bacterial infection. It was significantly associated with the antibiotic used (macrolides, 89.0%; penicillins, 62.2%; cephalosporins, 66.4%; P = 0.0001 for macrolides vs. the others). Best compliance was found with clarithromycin (94.0%) and erythromycin estolate (89.8%). Compliance was also significantly better in patients > or =6 years old (77.7%; P = 0.016); with a treatment duration of < or =7 days (77.6%; P = 0.014); when the drug package contained a dose-taking reminder (79.7%; P = 0.003); and when the pediatrician's behavior toward the patient was assessed by the parents as ""very sympathetic"" or ""sympathetic"" (72.6%; P = 0.017). Subjecting all variables to logistic regression analysis, we found 3 variables to be significant predictors of treatment compliance: choice of antibiotic (P = 0.0001); patient age (P = 0.0008); and residence in town or city (P = 0.03).

Whereas some variables significantly associated with compliance cannot be influenced (patient age; place of residence in town or city), others are amenable to modifications. These include the physician-patient interaction and the choice of antibiotic. Agents should be preferred that are well-accepted by patients, that enable short-term therapy with few daily doses and with a package that contains a dose-taking reminder.

In a randomised, double-blind study, we compared amoxycillin with erythromycin in this setting. 210 pregnant women with Chlamydia trachomatis infection were randomly assigned 7 days' treatment with amoxycillin (500 mg three times daily) or erythromycin (500 mg four times daily). Control cultures were obtained 21 days after treatment, during late pregnancy, and from the infant within a week of birth. Treatment was judged a failure if any post-treatment culture was positive or if the patient had to stop therapy because of severe side-effects. 11 women (5.2%) were lost to follow-up. 1 (of 100) amoxycillin-treated women had to stop treatment because of severe side-effects compared with 12 (of 99) erythromycin-treated women (p = 0.002). 1 woman in the amoxycillin group had a positive culture at the third-trimester examination. No positive post-treatment culture was found in the erythromycin group. Severe gastrointestinal side-effects were more common in women who received erythromycin (31 vs 6%, p < 0.001). The overall failure rate was therefore 2% in the amoxycillin group and 12% in the erythromycin group (p = 0.005).

These antibiotics were classified into three groups according to their in vitro activities (MICs at which 50 and 90% of the isolates are inhibited). Beta-Lactams of the first group (these included imipenem, cefpirome, FK-037, cefditoren, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and cefepime) showed activities higher than or similar to that of penicillin against penicillin-resistant viridans group streptococci. However, 80% of highly penicillin-resistant Streptococcus mitis organisms required cefotaxime and ceftriaxone MICs of > or = 2 micrograms/ml (range, 2 to 16 micrograms/ml). Beta-Lactams of the second group (cefpodoxime, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, piperacillin, and cefuroxime) showed lower activities than penicillin. Finally, antibiotics of the third group (cephalothin, oxacillin, ceftazidime, cefixime, cefaclor, cefetamet, cefadroxil, cephalexin, and ceftibuten) showed poor in vitro activities.

Therefore, further approaches aimed to improve standard triple therapy efficacy should be attempted. This prospective, pilot study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic role of either Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) or a high concentration of probiotics in addition to standard triple therapies for H. pylori eradication. The study enrolled 65 consecutive dyspeptic patients with H. pylori infection. All patients underwent upper endoscopy with gastric biopsies. Patients were assigned to receive one of the following therapies: (a) standard 7-day triple; (b) the same 7-day triple therapy plus L. reuteri supplementation; (c) the same 7-day triple therapy plus a probiotic mixture; and d) a 14-day standard triple therapy plus a probiotic mixture. H. pylori eradication was checked by using a 13C-urea breath test performed 4-6 weeks after treatment. No therapy regimen achieved > 80% eradication rate at both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses. Although the 14-day therapy plus a probiotic mixture tended to achieve higher eradication rate (71%), no statistically significant difference emerged among the different therapy regimens tested (range: 53-71%). The lowest incidence of side-effects was observed following the 7-day therapy plus L. reuteri (6%) and highest with the 14-day triple therapy plus probiotic mixture (33%), although the difference failed to reach the statistically significance.

Since concentrations above this level are reported to occur following an oral dose of 3 g of amoxycillin, this doses for prophylaxis has become widely accepted in USA and the UK, and presently also in Sweden. Nevertheless, in individuals who cannot tolerate a high single dose of amoxycillin, there is need for an alternative dosage regimen. In the present study, we have compared the pharmacokinetics in 12 healthy volunteers, of a single dose of 3 g of amoxycillin with those of 1 g as single dose or combined with 1 g of probenecid. The combination resulted in an AUC twice as large as that achieved after 1 g of amoxycillin, and was slightly, but not significantly, larger than that after 3 g. However, amoxycillin concentrations above 0.12 mg/l were sustained for almost 14 h with the combination as compared to 10.4 hours following 3 g of amoxycillin only (p less than 0.001).

To test this hypothesis, 72 patients below 24 months of age with otitis media were randomly divided into a group that received a prescription indicating amoxicillin should be given by teaspoon and a group that received a labeled syringe for this purpose.

Consecutive adults fulfilling a standard definition of lower respiratory tract infection presenting to 14 general practitioners in two neighbouring practices were allocated to antibiotic therapy in a random, single-blind manner. The outcome of treatment was assessed by the time taken by the patient to return to normal activities or work, the speed of resolution of symptoms, number of repeat consultations and side effects. The profile of the 221 patients receiving amoxycillin was very similar to that of the 221 receiving clarithromycin. The two groups did not differ greatly in requirement to visit the general practitioner again within either 4 weeks (20% amoxycillin group; 25% clarithromycin group) or 3 months (31% compared with 36%) of the original infection, in time taken to return to normal activities (6 days for group taking amoxycillin; 5 days for those on clarithromycin) or work (5 days for both groups), or in speed of resolution of symptoms.

In the five patients from whose sputum this organism could not be cultured, and in one from whom it could, there was no improvement. Untoward effects were limited to nausea in one patient and acceptability of the regimen by the remaining patients was unanimous. There was no evidence of accumulation of the drug in serum or sputum. The rapidity of effect and oral form of the treatment suggest that it may provide a simple out-patient regimen for chronic bronchial sepsis and severe purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis from which H. influenzae can be cultured.

We conducted a prospective controlled study with the aim of testing whether the vitamin C supplement to the therapy includes lower dosage of clarithromycin could have an acceptable influence on Helicobacter pylori eradication in comparison with routine anti-Helicobacter pylori regimen. Two hundred and fourteen consecutive patients with the verification of Helicobacter pylori infection via positive Rapid Urease Test (RUT) and histology results were included and divided into two therapy groups: 1) a group without vitamin C (n = 100) that were administered 20 mg omeprazol, 1 g amoxicillin, and 500 mg clarithromycin twice daily for 2 weeks and 2) a triple-plus-vitamin C group (n = 114) that was administered 20 mg omeprazol, 1 g amoxicillin, 250 mg clarithromycin plus 250 mg vitamin C twice daily for 2 weeks. Four weeks after the completion of therapy, each patient was scheduled for urea breath test to assess the success of Helicobacter pylori eradication.

458,458,458,9191627,"Traditionally, patients presenting with uncomplicated dyspepsia have been managed using empiric antisecretory therapy, followed by endoscopy in the event of persistent symptoms or complication. Since Helicobacter pylori is now accepted as an important and potentially reversible cause of ulcer disease, it is important to reevaluate the management of dyspepsia. The goal of this study is to evaluate seven outpatient strategies for the management of dyspeptic patients using a cost-utility analysis. The study design was that of a cost-utility analysis. The model assumes that an adult patient with signs of dyspepsia but no signs of complication presents to the outpatient office of a primary care physician. Seven strategies are modeled: empiric antisecretory therapy; empiric H pylori eradication using oral omeprazole (20 mg [corrected] twice daily), clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily), and amoxicillin (1000 mg twice daily); use of either upper endoscopy, an upper gastrointestinal barium study (an upper GI), or the serum titer for H pylori as a diagnostic test to identify patients for H pylori eradication; or use of an initial diagnostic test followed by the serum titer for H pylori. The primary outcome was the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for each strategy for a 1-year period from presentation; secondary outcomes included the probability of symptomatic ulcer recurrence, cost per ulcer cure, and mortality. Three strategies were similarly cost-effective: empiric H pylori eradication ($1198 per QALY), use of a serum H pylori titer as an initial diagnostic test ($1214 per QALY), and empiric antisecretory therapy ($1288 per QALY). Empiric antisecretory therapy, however, was associated with significantly more symptomatic ulcer recurrences and deaths than any other strategy. This cost-utility analysis suggests that two strategies are reasonable for patients presenting with dyspepsia: (1) empiric H pylori eradication and (2) use of a serum H pylori titer to identify patients who might benefit from H pylori eradication. The latter strategy may be preferable because it is less likely to lead to antibiotic resistance. Strategies utilizing an upper GI or upper endoscopy (either with or without serum H pylori titer) or empiric antisecretory therapy do not improve outcomes and are associated with greater cost, morbidity, and/or mortality.

In fact the combination of amoxicillin + clavulanic acid causes more gastrointestinal adverse effects (including potentially severe diarrhoea) than any other antibacterial agent.

Under baseline conditions, the effectiveness of MINO, AZM, CAM, and LVFX were on a par and higher than that of AMPC/CVA or CFDN by 125-290.5 QALD. The least expensive antibiotic was MINO (55,070 to 59,208 yen), followed by AZM (56,049 to 60,188 yen), CAM (56,171 to 60,309 yen), LVFX (61,988 to 66,127 yen). AMPC/CVA (122,432 to 133,797 yen), and CFDN (123,375 to 134,649 yen). Thus, MINO, AZM, and CAM were cost-effective antibiotics for adults with community-acquired pneumonia. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the initial success rate of each antibiotic was crucial in determining cost-effectiveness. When the number of times antibiotics are taken in a day and the period of therapy were taken into account, AZM was most beneficial with 917,179-1,152,694 yen (US$ 7,643-9,606) per additional QALY over MINO in patients without comorbidity. This result, however, was not applicable to patients with chronic lung disease. MINO was the least expensive and the most cost-effective in empirically treating adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia on an ambulatory basis. AZM provides a higher quality of life for adults without comorbidity with generally acceptable marginal cost.

Two different formulations of the agent were employed in the study. The first formulation consisting of 3.0 g amoxycillin and 125 mg clavulanic acid, achieved a cure rate of 75% (i.e. eighteen out of twenty-four patients) among PPNG infections, but 100% cure rate among nine patients with non-PPNG infections. The second formulation consisting of 3.0 g amoxycillin and 250 mg clavulanic acid, had a cure rate of 86% (i.e. fifty-seven out of sixty-six patients) among PPNG infections, and 91% (i.e. ten out of eleven patients) among non-PPNG infections. Clavulanic acid appears to potentiate and enhance the activity of amoxycillin against the beta-lactamase produced by the gonococci.

480,480,480,6484552,"Recommendations of the Swiss Working Group for Prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis. Despite the lack of definitive evidence for the efficacy of antibiotics in the prevention of bacterial endocarditis (BE) in man, it is accepted practice for antibiotics to be administered to patients at risk of developing BE following a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure which may cause bacteremia. The prophylactic regimens so far recommended are cumbersome and compliance is poor. An attempt is made to unify and simplify Swiss recommendations, taking into account the authors' own recent experimental results, pharmacological data, and clinical experience. It is proposed that the patients be classified into two risk groups: First, patients with congenital and acquired heart disease, previous palliative or non-definitive cardiac surgery, mitral valve prolapse with mitral insufficiency, and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy should be considered at moderate risk. For those patients a single dose of an orally administered antibiotic should be given 1 h before the procedure. The first choice antibiotic should be amoxicillin (3 g orally) for all procedures, except when S. aureus is likely to cause bacteremia (i.e. after drainage of abscesses, where flucloxacillin (2 g orally) should be used 1 h before the procedure). Amoxicillin is also recommended for patients receiving penicillin during the days prior to the procedure (for prevention of rheumatic fever, or for any other reason). Patients allergic to penicillin should be given 600 mg clindamycin orally 1 h before the procedure. Second, patients with valvular prosthesis or previous BE should be considered at high risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) ",[Prevention of bacterial endocarditis.

Preparation of DL involves two steps, first formation of primary (inner) liposomes by thin film hydration method containing one drug, then addition of suspension of inner liposomes on thin film of lipid containing the other drug. The success of formation of DL was characterized by optical and transmission electron microscopy. Quantitation of DL-bacterial interaction was evaluated in terms of percent growth inhibition (%GI) on reference strain of H. pylori ATCC 26695. To confirm specific binding efficacy of DL to H. pylori PE surface receptor we performed an agglutination assay. Agglutination in DL treated H. pylori suspension suggested selectivity of DL towards the PE surface receptor of H. pylori. Monotherapy is generally not recommended for treatment of a H. pylori infection due to the danger of development of resistance and unacceptably low eradication rates. Therefore combination therapy with amoxicillin trihydrate (AMOX) as anti-H. pylori agent and ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC) as antisecretory agent were selected for the study with an expectation that this dual-drug delivery approach will exert acceptable anti-H. pylori activity.

However, there was inconsistency when prescribing for penicillin-allergic patients, with three-quarters of respondents opting for inappropriate regimens, and almost half favouring an outdated erythromycin regimen. There was also inconsistency in prescribing for patients with a prosthetic joint. Most respondents considered their practice to be adequately equipped to handle an allergic reaction.

Rather, the recognition process relies on the use of an anion carrier (which carries the penicillin anion from the aqueous sample into the membrane), a proton receptor (lipophilic nile blue which accepts the proton, thereby undergoing a change in fluorescence intensity), and a new lipophilic hydroxylic plasticizer material (which facilitates ion transport). All materials are contained in a dyed poly(vinyl chloride) membrane whose fluorescence is monitored. The optical sensor fully reversibly responds to penicillin V over the 0.01-10mM concentration range, and to penicillin G from 0.03 to 10mM.

497,497,497,37493159,"Group A ß-hemolytic  This article aims to familiarize clinicians with the clinical manifestations, evaluation, diagnosis, and management of GABHS pharyngitis. A search was conducted in December 2022 in PubMed Clinical Queries using the key term ""group A β-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis"". This review covers mainly literature published in the previous ten years. Children with GABHS pharyngitis typically present with an abrupt onset of fever, intense pain in the throat, pain on swallowing, an inflamed pharynx, enlarged and erythematous tonsils, a red and swollen uvula, enlarged tender anterior cervical lymph nodes. As clinical manifestations may not be specific, even experienced clinicians may have difficulties diagnosing GABHS pharyngitis solely based on epidemiologic or clinical grounds alone. Patients suspected of having GABHS pharyngitis should be confirmed by microbiologic testing (e.g., culture, rapid antigen detection test, molecular point-of-care test) of a throat swab specimen prior to the initiation of antimicrobial therapy. Microbiologic testing is generally unnecessary in patients with pharyngitis whose clinical and epidemiologic findings do not suggest GABHS. Clinical score systems such as the Centor score and McIssac score have been developed to help clinicians decide which patients should undergo diagnostic testing and reduce the unnecessary use of antimicrobials. Antimicrobial therapy should be initiated without delay once the diagnosis is confirmed. Oral penicillin V and amoxicillin remain the drugs of choice. For patients who have a non-anaphylactic allergy to penicillin, oral cephalosporin is an acceptable alternative. For patients with a history of immediate, anaphylactic-type hypersensitivity to penicillin, oral clindamycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin are acceptable alternatives. Early diagnosis and antimicrobial treatment are recommended to prevent suppurative complications (e.g., cervical lymphadenitis, peritonsillar abscess) and non-suppurative complications (particularly rheumatic fever) as well as to reduce the severity of symptoms, to shorten the duration of the illness and to reduce disease transmission.

Due to the lack of sensitivity of the UV-vis detection, a solvent extraction/solid-phase extraction (SPE) method applied for off-line preconcentration and cleanup of water samples, in combination with an on-line preconcentration methodology named large volume sample stacking (LVSS) have been applied. The analytes included nafcillin, dicloxacillin, cloxacillin, oxacillin, ampicillin, penicillin G and amoxicillin. Average recoveries for water samples fortified with the studied beta-lactams at different concentration levels (1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 microg/L) were ranging between 94 and 99%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 10%. The precision, calculated as intra-day and inter-day standard deviations fell within acceptable ranges (3.3-7.2%). The limits of detection were estimated to range between 0.08 and 0.80 microgL(-1) for the studied compounds. All the samples analyzed were negative for all the analytes at these levels of concentration and the method showed its usefulness for the detection of these widely applied beta-lactam antibiotics in different kinds of waters.

499,499,499,16601883,"Persistent trimethylaminuria in children is caused by autosomal recessively inherited impairment of hepatic trimethylamine (TMA) oxidation due to deficiency of flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) secondary to mutations in the FMO3 gene. Trimethylaminuria or 'fish odour syndrome' is due to excessive excretion into body fluids and breath of TMA derived from the enterobacterial metabolism of dietary precursors. The disorder is present from birth but becomes apparent as foods containing high amounts of choline or of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) from marine (sea or saltwater) fish are introduced into the diet. In our experience, trimethylaminuria (FMO3 deficiency) in children is rare. We have compared the dynamics and diagnostic efficacy of choline loading with marine fish meals in six children with trimethylaminuria. Loading with a marine fish meal provides a simple and acceptable method for confirmation of diagnosis of suspected trimethylaminuria in children, with the effects being cleared more quickly than with a choline load test. However, oral loading with choline bitartrate allows estimation of residual oxidative capacity in vivo and is a useful adjunct to molecular studies. Patients homozygous for the 'common' P153L mutation in the FMO3 gene showed virtual complete lack of residual TMA N-oxidative capacity, consistent with a nonfunctional or absent FMO3 enzyme, whereas a patient with the M82T mutation showed some residual oxidative capacity. A patient compound heterozygous for two novel mutations, G193E and R483T, showed considerable residual N-oxidative capacity. A further patient, heterozygous for two novel sequence variations in the FMO3 gene, consistently showed malodour and elevated urinary TMA/TMAO ratios under basal conditions but a negative response to both choline and marine fish meal loading. Comparison of the effects of administration of antibiotics (metronidazole, amoxicillin, neomycin) on gut bacterial production of trimethylamine from choline showed they all reduced TMA production to a limited extent, with neomycin being most effective.

In industrialized countries, a proton pump inhibitor plus clarithromycin and amoxicillin or nitroimidazole have shown the best results. Our aims were: 1. To study the eradication rate of the association of a proton pump inhibitor plus tinidazole and clarithromycin on H. pylori infection in our population. 2. To determine if previous treatments, gender, age, tobacco, alcohol use, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) change the response to therapy. Two hundred patients with peptic ulcer (upper endoscopy) and H. pylori infection (histology and rapid urease test - RUT) were included. A proton pump inhibitor (lanzoprazole 30 mg or omeprazole 20 mg), tinidazole 500 mg, and clarithromycin 250 mg were dispensed twice a day for a seven-day period. Eradication was assessed after 10 to 12 weeks of treatment through histology and RUT. The eradication rate of H. pylori per protocol was 65% (128/196 patients). This rate was 53% for previously treated patients, rising to 76% for not previously treated patients, with a statistical difference p<0.01. No significant difference was observed regarding sex, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and NSAID use, but for elderly patients the difference was p = 0.05. Adherence to treatment was good, and side effects were mild. A proton pump inhibitor, tinidazole, and clarithromycin bid for seven days resulted in H. pylori eradication in 65% of the patients.

This study evaluated the prevalence of Plesiomonas shigelloides and their antibiogram fingerprints in water sample collected from four rivers in South-western Nigeria. In all, 148 presumptive Plesiomonas shigelloides isolates was recovered from the rivers out of which 66 (44.6%) were confirmed positive for the organism using polymerase chain reaction techniques. Confirmed isolates were evaluated for their antibiogram profiles against a panel of 20 antimicrobials using the disc diffusion method and further screened for relevant antibiotic resistance genes. Resistance of the isolates against the antimicrobials followed the order: sulphamethoxazole (100%), erythromycin (93%), ampicillin (90%), cephalotin (82%), streptomycin (64%), and chloramphenicol (58%), amoxicillin (53%), cefotaxime (50%), tetracycline (49%), neomycin (38%) and trimethoprim + sulphamethoxazole (38%). Conversely, all the isolates were susceptible against netilmicin, and susceptibility against the other antibiotics follows the order: meropenem (94%), gentamicin (88%), imipenem (79%), amikacin (70%), ciprofloxacin (70%), norfloxacin (59%), trimethoprim (56%) and ceftazidine (56%). The multiple antibiotic resistance indices of the organism were higher than the accepted threshold of 0.2. The incidence of 11 antimicrobial resistance determinants were obtained as follows: [sulphonamides; (sulI (18%), sulII (20%), dfr1 (70%), dfr(18) (5%)), [beta-lactams; (ampC 37%)], [tetracyclines; (tetA (78%), tetE (57%)], [phenicols; (catII (16%), cmlA1 (11%)] and [aminoglycosides; (aphA2 (36%) and strA (67%)]. Pearson chi-square exact test revealed positive associations among tetA, tetE, sullI and catII and tetA genes.

502,502,502,16164453,"After penicillins, cephalosporins are the betalactams that most often induce IgE-mediated reactions. The development of diagnostic tests has been delayed, however, because the cephalosporin allergenic determinants have not been properly identified. To evaluate the usefulness of skin tests, serum specific IgE assays, and challenges in diagnosing immediate reactions to cephalosporins and to clarify the pathogenic mechanism of such reactions. We studied 76 adults with immediate reactions to cephalosporins, mainly ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime. Skin tests and serum specific IgE assays were performed for culprit cephalosporins and cefaclor, as well as for penicillin, amoxicillin, and ampicillin. Some subjects with negative results underwent challenges and re-evaluations. Responses to cephalosporins other than the culprit ones were also studied. In the first allergologic work-up, an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to penicillins and/or cephalosporins was diagnosed in 63 (82.9%) of the 76 patients on the basis of skin-test and/or specific IgE assay positivity. Of the 13 negative patients, eight accepted challenges and underwent re-evaluations. Considering both first- and second-evaluation results, the skin-test-positivity rate increased from 76.3% to 85.5% and that of sepharose-radioimmunoassay positivity from 67.1% to 74.3%. Overall, an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity was diagnosed in 70 patients (in seven after retesting). On the basis of skin-test and CAP-FEIA results, we classified our 76 patients into five groups: group A (three patients), positive only to penicillin reagents; B (17), positive to both cephalosporin and penicillin reagents; C (24), positive to more than one cephalosporin; D (21), positive only to the responsible cephalosporin; E (11) negative to skin tests and CAP-FEIA, including five sepharose-radioimmunoassay positive. Most immediate reactions to cephalosporins appear to be IgE-mediated. Cephalosporin skin testing and sepharose-radioimmunoassay are useful tools for evaluating these reactions. Cephalosporin IgE-mediated hypersensitivity may be a transient condition; therefore, allergologic exams should be repeated in patients with negative initial allergologic work-ups, including challenges.

Although PST is the gold standard, the results can be heterogeneous, and awaiting specialist assessment may take an inordinate amount of time. Therefore, oral provocation challenge has become acceptable for individuals with low-risk penicillin allergy histories. There also appears to be an association with increased prevalence of adverse drug reaction reporting in female individuals, which may translate to penicillin allergy prevalence; however, the evidence has not been assessed through a sex and gender lens. This systematic review will identify and synthesize the findings from studies that report measures of effectiveness and safety of interventions aimed at delabeling penicillin allergies in low-risk individuals. Information related to sex and gender will be extracted, where available, to understand potential differences in allergy reporting and patient outcomes. The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the Centre for Review and Dissemination's Guidance for Undertaking Reviews in Health Care will be used as frameworks for conducting this systematic review. The literature search will be conducted by a medical librarian (B. M. M.) and will consist of a search strategy to identify and retrieve published studies that meet our inclusion criteria. Studies that require penicillin skin testing (PST) as a step prior to other interventions will be excluded. Integrated knowledge translation involving co-design was carried out for this systematic review protocol creation. Data extraction will be conducted at four levels: (1) study level, (2) patient level, (3) intervention level, and (4) outcome level. A narrative descriptive synthesis of results and risk of bias of all included studies will be provided, and, if relevant, a meta-analysis will be performed. The dissemination of findings from this knowledge synthesis to various stakeholders is intended to inform on options for evidence-based interventions to aid in delabeling penicillin allergies in individuals with a low risk of experiencing a hypersensitivity reaction. Detailed reporting on the characteristics of delabeling interventions as well as the effectiveness of similar interventions will benefit policy makers considering the implementation of a penicillin allergy delabeling protocol.

In 2008, he presented with temperature and feeling rough. With a diagnosis of urine infection, he was prescribed ciprofloxacin, followed by trimethoprim, amoxicillin, and gentamicin, as temperature did not subside. White cell count was 21.2 x 109/L; lymphocytes were 13.05 x 109/L (1.00 - 4.00). Therefore, computerised tomography (CT) of chest and abdomen was performed. Thrombus was present in pulmonary arteries bilaterally involving the lobar and segmental branches. Enlarged lymph nodes were seen in axillae, chest, abdomen and inguinal regions. Radiological diagnosis was lymphoma. Cell marker showed an excess of large granular lymphocytes and activated lymphocytes. The Glandular Fever Slide Test was positive. Subsequently, Paul Bunnell test was also positive. Epstein Barr virus serology was consistent with recent Epstein Barr virus infection. Antibiotic was omitted; enoxaparin was prescribed for pulmonary artery thrombosis. Learning points from this case: (1) Although routine administration of antibiotic to a spinal cord injury patient with pyrexia may be acceptable in outpatient setting, other possibilities such as infection by multi-drug resistant organism, viral infection, venous or, arterial thrombosis should be considered if a patient does not respond promptly to antibacterial therapy. (2) When full blood count showed lymphocytosis (comprising > 50% of white blood cells) with atypical morphology, lymphocyte surface markers, Paul Bunnell test, and Epstein Barr virus serology should be performed. These tests would have led to a diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis, and abdominal imaging studies could have been avoided. (3) Lymphoid hyperplasia is the hallmark of infectious mononucleosis; therefore, we should have suspected glandular fever rather than lymphoma when CT scan revealed enlarged lymph nodes in abdomen, mediastinum, axillae and inguinal regions in this patient, who had lymphocytosis with atypical morphology. (4) A soft tissue mass, situated inferior to left hemidiaphragm in this asplenic patient, was misinterpreted as lymph nodes; review of CT led to the correct diagnosis of splenunculus. (5) Acute infection with Epstein Barr virus may lead to transient induction of anti-phospholipid antibodies, which can cause vascular thrombosis.

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a commonly used dosing strategy to optimize exposure and thereby minimize toxicity and maximize the efficacy. Currently, TDM of β-lactam antibiotics is rarely performed, due to poor availability in clinical practice. We describe an ultrafast Hydrophilic-Interaction Chromatography (HILIC) based UPLC-MS/MS method for the determination of amoxicillin, benzylpenicillin, cefotaxime, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, flucloxacillin, imipenem, meropenem and piperacillin in human plasma. This method involves simple sample preparation steps and was comprehensively validated according to standard FDA guidelines. For all analytes, mean accuracy and precision values were within the acceptance value. The lower and upper limits of quantification were found to be sufficient to cover the therapeutic range for all antibiotics. Finally, the method was successfully applied in a large pharmacokinetic study performed in the intensive care setting, and the feasibility of the analytical procedure was demonstrated in routine clinical practice. To the best of our knowledge, we report here the first HILIC-based UPLC-MS/MS assay for the determination of β-lactam antibiotics in human plasma.

507,507,507,32352619,"The aims of this study were to explore the development of bacterial resistance and cross-resistance in four common human pathogens following realistic exposure to antibiotics found in over-the-counter (OTC) sore throat medicines: gramicidin, neomycin, bacitracin and tyrothricin. Bacterial exposure to in-use (concentration in the product before use) and diluted concentration (i.e. during use) of antibiotic where conducted in broth for 24 h or until growth was visible. The changes in bacterial susceptibility profile before and after exposure was determined using standardized ISO microdilution broth. Antibiotic testing was performed according to EUCAST guidelines. We demonstrated that test bacteria were able to survive exposure to the in-use concentrations of some antibiotics used in OTC medicines. Exposure to during use concentrations of bacitracin resulted in stable increase in minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) (>8-fold) in Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii. Exposure to tyrothricin resulted in a stable increase in MIC (2·4-fold) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, and exposure to neomycin resulted in a stable increase MIC (5000-fold higher than the baseline) in Streptococcus pyogenes. Clinical cross-resistance to other antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid, gentamicin, cefpodoxime, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and cefotaxime) was also demonstrated following exposure to bacitracin or tyrothricin. Bacitracin exposure lead to a stable bacterial resistance after 10 passages. Our results indicate that OTC antibiotic medicines have the potential to drive resistance and cross-resistance in vitro. Tackling antibiotic resistance is a high worldwide priority. It is widely accepted that the overuse and misuse of antibiotics increase the risk of the development and spread of antibiotic resistance within communities. A number of OTC sore throat products, widely available across the world for topical use in respiratory indications, contain locally delivered antibiotics. Our findings showed that these antibiotics in OTC medicines present a risk for emerging cross-resistance in a number of bacterial respiratory pathogens.

508,508,508,20980572,"Nocardiosis is an underrecognized clinical entity in South Africa, for which interspecies epidemiological and clinical differences are poorly understood. The taxonomical state of flux and the lack of a simple antimicrobial susceptibility testing method are partly responsible. Definitive identification is molecularly based, which further complicates the study of this ubiquitous organism, as this methodology is beyond the scope of most routine diagnostic laboratories. The Etest methodology has been proposed as an alternative to the reference broth microdilution method, although there have been a limited number of comparative studies. We profiled 51 clinical isolates of aerobic actinomycetes, including 39 Nocardia species, using sequence-based (16S rRNA) identification. Broth microdilution and Etests were done concurrently on all isolates. The overall level of categorical and essential agreement for broth microdilution and Etest for the Nocardia isolates ranged from 67.5 to 100% and 46.2 to 81.6%, respectively. Very major errors were seen with amikacin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, and imipenem. For Nocardia species, uniform susceptibility to co-trimoxazole, amikacin, and linezolid was demonstrated, with a 48.8% susceptibility rate to imipenem. Nocardia farcinica (20.5%) and Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (15.4%) were the most commonly identified species among the 82% of isolates identified to species level using 16S rRNA sequences. Furthermore, drug susceptibility patterns demonstrated limited concordance with species identification. Our results suggest that, in a routine diagnostic setting, the Etest is not an acceptable alternative to the reference method of broth microdilution for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Given the diversity and limited understanding of this group of organisms, further widespread evaluation of clinical isolates, from both clinical and diagnostic perspectives, is warranted.

509,509,509,37653834,"Clinically, vertebral osteomyelitis commonly occurs in immunocompromised individuals, such as people with diabetes, immunosuppression, chronic liver disease, and malignancy. Microbiologically, vertebral osteomyelitis is commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus; however, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis (SDSE) may also potentially cause vertebral osteomyelitis, albeit rarely. Since no case reports have documented the occurrence of SDSE cervical osteomyelitis accompanied by progressive atlantoaxial subluxation, its clinical characteristics remain uncertain. Herein, we report the first case of progressive atlantoaxial subluxation in addition to cervical osteomyelitis due to septic atlantoaxial arthritis caused by SDSE in an immunocompetent individual, and provide a review of the relevant literature. A 63-year-old man with hypertension but no history of trauma or musculoskeletal disorders presented with worsening neck pain for 1 month without fever. Physical examination revealed neck pain due to neck retroflexion and tenderness with swelling of the upper cervical spine. No neurological deficit was observed. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed low-intensity areas on a T1-weighted image and high-intensity areas on a short tau inversion recovery image at the C2, C5, and C6 vertebral bodies with atlantoaxial subluxation. Two sets of blood culture tests (aerobic and anaerobic) were performed. The anaerobic blood culture bottle showed the presence of beta-hemolytic pyrrolidonyl arylamidase-negative SDSE expressing Lancefield group A antiserum. Hence, the patient was diagnosed with SDSE cervical osteomyelitis with atlantoaxial subluxation; intensive intravenous ampicillin (2 g every 6 hours) - which is effective against SDSE - was administered. Posterior fusion (occipital bone, C4) was performed on day 33 because a follow-up magnetic resonance imaging on day 31 revealed progression of atlantoaxial subluxation with thickened atlantodental soft tissue. The patient's neck pain was completely relieved after treatment with intravenous ampicillin for 6 weeks, followed by oral amoxicillin (1500 mg) daily for an additional 4 weeks. The patient did not experience recurrence or sequelae during the 2-year follow-up period.

510,510,510,29521136,"Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery is known to reduce the rate of surgical site infections (SSI) as well as shorten hospital stay. However, there is currently a scarcity of data on antibiotic prophylaxis and SSIs among African countries including Botswana. Consequently, this study aimed to address this. A prospective study involving 400 patients was carried out at a leading tertiary hospital in Botswana from 2014-2015. Patients' demographic information, type of surgery performed and peri-operative use of antibiotics were documented. All enrolled patients were followed-up for 30 days post discharge to fully document the incidence of SSIs. Median age of patients was 35.5 (25 - 50) years, with 52% female. There were 35.8% emergency and 64.2% elective surgeries. The most common operations were exploratory laparotomy (25%), appendectomy (18.3%), excision, and mastectomy (8%). Antibiotics were given in 73.3% of patients, mainly postoperatively (58.3%). The most commonly prescribed antibiotics were cefotaxime (80.7%), metronidazole (63.5%), cefradine (13.6%) and amoxicillin/clavulanate (11.6%). The incidence of SSI was 9%. The most common organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. The rate of SSI is a concern, and may be related to inappropriate antibiotic prophylaxis given post operatively. Interventions are in place to decrease SSI rates to acceptable levels in this leading hospital by improving for instance infection prevention practices including the timing of antibiotic prophylaxis. Research is also ongoing among other hospitals in Botswana to reduce SSI rates building on these findings.

512,512,512,29577668,"Recent reports have shown that food-borne or commensal bacteria can function as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance. However, the antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates of most milk samples or the total bacterial counts (TBC) in human milk from healthy donors, are not fully understood in Taiwan. Thus, five healthy mothers were randomly recruited each month, and totally 30 mothers without any symptoms of infection were recruited over 6 months. Milk samples were then harvested and analyzed immediately after collection. The antibiotic susceptibility was analyzed in bacteria isolated from milk samples using nine clinically relevant antibiotics, such as oxacillin, ampicillin, cephalothin, amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin, and oxytetracycline. The Staphylococcus strains (48 isolates) found in milk resisted to 48.6 ± 20.1% selected antibiotics. Streptococcus-related isolates (8 isolates) exhibited resistance to 41.7 ± 26.4% selected antibiotics. Acinetobacter isolates (5 isolates) were resistant to 66.7 ± 13.6% antibiotics, and Enterococcus isolates (5 isolates) were resistant to 73.3 ± 6.1% tested antibiotics. Rothia-related isolates (4 isolates) were resisted to 58.2 ± 31.9% of tested antibiotics. In contrast, Corynebacterium isolates (5 isolates) were sensitive to 66%-100% of selected antibiotics. Furthermore, the TBC ranged from 40 to 710,000 CFU/ml, implying a wide spectrum of bacteria in milk from healthy mothers. Despite this, all milk donors were healthy during sampling, and they did not show any symptoms related to mastitis or subclinical mastitis. According to the previously described TBC criteria for the use of donated human milk, only 73% of the current milk samples could be accepted for the milk bank. In conclusion, the majority of the isolated bacterial strains from current human milk samples are multiresistant strains. In milk samples for preterm infants or milk banks, higher TBC levels or potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria in some milk samples have supported people using approaches to disinfect human milk partially.

514,514,514,30870741,"In France, the frequency of premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) is 2%-3% before 37 weeks' gestation (level of evidence [LE] 2) and less than 1% before 34 weeks (LE2). Preterm delivery and intrauterine infection are the major complications of preterm PROM (PPROM) (LE2). Prolongation of the latency period is beneficial (LE2). Compared with other causes of preterm delivery, PPROM is associated with a clear excess risk of neonatal morbidity and mortality only in cases of intrauterine infection, which is linked to higher rates of in utero fetal death (LE3), early neonatal infection (LE2), and necrotizing enterocolitis (LE2). The diagnosis of PPROM is principally clinical (professional consensus). Tests to detect IGFBP-1 or PAMG-1 are recommended in cases of uncertainty (professional consensus). Hospitalization is recommended for women diagnosed with PPROM (professional consensus). Adequate evidence does not exist to support recommendations for or against initial tocolysis (Grade C). If tocolysis is prescribed, it should not continue longer than 48 h (Grade C). The administration of antenatal corticosteroids is recommended for fetuses with a gestational age less than 34 weeks (Grade A) and magnesium sulfate if delivery is imminent before 32 weeks (Grade A). The prescription of antibiotic prophylaxis at admission is recommended (Grade A) to reduce neonatal and maternal morbidity (LE1). Amoxicillin, third-generation cephalosporins, and erythromycin (professional consensus) can each be used individually or eythromycin and amoxicillin can be combined (professional consensus) for a period of 7 days (Grade C). Nonetheless, it is acceptable to stop antibiotic prophylaxis when the initial vaginal sample is negative (professional consensus). The following are not recommended for antibiotic prophylaxis: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (professional consensus), aminoglycosides, glycopeptides, first- or second-generation cephalosporins, clindamycin, or metronidazole (professional consensus). Women who are clinically stable after at least 48 h of hospital monitoring can be managed at home (professional consensus). Monitoring should include checking for clinical and laboratory factors suggestive of intrauterine infection (professional consensus). No guidelines can be issued about the frequency of this monitoring (professional consensus). Adequate evidence does not exist to support a recommendation for or against the routine initiation of antibiotic therapy when the monitoring of an asymptomatic woman produces a single isolated positive result (e.g., elevated CRP, or hyperleukocytosis, or a positive vaginal sample) (professional consensus). In cases of intrauterine infection, the immediate intravenous administration (Grade B) of antibiotic therapy combining a beta-lactam with an aminoglycoside (Grade B) and early delivery of the child are both recommended (Grade A). Cesarean delivery of women with intrauterine infections is reserved for the standard obstetric indications (professional consensus). Expectant management is recommended for uncomplicated PROM before 37 weeks (Grade A), even when a sample is positive for Streptococcus B, as long as antibiotic prophylaxis begins at admission (professional consensus). Oxytocin and prostaglandins are two possible options for the induction of labor in women with PPROM (professional consensus).

Maastricht consensus (1996), which was modified in 2000. The scope of present paper is the meta-analysis of eradication studies performed in Hungary between 1993-2002. Articles/abstracts dealing with eradication, published in peer-reviewed Hungarian and international journals, meetings of the Hungarian Society of Gastroenterology and its Endoscopic Section and international congresses were identified from major databases and by manual search. The data were classified into groups based on eradication schedules, type of antibiotic used, and provenience of the study. The pooled eradication rates were calculated and compared with the international data. The pooled eradication rate of proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapies was 82.9% (confidence interval: 72.1-93.7%); omeprazole, pantoprazole and lansoprazole-based therapies given b.i.d. were equally efficient. H2-blockers based triple combinations lasting 10-14 days obtained a pooled eradication rate of 86.3% (confidence interval: 72.2-99.8%), insignificantly higher (p = 0.07) than the rate obtained with proton pump inhibitors. Classical triple therapy's (bismuth + 2 antimicrobials) pooled eradication rate is significantly lower as that of proton pump inhibitor (p = 0.01) or H2 blocker-based combinations (p = 0.008). Clarithromycin, nitroimidazoles, amoxicillin and doxycyclin-based therapies obtained pooled eradication rates of 79.4%, 74.7%, 79.3% and 73.0%, respectively. The results obtained in randomized controlled trials and university centers were better than those achieved in county and urban hospitals. The results are in part contrasting with the recommendations of European and national consensus. Proton pump inhibitor-based triple regimens are proposed as first-line treatment, which is in agreement with our results, but H2-blockers based regimens seem to be of same efficacy in open studies, although these represent a lower level of evidence. Classical triple therapies, also recommended, did not reach acceptable rates of eradication. Antibiotic-based analysis did not reflect the local resistance profile. A multicenter, randomized Hungarian study is warranted to assess the real efficacy of the eradication schedules.

516,516,516,27189753,"A ranking system for veterinary medicinal products and coccidiostat feed additives has been developed as a tool to be applied in a risk-based approach to the residue testing programme for foods of animal origin in the Irish National Residue Control Plan (NRCP). Three characteristics of substances that may occur as residues in food are included in the developed risk ranking system: Potency, as measured by the acceptable daily intake assigned by the European Medicines Agency Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use, to each substance; Usage, as measured by the three factors of Number of Doses, use on Individual animals or for Group treatment, and Withdrawal Period; and Residue Occurrence, as measured by the number of Non-Compliant Samples in the NRCP. For both Number of Doses and Non-Compliant Samples, data for the 5-year period 2008-12 have been used. The risk ranking system for substances was developed for beef cattle, sheep and goats, pigs, chickens and dairy cattle using a scoring system applied to the various parameters described above to give an overall score based on the following equation: Potency × Usage (Number of Doses + Individual/Group Use + Withdrawal Period) × Residue Occurrence. Applying this risk ranking system, the following substances are ranked very highly: antimicrobials such as amoxicillin (for all species except pigs), marbofloxacillin (for beef cattle), oxytetracycline (for all species except chickens), sulfadiazine with trimethoprim (for pigs and chickens) and tilmicosin (for chickens); antiparasitic drugs, such as the benzimidazoles triclabendazole (for beef and dairy cattle), fenbendazole/oxfendazole (for sheep/goats and dairy cattle) and albendazole (for dairy cattle), the avermectin ivermectin (for beef cattle), and anti-fluke drugs closantel and rafoxanide (for sheep/goats); the anticoccidials monensin, narasin, nicarbazin and toltrazuril (for chickens).

This study used a decision-analytic model to simulate the costs and consequences of the ototopical treatment of AOMT. The AOMT model consisted of 3 tiers of antimicrobial therapy. Each successive tier represented the repeat treatment of clinical failures from the preceding tier. Patients were modeled for treatment until cured or until third-tier therapy was complete, at which time patients were considered cured. First-tier therapy modeled a comparison of CD and OFX using efficacy rates taken from a randomized clinical trial with a population of 599 patients. Second-tier therapy modeled the use of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid using an efficacy rate taken from the medical literature. Third-tier therapy was modeled as being pathogen specific and could follow 1 of 3 possible clinical pathways: (1) PO fluconazole, (2) IM ceftriaxone, or (3) IV antibiotics administered in a hospital setting. Third-tier therapeutic pathway probabilities were based on the microbiologic spectrum of the treatment failures from the clinical trial. Cost information (in year-2003 US dollars) was taken from accepted cost reference sources and presented from the perspective of a third-party payer. The economic outcome of interest was the cost-effectiveness threshold of CD relative to OFX. Given the model parameters, CD had a cost-effectiveness threshold value of 4.5 times the wholesale acquisition cost of OFX. Based on actual cost, first-tier CD therapy was more cost-effective than OFX up to a threshold price of US 152.64 dollars. In this decision-analytic model, CD was more cost-effective than OFX for AOMT therapy in pediatric patients up to a threshold price of 4.5 times the price of OFX.

We collected urine culture results from 0-18-year-old patients in the National Taiwan University Hospital from January 1, 2003 to October 31, 2012. Their medical chart was reviewed to identify true pathogens responsible for their urinary tract infection (UTI). We checked the percentage of susceptibility of these pathogens to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate (AMC), cefazolin, cefmetazole, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline. The extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases (ESBLs) rate was also checked. In addition, we reviewed the treatment response of different antibiotics. Defervescence within 48 hours after initial antibiotics use was considered responsive. A total of 7758 urine cultures positive for Escherichia coli infection were collected during the 10-year period. The E. coli cefazolin susceptibility rate was 62-73% during 2003-2010, but it dropped to 23% in 2011 and 28% in 2012 after the new CLSI guideline (M100-S21) was released. However, other antibiotics did not show a significant difference. In UTI caused by E. coli, on average, the sensitivity rates for various antibiotics were as follows: cefmetazole, 90%; ceftriaxone, 85%; gentamicin, 77%; AMC, 61%; TMP-SMX, 47%; and ampicillin, 20%. The ESBL rate was also found to increase (2-11%; p < 0.01). The overall response rate of UTI caused by E. coli to first-line antibiotics such as first-generation cephalosporin and/or gentamicin was 78%. The susceptibility of common urinary tract pathogens to cefazolin has decreased dramatically since 2010. This trend may be due to the change in the CLSI guideline. Although the susceptibility rate to first-line empirical antibiotics shows a decreasing trend, we found that the clinical response was acceptable for our first-line empirical antibiotics.

El tratamiento ambulatorio en pacientes con cáncer, fiebre y neutropenia de bajo riesgo parece ser una alternativa segura y efectiva. El objetivo de este trabajo fue comparar la efectividad y la seguridad del tratamiento antimicrobiano en la modalidad de egreso temprano vs. el tratamiento intrahospitalario en niños con cáncer y neutropenia febril (NF), con bajo riesgo de infección bacteriana invasiva (IBI). Diseño cuasi-experimental con un grupo control histórico. Se incluyeron niños con cáncer durante un episodio de NF con bajo riesgo de IBI. El grupo control fue constituido por pacientes que recibieron tratamiento hospitalario con piperacilina-tazobactam intravenosa. Los pacientes en el grupo de egreso temprano recibieron 48 horas de tratamiento intravenoso y egresaron con antimicrobianos por vía oral. Desenlaces: resolución de la fiebre, reingreso al hospital y muerte. Se incluyeron 80 pacientes con NF de bajo riesgo; la mediana de edad fue de 6 años; 43 pacientes (54%) eran de sexo femenino. Los diagnósticos principales fueron tumores sólidos (52) y leucemia o linfoma (28). Cuarenta y tres pacientes recibieron tratamiento hospitalario y 37 fueron seleccionados para egreso temprano. En el grupo de egreso temprano, 31 pacientes recibieron ciprofloxacino y 6 recibieron amoxicilina-clavulanato. Dos pacientes reingresaron, uno por fiebre secundaria a progresión tumoral y otro por epistaxis. Los efectos adversos se presentaron en el 21.6% de los pacientes en el grupo de egreso temprano y en el 12% del grupo de tratamiento hospitalario (p = 0.04). El egreso temprano para niños con cáncer y NF de bajo riesgo es una alternativa aceptable y segura.

524,524,524,25841891,"Severe infections remain one of the main causes of neonatal deaths worldwide. Possible severe infection is diagnosed in young infants (aged 0-59 days) according to the presence of one or more clinical signs. The recommended treatment is hospital admission with 7-10 days of injectable antibiotic therapy. In low-income and middle-income countries, barriers to hospital care lead to delayed, inadequate, or no treatment for many young infants. We aimed to identify effective alternative antibiotic regimens to expand treatment options for situations where hospital admission is not possible. We did this randomised, open-label, equivalence trial in four urban hospitals and one rural field site in Bangladesh to determine whether two alternative antibiotic regimens with reduced numbers of injectable antibiotics combined with oral antibiotics had similar efficacy and safety to the standard regimen, which was also used as outpatient treatment. We randomly assigned infants who showed at least one clinical sign of severe, but not critical, infection (except fast breathing alone), whose parents refused hospital admission, to one of the three treatment regimens. We stratified randomisation by study site and age (<7 days or 7-59 days) using computer-generated randomisation sequences. The standard treatment was intramuscular procaine benzylpenicillin and gentamicin once per day for 7 days (group A). The alternative regimens were intramuscular gentamicin once per day and oral amoxicillin twice per day for 7 days (group B) or intramuscular procaine benzylpenicillin and gentamicin once per day for 2 days, then oral amoxicillin twice per day for 5 days (group C). The primary outcome was treatment failure within 7 days after enrolment. Assessors of treatment failure were masked to treatment allocation. Primary analysis was per protocol. We used a prespecified similarity margin of 5% to assess equivalence between regimens. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00844337. Between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013, we recruited 2490 young infants into the trial. We assigned 830 infants to group A, 831 infants to group B, and 829 infants to group C. 2367 (95%) infants fulfilled per-protocol criteria. 78 (10%) of 795 per-protocol infants had treatment failure in group A compared with 65 (8%) of 782 infants in group B (risk difference -1.5%, 95% CI -4.3 to 1.3) and 64 (8%) of 790 infants in group C (-1.7%, -4.5 to 1.1). In group A, 14 (2%) infants died before day 15, compared with 12 (2%) infants in group B and 12 (2%) infants in group C. Non-fatal relapse rates were similar in all three groups (12 [2%] infants in group A vs 13 [2%] infants in group B and 10 [1%] infants in group C). Our results suggest that the two alternative antibiotic regimens for outpatient treatment of clinical signs of severe infection in young infants whose parents refused hospital admission are as efficacious as the standard regimen. This finding could increase treatment options in resource-poor settings when referral care is not available or acceptable.

525,525,525,26157713,"The effectiveness of classic standard triple therapy regimen of helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication has decreased to unacceptably low levels, largely related to development of resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin. Thus successful eradication of H. pylori infections remains challenging. Therefore alternative treatments with superior effectiveness and safety should be designed and appropriately tested in all areas depending on the native resistance patterns. Furazolidone has been used successfully in eradication regimens previously and regimens containing furazolidone may be an ideal regimen. H. pylori infected patients with proven gastric or duodenal ulcers and /or gastric or duodenal erosions at Imam Khomeini Hospital in Sari/Northern Iran, were randomly allocated into three groups: group A (OABF) with furazolidone (F) (200 mg bid.), group B (OABM-F) metronidazole (M) (500 mg bid.) for the first five days, followed by furazolidone (F) (200 mg bid.) for the second five days and group C (OAF) with furazolidone (F) (200 mg tid.). Omeprazole (O) (20 mg bid.) and amoxicillin (A) (1000 mg bid.) were given in all groups; bismuth (B) (240 mg bid.) was prescribed in groups A & B. Duration of all eradication regimens were ten days. Eight weeks after treatment, a 14C-urea breath test was performed for evaluation of H. pylori eradication. A total of 372 patients were enrolled in three groups randomly (124 patients in each group); 120 (97%) patients in group A (OABF), 120 (97%) in group B (OABM-F) and 116 (93%) in group C (OAF) completed the study. The intention-to-treat eradication rates were 83.7% (95% CI= 77.3-90.4), 79.8% (95% CI= 72.6-87), and 84.6% (95% CI= 78.2-91.1) and per-protocol eradication rates were 86.6% (95% CI= 80.5-92.8), 82.5% (95% CI= 75.6-89.4), and 90.5% (95% CI= 85.1-95.9) for groups OABF, OABM-F, and OAF, respectively. No statistical significant differences were found in case of severe drug adverse effects between the above mentioned three groups (p> 0.05). The most common side effects, namely nausea and fever, occurred in all groups, but more frequently in group C (OAF) (p< 0.05). In developing countries such as Iran, furazolidone-based regimens can substitute clarithromycinbased regimens for H. pylori eradication because of a very low level of resistance, low cost and high effectiveness. Considering per-protocol eradication rate of ten days OAF regimen, and the acceptable limit of ninety percent, we recommend this regimen in developing countries such as Iran to be substituted of classic standard triple therapy. In order to minimize rare serious adverse effects, one week high dose OAF regimen should be taken into consideration in other studies.

526,526,526,32293315,"Understanding potential risks of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens from the booming poultry sector is a crucial public health concern. Campylobacter spp. are among the most important zoonotic pathogens associated with MDR infections in poultry and human. This study systematically examined potential risks and associated socio-environmental factors of MDR Campylobacter spp. in poultry farms and live bird markets (LBMs) of Bangladesh. Microbial culture and PCR-based methods were applied to examine the occurrence and MDR patterns of Campylobacter spp. in potential sources (n = 224) at 7 hatcheries, 9 broiler farms and 4 LBMs in three sub-districts. Antimicrobial residues in broiler meat and liver samples (n = 50) were detected by advanced chromatographic techniques. A questionnaire based cross-sectional survey was conducted on socio-environmental factors. Overall, 32% (71/ 224) samples were found contaminated with Campylobacter spp. In poultry farms, Campylobacter spp. was primarily found in cloacal swab (21/49, 43%), followed by drinking water (8/24, 33%), and meat (8/28, 29%) samples of broilers. Remarkably, at LBMs, Campylobacter spp. was detected in higher prevalence (p < 0.05) in broiler meat (14/26, 54%), which could be related (p < 0.01) to bacterial contamination of drinking water (11/21, 52%) and floor (9/21, 43%). Campylobacter isolates, one from each of 71 positive samples, were differentiated into Campylobacter jejuni (66%) and Campylobacter coli (34%). Alarmingly, 49 and 42% strains of C. jejuni and C. coli, respectively, were observed as MDR, i.e., resistant to three or more antimicrobials, including, tetracycline, amoxicillin, streptomycin, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides. Residual antimicrobials (oxytetracycline, ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin) were detected in majority of broiler liver (79%) and meat (62%) samples, among which 33 and 19%, respectively, had concentration above acceptable limit. Inadequate personal and environmental hygiene, unscrupulously use of antimicrobials, improper waste disposal, and lack of health surveillance were distinguishable risk factors, with local diversity and compound influences on MDR pathogens. Potential contamination sources and anthropogenic factors associated with the alarming occurrence of MDR Campylobacter, noted in this study, would aid in developing interventions to minimize the increasing risks of poultry-associated MDR pathogens under 'One Health' banner that includes poultry, human and environment perspectives.

The objective was to assess the effectiveness of HBC and CHPS on utilization, appropriate treatment given and users' satisfaction for the treatment of malaria, diarrhoea and pneumonia. A household survey was conducted 2 and 8 years after implementation of HBC in the Volta and Northern Regions of Ghana, respectively. The study population was carers of children under-five who had fever, diarrhoea and/or cough in the last 2 weeks prior to the interview. HBC and CHPS utilization were assessed based on treatment-seeking behaviour when the child was sick. Appropriate treatment was based on adherence to national guidelines and satisfaction was based on the perceptions of the carers after the treatment-seeking visit. HBC utilization was 17.3 and 1.0 % in the Volta and Northern Regions respectively, while CHPS utilization in the same regions was 11.8 and 31.3 %, with large variation among districts. Regarding appropriate treatment of uncomplicated malaria, 36.7 % (n = 17) and 19.4 % (n = 1) of malaria cases were treated with ACT under the HBC in the Volta and Northern Regions respectively, and 14.7 % (n = 7) and 7.4 % (n = 26) under the CHPS in the Volta and Northern Regions. Regarding diarrhoea, 7.6 % (n = 4) of the children diagnosed with diarrhoea received oral rehydration salts (ORS) or were referred under the HBC in the Volta Region and 22.1 % (n = 6) and 5.6 % (n = 8) under the CHPS in the Volta and Northern Regions. Regarding suspected pneumonia, CHPS in the Northern Region gave the most appropriate treatment with 33.0 % (n = 4) of suspected cases receiving amoxicillin. Users of CHPS in the Volta Region were the most satisfied (97.7 % were satisfied or very satisfied) when compared with those of the HBC and of the Northern Region. HBC showed greater utilization by children under-five years of age in the Volta Region while CHPS was more utilized in the Northern Region. Utilization of HBC contributed to prompt treatment of fever in the Volta Region. Appropriate treatment for the three diseases was low in the HBC and CHPS, in both regions.

528,528,528,33052981,"The World Health Organization (WHO) launched a guideline in 2015 for managing Possible Serious Bacterial Infection (PSBI) when referral is not feasible in young infants aged 0-59 days. This guideline was implemented across 303 Basic Health Unit (BHU) Plus primary health care (PHC) facilities in peri-urban and rural settings of Sindh, Pakistan. We evaluated the implementation of PSBI guideline, and the quality of care provided to sick young infants at these facilities. Thirty (10%) out of 303 BHU Plus facilities were randomly selected for evaluation. A survey team visited each facility for one day, assessed the health system support, observed the management of sick young infants by health care providers (HCP), validated their management, interviewed HCPs and caretakers of sick infants. HCPs who were unable to see a young infant on the day of survey were evaluated using pre-prepared case scenarios. Thirty (100%) BHU Plus facilities had oral amoxicillin, injectable gentamicin, thermometers, baby weighing scales and respiratory timers available; 29 (97%) had disposable syringes and needles; 28 (93%) had integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI)/PSBI chart booklets and job aids and 18 (60%) had a functional ambulance. Each facility had at least one HCP trained in PSBI, and 21 (70%) facilities had been visited by a supervisor in the preceding six months. Of 42 HCPs, 19 (45.3%) were trained within the preceding 12 months. During the survey, 26 sick young infants were identified in 18 facilities. HCPs asked about history of breastfeeding in 23 (89%) infants, history of vomiting in 17 (65%), and history of convulsions in 14 (54%); weighed 25 (97%) infants; measured respiratory rate in all (100%) and temperature in 24 (92%); assessed 20 (77%) for movement and 14 (54%) for chest indrawing. HCPs identified two infants with fast breathing pneumonia and managed them correctly per IMCI/PSBI protocol. HCPs identified six (23%) infants with clinical severe infection (CSI), two of them were referred to a higher-level facility, only one accepted the referral advice. Only one CSI patient was managed correctly per IMCI/PSBI protocol at the outpatient level. HCPs described the PSBI danger signs to eight (31%) caretakers. Caretakers of five infants with CSI and two with pneumonia were not counselled for PSBI danger signs. Five of the six CSI cases categorized by HCPs were validated as CSI on re-examination, whereas one had pneumonia. Similarly, one of the two pneumonia patients categorized by HCPs had CSI and one identified as local bacterial infection was classified as CSI upon re-examination. Health system support was adequate but clinical management and counselling by HCPs was sub-optimal particularly with CSI cases who are at higher risk of adverse outcomes. Scaling up PSBI management is potentially feasible in PHC facilities in Pakistan, provided that HCPs are trained well and mentored, receive refresher training to appropriately manage sick young infants, and have adequate supplies and counselling skills.

In France, PPROM rate is 2 to 3% before 37 weeks of gestation (level of evidence [LE] 2) and less than 1% before 34 weeks of gestation (LE2). Prematurity and intra-uterine infection are the two major complications of PPROM (LE2). Compared to other causes of prematurity, PPROM is not associated with an increased risk of neonatal mortality and morbidity, except in case of intra-uterine infection, which is associated with an augmentation of early-onset neonatal sepsis (LE2) and of necrotizing enterocolitis (LE2). PPROM diagnosis is mainly clinical (professional consensus). In doubtful cases, detection of IGFBP-1 or PAMG-1 is recommended (professional consensus). Hospitalization of women with PPROM is recommended (professional consensus). There is no sufficient evidence to recommend or not recommend tocolysis (grade C). If a tocolysis should be prescribed, it should not last more than 48hours (grade C). Antenatal corticosteroids before 34 weeks of gestation (grade A) and magnesium sulfate before 32 weeks of gestation (grade A) are recommended. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended (grade A) because it is associated with a reduction of neonatal mortality and morbidity (LE1). Amoxicillin, 3rd generation cephalosporins, and erythromycin in monotherapy or the association erythromycin-amoxicillin can be used (professional consensus), for 7 days (grade C). However, in case of negative vaginal culture, early cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis might be acceptable (professional consensus). Co-amoxiclav, aminosides, glycopetides, first and second generation cephalosporins, clindamycin, and metronidazole are not recommended for antibiotic prophylaxis (professional consensus). Outpatient management of women with clinically stable PPROM after 48hours of hospitalization is a possible (professional consensus). During monitoring, it is recommended to identify the clinical and biological elements suggesting intra-uterine infection (professional consensus). However, it not possible to make recommendation regarding the frequency of this monitoring. In case of isolated elevated C-reactive protein, leukocytosis, or positive vaginal culture in an asymptomatic patient, it is not recommended to systematically prescribe antibiotics (professional consensus). In case of intra-uterine infection, it is recommended to immediately administer an antibiotic therapy associating beta-lactamine and aminoside (grade B), intravenously (grade B), and to deliver the baby (grade A). Cesarean delivery should be performed according to the usual obstetrical indications (professional consensus). Expectative management is recommended before 37 weeks of gestation in case of uncomplicated PPROM (grade A), even in case of positive vaginal culture for B Streptococcus, provided that an antibiotic prophylaxis has been prescribed (professional consensus). Oxytocin and prostaglandins are two possible options to induce labor in case of PPROM (professional consensus).

Dornic acidity of milk revealed that 95.4% (229/240) had acceptable limits (< 8.0 oD). Caloric intake showed a wide variation in cream content (4%), fat (4%) and energy values (559.81 Kcal/L). Staphylococcus (105/186 or 56.5%) and Enterobacter (25/186 or 13.4%) were the most prevalent genera, although other microorganisms were identified, including Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (125/157 or 79.6%), vancomycin (115/157 or 73.2%), and cephalexin (112/157 or 71.3%) were the most effective antimicrobials. High resistance rates of isolates were found to penicillin G (141/157 or 89.8%), ampicillin (135/157 or 86%), and oxacillin (118/157 or 75.2%). Multidrug resistance to ≥ 3 antimicrobials occurred in 66.2% (123/186) of the isolates. Residues of microbial multiplication inhibitory substances were found in 85% (204/240) of samples. Among the coagulase-positive-CPS and negative-CoNS staphylococci, the mecA gene was detected in 53.3% (8/15) and 75% (30/40), respectively. Genes sea, seb and sec were detected in 20% (3/15) of CPS, while tsst-1 was detected in 13.34% (2/15). In addition, 13.3% (2/15) of S. aureus were toxin-producers.

Sixty different therapies were used; the 15 most frequently prescribed encompassed >90% of cases. Overall effectiveness remained <90% in all therapies. Optimised treatments achieved a higher eradication rate than non-optimised (78% vs 67%, p<0.0001). From 2017 to 2021, only 44% of treatments other than 10-day single-capsule therapy used high proton-pump inhibitor doses and lasted ≥14 days. Quadruple therapy containing metronidazole, tetracycline and bismuth achieved optimal eradication rates only when prescribed as third-line treatment, either as 10-day single-capsule therapy (87%) or as 14-day traditional therapy with tetracycline hydrochloride (95%). Triple amoxicillin-levofloxacin therapy achieved 90% effectiveness in Eastern Europe only or when optimised. The overall incidence of adverse events was 31%.

While untreated HFI typically first manifested when fructose- and sucrose-containing foods were introduced in the course of weaning young infants from breast milk, it is now presenting earlier, due to the addition of fructose-containing nutrients in infant formulas. If the infant ingests large quantities of fructose, the infant may acutely develop lethargy, seizures, and/or progressive coma. Untreated HFI may result in renal and hepatic failure.

535,2,2,36471989,"There are many kinds of pharmaceutical preparations for children in China, which are generally divided into oral solid preparations and oral liquid preparations. Solid preparations, such as microtablets, pellets, dispersible tablets, and fine granules, have become the development trend of pediatric drugs. Liquid preparations mainly include syrup, suspension, oral solution, and drops. The poor taste and the treatment of drugs in children of different ages are the key factors affecting the efficacy, safety, and compliance of pediatric drugs. To reduce the risk caused by the fluctuation of blood concentration and improve the oral compliance of pediatric drugs, it is urgent to develop new techniques for granulation and flavor maskingto improve the poor taste of solid preparations. For liquid pre-parations with poor taste, the flavor correction technique should be used. This paper summarized the new pharmaceutical techniques for granulation and flavor masking, and it was found that sustained/controlled-releasegranules, fine granules, and chewing solid mini-tablets became the mainstream of oral solid preparations for children. Generally, multiparticle preparation, coating, microencapsulation, and other granulating techniques were involved in these preparations. Granulation and flavor masking are closely related and synergetic. Flavor masking techniques mask the bitter taste of Chinese medicine from four aspects, including confusing the brain taste, changing the compounds, reducing the exposure of bitter molecules to bitter receptors in the mouth, and numbing the taste cells to increase the threshold of bitter perception. At present, the main drugs for children on the market mainly inhibit the oral release of bitter drugs.

In Argentina, indomethacin is only available as a suppository, dermic cream, injectable ampules, and delayed-release capsules. Aiming to improve pediatric treatment and minimize the risk associated with improper dosage, this work focused on the development of an extemporaneous 0.2% indomethacin oral suspension, starting from the commercially injectable formulation. Two 150-mL batches of suspension were prepared using Generally Recognized as Safe excipients. The suspensions were stored for 17 days at room temperature. Physical stability, morphological analysis of suspended particles, sedimentation volume, easy re-suspension, and dynamic viscosity were studied. The indomethacin content, dissolution studies, and microbiological attributes of nonsterile pharmaceutical products were also evaluated. After 17 days of storage, the suspension was easily re-dispersed after 15 seconds of the hand-shaking technique. There were no detectable changes in color, odor, and/or flavor. The suspension showed minimal changes in pH, viscosity, shape, and mean size of the suspended indomethacin particles. The content uniformity and drug dissolution remained within the acceptable range during storage. This oral liquid suspension is an interesting alternative to be prepared by hospital pharmacy services for optimizing the pediatric treatment of patent ductus arteriosus.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the organoleptic excipients in oral antibiotics for pediatric use marketed in Brazil. The information was obtained from the GuidetoPharmacy, a reference for the pharmaceutical trade. The analysis included dosage forms for oral administration and drugs and their combination with antibacterial action. After this survey, we identified the constitution of the flavoring, sweetening, and coloring agents of each medicine. The results are presented in a descriptive form. Twelve drugs or associations are distributed in 70medicines. Oral suspension was the most common pharmaceutical dosage form. Sweeteners were sucrose, sodium saccharin, and sodium cyclamate. All the coloring agents observed are synthetic and the most frequent ones were yellow twilight no. 6, yellow tartrazine no. 5, and red ponceau 4R. The presence of two or more types of flavorings per medicine was observed. Antibacterials use coloring agents, flavorings, and sweeteners to facilitate the administration of medicines for children, using up to six different substances per formulation. No natural coloring agent was observed, demonstrating an issue to be explored in the future.

Amiodarone hydrochloride is an antiarrhythmic drug used to treat supraventricular tachycardia. However, there are currently no commercial pediatric forms available to treat young patients. Various oral formulations were previously reported in the literature, but the concentration was lower than the doses prescribed in clinical practice (a loading dose of 500 mg/m2/day for 7-10 days followed by a maintenance dose of 250 mg/m2/day). The objective of this study was to develop an oral liquid formulation of amiodarone hydrochloride at an optimal concentration for use in children and to evaluate its physicochemical and microbiological stability. No commercial suspension vehicle was used, allowing the choice of excipients. Compounding was performed using hydroxypropylmethylcellulose as thickener, potassium sorbate preservative, citric acid/sodium citrate buffer, sodium saccharin as a , and a strawberry flavoring agent. A concentration of 40 mg/mL was selected based on a 5-year compilation of prescribed doses. Analyses performed were the following: visual and microscopic inspection, testing for antimicrobial preservation, osmolality and pH measurements, quantification of amiodarone hydrochloride by a stability-indicating liquid chromatography method, and a microbiological count. At least 95% of the initial amiodarone hydrochloride remained stable during the 60-day study period under refrigeration. All other tested parameters remained stable at 5 °C. A targeted log reduction of the microorganism inoculum by day 14 and no microbial growth by day 28 were demonstrated in the test for antimicrobial preservation.

It is widely dispensed as an extemporaneously compounded suspension for pediatric and geriatric patients. Extensive stability data at numerous temperatures and a calculated shelf life based on kinetics for such a formulation have not been reported. Refrigeration and room temperature data for finite times have been reported in the literature. In this study, a stable extemporaneous formulation of amiodarone hydrochloride was formulated using Paceron tablets. The formulation consisted of 0.75% carboxymethylcellulose and 0.75% Veegum as suspending agents; 25% sucrose, provided as simple syrup; and aqueous strawberry concentrate as flavor. A total of 2.5L of the formulation was compounded and stored in quanitites of 150 mL in 8-oz glass containers. The initial drug content was determined by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, with a method that was developed in our laboratory. The stability study was carried out by storing three containers at five different temperatures, namely 4, 30, 40, 50, and 60 deg C. The suspension was analyzed at the end of 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours at 7 days, and, therafter, at the end of every week for 13 weeks. The percentage of drug remaining was plotted against time for each temperature. The slope of the regression line was obtained for each temperature and the zero-order degradation rate constant obtained. The logarithm of the zero-order degradation rate constants was plotted against the inverse of the temperature in degrees Kelvin to obtain the Arrhenius plot. From the regression line for the Arrhenius plot, the zero-order degradation constant at 25 deg C was calculated to be 0.0517 day -1. The shelf life for the formulation at 25 deg C was calculated to be 193.4 days; the shelf life under refrigeration (4 deg C) was found to be 677.3 days. The degradation products were characterized using high-performance liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometry. Data obtained from the analysis suggested that amiodarone cleaved at its ketone and ether linkages to yield corresponding degradation products.

Stability, solubility, drug release, and taste of the suspension formulations were evaluated. Suspension that contained cocrystal with acesulfame showed higher drug release rate, while a cocrystal with saccharin showed a significant reduction in drug release rate. The cocrystal with saccharin was found stable in suspension for over 9 weeks at accelerated test condition; in contrast, the cocrystal with acesulfame was found unstable. Taste analysis using an electronic taste-sensing system revealed improved sweetness of the suspension formulations with cocrystals. Theophylline has a narrow therapeutic index with a short half-life which necessitates frequent dosing. This adversely impacts patient compliance and enhances risk of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular adverse effects.

The objective was to describe the compounding methods and clinical outcomes of three of the youngest patients to receive topiramate rectal suspensions. All three patients received topiramate per rectum for 2-4 days. No adverse effects or increase in seizure frequency were noted. For patients placed on NPO status, there is currently no alternative to oral topiramate. No studies describe per rectum topiramate use in pediatrics. Rectal administration of topiramate is not only useful in times when patients are NPO, but may also be useful when patients on topiramate experience status epilepticus.

Therefore, we compared the taste of 8 commonly prescribed liquid corticosteroid suspensions with the intent to help guide prescribing practices and improve patient compliance. We conducted a randomized, double-blind study using 31 adult volunteers ages 24 to 57. All volunteers were asked to sample 8 different pediatric corticosteroid suspensions and to rate the palatability of their taste and aftertaste. The mean scores for each sample were then compared. The 8 suspensions fell into 2 groups based on their taste scores: one group with relatively high scores or more acceptable tastes (Orapred, Pediapred, and a dexamethasone suspension) and a second group with relatively low scores or less acceptable tastes (a prednisone suspension and 4 cherry-flavored prednisolone suspensions). The results demonstrate a significant difference in palatability between corticosteroid suspensions.

556,23,23,14725575,"The management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) continues to garner vast amounts of attention among physicians who care for adults. However, there is an increasing awareness of the fact that this disease, as well as several other lifelong digestive diseases (i.e. Crohn's disease) may actually have their origins in childhood. Paediatric gastro-oesophageal reflux (GER) is likely to share a similar pathophysiology to adult GER, and mounting evidence from published preliminary data suggests a genetic susceptibility to GERD. However, further studies will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis. In children, GER has a distinct presentation from that in adults, with the diagnostic work-up based upon the patient's age as well as their presenting signs and symptoms. Like their adult counterparts, the early detection and treatment of GER in children may result in a better long-term outcome, improved quality-of-life, and a reduction in overall healthcare burden. While the treatment of GER in infants tends to be conservative (i.e. positioning during feeding, smaller feedings), its management in older children parallels that of adults and includes lifestyle changes and pharmacological therapy. However, with persistent symptoms, acid suppression is the mainstay of GERD management in both children and adults. Several studies in children have verified that acid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor is superior to histamine-2 receptor antagonists. Among the proton pump inhibitors, both lansoprazole and omeprazole have been the subject of published adult and paediatric studies demonstrating their short and long-term safety, in addition to their efficacy in a variety of oesophageal and supra-oesophageal GERD related conditions. These two proton pump inhibitors are manufactured as capsules containing enteric-coated granules that can be emptied into soft foods or liquids without compromising their pharmacological effects or pharmacokinetic properties. Lansoprazole is also available as a strawberry-flavoured suspension that is acceptable to children and as an oral disintegrating tablet.

557,24,24,29737955,"Purpose To prospectively compare small bowel distention provided by, as well as patient acceptance of, two different neutral (negative) oral contrast materials used for cross-sectional enterography in a pediatric population. Materials and Methods In this noninferiority study, 66 pediatric patients undergoing clinical computed tomographic (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) enterography were randomized to receive either a flavored beverage for neutral abdominal and pelvic imaging (Breeza; Beekley Medical, Bristol, Conn) or a low-density barium sulfate suspension. Patients were blinded to the oral contrast material administered and were asked to rate taste, texture, and their perceived health state (where 0 was very bad and 10 was very good). Ingested volume of the prescribed weight-based oral contrast material preparation was recorded. Maximum small bowel diameter was measured in all four abdominal quadrants. Mean bowel diameter as well as taste, texture, and health state scores were compared between cohorts by using t tests; proportions were compared by using Fisher exact tests. Results Thirty-three patients each received Breeza and barium sulfate suspension, respectively. No difference was found in age (Breeza, 13.5 years ± 2.6 [standard deviation]; barium sulfate suspension, 13.9 years ± 2.8; P = .49), sex distribution (15 girls each; P > .99), or health state (P = .21) between cohorts. Twenty-eight of 33 (84.8%) and 17 of 33 (51.5%) patients completed the Breeza and barium sulfate suspension preparations, respectively (P = .007). Breeza received higher scores for taste (6.1 ± 2.5 vs 2.7 ± 2.5; P < .0001) and texture (7.3 ± 2.3 vs 3.6 ± 2.9; P < .0001). No difference was found in bowel distention between Breeza and barium sulfate suspension (1.63 cm ± 0.24 vs 1.69 cm ± 0.25; P = .44). Conclusion The neutral oral contrast materials Breeza and low-density barium sulfate suspension provide similar small bowel distention.

There is a need for an oral liquid formulation of fecal microbiota for patients who are unable to swallow capsules, especially if they require multiple, repeated administrations. These studies were conducted to develop a protocol to manufacture an organoleptically acceptable powdered fecal microbiota formulation that can be suspended in a liquid carrier and used for fecal microbiota transplantation. Several processing steps were investigated, including extra washes of microbiota prior to lyophilization and an addition of a flavoring agent. The viability of bacteria in the transplant formulation was tested using live/dead microscopy staining and engraftment into antibiotic-treated mice. After development of a clinical protocol for suspension of the powdered microbiota, the new formulation was tested in three elderly patients with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections and who have difficulties in swallowing capsules. Changes in the microbial community structure in one of the patients were characterized using 16S rRNA gene profiling and engraftment analysis. The processing steps used to produce an organoleptically acceptable suspension of powdered fecal microbiota did not result in loss of its viability. The powder could be easily suspended in a liquid carrier. The use of the new formulation was associated with abrogation of the cycle of C. difficile infection recurrences in the three patients.

Low bone mass risks included adverse reactions to cow's milk (n = 25); cerebral palsy (4), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (4), cystic fibrosis (3), inflammatory bowel diseases (2), anorexia nervosa (1), and osteogenesis imperfecta (1). Two children (10%) aged 4 to 7 years were not able to express their preference.

We report here the development of novel methods to express, purify, and functionally reconstitute GLUT4 into detergent micelles and proteoliposomes. Rat GLUT4 containing FLAG and His tags at the amino and carboxy termini, respectively, was engineered and stably transfected into HEK-293 cells. Overexpression in suspension culture yielded over 1.5 mg of protein per liter of culture. Systematic screening of detergent solubilized GLUT4-GFP fusion protein via fluorescent-detection size exclusion chromatography identified lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG) as highly effective for isolating monomeric GLUT4 micelles. Preservation of structural integrity and ligand binding was demonstrated via quenching of tryptophan fluorescence and competition of ATB-BMPA photolabeling by cytochalasin B. GLUT4 was reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs and proper folding was confirmed. Reconstitution of purified GLUT4 with amphipol A8-35 stabilized the transporter at elevated temperatures for extended periods of time. Functional activity of purified GLUT4 was confirmed by reconstitution of LMNG-purified GLUT4 into proteoliposomes and measurement of saturable uptake of D-glucose over L-glucose.

566,33,33,35532810,"Dielectric spectroscopy has been used in the study and development of non-invasive glucose monitoring (NIGM) sensors, including the range of microwave frequencies. Dielectric relaxation of red blood cell (RBC) cytosolic water in the microwave frequency band has been shown to be sensitive to variations in the glucose concentration of RBC suspensions. It has been hypothesized that this sensitivity stems from the utilization of D-glucose by RBCs. To verify this proposition, RBCs were pretreated with inhibitors of D-glucose uptake (cytochalasin B and forskolin). Then their suspensions were exposed to different D-glucose concentrations as measured by microwave dielectric spectroscopy (MDS) in the 500 MHz-40 GHz frequency band. After incubation of RBCs with either inhibitor, the dielectric response of water in the cytoplasm, and specifically its relaxation time, demonstrated minimal sensitivity to the change of D-glucose concentration in the medium. This result allows us to conclude that the sensitivity of MDS to glucose uptake is associated with variations in the balance of bulk and bound RBC cytosolic water due to intracellular D-glucose metabolism, verifying the correctness of the initial hypothesis. These findings represent a further argument to establish the dielectric response of water as a marker of glucose variation in RBCs.

The quality of compounding was evaluated through content uniformity measurement and physical and microbiological stability evaluation, under different storage conditions during 90 days. Six batches of 1% BNZ suspension were prepared using safe excipients currently available in a galenic area of Hospital Pharmacy and then stored at 5 and 25 °C for 90 days. The BNZ content was determined by UV spectrophotometry. Physical stability was defined as the absence of colour, odour and/or flavour changes and the re-suspension of solid phase by a reasonable amount of simple 15-s shaking. The compliance with microbiological attributes of non-sterile pharmaceutical products was also evaluated. An oral liquid suspension, containing 1% of BNZ, was developed from commercially available BNZ tablets. The formulations stored for 90 days were easily re-dispersed after a simple 15-s shaking, ensuring the pouring of a liquid volume containing the desired dose of BNZ. All samples were within the acceptable range of BNZ concentration with minimal standard deviations. There were no detectable changes in colour, odour, viscosity, pH and microbial growth, complying with official quality requirements. The quality attributes were not affected by storage, room or refrigeration conditions or by the frequent opening or closing of the multidose containers. Paediatric oral liquid suspension containing 1.0% of BNZ was easily prepared starting from commercial tablets, being an interesting alternative for optimising the paediatric treatment of Chagas disease.

568,35,35,8878244,"Azithromycin, the prototypical azalide antibiotic, has a wide spectrum of activity that is characterized by resistance to beta-lactamase-producing microbes and efficacy against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae. Tissue-directed pharmacokinetics include tissue concentrations up to 100-fold higher than those in plasma and a tissue half-life of up to 4 days. Pharmacokinetics of azithromycin permits a reduction in dosage frequency and duration while maintaining efficacy comparable to that of conventional 7- to 10-day three or four times daily regimens. Dosage interval, duration of treatment, side effects and palatability can affect compliance and thus clinical outcome. Compliance among children is important in light of the high incidence of community-acquired infections such as otitis media and streptococcal pharyngitis. To compare the flavor, taste acceptability and color preference of oral antibiotic suspensions given to children. The taste and acceptability of the oral suspension form of azithromycin vs. cefixime, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefprozil, clarithromycin or loracarbef were rated by children during blinded taste tests and with acceptability/ preference questionnaires. Analysis of the mean acceptability/ preference rating from 769 children demonstrated that the flavor of azithromycin was rated significantly higher than that of cefpodoxime (4.3 vs. 2.8), cefprozil (4.0 vs. 3.4) and clarithromycin (4.3 vs. 2.7) and was comparable to that of cefixime (4.0 vs. 4.2) and loracarbef (4.4 vs. 4.5). A greater percentage of children preferred the taste of azithromycin to that of cefpodoxime (90.0% vs. 5.2%), cefprozil (63.0% vs. 33.1%) and clarithromycin (89.0% vs. 11.0%). The taste of azithromycin was not preferred to that of cefixime (39.0% vs. 53.9%) or loracarbef (36% vs. 58.5%).

A crossover, partially double-blind study was conducted in three phases of 14 days each, during which 11 volunteers wore palatal devices containing six dental enamel blocks covered with plastic meshes to allow biofilm formation. Dental blocks were extraorally submitted to treatment with a 20 % sucrose solution at three different daily frequencies of exposure (0, 3, and 8 times/day), and to the antibiotic suspension or its excipients at an 8-h time interval application regimen. On the 14th day of each phase, the blocks were removed for enamel analysis (surface and cross-sectional microhardness--SMH and CSMH). The antibiotic suspension showed significant higher SMH and CSMH values than the excipients (p < 0.05; Wilcoxon), regardless of the frequency of sucrose exposure. Sucrose exposure did not account for further enamel demineralization both for antibiotic and excipients (p > 0.05; Friedman). A protective effect of the antibiotic suspension on enamel demineralization was verified because its excipients alone promoted more pronounced surface and subsurface enamel demineralization, even in the absence of sucrose exposure. The use of a sugar-free amoxicillin/clavulanic acid suspension may promote a protective effect on primary enamel demineralization probably due to its topical effect on dental biofilm.

570,37,37,15478849,"Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is a ubiquitous disorder in infants. Whereas infants typically outgrow regurgitation by 1 year of age, the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms in those aged 3 to >18 years ranges from 1.8% to 22%. The pathophysiology of GERD in children is similar to that in adults. However, children may present with gastroesophageal and extraesophageal symptoms distinct from classic heartburn. In addition to a growing awareness of the high prevalence of the disorder, increasing evidence supports GERD being a lifelong condition in some individuals that begins in childhood. Although the diagnostic workup in children compared with adults may differ, studies suggest that the early detection and treatment of GERD in childhood may result in better adult disease outcomes, improved quality of life, and decreased overall healthcare burden. Studies of proton pump inhibitor therapy in children confirm high rates of mucosal healing and GER symptom resolution, even in children whose symptoms did not respond to H2-receptor therapy or fundoplication procedures. Omeprazole, lansoprazole, and esomeprazole are formulated as capsules containing enteric-coated granules that can be sprinkled onto applesauce or other soft foods. Lansoprazole is also formulated as strawberry-flavored granules for suspension. These as well as other alternative dosing formulations expand the ability to administer these agents to children. Moreover, long-term studies in adults and in children demonstrate that these agents are safe and well tolerated, even at the higher milligram per kilogram doses that are often required in pediatric patients because of their greater hepatic metabolic capacity.

Oral suspensions or powder dosage forms are often prescribed, particularly to pediatric patients, as they improve swallowability and ease of dose adjustment. Consequently, the bitterness of prednisolone is more apparent in these dosage forms. Few studies have investigated prednisolone's bitterness. Thus, in this study, 50 adults evaluated the bitterness of prednisolone using the generalized Labeled Magnitude Scale (gLMS), in comparison with quinine, a standard bitter substance. Overall, prednisolone-saturated solution demonstrated the same extent (mean gLMS score: 46.8) of bitterness as 1 mM quinine solution (mean gLMS score: 40.1). Additionally, large individual differences were observed in the perception of the bitterness of prednisolone and quinine.

Methods Clopidogrel oral suspension (5 mg/mL) was prepared using clopidogrel bisulfate tablets, Ora-Plus, and Ora-Sweet. Six 2-oz samples were prepared; three were stored at room temperature and three under refrigeration. One milliliter was withdrawn from each sample, diluted to 10 mL with methanol, and exposed to high-frequency sound waves in a water bath to ensure complete dissolution of clopidogrel. A 300-microL sample was then withdrawn, diluted with mobile phase to an expected concentration of 15 microg/mL, and assayed in duplicate using high- performance liquid chromatography immediately after preparation and at 7, 14, 28, and 60 days. The stability of the clopidogrel suspension was determined by calculating the percentage of the initial concentration remaining on each test day. Stability was defined as retention of at least 90% of the initial concentration. At least 97% of the initial clopidogrel concentration remained throughout the 60-day study period, regardless of storage conditions. There were no detectable changes in color, odor, taste, or pH and no visible microbial growth in any sample. The preparation was palatable, with a slightly gritty consistency and a slightly bitter aftertaste; the bitterness intensified slightly between 28 and 60 days but remained fairly mild.

We prospectively compared three MRE oral preparations in pediatric patients with known or suspected Crohn disease with respect to patient-reported tolerability and radiologist-determined small-bowel distension and opacification. Seventy-five pediatric patients (mean age 14.8 years, 55% female) with known or suspected Crohn disease referred for MRE were randomized to an oral preparation with a sugar alcohol-based flavored beverage (Breeza), polyethylene glycol preparation (MiraLAX), or low-concentration barium sulfate suspension (VoLumen). Patients were instructed to consume oral contrast agent (using a weight-based protocol) beginning 60 min prior to MRE imaging. Following MRE, patients completed a questionnaire regarding their oral preparation solution including: taste (1-5 scale), feeling of well-being (1-5 scale) and willingness to consume again (yes/no). Two radiologists reviewed all MRE exams and rated exams for global features (active disease, overall small-bowel distention [1-4 scale]) and features specific to individual small-bowel segments (extent of distention, maximal luminal diameter, opacification, and susceptibility artifact). Statistical methods included one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey honest difference and Fisher exact tests. The overall rate of completion of the entire prescribed contrast volume was 53% (40/75), with a significantly higher rate of completion for MiraLAX than for VoLumen (70% vs. 30%, P=0.007). Crossover to a different preparation occurred in nine patients (12%) and was significantly more frequent when the initial preparation was VoLumen versus MiraLAX (29% vs. 0%, P=0.005). Mean subjective taste ratings for both MiraLAX (3.4, P<0.0001) and Breeza (2.8, P=0.006) were superior to those of VoLumen (1.9), which persisted in the subset of patients with MRE evidence of active Crohn disease. Patients who consumed MiraLAX were more likely to be willing to drink it again compared to those consuming VoLumen (82% vs. 46%, P=0.009). Overall small-bowel distention and bowel-segment-specific metrics (distention, maximal diameter, opacification and susceptibility) did not significantly differ among groups. In pediatric patients with known or suspected Crohn disease, MiraLAX and Breeza were rated as more palatable than VoLumen, and all three preparations achieved a similar degree of small-bowel distension and opacification on MRE. Imaging centers performing MRE should stock multiple oral contrast preparations because a sizable proportion of children require more than one agent to ingest the requisite oral contrast volume.

574,41,41,19136828,"This study evaluated acid production from cooked starch by Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus mitis, and the effects of alpha-amylase inhibitors (maltotriitol and acarbose) and xylitol on acid production. Streptococcal cell suspensions were anaerobically incubated with various carbohydrates that included cooked potato starch in the presence or absence of alpha-amylase. Subsequently, the fall in pH and the acid production rate at pH 7.0 were measured. In addition, the effects of adding alpha-amylase inhibitors and xylitol to the reaction mixture were evaluated. In the absence of alpha-amylase, both the fall in pH and the acid production rate from cooked starch were small. On the other hand, in the presence of alpha-amylase, the pH fell to 3.9-4.4 and the acid production rate was 0.61-0.92 micromol per optical density unit per min. These values were comparable to those for maltose. When using cooked starch, the fall in pH by S. sanguinis and S. mitis was similar to that by S. mutans and S. sobrinus. For all streptococci, alpha-amylase inhibitors caused a decrease in acid production from cooked starch, although xylitol only decreased acid production by S. mutans and S. sobrinus. These results suggest that cooked starch is potentially acidogenic in the presence of alpha-amylase, which occurs in the oral cavity. In terms of the acidogenic potential of cooked starch, S. sanguinis and S. mitis were comparable to S. mutans and S. sobrinus. Alpha-amylase inhibitors and xylitol might moderate this activity.

575,42,42,22478950,"Prescribing of diclofenac for children usually involves a dose different from commercially available strengths. This drug is available only as tablets, which can be divided only so many times before the dose obtained becomes inaccurate. In addition, children may have difficulty swallowing tablets. For these reasons, a compounding formula for a liquid dosage form is essential to ensure effective delivery of the drug to pediatric patients. To develop a compounding formula for diclofenac sodium and to determine the extended physical and chemical stability of this compound when stored in amber polyvinyl chloride (PVC) prescription bottles under refrigeration and at room temperature. A suspension of diclofenac sodium (10 mg/mL) was prepared from commercially available diclofenac sodium tablets, with Ora-Blend as the suspending and flavouring agent. The suspension was packaged in 60-mL amber PVC prescription bottles and stored at either room temperature (23°C) or under refrigeration (5°C). Samples were collected on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 27, 56, and 93. Chemical stability was determined using a validated stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography method. At each sampling time, the suspensions were checked for changes in appearance (i.e., colour, layering, caking, ease of resuspension), odour, and pH. The diclofenac sodium suspensions were very stable, retaining at least 99.5% of the original concentration for up to 93 days, regardless of storage temperature. There were no apparent changes in the physical appearance of the suspensions, nor were there any substantial changes in odour or pH. Suspensions of diclofenac sodium (10 mg/mL) were quantitatively stable but difficult to prepare because of the enteric coating of the tablets. Therefore, it is recommended that diclofenac powder be used for the preparation of suspensions. For pediatric use, palatability is a consideration, and a masking agent should be added before administration. An expiry date of up to 93 days is suggested. La prescription de diclofénac aux enfants requiert généralement une dose qui ne correspond à aucun des dosages disponibles dans le commerce. Ce médicament n’existe que sous forme de comprimés qui ne peuvent être subdivisés que quelques fois sans compromettre l’exactitude de la dose obtenue.

The patient's own spontaneous verbal judgements, directly after the dose intake and also 3-4 minutes later, were recorded. The parents were asked about the child's acceptance of the suspension after finalized treatment. For 214 patients compliance was calculated from the remaining amount of suspension in the returned medication bottles. The study indicated that children aged 6 years or older considered the test formulation to be better-tasting than the standard formulation. The judgements by the parents also indicated that the test suspension was more acceptable. In children below 6 years there was no significant difference between the two suspensions with regard to taste or acceptance.

In the first part (A), suspensions of two lactobacilli strains (L. reuteri DSM 17938, L. plantarum 299v) were added to suspensions of supragingival dental plaque collected from healthy young adults (n=25). LA production after fermentation with either xylitol or fructose was analyzed. In the second part (B), subjects (n=18) were given lozenges with probiotic lactobacilli (L. reuteri DSM 17938 and ATCC PTA 5289) or placebo for two weeks in a double-blinded, randomized cross-over trial. The concentration of LA in supragingival plaque samples was determined at baseline and after 2 weeks. Salivary counts of mutans streptococci (MS) and lactobacilli were estimated with chair-side methods. Plaque suspensions with L. reuteri DSM 17938 produced significantly less LA compared with L. plantarum 299v or controls (p<0.05). Fructose gave higher LA concentrations than xylitol. In part B, there were no significant differences in LA production between baseline and follow up in any of the groups and no differences between test and placebo were displayed. The salivary MS counts were not significantly altered during the intervention but the lactobacilli counts increased significantly in the test group (p<0.05). Lactic acid production in suspensions of plaque and probiotic lactobacilli was strain-dependant and the present study provides no evidence of an increase in plaque acidity by the supply of selected probiotic lactobacilli when challenged by fructose or xylitol.

While oral liquid formulations of prednisone enable weight-based dosing, children frequently find them to be objectionable due to bitter taste. This limitation of prednisone can adversely impact patient acceptance and may result in non-compliance. Efforts to mask flavours often result in poorly controlled, heterogeneous particle distributions and can provide ineffective taste masking. The present work utilized a novel drug delivery technology developed by Orbis Biosciences, Inc., to create an oral taste-masked formulation of prednisone. The study examined the palatability of Orbis' microsphere prednisone formulation in healthy young adults (n = 24). Four test articles were used in the study including a reference formulation (Roxanne Laboratories), a control and the test formulation (Orbis) prepared in two different ways. Study participants were randomized in a crossover design. Results indicated that the test prednisone formulation was indistinguishable from the control, and both were preferable to the reference formulation in every category of palatability assessed using a validated 9-point Hedonic Scale. The data also suggested that preparing the microsphere suspension immediately before administration results in the most ideal palatability properties.

The proportion of X(S) ms was decreased after 6 wk in groups A and B and remained so during the experimental period. The lactic acid formation rates decreased slightly ( approximately 10%) in the two xylitol groups compared with baseline. In conclusion, our results showed that although an alteration of ms strains was demonstrated following a regular daily low-dose intake of xylitol, the long-term total ms counts in plaque and saliva as well as plaque acidogenicity remained unchanged.

580,47,47,16732449,"Growing evidence from clinical studies suggests that mothers using xylitol gums or lozenges have decreased levels of Streptococcus mutans (SM) and do not transmit these cariogenic bacteria as readily to their children. To begin to determine mechanisms for these clinical findings and to explore potential synergism of antimicrobial combinations, we studied the effect of multiple exposures of chlorhexidine (CHX) combined with copper gluconate (CG) or zinc gluconate (ZG) followed by xylitol (XYL) on the ability of SM to adhere and form biofilms. Cell suspensions of SM were exposed two times to CHX; CG; CHX plus CG; ZG; and CHX plus ZG, and then four times to XYL. Control cells were exposed six times to water or XYL or received no treatment. For biofilm assessment, glass slides were inoculated with treated cells, and numbers of bacteria were enumerated after 48 hours of incubation. To assess the ability of SM to adhere, microtiter plate wells coated with primary S. sanguinis biofilms grown in sucrose were inoculated with treated SM, and adhesion was determined. Cells exposed to CHX-XYL combinations exhibited significant but transient inhibition of growth. The multiple-exposure regimen groups showed significant decreases in the ability of SM to form biofilms (P < 0.05). However, the CHX-XYL group exhibited a much greater effect than the other treatment groups (P < 0.001). Adhesion studies revealed that none of the multiple-exposure regimens had a significant effect on adhesion of SM to primary biofilms of S. sanguinis. We concluded that significant inhibition of SM growth and subsequent inability to grow as biofilms in the presence of sucrose occurs after a staggered exposure regimen to CHX initially and then to XYL. This may help explain the clinical data showing the decreased levels of SM in mothers treated with CHX and XYL.

Granulation experiments were performed incorporating PZQ either in the powder mixture, according to the traditional way, or in the liquid phase containing wetting agents. In the powder mixture several excipients were tested: Flowlac 100 as filler, Galeniq 721 (isomalt) and Neosorb P 100 T (D-sorbitol) as sweeteners and PVP K30 as binder; while in the liquid phase Lutrol F68, Cremophor RH 40 or Tween 80 as surfactants were investigated. Different formulations loaded with 10% w/w (batches 1-8) and 20% w/w of PZQ (batches 9-13) were produced The majority of granules displayed good flow properties and uniform drug content. X-ray powder diffraction showed that PZQ remained in its original crystalline state, while differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform-infrared analysis evidenced the formation of chemical interactions among the ingredients. The solubilisation test performed in non-sink condition to reproduce the actual condition in which a child of 4 years takes the medicine revealed that granules quickly formed a very fine suspension in water (dV90=39.9 μm). Although after the granulation process the solubility of raw PZQ was not increased, adding the aqueous suspension to 500 ml of buffer solution of pH 1.5, simulating the fasted state of a child, 50% of the drug was dissolved after 30 min. After granule manipulation with milk and fruit juices, no PZQ degradation was observed during time. Finally, the selected granule formulation provided evidence to be stable even at hot and very humid climate (30°C/75% RH), at least for the examined time.

Twenty healthy volunteer children with a mean age of 9.2 +/- 2.0 SD years (range 6-12). The taste of each antibiotic was rated by the children on a 10-cm visual analog scale incorporating a facial hedonic scale. The children were also asked which antibiotic they thought tasted the best and which tasted the worst. Taste scores were as follows: cloxacillin 1.4 +/- 1.8 cm, cephalexin 6.5 +/- 2.7 cm, erythromycin 6.8 +/- 3.0 cm, and fusidic acid 6.3 +/- 2.4 cm. The taste rating of cloxacillin was significantly lower compared with the other three antibiotics (p = 0.001). Cloxacillin was chosen as having the worst taste by a significant proportion of the children (18 of 20). None of the antibiotics was clearly best tasting. Given similar effectiveness, taste considerations may be important in the decision as to which antibiotic to prescribe. The perception that cloxacillin is poor tasting to children is supported by this study, which suggests that when compliance with oral medication is critical for successful treatment, prescription of cloxacillin suspension should be avoided.

585,52,52,23383224,"This study aimed to investigate the possible topical effect of a broad-spectrum antibiotic on dental biofilm formed in situ in the absence or presence of sucrose. A crossover study was conducted in three phases of 14 days each, during which 11 volunteers wore palatal devices containing 6 enamel blocks covered with meshes to allow biofilm formation. Dental blocks were extraorally submitted to a 20% sucrose solution at three different frequencies of exposure (0, 3 and 8 times/day), and to a suspension of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium (A/CP) or a placebo (P) suspension at an 8-hour time interval application regimen. On the 14(th) day of each phase, biofilms were collected for microbiological (conventional culture) and molecular (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis--DGGE) analyses. In the absence of sucrose exposure (SE) and at the 3-time daily frequency, dental biofilms treated with A/CP showed lower total biofilm weight and lower counts of total microbiota than the ones treated with P (p>0.05). A/CP presented higher counts of Candida spp. when compared with P in the presence of SE, especially at the 8-time daily frequency (p<0.05). Considering the DGGE analysis, the mean number of bands was higher for P (p>0.05), regardless of SE. However, DGGE profiles demonstrated large interindividual variability. Both conventional culture and DGGE have demonstrated some differences on total microbiota of dental biofilms when exposed to the A/CP or P suspensions, mainly in the absence of sucrose, which suggests a possible topical effect of the sugar-free A/CP suspension on dental biofilm.

The applicability of an electronic tongue in the development of a taste masked generic ibuprofen suspension, starting from a commercial taste masked product, was evaluated in this study. The initial screening study on 3 proprietary and 11 generic products showed that sensors of the taste sensing system TS-5000Z could clearly detect differences between the products. The variation of sensor responses were mainly caused by sodium salts, sweeteners, and preservatives, whereas pH and viscosity did not affect sensor response. In addition, the presence of the particles (20-100 µm) did not damage the sensor membranes. Based on this screening, and the known qualitative composition of the proprietary formulations, the approximate quantitative composition of a proprietary formulation could be deduced and a taste masked generic formulation could be developed using the electronic tongue data. Differences in sensor responses between the proprietary and optimized generic formulation were smaller than 11 mV for each sensor.

A single-blind taste test of 2 different steroid suspensions, liquid prednisolone (1mg/ml) versus liquid dexamethasone (1mg/ml), was conducted in children aged 5-12 years, presenting to the pediatric emergency department with an exacerbation of asthma requiring steroid treatment. Children received 2.5mls of either prednisolone or dexamethasone and were asked to score their impression of taste on a 10 cm visual analog scale. After cleansing of the palate they were given the other steroid and scored its taste. Thirty-nine children (54% male) were enrolled in the study. The mean age was 7.1 years (SD=2.0).

The addition of glucose to an unbuffered suspension of cells results in the extrusion of acid. This process was inhibited by diethylstilbestrol (DES), an inhibitor of the H(+)-ATPase (IC50 71 microM), and also by amiloride (IC50 824 microM) and EIPA (IC50 203 microM). The presence of 100 mM NaCl reduced the degree of inhibition observed for amiloride and EIPA, but had no effect on inhibition by DES. N-Methylglucosamine partially protected the cells against the effect of amiloride, but choline chloride did not, suggesting that sodium may be important in the action of amiloride. To establish the site of action of amiloride and EIPA, ATP hydrolysis assays were performed on isolated plasma membranes. H(+)-ATPase activity was inhibited by orthovanadate, but not by amiloride or EIPA. However, both amiloride and EIPA were found to inhibit the incorporation of radioactivity from labelled glucose in S. pombe, with IC50 values of 879 and 272 microM for amiloride and EIPA respectively. Again, 100 mM NaCl was found to reduce the effectiveness of inhibition. Amiloride had no effect on the uptake of 2-deoxyglucose under the same conditions, indicating that amiloride does not inhibit the glucose transporter. We propose that amiloride and EIPA disrupt glucose-induced acidification by inhibiting glucose metabolism.

591,58,58,1590430,"To determine whether growth hormone (GH) directly affects ammoniagenesis in the renal proximal tubule, ammonia production was measured in suspensions of isolated canine renal proximal tubule segments (IPTs) incubated with 2.5 mM L-glutamine and varying concentrations of human growth hormone (hGH). Ammonia production from IPTs significantly increased by nearly threefold in the presence of hGH (10(-6) M) at 60 min. This increase was dose dependent, with as little as 10(-9) M hGH significantly stimulating ammonia production. In addition, hGH enhanced glucose production when lactate, alanine, and succinate replaced L-glutamine as substrate. hGH significantly stimulated ammonia production when IPTs were incubated at alkalotic and neutral pH. The effect of hGH was lost at acidic pH. When hGH was added to IPTs incubated under Na(+)-equilibrated conditions, ammonia production was not different from control. hGH stimulated ouabain-sensitive Na(+)-K(+)-adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) activity by 8.1 +/- 1.1% in basolateral membranes isolated from IPTs. hGH stimulation of proximal tubule ammonia production from L-glutamine occurs at physiological concentrations of hGH and when the extracellular-to-intracellular Na+ gradient favors L-glutamine transport. This effect is associated with an increase in basolateral Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity. The data suggest a role for hGH in the regulation of renal acid-base metabolism under physiological conditions in which increased net acid excretion is important.

The acceptability of the single dose was good. The terminal elimination half-life t1/2 (h) and the mean residence time (MRT, h) of fusidate were similar to those determined in healthy adults after oral dosing, i.e. 16.0 +/- 14.5 versus 16.0 +/- 3.5 and 17.7 +/- 12.1 versus 17.7 +/- 2.5, respectively. In contrast, the oral bioavailability of the suspension (Fapprox., %) was relatively low: of the order of 22.5 versus 91.0% for tablets in the healthy adult, which justifies the use of a relatively higher dose in the child. This led to the calculation of an estimated total clearance (Clest., ml/min) significantly less than that in the healthy adults, while the estimated apparent volume of distribution (Vd, litre/kg) was significantly increased (10.4 +/- 9.1 versus 21.8 +/- 2.1 and 0.73 +/- 0.53 versus 0.30 +/- 0.04, respectively).

Although beta-galactosidase activities were observed in all the strains, 4'-beta-galactosyllactose could not be used as a carbon source for the growth of mutans streptococci. Enzymes metabolizing 4'-beta-galactosyllactose were induced when S. oralis ATCC 10557 was cultured in medium containing galactose. These results suggested that 4'-beta-galactosyllactose could be as cariogenic as lactose if it is consumed frequently and retained for a long period in the mouth.

597,64,64,2847549,"To determine whether parathyroid hormone (PTH) affects ammoniagenesis in renal proximal tubule, we measured ammonia production in suspensions of canine renal proximal tubular segments incubated with 10 mM L-glutamine in the absence or presence of 10(-7) M PTH. Productions of ammonia were linear functions of time for 120 min and averaged 231 +/- 55 and 311 +/- 67 mumol ammonia/g protein in the absence and presence of PTH, respectively. When measured over the range of 10(-11)-10(-7) M PTH, half-maximal stimulation of ammonia production occurred between 10(-10) and 10(-9) M PTH. Maximal production of ammonia was observed at 10(-8) M PTH. Incubation of proximal tubular segments with PTH increased levels of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) in vitro. Ammonia production was significantly enhanced by incubation of segments with the cAMP analogue, 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate. PTH also increased ammonia production in segments incubated with 1 mM L-glutamine. We conclude that PTH stimulates ammonia production in canine renal proximal tubular segments. This effect appears to be mediated, at least in part, through cAMP in vitro. Such stimulation could reflect a direct action of PTH on the proximal tubule to enhance ammoniagenesis in vivo.

598,65,65,3386134,"Renal hypertrophy is a common consequence of diabetes mellitus that precedes and possibly accounts for the increased glomerular filtration rate. We have postulated that the glucose-mediated increase in the intracellular concentration of sodium [Na]i initiates the chain of events leading to the increase in cell size and eventually cell number. Experiments were conducted on Sprague-Dawley rats made diabetic by the intravenous injection of 45 mg/kg body wt of streptozotocin dissolved in a 5 mM citrate buffer solution. Control animals were injected with the vehicle alone. Ninety-six hours and 11 weeks later, measurements of [Na]i were done by NMR spectroscopy on suspensions of proximal tubules, using dysprosium tripolyphosphate as an extracellular shift reagent. At 96 hours after the induction of the diabetes, there was a 60% increase in [Na]i compared to control (P less than 0.01). No further increase in [Na]i was observed during the subsequent 11 weeks of observation. Addition of ouabain (1.0 mM) resulted in a fourfold increase in [Na]i in tubules from control animals, and a 2.5-fold increase in tubules from 96-hour diabetic rats. Ouabain-inhibitable Na+-K+-ATPase activity was substantially higher in the renal tubules of diabetic rats, the increase being proportional to that of [Na]i. In order to ascertain the effect of hyperglycemia on [Na]i, proximal tubules prepared from kidneys of normal and diabetic rats were exposed to low (5 mM) and high (25 mM) concentration of glucose in the media.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) ",Intracellular sodium in proximal tubules of diabetic rats.

599,66,66,15641497,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the lactic acid concentration in supragingival plaque from caries-active pre-school children after a short-term use of either xylitol- or sorbitol-containing chewing gums. The investigation consisted of a prospective crossover design with 10 healthy children aged 2-4 years each with at least two caries lesions within the dentine (ds > or = 2). The children were instructed to chew 6 pieces of a test or a control gum every day for a 14-day period. The test gum contained 65% xylitol and the control gum was sweetened with sorbitol. At baseline and after 14 days, salivary mutans streptococci were enumerated with a chair-side test (Strip mutans) and dental plaque was collected from the upper maxillary incisors. After a washout period of 6 weeks, the same procedure was repeated with the corresponding test or control gum. Lactic acid was determined enzymatically in glucose-challenged plaque suspensions. The lactic acid concentration was significantly reduced (p<0.05) by 22% compared with baseline following the xylitol gum regimen but was unaltered after the control gum. The levels of salivary mutans streptococci were mainly unaffected by both chewing gums. A 14-day use of xylitol-containing chewing gums, corresponding to a daily amount of 5 grams of xylitol, could diminish glucose-initiated lactic acid formation in supragingival plaque in caries-active pre-school children.

600,67,67,7279470,"Cariogenicity of seven commonly prescribed liquid medications was studied. Sucrose content of the medications ranged from 0 to 70 gm/100 ml. Initial pH and buffering capacity were measured and found to vary widely among the medications. Intraoral microbial plaque pH changes were determined at intervals for 30 minutes following an oral rinse with each medication. These data were compared with plaque pH changes caused by rinsing with an established cariogenic challenge, 10% sucrose solution. Decreased plaque pH was caused by each medication tested. The extent and duration of the pH drop varied among the medications. Patterns of the pH curves are discussed in relation to sucrose content, endogenous pH, and buffering capacity of the medications. Intraoral pH response to several medications equaled or exceeded that seen when sucrose rinses alone were given. The findings are discussed in relation to dental caries-producing potential of long-term therapy with liquid medications, and two cases are presented that implicate liquid medications as a major etiologic factor leading to rampant dental decay. It is concluded that health practitioners should be aware of the sucrose content of pediatric medications. Patient education to ensure adequate oral clearance following each dose of medication is an essential first step in minimizing the risk of dental decay posed by long-term therapy with liquid medications.

601,68,68,11641569,"The cariogenic potential of lactosylfructoside [O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1-->4)-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1<-->2)-beta-D-fructofuranoside] was estimated by experiments on oral streptococci in vitro and human dental plaque in situ. Lactosylfructoside was unable to support growth of the strains of Streptococcus mutans and S. sobrinus used in this study. However, it was able to support growth of strains of S. sanguis, S. mitis and S. oralis. Acid was produced rapidly by cell suspensions of S. oralis ATCC 10557 incubated with lactosylfructoside. Application of 5% w/v solution decreased the pH of human dental plaque. The minimum pH value was below 5.3. The results suggest that lactosylfructoside is as acidogenic as lactose and could be cariogenic if it is consumed frequently and retained for a long period in the mouth.

602,69,69,3237306,"A study was carried out to determine the effect of trypsin on glucose transport into brain cells. Two suspensions of dissociated cells were prepared from the two brain hemispheres of adult rats--one using only mechanical means to dissociate the cells and one using trypsin. The use of trypsin for preparation of dissociated brain cells caused a marked reduction in the rate of transport of [1,2-3H]-2-deoxy-D-glucose compared to uptakes of this glucose analog by cells prepared without trypsin. Responses of the two cell preparations to inhibitors of glucose transport (cytochalasin B and phloretin) were similar. Rates of oxidation of [6-14C]glucose to 14CO2 by trypsin-treated cells were nearly double those in cells prepared without trypsin. Electron microscopic examination of the two preparations revealed much less preservation of structural integrity if trypsin was used to prepare the cells. The findings suggest that trypsin alters cell structure and affects receptor-regulated events in brain cells.

603,70,70,7595773,"The onset of hematochezia with the use of sodium polystyrene sulfonate enemas in an index case prompted us to review our experience with the use of such enemas in neonates. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate enemas were used in 20 of 2317 patients. Of these 20 patients, four (20%) had evidence of hematochezia temporally related to the use of the enemas. No episodes of such bleeding occurred in infants who were older than 29 weeks of gestation or larger than 1250 gm birth weight. In one case an autopsy performed within 2 days of the enemas showed extensive vascular congestion within the mucosa and submucosa with focal areas of hemorrhage. Approximately 20% sorbitol (1098 mOsm/L) was the vehicle for suspension of the sodium polystyrene sulfonate. On the basis of evidence regarding similar morbidities in adults, we are concerned that the hyperosmolar suspending agent, sorbitol, may be the cause of such pathologic conditions in the colon of susceptible infants.
