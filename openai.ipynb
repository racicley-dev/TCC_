      "Title: Physicochemical and microbiological stability of 40 mg/mL amiodarone hydrochloride oral suspension.\n",
      "Abstract: In an effort to expedite the publication of articles, AJHP is posting manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance. Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. Amiodarone hydrochloride is an antiarrhythmic drug used to treat supraventricular tachycardia. However, there are currently no commercial pediatric forms available to treat young patients. Various oral formulations were previously reported in the literature, but the concentration was lower than the doses prescribed in clinical practice (a loading dose of 500 mg/m2/day for 7-10 days followed by a maintenance dose of 250 mg/m2/day). The objective of this study was to develop an oral liquid formulation of amiodarone hydrochloride at an optimal concentration for use in children and to evaluate its physicochemical and microbiological stability. No commercial suspension vehicle was used, allowing the choice of excipients. Compounding was performed using hydroxypropylmethylcellulose as thickener, potassium sorbate preservative, citric acid/sodium citrate buffer, sodium saccharin as a , and a strawberry flavoring agent. A concentration of 40 mg/mL was selected based on a 5-year compilation of prescribed doses. Analyses performed were the following: visual and microscopic inspection, testing for antimicrobial preservation, osmolality and pH measurements, quantification of amiodarone hydrochloride by a stability-indicating liquid chromatography method, and a microbiological count. At least 95% of the initial amiodarone hydrochloride remained stable during the 60-day study period under refrigeration. All other tested parameters remained stable at 5 °C. A targeted log reduction of the microorganism inoculum by day 14 and no microbial growth by day 28 were demonstrated in the test for antimicrobial preservation. The stability of 40 mg/mL amiodarone hydrochloride oral suspension was maintained under refrigeration for 60 days before opening bottles and for 1 month after opening bottles. \n",

      "Title: Pediatric oral extemporaneous preparations and practices: International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) global study.\n",
      "Abstract: This publication is the first to report current, global, pediatric oral extemporaneous compounding practices. Complete survey responses were received from 470 participants actively involved in compounding across all the World Health Organization (WHO) regions. The survey addressed oral formulation of extemporaneous liquids, including the use of commercial or in-house vehicles, flavoring excipients, source of formulation recipes, and beyond use dates (BUDs). Over 90% of the survey participants prepared oral liquids. Solid dosage forms, comprising capsules and powder papers (sachets) were also frequently prepared for children, albeit to a lesser extent. The top 20 active pharmaceutical ingredients compounded for children, globally, were: omeprazole, captopril, spironolactone, propranolol, furosemide, phenobarbital, hydrochlorothiazide, ursodeoxycholic acid, sildenafil, melatonin, clonidine, enalapril, dexamethasone, baclofen, caffeine, chloral hydrate, trimethoprim, atenolol, hydrocortisone, carvedilol and prednisolone. Diuretics, drugs for acid-related disorders, and beta-blockers were the top three most frequently compounded classes per the WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. The principal need identified for the practice of extemporaneous compounding for children was the development of an international, open-access formulary that includes validated formulations, as well as updated compounding literature and guidelines. Furthermore, improved access to data from stability studies to allow compounding of formulations with extended BUDs. \n",

      "Title: Successful Treatment of Recurrent Clostridioides difficile Infection Using a Novel, Drinkable, Oral Formulation of Fecal Microbiota.\n",
      "Abstract: Fecal microbiota transplants can be administered orally in encapsulated form or require invasive procedures to administer liquid formulations. There is a need for an oral liquid formulation of fecal microbiota for patients who are unable to swallow capsules, especially if they require multiple, repeated administrations. These studies were conducted to develop a protocol to manufacture an organoleptically acceptable powdered fecal microbiota formulation that can be suspended in a liquid carrier and used for fecal microbiota transplantation. Several processing steps were investigated, including extra washes of microbiota prior to lyophilization and an addition of a flavoring agent. The viability of bacteria in the transplant formulation was tested using live/dead microscopy staining and engraftment into antibiotic-treated mice. After development of a clinical protocol for suspension of the powdered microbiota, the new formulation was tested in three elderly patients with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections and who have difficulties in swallowing capsules. Changes in the microbial community structure in one of the patients were characterized using 16S rRNA gene profiling and engraftment analysis. The processing steps used to produce an organoleptically acceptable suspension of powdered fecal microbiota did not result in loss of its viability. The powder could be easily suspended in a liquid carrier. The use of the new formulation was associated with abrogation of the cycle of C. difficile infection recurrences in the three patients. We developed a novel organoleptically acceptable liquid formulation of fecal microbiota that is suitable for use in clinical trials for patients with difficulties in swallowing capsules. \n",

      "Title: Super Bolus-A Remedy for a High Glycemic Index Meal in Children with Type 1 Diabetes on Insulin Pump Therapy?-A Randomized, Double-Blind, Controlled Trial.\n",
      "Abstract: This study aimed to compare whether a super bolus (SB) is a more efficient strategy than a normal bolus (NB) for high glycemic index (h-GI) meals in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). A randomized, double-blind, crossover trial with an allocation ratio of 1:1, registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04019821). 72 children aged 10-18 years with T1D > 1 year, and on insulin pump therapy > 3 months were included. As an intervention, they ate a h-GI breakfast for the two following days and receive a prandial insulin bolus either in the form of SB or NB. The SB group had lower glucose values during the observation time and lower glucose levels in 90th min (primary end point). The median time in range was also higher after SB. At the same time, more hypoglycemic episodes and a higher time below range were noted in this group. Almost 90% of them were the threshold value for initiating treatment for hypoglycemia and occurred near the end of observation period. More hyperglycemic episodes and over twice as much time in hyperglycemia were noted after NB. Super bolus is an effective strategy to avoid postprandial hyperglycemia but the basal insulin suspension should be longer to avoid hypoglycemia (f.ex. 3 h). \n"

      "Example string: In an effort to expedite the publication of articles, AJHP is posting manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance. Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. Amiodarone hydrochloride is an antiarrhythmic drug used to treat supraventricular tachycardia. However, there are currently no commercial pediatric forms available to treat young patients. Various oral formulations were previously reported in the literature, but the concentration was lower than the doses prescribed in clinical practice (a loading dose of 500 mg/m2/day for 7-10 days followed by a maintenance dose of 250 mg/m2/day). The objective of this study was to develop an oral liquid formulation of amiodarone hydrochloride at an optimal concentration for use in children and to evaluate its physicochemical and microbiological stability. No commercial suspension vehicle was used, allowing the choice of excipients. Compounding was performed using hydroxypropylmethylcellulose as thickener, potassium sorbate preservative, citric acid/sodium citrate buffer, sodium saccharin as a , and a strawberry flavoring agent. A concentration of 40 mg/mL was selected based on a 5-year compilation of prescribed doses. Analyses performed were the following: visual and microscopic inspection, testing for antimicrobial preservation, osmolality and pH measurements, quantification of amiodarone hydrochloride by a stability-indicating liquid chromatography method, and a microbiological count. At least 95% of the initial amiodarone hydrochloride remained stable during the 60-day study period under refrigeration. All other tested parameters remained stable at 5 °C. A targeted log reduction of the microorganism inoculum by day 14 and no microbial growth by day 28 were demonstrated in the test for antimicrobial preservation. The stability of 40 mg/mL amiodarone hydrochloride oral suspension was maintained under refrigeration for 60 days before opening bottles and for 1 month after opening bottles. \n",

Amiodarone hydrochloride is an antiarrhythmic drug used to treat supraventricular tachycardia. However, there are currently no commercial pediatric forms available to treat young patients. Various oral formulations were previously reported in the literature, but the concentration was lower than the doses prescribed in clinical practice (a loading dose of 500 mg/m2/day for 7-10 days followed by a maintenance dose of 250 mg/m2/day). The objective of this study was to develop an oral liquid formulation of amiodarone hydrochloride at an optimal concentration for use in children and to evaluate its physicochemical and microbiological stability. No commercial suspension vehicle was used, allowing the choice of excipients. Compounding was performed using hydroxypropylmethylcellulose as thickener, potassium sorbate preservative, citric acid/sodium citrate buffer, sodium saccharin as a , and a strawberry flavoring agent. A concentration of 40 mg/mL was selected based on a 5-year compilation of prescribed doses. Analyses performed were the following: visual and microscopic inspection, testing for antimicrobial preservation, osmolality and pH measurements, quantification of amiodarone hydrochloride by a stability-indicating liquid chromatography method, and a microbiological count. At least 95% of the initial amiodarone hydrochloride remained stable during the 60-day study period under refrigeration. All other tested parameters remained stable at 5 °C. A targeted log reduction of the microorganism inoculum by day 14 and no microbial growth by day 28 were demonstrated in the test for antimicrobial preservation. The stability of 40 mg/mL amiodarone hydrochloride oral suspension was maintained under refrigeration for 60 days before opening bottles and for 1 month after opening bottles. \n",

      "        String: Amiodarone is commercially available as both a tablet and an injectable formulation. It is widely dispensed as an extemporaneously compounded suspension for pediatric and geriatric patients. Extensive stability data at numerous temperatures and a calculated shelf life based on kinetics for such a formulation have not been reported. Refrigeration and room temperature data for finite times have been reported in the literature. In this study, a stable extemporaneous formulation of amiodarone hydrochloride was formulated using Paceron tablets. The formulation consisted of 0.75% carboxymethylcellulose and 0.75% Veegum as suspending agents; 25% sucrose, provided as simple syrup; and aqueous strawberry concentrate as flavor. A total of 2.5L of the formulation was compounded and stored in quanitites of 150 mL in 8-oz glass containers. The initial drug content was determined by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, with a method that was developed in our laboratory. The stability study was carried out by storing three containers at five different temperatures, namely 4, 30, 40, 50, and 60 deg C. The suspension was analyzed at the end of 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours at 7 days, and, therafter, at the end of every week for 13 weeks. The percentage of drug remaining was plotted against time for each temperature. The slope of the regression line was obtained for each temperature and the zero-order degradation rate constant obtained. The logarithm of the zero-order degradation rate constants was plotted against the inverse of the temperature in degrees Kelvin to obtain the Arrhenius plot. From the regression line for the Arrhenius plot, the zero-order degradation constant at 25 deg C was calculated to be 0.0517 day -1. The shelf life for the formulation at 25 deg C was calculated to be 193.4 days; the shelf life under refrigeration (4 deg C) was found to be 677.3 days. The degradation products were characterized using high-performance liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometry. Data obtained from the analysis suggested that amiodarone cleaved at its ketone and ether linkages to yield corresponding degradation products. \n",

      "        String: The stability of theophylline (T) and propranolol hydrochloride (P) in extemporaneously compounded oral suspensions (25 mg/mL or 50 mg/mL for T and 2 mg/mL or 5 mg/mL for P) were studied. Suspension with P and T were prepared with bulk substance or tablets using three different suspending vehicles: Ora-Sweet (M1), modified Ora-Sweet (M2) and simple syrup with glycerol and sorbitol (M3). Each suspension was stored for 35 days in a dark place at 25 degrees C and 4 degrees C. The results demonstrated that the prepared suspensions with P either from tablets or from a substance were stable in all three studied vehicles (more than 95% of initial concentration remaining). However, it is recommended that storage at 4 degrees C of suspensions prepared with M2 should be avoided because of crystallization of the buffer substances. Extemporaneous suspensions with T in an appropriate pediatric concentrations of the drug were not obtained because the problem of fast crystallization of T was not eliminated. \n",

Suspension with P and T were prepared with bulk substance or tablets using three different suspending vehicles: Ora-Sweet (M1), modified Ora-Sweet (M2) and simple syrup with glycerol and sorbitol (M3). Each suspension was stored for 35 days in a dark place at 25 degrees C and 4 degrees C. The results demonstrated that the prepared suspensions with P either from tablets or from a substance were stable in all three studied vehicles (more than 95% of initial concentration remaining). However, it is recommended that storage at 4 degrees C of suspensions prepared with M2 should be avoided because of crystallization of the buffer substances. Extemporaneous suspensions with T in an appropriate pediatric concentrations of the drug were not obtained because the problem of fast crystallization of T was not eliminated. \n",

      "        String: Indomethacin is used for off-label prescription for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants. In Argentina, indomethacin is only available as a suppository, dermic cream, injectable ampules, and delayed-release capsules. Aiming to improve pediatric treatment and minimize the risk associated with improper dosage, this work focused on the development of an extemporaneous 0.2% indomethacin oral suspension, starting from the commercially injectable formulation. Two 150-mL batches of suspension were prepared using Generally Recognized as Safe excipients. The suspensions were stored for 17 days at room temperature. Physical stability, morphological analysis of suspended particles, sedimentation volume, easy re-suspension, and dynamic viscosity were studied. The indomethacin content, dissolution studies, and microbiological attributes of nonsterile pharmaceutical products were also evaluated. After 17 days of storage, the suspension was easily re-dispersed after 15 seconds of the hand-shaking technique. There were no detectable changes in color, odor, and/or flavor. The suspension showed minimal changes in pH, viscosity, shape, and mean size of the suspended indomethacin particles. The content uniformity and drug dissolution remained within the acceptable range during storage. This oral liquid suspension is an interesting alternative to be prepared by hospital pharmacy services for optimizing the pediatric treatment of patent ductus arteriosus. \n",
