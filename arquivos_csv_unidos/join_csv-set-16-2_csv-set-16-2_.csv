0,0,33248659,"Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in blood samples can be used as useful biomarkers to diagnose various human diseases. This study describes the potential of a paper-based sensor array for detecting leukemia using blood VOCs. Blood samples were collected from 59 new leukemia cases and 47 healthy cases as a control group. Each blood sample was divided into two parts; one for a laboratory test and the other was used in our study. Samples were mixed with heparin and then transferred to a sterile container, and a sensor was stacked on its cap. This sensor array contains 16 nanoparticles deposited on a sheet of hydrophobic paper in a 4 × 4 array format. Containers were stored in an oven at 60 °C for 4.5 h. Then, the image of sensors was recorded by a scanner and compared to the image before exposing the blood vapor. The sensor responses were subjected to different multivariate statistical methods to develop models that discriminate between control and leukemia samples. The interaction of nanoparticles with the volatile metabolome of blood caused aggregation and consequently changing in the color of nanoparticles. The color changes resulted in a specific pattern for blood samples with leukemia, which is different from those obtained from healthy specimens. The discrimination analysis was approved by pattern recognition methods such as principal component analysis with 97% accuracy. Among 59 patients, the mean age was 6.02 ± 4.55 years (range 1-16 y). The mean total response was 652.83 ± 117.02. The rock curve showed an accuracy of 96% for classifying patients from the control group. The logistic regression model showed that 93.6% of healthy and 93.2% of patients were classified correctly by using this method. These statistics agree with the classification results obtained by principal component analysis. For every 5000-unit increase in platelet count, the chance of leukemia decreased by 9%. Additionally, the chance of being categorized as a patient decreased by 10% for every 20-unit increase in total response. The electronic nose using VOC's of blood is a non-invasive and inexpensive tool for detecting new cases of leukemia with high sensitivity and specificity. Platelet count is an essential para-clinical parameter determining the total response of the sensors. Follow up studies with a larger sample size are warranted to elucidate its clinical applicability.

We followed up 231 PHIV, 125 perinatally HIV-exposed, uninfected (HEU), and 138 HIV-unexposed, uninfected (HUU) adolescents (aged 10 years and older), matched by age/sex, in Thailand and Cambodia for 3 years. Executive function was assessed with Children's Color Trails Tests 1 and 2 (CCTT-1 and -2), the design fluency test, and the verbal fluency test. Working memory (Freedom from Distractibility Index) and processing speed index were assessed using WISC-III. Visual memory was assessed by design memory and design recognition subtests of the Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning (WRAML-2) and behavioral problems using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Generalized estimating equations examined adjusted odds ratios of cognitive impairment (Z-scores ≥2 SD below age-adjusted means of the HUU group) and CBCL T-scores in the borderline-clinical range (T-Scores ≥60) in PHIV and HEU versus HUU youth, adjusting for ethnicity, household income, and caregiver characteristics. The median age at enrollment was 13.8 years, with 58% women and 63% Thai participants. PHIV youth had >86% virological suppression and significantly higher impairment rates on CCTT-1 and -2 tests, design fluency test, verbal fluency tests, design memory, and CBCL internalizing and externalizing problems. Results were mostly similar between HEU and HUU groups, apart from higher impairment rates on CCTT-1 and internalizing problems in HEU.

3,3,11029091,"Liver tumors are a relatively rare pathologic condition in children and young patients. The aim of the present study was to categorize the sonographic (US) and color Doppler results of liver tumors in these patients. We retrospectively reviewed the US findings of 23 such cases: malignant tumor (13 cases)-hepatoblastoma (four cases), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; four cases), and hepatic metastasis (five cases); benign tumor (10 cases)-hepatocellular adenoma (four cases), focal nodular hyperplasia (two cases), mesenchymal hamartoma (two cases), cystadenoma (one case), and hemangioendothelioma (one case). There was no specific US findings for each tumor type. HCC usually developed on a normal liver and was imaged as multiple nodules. Color Doppler US helped in differentiating multiple metastatic nodules (hypovascular) from multiple HCC nodules (hypervascular). Presence of intratumoral cystic areas was usually suggestive of benign tumors. Follow-up US was useful for detecting small nodules in high-risk groups (congenital biliary atresia, glycogen storage disease). Color Doppler US helped in diagnosing portal thrombus or intratumoral shunt. Although there were no highly specific findings, US and color Doppler results contributed, to a certain degree, to the diagnosis of liver tumors in children and young adults by showing intratumoral cystic areas or vascularity.

4,4,39116483,"The Chinese Haemophilia Individualized Prophylaxis Study (CHIPS), which was launched in 2016, reported a significant reduction in haemarthrosis over a one-year study. However, its long-term efficacy requires verification. This paper summarizes the clinical outcomes of 18 severe haemophilia A (SHA) patients who completed one year on the CHIPS and 3 more years of follow-up. Clinical follow-up was based on the CHIPS protocol (from July 2018 to July 2021). Escalation was based on index joint bleeding, and serial ultrasound (greyscale and colour Doppler) examinations of the index joints (both sides of the ankles, knees and elbows) were conducted every 6 months via a scoring system. A total of 18 SHA patients completed the 3-year study. Fifteen patients dropped out due to the financial crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. The median age was 5.4 (range 4.3-6.9) years. A significant reduction in haemarthrosis was achieved, with mean annual bleeding rates reduced from 18.9 ± 2.8 to 1.7 ± 0.4 (p < 0.001), annual joint bleeding rates from 3.1 ± 0.7 to1.2 ± 0.3 (p < 0.028). 5 out of 8 target joint resolved. Sixteen doses were escalated. At study exit, the heterogeneous treatment outcomes of the SHA boys were 5 at step 4 (20-25 lU/kg, every other day), 10 at step 3 (15-20 IU/kg, 3×/week), 2 at step 2 (10-15 lU/kg, 3×/week) and 1 at step 1 (10-15 lU/kg, 2×/week). The mean FVIII consumption was 2964 IU/kg/year, with savings.

8,8,32404362,"Sarah Jane Whiteling was accused of fatally poisoning her husband and two children in Philadelphia in 1888. The case prompted public outrage over the appearance that Ms. Whiteling's motive was to collect life insurance. It was evident, however, that she was disturbed, raising a question of culpability. Dr. Alice Bennett, the first female physician in charge of an asylum, provided the defense with expert testimony on the defendant's mental state. Dr. Bennett, who had little forensic but much clinical experience, proposed a physiological theory of insanity among women with reproduction-related derangements. At that time, cultural ideas about ""female poisoners"" colored popular and journalistic perceptions of Ms. Whiteling. Familicide was considered unconscionable because a mother's duty was to nurture and protect her family. When Ms. Whiteling was convicted and sentenced to death, Dr. Bennett undertook a campaign for commutation. Her unsuccessful efforts to reduce culpability were followed by Ms. Whiteling's hanging in 1889, the first execution of a woman in Philadelphia since colonial times. This article recounts the Whiteling case, Dr. Bennett's involvement in it, and how it relates to what is known about familicide. It is argued here that Dr. Bennett was a pioneer in applying medical expert testimony to effect individualized mitigation.

To date, we are unaware of any study evaluating its use in a Latin American population. To investigate the accuracy of the Broselow tape in a Mexican emergency department (ED). We conducted a prospective, observational study of children presenting to a Mexican ED. Patient weight was estimated using the Broselow tape and the estimate compared to their weight measured on a scale. Researchers were blinded to scale weight and Broselow categories. For analysis, the Broselow tape's nine color zones were divided into three weight categories. Of 815 subjects, 356 (43.7%) were female. In children weighing <10 kg, the tape tended to underestimate weight, whereas it overestimated weight in the other two weight categories. The mean percentage difference between the actual weight and the Broselow tape-predicted weight was <3% in each category, although it differed significantly across the three weight categories. Accuracy of the predicted weight to within 10% of actual weight was lowest for children weighing <10 kg, at 46.2% (confidence interval [CI] ± 6.4%), and greatest for those in the 10-18-kg weight category, at 64.1% (CI ± 5.1%). However, the correlation of color zones predicted by both methods was highest for subjects <10 kg at 64.4% (CI ± 6.1%). It was significantly lower in the other weight categories at 54.5% (CI ± 5.3) for subjects weighing 10-18 kg, and 50.1% (CI ± 6.4%) for subjects weighing >18 kg.

The majority of patients/parents reported that they were very or somewhat satisfied with their surgery (or their child's surgery) and would definitely or probably recommend LCSD to another patient. Despite the anticipated side effects associated with LCSD, patients are satisfied with their surgery and indicate that they would recommend the surgery to another patient.

Of the 92 cases of pediatric TGCT, 64 (69.6%) were pathologically confirmed as benign tumors, including 40 cases of teratoma (62.5%), 18 cases of epidermoid cyst (28.1%) and 6 cases of dermoid cyst (9.4%), and the other 28 (30.4%) as malignant neoplasms, including 26 cases of yolk sac tumor (YST, 92.9%) and 2 cases of mixed germ cell tumor (MGCT, 7.1%). Ultrasonography showed that 62.5% of the teratomas were cystic-solid mixed (25/40) and 32.5% solid masses (12/40), that 33.3% of the epidermoid cysts exhibited a typical sign of ""onion ring"" (6/18) and 22.2% that of capsular calcification (4/18), and that 42.3% of the YSTs displayed isoechoic (11/26), 30.9% hypoechoic (8/26) solid masses without calcium and 26.9% cystic anechoic lesions (7/26). Color Doppler blood flow imaging manifested abundant blood flow signals in most of the YSTs (25/26, 96.2%) but none in either the epidermoid or the dermoid cysts. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the serum AFP value was 0.985, with an optimal cutoff value of 124.2 ng/ml, and the sensitivity and specificity of AFP in the diagnosis of benign and malignant tumors were 92.9% and 93.7%, respectively. The AUC of the maximum diameter of the tumors was 0.796, with an optimal cutoff value of 2.7 cm, and the sensitivity and specificity of the maximum diameter of the tumors in the diagnosis of benign and malignant neoplasms were 57.1% and 93.7%, respectively.

Records kept at the Hamburg State Archive prove that in a memorandum from 1941/1942 following the example of Binding and Hoche, Nonne firmly approved the killing of ""life absolutely unworthy of living"". In a report addressed to the District Court of Hamburg he attested in 1946 that many physicians charged with manslaughter acted in accordance with the regulations governing ""child euthanasia"", resulting in the withdrawal of the accusation. In a further statement from 1949 he confirmed that the killing of children and the ""euthanasia program"" during the NS era were consistent with the state of medical science. An earlier book chapter authored by Nonne immediately after World War I suggested that his social-Darwinistically colored concept of mankind was developed clearly before the Nazi era. Notwithstanding the arrangement to which he came with the new powers after 1933 and his acceptance of tributes to him by them, he repeatedly stood up for his Jewish colleagues.

Re-coloring of poliosis with vitiligo is possible but was unexpected because of the difference in mechanism and signaling required between hair bulb melanization and the surface skin. One likely mechanism to explain this change is that melanocyte stem cells are stimulated and migrate to supply hair bulbs with new mature melanocytes.

Cognitive development of stunted children is compromised, but evidence about the association between height gain in late childhood and adolescent cognitive capacity is scarce. We aimed to determine the association between height gains at different ages, including late childhood, and cognitive capacity at 15-years-of-age. We conducted a prospective cohort study in a rural African setting in Southern Malawi. The study cohort was enrolled between June 1995 and August 1996. It originally comprised mothers of 813 fetuses, and the number of children born live was 767. These children were followed up until the age of 15 years. The anthropometrics were measured at one and 24-months-of-age and 15-years-of-age, and cognitive capacity of participants was assessed at 15-years-of-age with Raven's Coloured Matrices score, mathematic test score, median reaction time (RT) (milliseconds) and RT lapses. The associations between growth and the outcome measures were assessed with linear regression. Raven's Coloured Matrices score was predicted by height gain between 24 months and 15-years-of-age (coefficient 0.85, P = 0.03) and (coefficient 0.69, P = 0.06), but not by earlier growth, when possible confounders were included in the model. The association weakened when school education was further added in the model (coefficient = 0.69, P = 0,060). In conclusion, in rural Malawi, better growth in late childhood is likely to lead to better cognitive capacity in adolescence, partly through more school education.

28,28,34329507,"The neural mechanisms underlying memory encoding have received much attention in the literature. Research in adults and school-age children suggest that the hippocampus and cortical regions in both frontal and parietal areas are involved in successful formation of memories. Overall, the hippocampus has been shown to interact with fronto-parietal regions to collaboratively support successful memory encoding for both individual items as well as item details (such as the source or color in which the item was originally encountered). To date, only one study has investigated neural regions engaged during memory encoding in children younger than 8 years of age, which is unfortunate since early childhood is a period of dramatic improvement in memory. This previous study indicated that both the hippocampus and cortical regions are involved during the encoding of subsequently remembered item details (i.e., sources). However, this study reported few interactions between these regions, and it did not explore item memory at a more general level. To fill these gaps, this article reanalyzed data from the previous report, aiming to examine the neural correlates of item memory during encoding in early childhood (4-8 years) and interactions between the hippocampus and fronto-parietal regions during encoding. Consistent with research in older individuals, both the hippocampus and fronto-parietal regions were found to participate in item memory encoding. Additionally, functional connectivity between hippocampus and fronto-parietal regions was significantly related to both subsequent item memory and subsequent source memory. Taken together, these findings suggest that not only the activation of individual brain regions (hippocampus and fronto-parietal regions) but also the functional connections between these regions are important for memory encoding. These data add to the growing literature providing insight into how the hippocampus and cortical regions interact to support memory during development.

29,29,1946087,"Congenital vascular birthmarks, classified as either hemangioma or vascular malformations (portwine stains), can now be cleared successfully using certain lasers. Since their introduction into medicine in the mid-1960s, several types of lasers including the argon, carbon dioxide, neodymium yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) and pulsed tunable dye lasers have been used to treat benign cutaneous vascular lesions such as portwine stains. After extensive research examining the effects of specific laser parameters on tissue, a set of parameters was identified which together selectively destroyed blood vessels in the skin. Application of this laser technique for the treatment of benign cutaneous vascular lesions, such as portwine stains, meant that it was possible to destroy only the abnormally ectatic vessels which are inherent in these birthmarks. Because of the specificity of the laser injury, only the abnormal blood vessels are destroyed and healthy adjacent structures such as epidermal pigment and dermal collagen are left intact. Thus, unwanted adverse effects such as scar formation and pigmentary abnormalities at the laser-exposed site have been minimized. Skin treated using this combination of laser parameters normalizes in color, texture and its markings, and adnexae are maintained at the treated site. Not only has this new laser treatment provided a way of removing these disfiguring birthmarks with the return of normal-appearing skin at the treated site, but the lack of adverse effects following this treatment has meant that not only adults but children of all ages can now be treated using this technique.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) ",1029,Laser treatment of congenital vascular birthmarks,"Tan OT, Morelli J.",Pediatrician. 1991;18(3):204-10.,Tan OT,Pediatrician,1991,1991/01/01,,,

A household is defined to be in food poverty when monthly food spending is less than the cost of a nutritionally adequate very low-cost diet. The prevalence of food poverty in South Africa in 1995 was 43%. Food poverty rates were highest among households headed by Africans, followed by coloureds, Indians and whites. Higher food poverty rates were found with decreasing income, increasing household size, and among households in rural areas or those headed by females. The widespread nature of household food insecurity in South Africa is documented here. Prevalence rates by geographic and socio-economic breakdown provide the means for targeting of nutritional interventions and for monitoring progress in this field.

In addition, peak VSD flow (2pir(2) Nyquist limit [NL]), amount of left-to-right shunting (Qp-Qs = heart rate x [2pir(2) x NL x VTI(VSD)]/V(max)) and defect area ([2pir(2) x NL]/V(max)) were calculated. There were significant positive correlations between Qp-Qs values calculated by PISA and other spectral Doppler methods using the cross-sectional area, as well as the VTI of pulmonary-aortic (r=0.73, P<0.001) or mitral-tricuspid (r=0.58, P<0.001) flows and cardiac catheterization (20 patients, r=0.82, P<0.001). PISA-derived left-to-right-shunting discriminated moderate to large defects from small defects, which were classified according to the catheter-derived Qp/Qs ratio (2 or greater versus less than 2; P=0.001) or clinical evaluation (P<0.001). The present study demonstrated that the PISA method is a reliable semiquantitative method to determine the amount of left-to-right shunting of VSDs and to discriminate moderate to large defects from small defects. Consequently, this method may serve as a simple and useful adjunct to conventional spectral Doppler methods in the noninvasive assessment of patients with VSDs. La surface d’isovélocité proximale (SIP), soit la zone de convergence du débit qui paraît à la surface interventriculaire gauche où le débit accélère à l’approche de la communication, permet une évaluation quantitative du débit de la communication interventriculaire (CIV) et de la zone de cette communication à l’imagerie Doppler couleur. Dans le cadre de la présente étude, les auteurs évaluent l’applicabilité et la fiabilité cliniques de la SIP pour établir l’importance du shunt gauchedroite chez les patients présentant une CIV. Cinquante-huit patients de 0,25 à 15 ans (moyenne de 4,3±4,4 ans) ayant une CIV ont fait l’objet d’une étude prospective. Les auteurs ont mesuré le rayon maximal de la SIP pendant la systole de pointe (r), la vélocité de pointe (V On remarque des corrélations positives importantes entre les valeurs Qp-Qs calculées au moyen de la SIP et d’autres méthodes Doppler spectrales, à l’aide de la zone transversale, ainsi que l’IVT des débits pulmonaire-aortique (r=0,73, p < 0,001) ou mitral-tricuspide (r=0,58, p < 0,001) et le cathétérisme cardiaque (20 patients, r=0,82, p < 0,001). Le shunt gauche-droite dérivé de la SIP permettait de distinguer les communications modérées à grandes des communications mineures, classées d’après le ratio Qp/Qs dérivé du cathéter (2 ou plus par rapport à moins de 2, P=0,001) ou l’évaluation clinique (p < 0,001). La présente étude démontre que la SIP est une méthode semi-quantitative fiable pour déterminer l’importance du shunt gauche-droite des CIV et distinguer les communications modérées à importantes des communications mineures. Par conséquent, cette méthode peut constituer un ajout simple et utile aux méthodes Doppler spectrales classiques dans l’évaluation non effractive des patients présentant une CIV.

36,36,6728348,"Maternal-child nurses are part of a growing number of Americans who have had the opportunity to visit China. An increased understanding of the history and of the health care practices of the Chinese people lends itself to an examination of American values and health practices. The insight developed may aid us as we seek to understand our own health care practices for women and children and to plan for the future in health care. Reporting on a professional exchange tour of American nurses in China, this discussion recounts what was learned about the Chinese health care system, nursing system, and maternal-child health, and focuses on some insights gained into the US health care system. Before 1949, the infant mortality rate was 20% during the 1st year of life; 30-40% of children died before age 5; vernereal disease, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis, typhus, cholera, and the plague were rampant; and traditional medicine had been outlawed. When the communists came to power, efforts were made at preventive health care but the results were not impressive until the Cultural Revolution of 1965. 4 main health objectives were stressed at that time: improving access to health care for the rural areas; emphasizing prevention; emphazing Chinese traditional medicine; and making health an individual and collective responsibility. Peasants were brought in to become the nurses or physicians with minimal or no preparation or education. Since then Western-trained physicians and nurses have been reintroduced into the health care system. Since 1965 the Chinese life expectancy has increased from 40 to 70 years. Infant mortality is now 1 of the lowest in the world. Veneral disease, drug addiction, and several other epidemic diseases have been almost totally eradicted, as has malnutrition. There is at least 1 barefoot doctor in each of these ""production teams"" of 30-50 families, often supported by traditional medical assistants, health aides, midwives, nurses, and public health workers. Patients can be referred to the commune hospital and can be further referred to county hospitals for more complicated problems. Free care is provided for many people. It is within this highly organized, prevention oriented, socially conscious context of health care that maternal-child health care is deelivered. Prenatal and postpartum care begins with home visits by traditional birth attendants or ffemale barefoot doctors. At the well baby clinics the walls are hung with colorful health education posters. Family planning is probably the number 1 health concern in China, and the government stresses late marriages, free use of contraceptives, and the 1 child family. Another insight gained was the idea of harnessing manpower rather than technological power for the purpose of health.

37,37,25894624,"To assess the impact of the duration and intensity of episodes of increased intracranial pressure on 6-month neurological outcome in adult and paediatric traumatic brain injury. Analysis of prospectively collected minute-by-minute intracranial pressure and mean arterial blood pressure data of 261 adult and 99 paediatric traumatic brain injury patients from multiple European centres. The relationship of episodes of elevated intracranial pressure (defined as a pressure above a certain threshold during a certain time) with 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale was visualized in a colour-coded plot. The colour-coded plot illustrates the intuitive concept that episodes of higher intracranial pressure can only be tolerated for shorter durations: the curve that delineates the duration and intensity of those intracranial pressure episodes associated with worse outcome is an approximately exponential decay curve. In children, the curve resembles that of adults, but the delineation between episodes associated with worse outcome occurs at lower intracranial pressure thresholds. Intracranial pressures above 20 mmHg lasting longer than 37 min in adults, and longer than 8 min in children, are associated with worse outcomes. In a multivariate model, together with known baseline risk factors for outcome in severe traumatic brain injury, the cumulative intracranial pressure-time burden is independently associated with mortality. When cerebrovascular autoregulation, assessed with the low-frequency autoregulation index, is impaired, the ability to tolerate elevated intracranial pressures is reduced. When the cerebral perfusion pressure is below 50 mmHg, all intracranial pressure insults, regardless of duration, are associated with worse outcome. The intracranial pressure-time burden associated with worse outcome is visualised in a colour-coded plot. In children, secondary injury occurs at lower intracranial pressure thresholds as compared to adults. Impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation reduces the ability to tolerate intracranial pressure insults. Thus, 50 mmHg might be the lower acceptable threshold for cerebral perfusion pressure.

39,39,35273126,"Moisture-associated skin damage occurs in 4% to 37% of the pediatric population. Commonly described treatments can be challenging to apply to small neonatal wounds, and concerns exist about absorption, cutaneous side effects, and use in certain populations (eg, preterm neonates). This single-center, retrospective case series evaluated the use of cyanoacrylate liquid skin protectant (CSP) to manage moisture-, friction-, and trauma-associated pediatric and neonatal wounds. Fifteen pediatric and neonatal patients with wounds of various etiologies were treated with 1 to 3 applications of CSP. The product is a purple-colored liquid that comes in a small-sized and large-sized applicator and immediately adheres to the skin, taking approximately 1 minute to dry. One to 2 coats were applied to the affected area. Subsequent applications were prescribed as needed, depending on the skin condition. Before CSP application, some patients underwent different treatments deemed necessary by the treating practitioners. There were 7 neonate patients (age range, 4 days-3 weeks), with a gestational age of 25 weeks to full term. Wounds included incontinence-associated dermatitis; peristomal, gastrostomy-associated, and tracheostomy-associated dermatitis; and skin tears. In the 8 older patients (age, 1-5 months; 10 years; 12 years; 16 years), wounds included gastrostomy and tracheostomy-associated dermatitis and granulation tissue, epidermal stripping from adhesive dressing removal, intertriginous dermatitis, and lesions resulting from graft-versus-host disease. Application of CSP facilitated the healing of dermatitis and peristomal excoriations as well as facilitated skin dryness, leading to increased wear time of a peristomal appliance. Peristomal dryness contributed to less friction and likely was the reason for granulation tissue recession. Cyanoacrylate liquid skin protectant can be considered in the management of pediatric moisture- and friction-associated cutaneous injuries, skin tears, and exudative wounds. It can be used as a stand-alone therapy or in combination with standard of care.

41,41,32584469,"A validated tool for scoring bronchitis during flexible bronchoscopy (FB) is potentially useful for clinical practice and research. We aimed to develop a bronchoscopically defined bronchitis scoring system in children (BScore) based on our pilot study. Children undergoing FB were prospectively enrolled. Their FB was digitally recorded and assessed (two clinicians blinded to each other and clinical history) for six features: secretion amount (six-point scale), secretion color (BronkoTest, 0-8), mucosal oedema (0-3), ridging (0-3), erythema (0-3), and pallor (0-3) based on pre-determined criteria. We correlated (Spearman's rho) each feature with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) neutrophil percentage (neutrophil%). BScore was then derived using models with combinations of the six features that best related to airway BAL neutrophil%. The various models of BScore were plotted against BAL neutrophil% using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. We analyzed 142 out of 150 children enrolled. Eight children were excluded for unavailability of BAL cytology or FB recordings. Chronic/recurrent cough was the commonest indication for FB (75%). The median age was 3 years (IQR, 1.5-5.3 years). Secretion amount (r = 0.42) and color (r = 0.46), mucosal oedema (r = 0.42), and erythema (r = 0.30) significantly correlated with BAL neutrophil%, P < .0001.

Barriers to implementation of echocardiographic screening include the requirement for expensive equipment and expert practitioners. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of an abbreviated echocardiographic screening protocol (single parasternal-long-axis view with a sweep of the heart) performed by briefly trained, nonexpert practitioners using handheld ultrasound devices. Participants aged 5 to 20 years in Timor-Leste and the Northern Territory of Australia had 2 echocardiograms: one performed by an expert echocardiographer using a GE Vivid I or Vivid Q portable ultrasound device (reference test), and one performed by a nonexpert practitioner using a GE Vscan handheld ultrasound device (index test). The accuracy of the index test, compared with the reference test, for identifying cases with definite or borderline RHD was determined. There were 3111 enrolled participants; 2573 had both an index test and reference test. Median age was 12 years (interquartile range, 10-15); 58.2% were female.

45,45,35596620,"Nonadherence to antiseizure drugs is a significant problem in pediatric epilepsy and is linked to increased morbidity and mortality, clinically unnecessary medication changes, and increased health care costs. Family interventions can improve adherence. However, it is challenging to determine which families will struggle with nonadherence and require intervention. This study aims to identify specific parent, family, child, and medical factors that predict which families most need family-based adherence interventions. Families enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of a family-based adherence intervention completed measures assessing parent, family, child, and medical factors. Families also used an electronic adherence monitor. Adherence of ≥95% was considered high adherence (not requiring intervention), and <95% was considered suboptimal adherence (requiring intervention). We conducted a stepwise logistic regression analysis to assess demographic, medical, child, family, and parent predictors of membership to the suboptimal adherence group. Of the 200 families of children with new onset epilepsy who enrolled, 177 families completed the study. Of these families, 121 (68%) were in the high adherence group and 56 (32%) were in the suboptimal adherence group. Families with lower socioeconomic status (SES), children of color, lower general family functioning, and more parent distress were more likely to be in the suboptimal adherence group. We identified that parent and family factors, as well as sociodemographic characteristics, predicted membership in the suboptimal adherence group.

The current study examined the stability of testosterone concentrations between two hair samples collected three months apart and investigated two potential confounding factors: natural hair colour and cosmetic hair treatments. Testosterone was analysed with an in-house radioimmunoassay with a limit of detection adequate for the purpose. The testosterone concentrations from the two samplings, at baseline and three months later, had an intra-individual correlation of moderate strength (rho = 0.378, p<0.001, n = 146). Hair treatment, such as colouring or bleaching, seemed to increase testosterone concentrations (p = 0.051, n = 191, and in a paired analysis in a subset of the cohort p = 0.005, n = 24), while no effect of natural colour in untreated hair (p = 0.133) could be detected.

We describe a phenomenon seen on color density spectral array but not raw EEG associated with seizures and acquired brain injury in pediatric patients. We reviewed EEGs of 541 children admitted to an intensive care unit between October 2015 and August 2018. We identified 38 children (7%) with a periodic pattern on color density spectral array that oscillates every 2 to 5 minutes and was not apparent on the raw EEG tracing, termed macroperiodic oscillations (MOs). Internal validity measures and interrater agreement were assessed. We compared demographic and clinical data between those with and without MOs. Interrater reliability yielded a strong agreement for MOs identification (kappa: 0.778 [0.542-1.000]; P < 0.0001). There was a 76% overlap in the start and stop times of MOs among reviewers. All patients with MOs had seizures as opposed to 22.5% of the general intensive care unit monitoring population ( P < 0.0001). Macroperiodic oscillations occurred before or in the midst of recurrent seizures. Patients with MOs were younger (median of 8 vs. 208 days; P < 0.001), with indications for EEG monitoring more likely to be clinical seizures (42 vs. 16%; P < 0.001) or traumatic brain injury (16 vs. 5%, P < 0.01) and had fewer premorbid neurologic conditions (10.5 vs. 33%; P < 0.01).

54,54,36031052,"This study sought to examine how mental health diagnoses, health care utilization and foster care placement instability affect antipsychotic prescribing and how these factors may contribute to disproportionate antipsychotic prescribing among youth in foster care. This retrospective cohort study utilized EHR data that were linked to administrative child welfare data. Two outcome variables were analyzed: 1) any antipsychotic prescription documented and 2) number of antipsychotic prescriptions documented. Predictor variables included foster care status, number of unique mental health diagnoses, counts of health care encounters over the study period, and counts of foster care placements. Covariates included gender, persons of color, and age in years. Models were estimated using logistic regression for the dichotomous outcome and Poisson regression for the count outcome. Increased antipsychotic prescribing among children in foster care persists even after accounting for mental health diagnoses and health care utilization. However, the number of placements modified the effect of foster care involvement on antipsychotic prescribing such that after 2 placement changes, the odds of being prescribed an antipsychotic surpassed the effect of foster care involvement. More mental health diagnoses, more inpatient and emergency health care encounters, and more foster care placements were associated with an increased odds of being prescribed an antipsychotic and an increased count of antipsychotic prescriptions. Decreased primary care encounters were associated with increased odds of antipsychotic prescriptions, and decreased specialty encounters were associated with higher counts of antipsychotic prescriptions.

The ability of a cast to maintain a desired shape is termed moldability. Clinicians use plaster, fiberglass, and soft casts. To our knowledge the biomechanical molding characteristics of these 3 materials have never been reported. We hypothesized that moldability of plaster would be better than fiberglass and fiberglass would be better than soft cast. We compared 12.7 cm wide casts of plaster, fiberglass, and soft cast. Casts were 5 layers thick, prepared in 40°C water, and placed over 2 layers of cotton padding on 5.1 cm and 15.2 cm diameter foam cylinders. A loading device simulated loads applied by clinicians when molding casts for 4 conditions: clubfoot (thumb-shaped 50 N load on 5.1 cm model), DDH (thumb-shaped 100 N load on 15.2 cm model), forearm fracture (palm-shaped 50 N load on 5.1 cm model), and femur fracture (palm-shaped 100 N load on 15.2 cm model). The loading device applied molding for 7 minutes. Five casts of each material were made for each model. Casts were removed, photographed, and the area of maximal deformation was compared with an unmolded cast. A large area of maximal deformation meant that the deformation was spread out over a large area, less precise molding. In the clubfoot model, plaster was more precise than fiberglass (P=0.002) and soft cast (P<0.0001). In the DDH model, plaster was more precise than fiberglass (P<0.0001) and soft cast (P<0.0001) and fiberglass was more precise than soft cast (P<0.0001).In the femur fracture model, plaster was more precise than fiberglass (P=0.001) and soft cast (P=0.001).

Molluscum contagiosum is caused by a poxvirus of the Molluscipox genus. Preschool and elementary school-aged children are more commonly affected. The virus is transmitted by close physical contact, autoinoculation, and fomites. Typically, molluscum contagiosum presents as asymptomatic, discrete, smooth, flesh-colored, dome-shaped papules with central umbilication from which a plug of cheesy material can be expressed. Some authors suggest watchful waiting of the lesions.Many authors suggest active treatment of lesions for cosmetic reasons or concerns of transmission and autoinoculation. Active treatments may be mechanical (e.g. cryotherapy, curettage, pulsed dye laser therapy), chemical (e.g. cantharidin, potassium hydroxide, podophyllotoxin, benzoyl peroxide, tretinoin, trichloroacetic acid, lactic acid, glycolic acid, salicylic acid), immune-modulating (e.g. imiquimod, interferon-alpha, cimetidine) and anti-viral (e.g. cidofovir). Recent patents related to the management of molluscum contagiosum are also retrieved and discussed. These patents comprise of topical compositions and herbal Chinese medicine with limited documentation of their efficacy. The choice of treatment method should depend on the physician's comfort level with the various treatment options, the patient's age, the number and severity of lesions, location of lesions, and the preference of the child/parents.

65,65,33574399,"While atypical sensory processing is one of the more ubiquitous symptoms in autism spectrum disorder, the exact nature of these sensory issues remains unclear, with different studies showing either enhanced or deficient sensory processing. Using a well-established continuous cued-recall task that assesses visual working memory, the current study provides novel evidence reconciling these apparently discrepant findings. Autistic children exhibited perceptual advantages in both likelihood of recall and recall precision relative to their typically-developed peers. When autistic children did make errors, however, they showed a higher probability of erroneously binding a given colour with the incorrect spatial location. These data align with neural-architecture models for feature binding in visual working memory, suggesting that atypical population-level neural noise in the report dimension (colour) and cue dimension (spatial location) may drive both the increase in probability of recall and precision of colour recall as well as the increase in proportion of binding errors when making an error, respectively. These changes are likely to impact core symptomatology associated with autism, as perceptual binding and working memory play significant roles in higher-order tasks, such as communication.

66,66,14597015,"Skin lesions are encountered in all areas of medicine, and it is therefore important for physicians to understand the fundamentals of explaining and diagnosing common skin conditions. This article begins with a discussion of description and documentation of skin lesions based on color, size, morphology, and distribution. Pigmentation disorders such as vitiligo are depicted. Cutaneous growths that are found in the pediatric and adolescent population include acrochordons, dermatofibromas, keloids, milia, neurofibromas, and pyogenic granulomas. Treatment of these growths usually involves observation or curettage with electrodessication.Psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, poison ivy, and eczema are comprised of scaling patches and plaques; poison ivy and atopic dermatitis may also present with bullous and vesicular changes. Therapy typically consists of topical emollients and corticosteroids; phototherapy is reserved for refractory cases. Acne vulgaris is the most common skin disease of the pediatric and adolescent population. This condition can be psychologically debilitating and, therefore, proper treatment is of paramount importance. Therapeutic options include topical as well as oral antibiotics and retinoids. Extreme caution must be used when prescribing retinoids to post-pubescent females, as these agents are teratogenic. Vascular anomalies are most commonly exemplified as port wine stains and hemangiomas. Port wine stains may be treated with pulsed dye laser or may be observed if they are not of concern to the patient or physician. Hemangiomas typically spontaneously regress by age ten; however, there has been recent concern that certain cases may need to be treated. Dermal rashes may be localized or generalized. Treatment of generalized drug eruptions involves elimination of the inciting agent, topical antipruritics, and systemic corticosteroids for severe reactions. Infectious etiologic agents of skin disease include bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Many sexually transmitted diseases are bacterial or viral in origin and present as a rash or ulcer. Impetigo is a bacterial infection which may present as a bullous eruption or as an erosion with a honey colored crust. Other bacterial infections include erythema chronicum migrans, folliculitis, and cellulitis. Fungal infections include the various forms of tinea and are usually treated with topical antifungals; if the infection is located in a hair-bearing area, systemic antifungals are necessary. Viral infections include warts, varicella, molluscum contagiosum, and herpes. Treatment varies from observation or antivirals for varicella to cryosurgery and topical imiquimod for warts. Finally, scabies and lice are infectious agents that can be treated with permethrin and pyrethrin solutions.

67,67,32166386,"Mongolian spots (MS) are congenital dermal conditions resulting from neural crest-derived melanocytes migration to the skin during embryogenesis. MS incidences are highly variable in different populations. Morphologically, MS present as hyperpigmented maculae of varying size and form, ranging from round spots of 1 cm in diameter to extensive discolorations covering predominantly the lower back and buttocks. Due to their coloring, which is also dependent on the skin type, MS may mimic hematoma thus posing a challenge on the physician conducting examinations of children in cases of suspected child abuse. In the present study, MS incidences and distribution, as well as skin types, were documented in a collective of 253 children examined on the basis of suspected child abuse. From these data, a classification scheme was derived to document MS and to help identify cases with a need for recurrent examination for unambiguous interpretation of initial findings alongside the main decisive factors for re-examination such as general circumstances of the initial examination (e. g., experience of the examiner, lighting conditions) and given dermatological conditions of the patient (e. g., diaper rash).

The authors trace the evolution of the surgical treatment of hemispheric epilepsy from radical anatomic resections to current less invasive disconnection procedures. Anatomic hemispherectomy (AH) was first described by Dandy in 1928 as a treatment for gliomas. The first report of this technique to control seizures was by McKenzie in 1938. AH gained wide popularity but began to fall out of favor after the description of superficial cerebral hemosiderosis in 1966. To reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with AH, Rasmussen introduced functional hemispherectomy in 1974. The technique of hemispherotomy was introduced in the 1990 s to minimize the extent of brain removal while maximizing the white matter disconnections. Thus, surgery for hemispheric epilepsy has undergone dramatic transformation since the technique was first introduced. Less invasive techniques have been developed to reduce surgical morbidity. Although optimal seizure control is best achieved with radical AH, the newer less invasive disconnection techniques appear to achieve near-comparable postoperative seizure control with a significantly lower rate of complications.

It can register images accurately and quickly without the use of elaborate mathematical modeling or optimization techniques. The method provides the operator with tools to manipulate images in three dimensions, including visual feedback techniques to assess the accuracy of registration (grids, overlays, masks, and fusion of images in different colors). Its application is not limited to brain imaging and can be applied to images from any region in the body.

We used intraoperative color flow mapping echocardiography to assess the results of surgical repair of atrioventricular septal defect in 19 consecutive patients and compared those findings with results three to five days and 3 to 11 months after repair. There was close correlation between intraoperative and postoperative color flow mapping echocardiography in estimating the presence and severity of left atrioventricular valve regurgitation. All patients survived surgical repair, but in 4 (21%), postoperative congestive heart failure due to left atrioventricular valve regurgitation developed. The need for reoperation was significantly correlated with the severity of left atrioventricular valve regurgitation (r = 0.68) as estimated by intraoperative echocardiography and preoperative aberrancies in the atrioventricular valve (r = 0.68). Age, weight, additional congenital heart disease, preoperative pulmonary vascular resistance, preoperative atrioventricular valve regurgitation, and postoperative mean pulmonary arterial or left atrial pressure were not significantly correlated with the need for reoperation.

86,86,33978794,"Ultrasound (US) is the first-line imaging tool for evaluating liver and kidney transplants during and after the surgical procedures. In most patients after organ transplantation, gray-scale US coupled with color/power and spectral Doppler techniques is used to evaluate the transplant organs, assess the patency of vascular structures, and identify potential complications. In technically difficult or inconclusive cases, however, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can provide prompt and accurate diagnostic information that is essential for management decisions. CEUS is indicated to evaluate for vascular complications including vascular stenosis or thrombosis, active bleeding, pseudoaneurysms and arteriovenous fistulas. Parenchymal indications for CEUS include evaluation for perfusion defects and focal inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions. When transplant rejection is suspected, CEUS can assist with prompt intervention by excluding potential underlying causes for organ dysfunction. Intracavitary CEUS applications can evaluate the biliary tract of a liver transplant (e.g., for biliary strictures, bile leak or intraductal stones) or the urinary tract of a renal transplant (e.g., for urinary obstruction, urine leak or vesicoureteral reflux) as well as the position and patency of hepatic, biliary and renal drains and catheters. The aim of this review is to present current experience regarding the use of CEUS to evaluate liver and renal transplants, focusing on the examination technique and interpretation of the main imaging findings, predominantly those related to vascular complications.

Because of their significance for the practice of pediatric radiology and sonography, two studies, one adult and one experimental, are incorporated. Since there is still plenty of room for improving sonographic techniques and technology and because new developments, such as the use of contrast agents, are in the horizon, the true limitations of sonography and duplex and color Doppler is yet unknown. Therefore, because of the well-known advantages of using sonography in children, we must exhaust all our efforts, ""tricks,"" and resources as a sonographer before we subject the child to more invasive, stressful, and expensive studies.

The primary aim of the study was to determine if the dimensions of available prescribed school shoes fit the foot dimensions of habitually barefoot South African children and adolescents. A cross-sectional observational study was conducted where static standing foot measurements of children and adolescents from urban and rural schools were obtained with a mobile caliper. The maximum heel-toe-length and foot width with an added 10 mm toe- and width fit allowance to each participant, were compared to the corresponding school shoe length and shoe width available in retail. A mixed model ANOVA was used to compare foot dimensions between gender, age and side. Six hundred and ninety-eight school children (N = 698) (431 girls; 267 boys; average age 10.86 years, SD = 2.55) were participants. A total of seventy-seven (N = 77) black coloured prescribed school shoes currently available in retail ranging from different styles and brands were measured. Results show that, comparing the shoe length and maximum heel-toe-length of participants, as well as taking 10 mm toe allowance into account, fifty-nine percent (59%) of children wore shoes that were not the correct length. With regards to the shoe width and the added 10 mm of width fit allowance, ninety-eight percent (98%) of the shoes worn by participants were too narrow for their feet. Results confirmed that school shoes currently available in retail, are not suited for the habitually barefoot population studied.

Nodular thyroid lesions that were enclosed by the thyroid parenchyma and showed a typical echo pattern consistent with the thymus were accepted as the enclosed form of an intrathyroidal ectopic thymus. Eleven of these 30 children had an intrathyroidal ectopic thymus enclosed by the thyroid parenchyma, and they were enrolled in the study. The recorded sonograms were reviewed according to side, location, size, shape, echo pattern, internal content, and vascularization. The enclosed forms of ectopic intrathyroidal thymuses were unilateral in all children and located in the mid portion (n = 10) or lower portion (n = 1).

These screening programs, however, are resource intensive and may not be feasible in many resource-limited settings. Automated echocardiographic diagnosis may enable more widespread echocardiographic screening, early diagnosis, and improved outcomes. In this feasibility study, the authors sought to build a machine learning model capable of identifying mitral regurgitation (MR) on echocardiography. Echocardiograms were labeled by clip for view and by frame for the presence of MR. The labeled data were used to build two convolutional neural networks to perform the stepwise tasks of classifying the clips (1) by view and (2) by the presence of any MR, including physiologic, in parasternal long-axis color Doppler views. The view classification model was developed using 66,330 frames, and model performance was evaluated using a hold-out testing data set with 45 echocardiograms (11,730 frames). The MR detection model was developed using 938 frames, and model performance was evaluated using a hold-out testing data set with 42 echocardiograms (182 frames). Metrics to evaluate model performance included accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score (average of precision and recall, ranging from 0 to 1, with 1 suggesting perfect precision and recall), and receiver operating characteristic analysis. For the parasternal long-axis view with color Doppler, the view classification convolutional neural network achieved an F1 score of 0.97. The MR detection convolutional neural network achieved testing accuracy of 0.86 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91.

97,97,34455524,"Brief resolved unexplained events (BRUE) are concerning episodes of short duration (typically < 1 min) characterized by a change in breathing, consciousness, muscle tone (hyper- or hypotonia), and/or skin color (cyanosis or pallor). The episodes occur in a normal-appearing infant in the first year of life, self-resolve, and have no readily identifiable explanation for the cause of the event. Previously called apparent life-threatening events (ALTE), the term BRUE was first defined by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in 2016. The criteria for BRUE carry greater specificity compared to that of ALTE and additionally are indicative of a diagnosis of exclusion. While most patients with BRUE will have a benign clinical course, important etiologies, including airway, cardiac, gastrointestinal, genetic, infectious, neurologic, and traumatic conditions (including nonaccidental), must be carefully considered. A BRUE is classified as either lower- or higher-risk based on patient age, corrected gestational age, event duration, number of events, and performance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation at the scene. The AAP clinical practice guideline provides recommendations for the management of lower-risk BRUEs, advocating against routine admission, blood testing, and imaging for infants with these events, though a short period of observation and/or an electrocardiogram may be advisable. While guidance exists for higher-risk BRUE, more data are required to better identify proportions and risk factors for serious outcomes among these patients. Conclusion: BRUE is a diagnosis with greater specificity relative to prior definitions and is now a diagnosis of exclusion. Additional research is needed, particularly in the evaluation of higher-risk events. Recent data suggest that the AAP guidelines for the management of lower-risk infants can be safely implemented.This review article summarizes the history, definitional changes, current guideline recommendations, and future research needs for BRUE. What is Known: • BRUE, first described in 2016, is a diagnosis used to describe a well-appearing infant who presents with change in breathing, consciousness, muscle tone (hyper- or hypotonia), and/or skin color (cyanosis or pallor). • BRUE can be divided into higher- and lower-risk events. Guidelines have been published for lower-risk events, with expert recommendations for higher-risk BRUE. What is New: • BRUE carries a low rate of serious diagnoses (< 5%), with the most common representing seizures and airway abnormalities. • Prior BRUE events are associated with serious diagnoses and episode recurrence.

We assessed ICG accumulation in cell lines using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. For our CTC test, we developed a panel of liver tumor-specific markers, including ICG, Glypican-3, and DAPI, and tested it with cell lines and noncancer control blood samples. We then used this panel to analyze whole-blood samples for CTC burden with a cohort of 15 patients with hepatoblastoma and HCC and correlated with patient characteristics and outcomes. We showed that ICG accumulation is specific to liver cancer cells, compared to nonmalignant liver cells, non-liver solid tumor cells, and other nonmalignant cells, and can be used to identify liver tumor cells in a mixed population of cells. Experiments with the ICG/Glypican-3/DAPI panel showed that it specifically tagged malignant liver cells. Using patient samples, we found that CTC burden from sequential blood samples from the same patients mirrored the patients' responses to therapy.

101,101,35916968,"Subgaleal drainage is often being used in craniotomy procedures. It's not only offers advantages but also carries a risk of life-threatening complications. Here, we present a rare case of subgaleal hematoma and skin necrosis caused by placement of subgaleal drainage in a pediatric patient after a craniotomy procedure. We reported a 6-months-old child who came to our institution complaining of uncontrolled eye movements which occurred 4 months earlier. From the CT scan and MRI, it was found that the patient had a mass in his suprasellar region, which suggested a suprasellar tumor. She underwent a mass resection procedure, but unfortunately, 3 days after the surgical procedure, the wound appeared necrotic, with a blackish color around the drain. The necrotic wound was suspected due to vacuum subgaleal drain placement. The wound was cleaned and the suture removed, but the necrotic area was still there. Four days after the surgery, the patient clinical condition got worse. After 17 days of treatment with no significant improvement, unfortunately, the patient died. The mechanism of subgaleal hematoma and skin necrosis induced by the Redon drain possibly related to mechanical compression by the drain, which damage perforating vessels and subsequently disrupt skin vascularization, combined with vascular stasis as given by negative pressure of the drain. This induced skin ischemia lesion which later contributes the necrotic formation. The subgaleal hematoma and skin necrosis as a complication of subgaleal redon drain in pediatric are rare phenomenon and likely under reported. The possible underlying mechanism was that drain's negative pressure disrupt subgaleal tissue and induce necrotic formation. Even the complication is rare compared to older children, yet it has been linked to an increased risk for infection, morbidity, and mortality.

Mothers (n = 20) and drug vendors (n = 15) were asked to freelist medicines used to treat childhood illnesses, and to identify all medicines that corresponded to each of the listed terms from an array of medicines displayed with their packaging. Each Bambara language medicine term can refer to numerous modern medicines, and each modern medicine has several Bambara names. The term nivakini (Nivaquine), often translated as 'chloroquine', refers to a wide range of medicines commonly used to treat malaria, many with no antimalarial effect. Antibiotics were also identified as common treatments for malaria. Mothers and vendors used slightly different terminology when discussing treatments for malaria, and sometimes employed the same term to refer to different medicines. Neither mothers nor vendors clearly differentiated between antimalarial medicines. Colour, shape and packaging play a large role in their recognition, classification and use. Current household survey methods are likely to provide inaccurate estimates of appropriate treatment of febrile illness, and thus alternative approaches are recommended. In introducing new malaria treatments, malaria control programmes should differentiate recommended treatments from other medications through distinctive packaging, drug appearance and appropriate Bambara language terms.

103,103,38511581,"The phenotypical manifestations of asthma among children are diverse and exhibit varying responses to therapeutic interventions. There is a need to develop objective biomarkers to improve the characterization of allergic and inflammatory responses relevant to asthma to predict therapeutic treatment responses. We have previously investigated histamine iontophoresis with laser Doppler flowmetry (HILD) as a potential surrogate biomarker that characterizes histamine response and may be utilized to guide the treatment of allergic and inflammatory disease. We have identified intra-individual variability of HILD response type among children and adults with asthma and that HILD response type varied in association with racial classification. As laser Doppler flowimetry may be impacted by skin color, we aimed to further validate the HILD method by determining if skin color or tone is associated with observed HILD response type differences. We conducted an observational study utilizing quantification of skin color and tone obtained from photographs of the skin among participants during HILD assessments via the RGB color model. We compared RGB values across racial, ethnic, and HILD response type via the Kruskal-Wallis test and calculated Kendall rank correlation coefficient to evaluate the relationship between RGB composite scores and HILD pharmacodynamic measures. We observed that RGB scores differed among racial groups and histamine response phenotypes (p < 0.05). However, there was a lack of correlation between the RGB composite score and HILD pharmacodynamic measures (r values 0.1, p > 0.05). These findings suggest that skin color may not impact HILD response variations, necessitating further research to understand previously observed differences across identified racial groups.

104,104,14982289,"Recent technical improvements in cross-sectional echocardiography have made it possible to detect even mild organic regurgitation of the mitral and aortic valves in patients with acute rheumatic fever. To determine the prevalence and prognosis of subclinical valvitis, we have analyzed 104 patients with acute rheumatic fever referred to our institution. Of 53 patients who had no murmur, 22 of them with polyarthritis, 29 with chorea, and 2 with polyarthritis and chorea, 23 (43.4%) had subclinical valvitis. Isolated mitral regurgitation was the most common valvar lesion, seen in 82.6% of the patients. Isolated aortic regurgitation was detected in 4.4% of the cases, and combined mitral and aortic regurgitation in the remaining 13%. During follow-up, the degree of mitral regurgitation improved in 59.1%, decreased in 18.2%, and increased or remained unchanged in 22.7% according to the length of colour jet. According to criterions of velocity, mitral regurgitation improved in 86.4% of the patients, and increased or unchanged in the remaining 13.6%. Mitral regurgitation disappeared completely in 6 of the patients (27.3%) as judged according to both the length of colour jet and the velocity of regurgitation. Aortic regurgitation improved in all the patients with this problem, disappearing completely in two of the four. Based on this experience, we suggest that not only the disappearance of regurgitation, but also improvements in the echocardiographic diagnostic criterions of regurgitation, such as the length of the colour jet less than 1 cm, or velocity less than 2.5 m/s, or indicative of regurgitation that is either intermittent or of short duration, should also be considered as criterions indicating improvement in valvar regurgitation in patients with subclinical rheumatic valvitis.

The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical and echocardiographic presentation of ALCAPA, create a set of critical echocardiographic diagnostic criteria, and report outcomes. A retrospective review was conducted of all patients diagnosed with isolated ALCAPA at two major cardiac centers between 1990 and 2015. Of the 37 patients identified, only 54% presented in infancy. The anomalous coronary artery (CA) origin was clearly imaged in only 54% of echocardiographic examinations. However, other consistently identified echocardiographic markers were found, including left CA flow reversal (91%), collateral CA flow (85%), right CA dilation (81%), abnormal pulmonary artery flow (79%), mitral regurgitation (74%), left ventricular dysfunction (66%) and endocardial fibroelastosis (57%). Presenting echocardiograms had five of seven markers in 85% of patients. Left ventricular dysfunction was the most common marker in infants (89% vs 38%, P = .005); older children were more likely to have collateral formation visualized by color Doppler (100% vs 75%, P = .04). Following surgery, there were no early surgical deaths. The median follow-up duration was 10.3 years. At last follow-up, 92% had normal left ventricular function, 3% had moderate or worse mitral regurgitation, and 17% had required reintervention.

107,107,38408647,"Firearms are now the number one killer of children and adolescents in the United States. Firearm homicides among Black male youth are the driver of this increase. Prevention requires a multi-faceted life course approach. Academic achievement has been identified as a protective factor. Early childhood education, which is linked to later achievement, is thus an intervention area of interest. Conceptualizing the potential links between early childhood education and reduced risk for youth firearm homicide is important for guiding policy advocacy and informing future research. This paper presents a conceptual model linking early childhood education to reduced risk for firearm homicide. Each link in the model is discussed, and a corresponding review of the literature is presented. The need for anti-racist policies to strengthen the impact of early childhood education is highlighted. Early education and firearm homicide research are each well-established but largely disconnected. There are clear immediate benefits of early childhood education; however, these effects wane with time, particularly for youth of color. At the same time, juvenile delinquency-a major risk factor for firearm homicide-is influenced by educational inequities. Effective interventions to reduce firearm homicides among Black male youth in the United States are needed. Early childhood education shows promise as an intervention. However, to have an impact, this education needs to be accessible and affordable for all, particularly families of color and low income. Societal structures and policies must also better support the positive gains seen through early childhood education to avoid dissipation.

108,108,26563852,"This study sought to compare findings from institutional echocardiographic reports with imaging core laboratory (ICL) review of corresponding echocardiographic images and operative reports in 159 patients with anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery (AAOCA). The study also sought to develop a ""best practice"" protocol for imaging and interpreting images in establishing the diagnosis of AAOCA. AAOCA is associated with sudden death in the young. Underlying anatomic risk factors that can cause ischemia-related events include coronary arterial ostial stenosis, intramural course of the proximal coronary within the aortic wall, interarterial course, and potential compression between the great arteries. Consistent protocols for diagnosing and evaluating these features are lacking, potentially precluding the ability to risk stratify patients based on evidence and plan surgical strategy. For a prescribed set of anatomic AAOCA features, percentages of missing data in institutional echocardiographic reports were calculated. For each feature, agreement among institutional echocardiographic reports, ICL review of images, and surgical reports was evaluated using the weighted kappa statistic. An echocardiographic imaging protocol was developed heuristically to reduce differences between institutional reports and ICL review. A total of 13%, 33%, and 62% of echocardiograms were missing images enabling diagnosis of intra-arterial course, proximal intramural course, and high ostial takeoff, respectively. There was poor agreement between institutional reports and ICL review for diagnosis of origin of coronary artery, interarterial course, intramural course, and acute angle takeoff (kappa = 0.74, 0.11, -0.03, 0.13, respectively). Surgical findings were also significantly different from those of reports, and to a lesser extent ICL reviews. The resulting protocol contains technical recommendations for imaging each of these features. Poor agreement between institutional reports and ICL review for AAOCA suggests need for an imaging protocol to permit evidence-based risk stratification and surgical planning. Even then, delineation of echocardiographic details in AAOCA will remain imperfect.

109,109,16585282,"Family history of skin cancer is an important determinant of skin cancer risk for offspring. No previous study of the effect of personal or family history of skin cancer on the sun protection behaviors of the offspring has been published. A retrospective study was conducted of the sun protection behaviors of the adolescent participants in the Growing Up Today Study (GUTS), who were offspring of mothers from the Nurses Health Study II. Adolescents' surveys were matched with their mothers' reports of a personal or family history of skin cancer and compared with adolescents whose mothers did not report a personal or family history of skin cancer. The outcome measures were (1) occurrence of frequent sunburns during the past summer, (2) use of a tanning bed during the past year, and (3) routine use of sunscreen. Frequent sunburns were defined as the report of > or = 3 sunburns during the past summer. We compared those who reported having used a tanning bed in the past year at least once with those who reported no tanning bed use in the past year. Routine use of sunscreen was defined as a respondent who replied that he or she ""always"" or ""often"" used sunscreen with sun protection factor of 15 or more when he or she was outside for > 15 minutes on a sunny day during the past summer. General estimating equations were used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals adjusted for gender, age, color of untanned skin, and number of friends who were tanned. We also conducted an additional analysis restricted to children whose mothers had received a diagnosis of skin cancer in which we assessed sun protection behaviors according to the child's age and mother's age at the time of the mother's diagnosis and the number of years that had passed since the diagnosis of the mother's skin cancer. In 1999, 9943 children reported their sun protection behaviors; 8697 of their mothers had not received a diagnosis of skin cancer or reported a family history of melanoma, 463 participants' mothers had received a diagnosis of skin cancer, and 783 participants' mothers reported a family history of melanoma. Between 1989 and 1999, 371 mothers of GUTS participants received a diagnosis of skin cancer: melanoma (n = 44), squamous cell (n = 39), and basal cell cancer (n = 311); 23 mothers received a diagnosis of > 1 type of skin cancer. Because GUTS includes siblings from the same family, the 371 mothers with skin cancer had 463 offspring in GUTS. Offspring of mothers with skin cancer were slightly more likely to report frequent sunburns in the past year compared with those with neither maternal diagnosis nor family history (39% vs 36%). Tanning bed use was not significantly different among those with either a maternal diagnosis of skin cancer or family history of melanoma as compared with nonaffected adolescents (8% vs 9% vs 10%). Sunscreen use among offspring of mothers with skin cancer was higher than among those whose mothers had a family history of melanoma or mothers with no personal history of skin cancer (42% vs 33% vs 34%). Tan-promoting attitudes were also similar across all groups. Only 25% thought that a natural skin color was most attractive, and on average, 25% in each group agreed that it was worth burning to get a tan. Children of mothers who had received a diagnosis > 2 years in the past were less likely to use sunscreen, more likely to sunburn, and more likely to use tanning beds than children of mothers with a more recent diagnosis, although the results did not reach statistical significance. Frequent sunburns, suboptimal sunscreen use, and high rates of tanning bed use are commonplace even among the children of health professionals who are at risk for developing skin cancer themselves as a result of personal or family history. With new information on family risk, pediatricians can use the potential of a teachable moment to ensure optimal sun protection for children who are at risk.

The study was performed at the principal investigator's office. Children between three to eleven years old, who had at least two primary molars with a small to moderate approximal caries lesion were included in the study. The assessed material consisted of 107 proximal restorations (63 Dyract and 44 amalgam) placed in primary molars during the years 1994 to 1997 in forty-two children who were available for follow-up examinations. All the evaluated restorations were clinically acceptable, with smooth surface appearance, satisfactory color match, neither secondary caries nor fracture. The margins of two Dyract restorations presented minimal stain. Of the 63 Dyract restorations evaluated radiographically, two presented with bubbles, one with an overhang, and nine had pooling at the tooth-restoration interface. Minimal overhangs were disclosed in six amalgam restorations, and neither bubbles nor defects were seen at the tooth-restoration interface. These differences were statistically significant (p < 0.001).

Venous blood specimens were collected before and after the experiment from each of the subjects. Serum retinol and carotenoid were determined with high performance liquid chromatography. Serum level of carotenoid, including all-trans-beta-carotene, cis-beta-carotene, cryptoxanthin and lutein were significantly higher after intervention in yellow-green vegetable group, as compared to their baseline levels. However, in the light-colored vegetable group, all those components, including all-trans-beta-carotene, 13-cis-beta-carotene and lutein, decreased significantly after intervention, as compared with those at their baseline levels.

118,118,25875844,"Acupuncture has been shown to treat various medical conditions, including acute and chronic pain, and there is limited evidence that acupuncture produces anti-inflammatory effects. This pilot study evaluated the use of acupuncture to treat pain and determine if acupuncture can reduce the inflammatory response in pediatric patients diagnosed with acute appendicitis. This pilot study used convenience sampling and was conducted in the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) of an urban tertiary care children's hospital. Patients conventionally evaluated and definitively diagnosed with appendicitis were eligible to voluntarily participate. The diagnostic homogeneity of the target population allowed for a standardized intervention protocol. A licensed acupuncturist performed a specific form of Japanese acupuncture known as the Kiiko Matsumoto Style on all study patients. Subjective pain was assessed immediately before the intervention and 20 minutes postintervention, using 3 measures: Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R), colored analog scale (CAS), and visual analog scale (VAS). Evidence of inflammation was assessed using two biomarkers: white blood cell (WBC) count and C-reactive protein (CRP). WBC and CRP were drawn and recorded 3 times: before the intervention, 2 minutes before removal of needles, and 30 minutes after needling. Six Latino/Hispanic patients (4 males, 2 females, median age=15 years) with no previous acupuncture experience participated in the study. Median pre/postacupuncture pain scores were as follows: FPS-R, 5 vs. 4; CAS, 6.1 vs. 4.8; VAS, 46 vs. 32. Median WBC (10(3)/μL) and CRP (mg/dL) across time were as follows: WBC, 13.2, 11.8, and 11.4; CRP, 4.5, 4.9, and 5.1. Median acupuncture duration was 28.5 minutes (range 22-32) and no complications were observed. Pilot data suggest that acupuncture may be a feasible and effective treatment modality for decreasing subjective pain and inflammation as measured by WBC.

119,119,20658930,"There are few studies of the developmental changes in B-cell subsets in children. Recent data from adult populations demonstrate that alterations to B-cell subsets have functional consequences and can be helpful diagnostically. Comparable studies in children have been hindered by the lack of normative data and by significant changes with age. This study evaluated B-cell subsets by 4-color flow cytometry in 47 children of different ages. The use of a 4-color platform is compatible with broad use in clinical laboratories. We found that there are rapid changes in the B-cell compartment in infancy and early childhood. Total B-cell numbers decline early in life, and this correlates with a decline in transitional B cells and naïve B cells. The decline is most rapid between 1 and 5 years of age, with a slower decline later in childhood. In contrast, nonswitched and switched memory B cells both increase during the 1st 5 years of life. The decline in B-cell numbers did not occur until after 1 year of age, suggesting that the period after birth is a unique developmental window. These data provide a reference set for further studies on B-cell dysfunction in pediatric disorders. The changes occurring in early childhood document the need for age-related assessments and serve to underscore the B-cell-specific kinetics of immunologic development in humans.

Participants were 180 young people (mean age = 14.88; SD= 1.64; age range: 12-19). They were asked to report the maximum intensity of their most frequent pain in the previous three months using traditional and electronic versions of the scales. They also reported their level of fatigue and pain catastrophizing. Construct validity was evaluated by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and by convergent and discriminant validity. Criterion validity was assessed as concurrent validity. Agreement was calculated using the Bland and Altman method. Analyses were conducted for two confidence intervals (CI): 95% and 80%. CFA demonstrated that the four electronic versions of the scales measure a single factor. All the scales showed a) moderate to high convergent validity, b) adequate discriminant validity with fatigue ratings, and c) adequate concurrent validity with pain catastrophizing ratings. Results also show that traditional and electronic versions of the four scales are in agreement, at least at the 80% CI.

122,122,35546925,"Experiences of stress and adversity, such as intimate partner violence, confer risk for psychiatric problems across the life span. The effects of these risks are disproportionately borne by women and their offspring-particularly those from communities of color. The prenatal period is an especially vulnerable period of fetal development, during which time women's experiences of stress can have long-lasting implications for offspring mental health. Importantly, there is a lack of focus on women's capacity for resilience and potential postnatal protective factors that might mitigate these intergenerational risks and inform intervention efforts. The present study examined intergenerational associations between women's prenatal stressors and child executive functioning and externalizing problems, testing maternal parenting quality and child sex as moderators, using a large, prospective, sociodemographically diverse cohort. We used data from 1,034 mother-child dyads (64% Black, 30% White) from the Conditions Affecting Neurocognitive Development and Learning in Early Childhood (CANDLE) pregnancy cohort within the ECHO PATHWAYS consortium. Women's prenatal stressors included stressful life events (pSLE) and intimate partner violence (pIPV). Measures of child psychopathology at age 4-6 included executive functioning and externalizing problems. Parenting behaviors were assessed by trained observers, averaged across two sessions of mother-child interactions. Linear regression models were used to estimate associations between women's prenatal stressors and child psychopathology, adjusting for confounders and assessing moderation effects by maternal parenting quality and child sex. Women's exposures to pSLE and pIPV were independently associated with child executive functioning problems and externalizing problems in fully-adjusted models. Maternal parenting quality moderated associations between pSLE and both outcomes, such that higher parenting quality was protective for the associations between women's pSLE and child executive functioning and externalizing problems. No moderation by child sex was found. Findings from this large, sociodemographically diverse cohort suggest women's exposures to interpersonal violence and major stressful events-common for women during pregnancy-may prenatally program her child's executive functioning and externalizing problems. Women's capacity to provide high quality parenting can buffer this intergenerational risk. Implications for universal and targeted prevention and early intervention efforts to support women's and children's wellbeing are discussed.

However, this approach may underestimate the true variability in childhood body shape and size. To use a comprehensive three-dimensional photonic scan approach to describe variation in childhood body shape and size. At age 6 years, 3350 children from the population-based 2004 Pelotas birth cohort study were assessed by three-dimensional photonic scanner, traditional anthropometry and dual X-ray absorptiometry. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on height and 24 photonic scan variables (circumferences, lengths/widths, volumes and surface areas). PCA identified four independent components of children's body shape and size, which we termed: Corpulence, Central:peripheral ratio, Height and arm lengths, and Shoulder diameter. Corpulence showed strong correlations with traditional anthropometric and body composition measures (r>0.90 with weight, BMI, waist circumference and fat mass; r>0.70 with height, lean mass and bone mass); in contrast, the other three components showed weak or moderate correlations with those measures (all r<0.45). There was no sex difference in Corpulence, but boys had higher Central:peripheral ratio, Height and arm lengths and Shoulder diameter values than girls. Furthermore, children with low birth weight had lower Corpulence and Height and arm lengths but higher Central:peripheral ratio and Shoulder diameter than other children. Children from high socio-economic position (SEP) families had higher Corpulence and Height and arm lengths than other children. Finally, white children had higher Corpulence and Central:peripheral ratio than mixed or black children. Comprehensive assessment by three-dimensional photonic scanning identified components of childhood body shape and size not captured by traditional anthropometry or body composition measures. Differences in these novel components by sex, birth weight, SEP and skin colour may indicate their potential relevance to disease risks.

Alertness at T1 and Color Naming at T1 and T2 were significantly reduced following mTBI compared to controls, although most group differences in PS disappeared when patients with previous impairments and mTBI were excluded. PS was predictive for episodic and working memory performance 3-6 months after injury, whereas group was a significant predictor of working memory.

This tool is important, particularly for telemedicine, tracking of wound healing, the evaluation of potential abuse, and injury research. Despite this, protocols to ensure standardization of photography in clinical practice, forensics, or research have not been published. In preparation for a study of injury patterns in elder abuse and geriatric falls, our goal was to develop and evaluate a protocol for standardized photography of injuries that may be broadly applied. We conducted a literature review for techniques and standards in medical, forensic, and legal photography. We developed a novel protocol describing types of photographs and body positioning for eight body regions, including instructional diagrams. We revised it iteratively in consultation with experts in medical photography; forensics; and elder, child, and domestic abuse. The resulting protocol requires a minimum of four photos of each injury at multiple distances with and without a ruler/color guide. To evaluate the protocol's efficacy, multiple research assistants without previous photography experience photographed injuries from a convenience sample of elderly patients presenting to a single large, urban, academic emergency department. A selection of these patients' images were then evaluated in a blinded fashion by four nontreating emergency medicine physicians and the inter-rater reliability between these physicians was calculated. Among the 131 injuries, from 53 patients, photographed by 18 photographers using this protocol, photographs of 25 injuries (10 bruises, seven lacerations, and eight abrasions) were used to assess characterization of the injury. Physicians' characterizations of the injuries were reliable for the size of the injury (κ = 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.77 to 1.00), side of the body (κ = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.88 to 1.00), precise location of the injury (κ = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.63 = 0.81), and type of abrasion (κ = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.45 to 1.00).

In the second National Burden of Disease (NBD) study, we aimed to analyse cause of death data for 1997-2012 and develop national, population group, and provincial estimates of the levels and causes of mortality. We used underlying cause of death data from death notifications for 1997-2012 obtained from Statistics South Africa. These data were adjusted for completeness using indirect demographic techniques for adults and comparison with survey and census estimates for child mortality. A regression approach was used to estimate misclassified HIV/AIDS deaths and so-called garbage codes were proportionally redistributed by age, sex, and population group population group (black African, Indian or Asian descent, white [European descent], and coloured [of mixed ancestry according to the preceding categories]). Injury deaths were estimated from additional data sources. Age-standardised death rates were calculated with mid-year population estimates and the WHO age standard. Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation Global Burden of Disease (IHME GBD) estimates for South Africa were obtained from the IHME GHDx website for comparison. All-cause age-standardised death rates increased rapidly since 1997, peaked in 2006 and then declined, driven by changes in HIV/AIDS. Mortality from tuberculosis, non-communicable diseases, and injuries decreased slightly. In 2012, HIV/AIDS caused the most deaths (29·1%) followed by cerebrovascular disease (7·5%) and lower respiratory infections (4·9%). All-cause age-standardised death rates were 1·7 times higher in the province with the highest death rate compared to the province with the lowest death rate, 2·2 times higher in black Africans compared to whites, and 1·4 times higher in males compared with females. Comparison with the IHME GBD estimates for South Africa revealed substantial differences for estimated deaths from all causes, particularly HIV/AIDS and interpersonal violence. This study shows the reversal of HIV/AIDS, non-communicable disease, and injury mortality trends in South Africa during the study period. Mortality differentials show the importance of social determinants, raise concerns about the quality of health services, and provide relevant information to policy makers for addressing inequalities.

All lesions were flat and <1 cm in diameter. A brown color was observed in oral melanocytic macules and nevi. The exogenously pigmented lesion was bluish gray. Histopathology showed that the biopsied lesions corresponded to melanotic macules, junctional nevus, blue nevus, and exogenous pigmentation. Solitary pigmented lesions on the oral mucosa of children, from melanin pigment or exogenous pigment, may have a similar clinical presentation, but melanotic lesions such as oral melanotic macules and nevi can be differentiated from one another only with histopathologic examination.

134,134,21395672,"Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a promising approach to improve cardiac function in children in heart failure with cardiomyopathy. Cardiac timing measures in pediatrics are typically based on age and heart rate. However, pediatric CRT studies to date have used adult based timing cutoff values. We investigated the applicability of using these adult standards in pediatric patients with normal hearts. We studied 88 outpatients referred for cardiac evaluation who had a normal cardiac evaluation. Subjects had 12 lead EKG and normal echocardiogram. Patients with known heart disease or abnormal rhythms were excluded. 2D echo and Doppler including color tissue Doppler imaging (TDI, Vivid 7 GE Ultrasound, Norway) were obtained. TDI was performed on three standard apical views (four chamber, two chamber, and long axis). Longitudinal dyssynchrony was determined from (1) Yu index--standard deviation of differences in timing of peak TDI velocity of all 12 basal and mid LV wall segments, adult cutoff >32 ms and (2) opposing wall difference (OWD) in timing of peak TDI velocity of 12 LV wall segments, adult cutoff >65 ms. Radial dyssynchrony was determined from differences in timing of peak radial strain between anterior-septal and posterior LV segments from speckle tracking of 2D LV views, adult cutoff >130 ms. Median age was 11.5 years; median heart rate was 74.5. Longitudinal dyssynchrony was present in 40% of normals based on Yu index, and in 43% based on OWD. No child had Radial dyssynchrony. This pilot study of children with normal hearts suggests that current adult CRT dyssynchrony cutoff values are inappropriate in the pediatric population.

135,135,36970005,"Endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) is a diffuse endocardial collagen and elastin hyperplasia disease of unknown etiology, which may be accompanied by myocardial degenerative changes leading to acute or chronic heart failure. However, acute heart failure (AHF) without obvious associated triggers is rare. Prior to the report of endomyocardial biopsy, the diagnosis and treatment of EFE are highly susceptible to being confounded with other primary cardiomyopathies. Here, we report a case of pediatric AHF caused by EFE mimicking dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), with the aim of providing a valuable reference for clinicians to early identify and diagnose EFE-induced AHF. A 13-mo-old female child was admitted to hospital with retching. Chest X-ray demonstrated enhanced texture in both lungs and an enlarged heart shadow. Color doppler echocardiography showed an enlarged left heart with ventricular wall hypokinesis and decreased left heart function. Abdominal color ultrasonography revealed a markedly enlarged liver. Pending the result of the endomyocardial biopsy report, the child was treated with a variety of resuscitative measures including nasal cannula for oxygen, intramuscular sedation with chlorpromazine and promethazine, cedilanid for cardiac contractility enhancement, and diuretic treatment with furosemide. Subsequently, the child's endomyocardial biopsy report result was confirmed as EFE. After the above early interventions, the child's condition gradually stabilized and improved. One week later, the child was discharged. During a 9-mo follow-up period, the child took intermittent low-dose oral digoxin with no signs of recurrence or exacerbation of the heart failure. Our report suggests that EFE-induced pediatric AHF may present in children over 1 year of age without any apparent precipitants, and that the associated clinical presentations are grossly similar to that of pediatric DCM. Nonetheless, it is still possible to be diagnosed effectively on the basis of the comprehensive analysis of auxiliary inspection findings before the result of the endomyocardial biopsy is reported.

Our objective was to test the feasibility of novice physician sonographers (NPS) to perform echocardiograms of adequate quality to exclude pathology (defined as TRJV > 2.5 meters per second). We conducted a cross-sectional study of NPS to assess TRJV by echocardiogram in an urban pediatric emergency department. NPS completed an educational course consisting of a didactic curriculum and hands-on workshop. NPS enrolled a convenience sample of patients aged 7-21 years. Our primary outcome was the proportion of echocardiograms with images of adequate quality to exclude pathology. Our secondary outcome was NPS performance on four image elements. We present descriptive statistics, binomial proportions, kappa coefficients, and logistic regression analysis. Eight NPS completed 80 echocardiograms. We found 82.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 74.2-90.8) of echocardiograms had images of adequate quality to exclude pathology. Among image elements, NPS obtained a satisfactory, apical 4-chamber view in 85% (95% CI, 77.1-92.9); positioned the color box accurately 65% (95% CI, 54.5-75.5); optimized TRJV color signal 78.7% (95% CI, 69.8-87.7); and optimized continuous-wave Doppler in 55% (95% CI, 44.1-66.0) of echocardiograms. NPS obtained images of adequate quality to exclude pathology in a majority of studies; however, optimized acquisition of specific image elements varied.

The preliminary criterion for qualifying patients for the procedure was the PDA diameter (< or = 4 mm) at the narrowest site, as assessed echocardiographically. The criterion was met by 22 of 116 children with PDA treated at the Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Faculty of Medicine, Jagiellonian University, between January 1, 1996 and December 31, 2000. Angiography revealed, that in one case, the PDA diameter was larger (6.5 mm) and the patient required two Gianturco coils. Of 22 patients (8 males and 14 females) aged 2.7-16 years (x = 6.5 +/- 3.8), the procedure was successful in 21 children (95.5%). One patient with PDA was referred to the surgical department due to complications (the coil was displaced to the periphery of the left pulmonary artery and required removal by an Amplatzer device). The analysis of the follow-up echocardiography performed within 48 hours after the procedure and 1, 6, 12, 24 and 48 months later, revealed immediate total PDA closure in 29% of children. In 33% of patients, the PDA closed within 24 months. One child did not report to follow-up, however, the others are asymptomatic and show residual negligible shunts. The authors determined that the incidence and time of closure of residual shunts is dependent on the magnitude of the left-to-right shunt before the procedure.

140,140,38748631,"Since European settlement, the United States has controlled the reproduction of communities of color through tactics ranging from forced pregnancies, sterilizations, and abortions to immigration policies and policies that separate children from their families. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (or questioning), asexual, intersex, and gender diverse people (LGBTQIA+) have been persecuted for sexual behavior and gender expression, and also restricted from having children. In response, women of color and LGBTQIA+ communities have organized for Reproductive Justice (RJ) and liberation. The Reproductive Justice framework, conceived in 1994 by the Women of African Descent for Reproductive Justice, addresses the reproductive health needs of Black women and communities from a broad human rights perspective. Since then, the framework has expanded with an intersectional approach to include all communities of color and LGBTQIA+ communities. Notwithstanding, reproductive injustice negatively impacts the health of already marginalized and oppressed communities, which is reflected in higher rates of maternal mortality, infant mortality, infertility, preterm births, and poorer health outcomes associated with race-based stress. While the impact of racial injustice on disparate health outcomes is increasingly addressed in family medicine, Reproductive Justice has not been universally incorporated into care provision or education. Including the RJ framework in family medicine education is critical to understanding how structural, economic, and political factors influence health outcomes to improve health care delivery from a justice and human rights perspective. This commentary describes how an RJ framework can enhance medical education and care provision, and subsequently identifies strategies for incorporating Reproductive Justice teaching into family medicine education.

Identifying factors associated with childhood intelligence and their interactions is essential in behavioral research. We assessed the impact of genetic variants and early child stimulation (ECS) on child intelligence and examined their possible interaction as potential modifiers of IQ in a population-based longitudinal study. Participants of the 2004 Pelotas Birth Cohort study (N = 4231) underwent intelligent quotient (IQ) by WISC-III assessment at 6 years of age. At 24 and 48-months, mothers answered five ECS marker questions, whose sum was used to create a score. The polygenic score for intelligence (IQ-PGS) was constructed from the GWAS-weighted estimate of cognition. Association was assessed using multiple linear regression models adjusted for maternal, family, and child confounding variables. To explore the possible influence of skin color and ethnoracial classification, the regression models were stratified according to the skin color variable, as a sensitivity analysis. In the adjusted analysis, IQ-PGS (β = 0.79, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.26;1.31) as well as ECS (β = 2.34; 95% CI: 1.76;2.92) were associated with IQ in this sample.

Prospective data from a large sample would be useful for counseling families on treatment decisions and prognosis. To prospectively study children with a first episode of ON, describe VA after 6 months, and ascertain the network's (Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group and Neuro-Ophthalmology Research Disease Investigator Consortium) ability to enroll pediatric patients with ON prospectively. This nonrandomized cohort study was conducted from September 20, 2016, to July 20, 2018, at 23 sites in the United States and Canada in pediatric ophthalmology or neuro-ophthalmology clinics. A total of 44 children (aged 3-15 years) presented with a first episode of ON (visual loss, pain on eye movements, or both) within 2 weeks of symptom onset and at least 1 of the following in the affected eye: a distance high-contrast VA (HCVA) deficit of at least 0.2 logMAR below age-based norms, diminished color vision, abnormal visual field, or optic disc swelling. Exclusion criteria included preexisting ocular abnormalities or a previous episode of ON. Primary outcomes were monocular HCVA and low-contrast VA at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were neuroimaging, associated diagnoses, and antibodies for neuromyelitis optica and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein. A total of 44 children (mean age [SD], 10.2 [3.5] years; 26 boys [59%]; 23 White individuals [52%]; 54 eyes) were enrolled in the study. Sixteen patients (36%) had bilateral ON. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed white matter lesions in 23 children (52%). Of these children, 8 had myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-associated demyelination (18%), 7 had acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (16%), 5 had multiple sclerosis (11%), and 3 had neuromyelitis optica (7%).

Baseline HCVA was worse in younger participants (aged <10 years) with associated neurologic autoimmune diagnoses, white matter lesions, and in those of non-White race and non-Hispanic ethnicity. The data did not suggest a statistically significant association between baseline factors and improvement in HCVA. The study network did not reach its targeted enrollment of 100 pediatric patients with ON over 2 years. This indicates that future treatment trials may need to use different inclusion criteria or plan a longer enrollment period to account for the rarity of the disease. Despite poor VA at presentation, most children had marked improvement by 6 months. Associated neurologic autoimmune diagnoses were common.

143,143,29019750,"Ultrasonography (US) is often the first line of imaging for the examination of children suspected of having liver lesions. However, gray-scale US with color Doppler imaging has limitations. The use of US contrast agents has recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Compared with other imaging modalities, contrast material-enhanced US (CEUS) enables the assessment of contrast enhancement patterns with a higher temporal resolution and is therefore becoming a valuable alternative imaging technique. CEUS is advantageous owing to its high safety profile; lower cost, compared with the costs of conventional contrast-enhanced computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging examinations; reliability; and reproducibility. Furthermore, US examinations obviate the use of sedation, ionizing radiation, and iodinated or gadolinium-based contrast agents. All of these are desirable attributes for an imaging examination for children, the most vulnerable of patients. Focal liver lesions in children are commonly discovered incidentally, and this can pose a dilemma in terms of diagnosis and management. Owing to the FDA's recent approval of the use of a specific US contrast agent for evaluation of focal liver lesions in pediatric patients, CEUS can now be used as a problem-solving tool that complements conventional imaging examinations and aids in the follow-up of lesions. The temporal resolution with CEUS enables US images to readily depict the real-time internal vascularity of a lesion. The characterization of a lesion during different phases of enhancement improves diagnostic confidence and treatment. In this article, the authors review the composition, physiologic properties, and safety profile of CEUS; describe the technique for performing CEUS; and highlight the utility of this examination in the assessment of common focal liver lesions in children.

This study aimed to describe trends in race and gender profiles of postgraduate students in medical specialties (registrars) from 1999 to 2006 and to identify factors affecting recruitment and retention of black and female trainees. Review of faculty databases for race and gender data from 1999 to 2006. Distribution of an anonymous self-administered questionnaire to all registrars in 2005/2006. The percentage of African registrars doubled from 10% to 19% from 1999 to beyond 2002. The percentages of Africans, Coloureds and Indians rose steadily from 26% to 46% from 1999 to 2005, as did that of women from 27% to 44%. The institution's perceived good reputation, being an alumnus and originating from Cape Town were common reasons for choosing UCT for training. A quarter of respondents reported knowledge of a friend who decided against studying at UCT for reasons which included anticipated racial discrimination. Black respondents (23%), particularly African (50%), were more likely to describe registrarship at UCT as unwelcoming than white respondents (12%). Specific instances of personal experience of discrimination were uncommon and not associated with respondents' race or gender. Registrars who had had a child during registrarship and those reporting discrimination were more likely to rate the learning and research environment as poor (Odds Ratio, 4.01; 95% CI 0.98 - 16.47 and 1.99 95% CI 0.57 - 6.97, respectively). The proportion of black and female registrars at the University of Cape Town has increased steadily from 1999 to 2006, most likely a result of systematic equity policies and procedures adopted in the faculty during this period. The data point to a need for policies to make the institution more welcoming to diversity and for strategies to address institutional culture and mentorship, with an aim to develop examples of best practices to share within and between institutions.

All four categories of the indicator system reveal discrepancies which exist between Black and White, rich and poor, urban and rural. To achieve the social goal of Health-for-All requires a greater measure of political commitment from the state. We conclude that it is debatable whether a system which maintains race discrimination and exploitation can in fact be adapted to provide Health-for-All. This report evaluates the effects of race discrimination on the health status of South Africa using a socio-medical indicator system derived by WHO. The indicator system consists of 4 categories: health policy indicators, social and economic indicators related to health, indicators of provision of health care, and health status indicators. Political commitment is essential for the attainment of health for the population; the government of South Africa is committed to 3 different options influencing health, all described in detail. Budget allocation is an objective measure of commitment; 3.2% of the GNP was spent on health in 1981, and only 2.2% of the total health budget is devoted to preventive medicine. Absence of democratic structures for all to express needs and demands results in racially biased allocation and distribution of health services. Social and economic indicators relating to health include rate of population increase, gross national product, income distribution, work conditions, literacy rates, housing needs, and food availability. Indicators of basic health status include nutritional status, child mortality rates (15.6/1000 for Africans, 1.1 for whites) and life expectancy at birth (for black males 45.0 yrs and for black females 47.3, for white males 65.5 and white females 71.9).

However no studies have related the disappearance of the murmur with the functional or anatomical state of the mitral valve. This study was done to elucidate the mitral valve status using doppler and color coded echocardiography among those children who have lost their apical pansystolic murmur on auscultation following a documented attack of rheumatic fever. The study sample consisted of 51 patients including 31 patients in whom the murmur has disappeared (group I), and 20 patients with persistent isolated mitral regurgitation (group II). Patients of group I had significantly lower grades of murmur intensity, lower incidence of cardiomegaly, and had no heart failure in the initial attack. They were more compliant with prophylaxis and had less recurrences than patients of group II. The murmur disappeared in patients of group I from 1/2 to 14 years after the initial attack. Echocardiography revealed that such patients had a normal mitral valve apparatus, and a normal heart size and function. Only 5 patients of this group had a significant regurgitant jet demonstrated by colour doppler. We concluded that recovery of the mitral valve and return of cardiac functions to normal is possible in patients who had mitral regurgitation following rheumatic fever. Some of them may still have an inaudible mild regurgitation. Patients who have lost their murmur may be allowed to exercise freely, yet penicillin prophylaxis should not be discontinued.

Racial and ethnic minority children continue to bear the burden of poverty disproportionately. Evidence-based parenting interventions in early childhood have the potential to attenuate risk attributable to poverty and stress. To reduce racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in the USA, parenting interventions must be accessible, engaging, and effective for low-income families of color living in large urban centers. This paper describes the initial development of ParentCorps and ongoing improvements to realize that vision. Initial development focused on creating a parenting intervention that places culture at the center and effectively embedding it in schools. ParentCorps includes core components found in nearly all effective parenting interventions with a culturally informed approach to engaging families and supporting behavior change. As the intervention is implemented at scale in increasingly diverse communities, improvement efforts include augmenting professional development to increase racial consciousness among all staff (evaluators, coaches, and school-based facilitators) and applying an implementation science framework to study and more fully support schools' use of a package of engagement strategies.

157,157,12728112,"Otitis media is 1 of the most frequent diseases of early infancy and childhood and 1 of the most common reasons for children to visit a physician. In the past 2 decades, there has been a substantial increase in the diagnosis of otitis media worldwide. In the United States, 93% of all children have had at least 1 episode of acute otitis media (AOM) by 7 years of age. Otalgia is the hallmark of AOM. Most affected children either complain of earache or manifest behavior that the parents interpret as indicating ear pain. Treatment of the ear pain early in the course of AOM decreases both parental anxiety and the child's discomfort and accelerates the healing process. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and tolerability of naturopathic versus traditional treatment for the management of otalgia commonly associated with AOM in children. The study was designed as a double-blind trial in an outpatient community clinic. A total of 171 children who were aged 5 to 18 years and had otalgia and clinical findings associated with middle-ear infection were studied. The children were randomly assigned to receive treatment with Naturopathic Herbal Extract Ear Drops (NHED) or anesthetic ear drops, with or without amoxicillin. On enrollment, the children were assigned by computer-numbered randomization to receive NHED (contents: allium sativum, verbascum thapsus, calendula flores, hypericum perfoliatum, lavender, and vitamin E in olive oil) 5 drops 3 times daily, alone (group A) or together with a topical anesthetic (amethocaine and phenazone in glycerin) 5 drops 3 times daily (group B), or oral amoxicillin 80 mg/kg/d (maximum 500 mg/dose) divided into 3 doses with either NHED 5 drops 3 times daily (group C) or topical anesthetic 5 drops 3 times daily (group D). A double-blind design was used, and all ear drops were placed in identical bottles. Treatment was initiated by the nurse in all cases. A single physician (M.S.) evaluated and treated all of the patients included in the study and recorded all of the data. The presence or absence of ear pain was assessed over 3 days with a visual analog scale. Ear pain was assessed by a specially devised observational instrument based on previous reports. One side of the instrument consisted of a linear numbered scale, from 1 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), and a corresponding color scale, ranging from blue to dark red. The reverse side contained a scale of 5 facial expressions, ranging from broad smile (no pain) to a sad and crying face (worst possible pain), and a corresponding color scale, ranging from blue to dark red. There were no significant between-group differences in patient age or gender, degree of fever, main symptoms, associated symptoms, and severity or laterality of acute otitis media. Each group had a statistically significant improvement in ear pain over the course of the 3 days. Patients who were given ear drops alone had a better response than patients who were given ear drops together with amoxicillin. Results were better in the NHED group than in the controls. Nevertheless, the findings indicated that the pain was mostly (80%) self-limited and could be explained simply by the time elapsed. The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines recommend topical medications as the first line of treatment for ear pain in the absence of systemic infection or serious underlying disease. Because no evidence was found that systemic antibiotics alone improved treatment outcome, if antibiotics do not change the natural course of otitis media, then the main goal of treatment, as in the present study, should be to alleviate the ear pain. The alternative, naturopathic herbal extract medications, may offer many new possibilities in the management of ear pain associated with AOM. Primary care physicians should be aware that at least 10% of their patients may have tried 1 or more forms of alternative/complementary medicine before presenting for consultation. As it was widely reported in the medical literature, these herb, these herbal extracts have the potential to meet all of the requirements of appropriate medication that could be routinely used in the pediatric patient, namely in vitro bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal activity against common pathogens, immunostimulation ability, antioxidant activity, and anti-inflammatory effects. They are also well-absorbed with good penetration into the tissue surrounding the tympanic membrane. They have been found to enhance local immunologic activity. Finally, herbal extracts are well-tolerated (owing to their long elimination time), easy to administer, and less expensive than the new antibiotics. There are no documented side effects. On the basis of our findings that the group with the most significant treatment effects (NHED with topical anesthetic) explained only 7.3% of the total pain reduction, we propose that sometimes the general practitioner or pediatrician needs to give the human body a chance to repair itself. Nevertheless, if the physician believes that there is an indication for some treatment, especially if the parents are anxious, then a local treatment such as one used in our study might be adequate. This study suggests that in cases of ear pain caused by AOM in children in which active treatment, besides a simple 2- to 3-day waiting period, is needed, an herbal extract solution may be beneficial. Concomitant antibiotic treatment is apparently not contributory.

Melanosomes in keratinocytes of light skin as in Caucasians are distributed as membrane-bound clusters, whereas the melanosomes in keratinocytes of dark skin as in African/American individuals tend to be larger and distributed individually. It has been shown that melanin content, melanin composition and the size of melanosomes in the human epidermis vary considerably with both ethnicity and chronic sun exposure. To assess quantitatively the distribution pattern of melanosomes that have been transferred to keratinocytes in the photoprotected (volar forearm) skin from normal Asian individuals and to compare these data with those from light-skinned Caucasian and dark-skinned African/American individuals. Electron microscopy was used. We have demonstrated that melanosomes within keratinocytes of Asian skin are distributed as a combination of individual and clustered melanosomes with a proportion of 62.6% vs. 37.4%, respectively. This contrasts with dark and light skin keratinocytes where melanosomes are predominantly individual (88.9%) and clustered (84.5%), respectively. Analysis of mean +/- SD melanosome size also revealed a progressive variation in size with ethnicity, melanosomes in dark skin being the largest (1.44 +/- 0.67 microm(2) x 10-2) followed in turn by those in Asian skin (1.36 +/- 0.15 microm(2) x 10-2) and Caucasian skin (0.94 +/- 0.48 microm(2) x 10-2). In addition, it was shown that the melanosomes that are individually distributed tend to have a larger size than the clustered melanosomes. The present data indicate that there may be a size gradient of melanosomes encompassing the global complexion coloration and that the melanosome distribution in keratinocytes of Asian skin is intermediate between that in light Caucasian and dark African/American skin.

160,160,35883036,"There are many inequalities in terms of prevention and treatment for pregnant women with HIV and exposed children in low and middle-income countries. The Brazilian protocol for prenatal care includes rapid diagnostic testing for HIV, compulsory notification, and monitoring by the epidemiological surveillance of children exposed to HIV until 18 months after delivery. The case is closed after HIV serology results are obtained. Lost to follow-up is defined as a child who was not located at the end of the case, and, therefore, did not have a laboratory diagnosis. Lost to follow-up is a current problem and has been documented in other countries. This study analyzed factors associated with loss to follow-up among HIV-exposed children, including sociodemographic, behavioral, and health variables of mothers of children lost to follow-up. This historical cohort study included information on mothers of children exposed to HIV, born in Porto Alegre, from 2000 to 2017. The research outcome was the classification at the end of the child's follow-up (lost to follow-up or not). Factors associated with loss to follow-up were investigated using the Poisson regression model. Relative Risk calculations were performed. The significance level of 5% was adopted for variables in the adjusted model. Of 6,836 children exposed to HIV, 1,763 (25.8%) were classified as lost to follow-up.

161,161,36411550,"Roseola infantum is a common viral disease that occurs during childhood worldwide. The purpose of this article is to familiarize pediatricians with the clinical manifestations, evaluation, diagnosis, and management of roseola infantum. A search was conducted in April, 2022, in PubMed Clinical Queries using the key terms ""roseola infantum"" OR ""exanthem subitum"" OR ""sixth disease"". The search strategy included all clinical trials, observational studies, and reviews published within the past 10 years. Only papers published in the English literature were included in this review. The information retrieved from the above search was used in the compilation of the present article. Roseola infantum is a viral illness characterized by high fever that lasts 3 to 4 days, followed by the sudden appearance of rash at defervescence. The disease occurs most frequently in children between 6 months and 2 years of age. Human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) is the major cause of roseola infantum, followed by HHV-7. Transmission of the infection most likely results from the asymptomatic shedding of the virus in the saliva of the caregivers or other close contacts. Characteristically, the rash is discrete, rose-pink in color, circular or elliptical, macular or maculopapular, measuring 2 to 3 mm in diameter. The eruption is first seen on the trunk. It then spreads to the neck and proximal extremities. Typically, the rash blanches on pressure and subsides in 2 to 4 days without sequelae. Most children look well otherwise and appear to be happy, active, alert, and playful. The diagnosis is mainly clinical. Febrile seizures occur in 10 to 15 % of children with roseola infantum during the febrile period. In general, serious complications are rare and occur more often in individuals who are immunocompromised. There is no specific treatment. An antipyretic may be used to reduce fever and discomfort. Roseola infantum is generally a benign and self-limited disease. Failure to recognize this condition may result in undue parental fear, unnecessary investigations, delay in treatment for conditions that mimic roseola infantum and complications from roseola infantum, unnecessary treatment of roseola infantum per se, and misuse of healthcare expenditure.

Selective angiography showed intracavernosal arteriovenous fistulas in all patients and pseudoaneurysm of the cavernosal artery (or common penile artery) in three patients. After successful embolization, detumescence was achieved in all patients. Colour Doppler sonography enabled localization and characterization of the lesion causing priapism in four patients. Grey-scale ultrasonography showed the dilated cavernosal sinuses in all patients. Angiography with selective embolization is safe and effective method to correct post-traumatic priapism.

Little information is available which children with CP are most at risk. This study aimed to describe the development of non-verbal intellectual capacity of school-age children with CP and to examine the association between the development of non-verbal intellectual capacity and the severity of CP. A longitudinal analysis in a cohort study was performed with a clinic-based sample of children with CP. Forty-two children were assessed at 5, 6 and 7 years of age, and 49 children were assessed at 7, 8 and 9 years of age. Non-verbal intellectual capacity was assessed by Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (RCPM). Severity of CP was classified by the Gross Motor Function Classification System, type of motor impairment and limb distribution. manova for repeated measurements was used to analyse time effects and time × group effects on both RCPM raw scores and RCPM intelligence quotient scores. The development of non-verbal intellectual capacity was characterised by a statistically significant increase in RCPM raw scores but no significant change in RCPM intelligence quotient scores. The development of RCPM raw scores was significantly associated with the severity of CP. Children with higher levels of gross motor functioning and children with spastic CP showed greater increase in raw scores than children with lower levels of gross motor functioning and children with dyskinetic CP. Children with CP aged between 5 and 9 years show different developmental trajectories for non-verbal intellectual capacity, which are associated with the severity of CP. The development of non-verbal intellectual capacity in children with less severe CP seems to resemble that of typically developing children, while children with more severe CP show a limited intellectual development compared to typically developing children.

164,164,26270999,"Evidence on the associations of dietary patterns with cognition in children is limited. Therefore, we investigated the associations of the Baltic Sea Diet Score (BSDS) and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score with cognition in children. The present cross-sectional study sample included 428 children aged 6-8 years (216 boys and 212 girls). The BSDS and the DASH score were calculated using data from 4 d food records, higher scores indicating better diet quality. Cognition was assessed by the Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (CPM) score, a higher score indicating better cognition. Among all children, the BSDS (standardised regression coefficient β = 0·122, P =0·012) and the DASH score (β = 0·121, P =0·015) were directly associated with the Raven's CPM score. Among boys, a lower BSDS (β = 0·244, P< 0·001) and a lower DASH score (β = 0·202, P= 0·003) were related to a lower Raven's CPM score. Boys in the lowest quartile of the BSDS (22·5 v. 25·3, P= 0·029) and the DASH score (22·4 v. 25·7, P= 0·008) had a lower Raven's CPM score than those in the highest quartile of the corresponding score.

This study was performed to review our experience and evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the step-advanced rectangular flap.From May, 2014 to September, 2016, 12 consecutive children with soft-tissue defects overlying the Achilles tendon caused by spoke injuries were treated with the step-advanced rectangular flap. The patients' general information, surgical details, and postoperative complications were recorded. The Mazur evaluation system was used to assess clinical outcomes.All patients were followed up for ≥12 months (range 12-38 months). All flaps survived completely. Superficial infection occurred in 2 patients and healed by second intention after dressing changes; the other patients' surgical wounds healed by primary intention. The scars around the flaps in 2 patients were remarkable, and all others showed good results in terms of flap color and texture. Ankle function was normal, and satisfactory results were obtained in all cases. According to the Mazur evaluation system, the results were excellent in 9 patients and good in 3, with an excellent and good rate of 100% at 12 months postoperatively.The rectangular advancement flap appears to be a simple and reliable method for small to moderate soft tissue defects overlying the Achilles tendon in children.

The remaining 10 (45%) had residual leaks immediately after the procedure, although no patient with a large duct showed residual leakage 18 months after the procedure. Radiographic measurement of the coils showed that all implanted coils retracted to 65-85% of their original size immediately after occlusion. This retraction was more evident in patients showing spontaneous closure of the residual shunt or having a coil 8 mm in diameter. Coil embolisation is an acceptable method for occluding persistent ductus arteriosus. Retraction of implanted coils is common in the follow up period.

They all underwent a thorough ophthalmological investigation, including age-appropriate visual acuity testing, anterior segment evaluation for Lisch nodules and a dilated fundus examination. If children were cooperative enough, colour vision was tested using the Hardy-Rand-Rittler test, visual fields were evaluated with Goldmann perimetry. All performed MRI of the brain and orbits as part of the standard of care protocol. Visual electrodiagnostics included electroretinography (ERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP) using a standard protocol in older children, whereas with less cooperative children a modified protocol according to the Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH protocol) was used. The average visual acuity was 0.8 ± 0.3, colour vision was abnormal in 6%, perimetry in 8%, Lisch nodules were present in 62%, and the optic disc was pale in 66% of all eyes. Plexiform neurofibroma of the eyelid/orbit was present in 4%. Optic pathway glioma (OPG) was detected with MRI in 22 (57%) and in 6/22 treatment was indicated. Other intracranial NF1-related lesions were documented in 70% of children. VEP were abnormal in 16/39 of all children with NF1 (41%) comprising 14/22 (65%) of children with confirmed OPG and 2/17 (12%) of children without OPG. All full-field and pattern ERG responses were within normal limits. All individual VEP results are described and three cases from this cohort of children are presented in detail to illustrate the importance of VEP testing. In Case 1, VEP abnormality suggested subsequent MRI of the brain under general anaesthesia, which was otherwise contraindicated according to normal clinical findings and his young age. In Cases 2 and 3, VEP provided more precise functional information during the follow-up of OPG, while other psychophysical tests remained unchanged. Electrodiagnostics has multifactorial role and importance in children with NF1, either when visual pathway function is impaired in young children, even before MRI under general anaesthesia and other psychophysical tests can be performed, as well as for a more precise monitoring of the visual pathway function before potential treatment of OPG, or after it, to evaluate its success.

171,171,23098746,"Unintended hyperinflation of the cuff of a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) may be associated with increased airway morbidity and postoperative pain. While the manufacturers recommend a cuff pressure of ≤ 60 cmH(2)O, in usual clinical practice, there is no method used to determine the intracuff pressure. The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the accuracy of a newly designed LMA with a built in pressure gauge intended to alert the clinician to elevated intracuff pressures. The pressure gauge has a color code system intended to reflect the intracuff pressure with green being 40-60 cmH(2)O. There was no change dictated in clinical practice for these patients. Per our usual practice, the LMA was removed from the package and inserted with the cuff partially inflated. Additional air was added to the cuff using a syringe as needed to ensure a seal during positive pressure ventilation to a peak inflating pressure (peak ventilating pressure) of 20-25 cmH(2)O. The clinicians placing the LMA did not use the pressure gauge for clinical feedback during cuff inflation. Immediately after LMA placement, the pressure in the cuff of the LMA was measured using a hand held manometer by an independent reviewer not part of the patient's anesthetic management. The color indicated on the pressure gauge (yellow, green or red) was recorded prior to pressure sampling. Additional data collected included the patient's demographic data (age, weight, and gender), the size of the LMA, and whether air was added to the cuff. The study cohort included 100 children, ranging in age from 3 months to 19 years and in weight from 5.4 to 80.1 kg. One patient was excluded due to malfunction of the pressure gauge and pilot balloon of the LMA. The intracuff pressure as measured by manometer correlated appropriately with the color coding of the pressure gauge in 94 of the 99 (95%) of the LMA's tested. Given the potential association of excessive intracuff pressures with postoperative sore throat and the inability to ensure acceptable intracuff pressures using clinical judgment, this new LMA may allow a simple means of achieving this goal without the use of costly devices (manometers) in every operating room. In 95% of the LMA's tested, the color reading correlated appropriately with the intracuff pressure.

173,173,15181186,"Pediatric cardiology, as a discipline, arose from early descriptive studies of congenital cardiac defects. The development of the stethoscope allowed some clinical diagnoses to be made during life. Cardiology as a medical specialty was limited, mainly, to internists. When Robert Gross ligated a patent ductus in 1938, pediatric cardiology, as a discipline, was born. Physiologic studies, angiography, and the development of extracorporeal circulation allowed congenital cardiac lesions previously considered a curiosity to be diagnosed and treated successfully. The few pediatricians who were interested in cardiology taught themselves, and soon pediatric cardiology training programs developed. By 1961, pediatric cardiology became the first subspecialty board in pediatrics. The past 60 y has brought enormous progress. Cardiac ultrasound, color-flow Doppler, and magnetic resonance imaging have made diagnostic cardiac catheterization almost unnecessary. Instead, interventional cardiac catheterization rapidly developed and is already able to replace surgery in the treatment of a number of cardiac defects. The first 50 y of cardiology has been focused on patient care, education, and clinical research, but the last 10 y has added exciting, basic research discoveries, which are elucidating the cause of cardiac defects with hope for prevention in the future. As a discipline, pediatric cardiology has always required a team-pathologists, physiologists, cardiologists, surgeons, intensivists, interventionists, and anesthesiologists-all playing an important role in the treatment of children with cardiac problems. Today the geneticists, molecular biologists, and other basic scientists are joining the team to ensure an exciting future for pediatric cardiology and the children yet to be born.

174,174,36049595,"View classification is a key step toward building a fully automated system for interpretation of echocardiograms. However, compared with adult echocardiograms, creating a view classification model for pediatric echocardiograms poses additional challenges, such as greater variation in anatomy, structure size, and views. The aim of this study was to develop a computer vision model to autonomously perform view classification on pediatric echocardiographic images. Using a training set of 12,067 echocardiographic images from patients aged 0 to 19 years, a convolutional neural network model was trained to identify 27 preselected standard pediatric echocardiographic views which included anatomic sweeps, color Doppler, and Doppler tracings. A validation set of 6,197 images was used for parameter tuning and model selection. A test set of 9,684 images from 100 different patients was then used to evaluate model accuracy. The model was also evaluated on a per study basis using a second test set consisting of 524 echocardiograms from children with leukemia to identify six preselected views pertinent to cardiac dysfunction surveillance. The model identified the 27 preselected views with 90.3% accuracy. Accuracy was similar across age groups (89.3% for 0-4 years, 90.8% for 4-9 years, 90.0% for 9-14 years, and 91.2% for 14-19 years; P = .12).

175,175,22065796,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of three diagnostic sonographic methods, greyscale sonography (GSS), colour Doppler sonography (CDS) and spectral Doppler (SPD), in differentiating between benign and malignant salivary gland (SG) tumours. 44 patients with SG masses were examined using GSS, CDS and SPD. The morphological features of each tumour were evaluated using GSS, the distribution and number of detected blood vessels were assessed using CDS, and peak systolic velocity (PSV), resistive index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) were measured on SPD. All cases underwent excisional biopsy and a definite tissue diagnosis was obtained. Histopathological examination revealed that 28 of the 44 tumours were benign and 16 were malignant. GSS showed that malignant SG tumours had a significantly higher incidence of ill-defined borders and lymph node involvement than benign tumours, but there was no significant difference between benign and malignant SG tumours regarding echogenicity, homogeneity or sonographic shape. CDS demonstrated malignant tumours with significantly higher vascularity and a scattered distribution. Using SPD, malignant tumours had significantly higher PSV, RI and PI compared with benign tumours. RI values above 0.7, PI values above 1.2, PSV values above 44.3 cm s(-1), ill-defined borders, lymph node involvement, Grade 2 or 3 vascularity and hilar distribution of blood vessels should alert the clinician to suspect a malignant SG tumour. After consensus on the threshold values of PSV, RI and PI in differentiating benign from malignant SG tumours, these numbers should be incorporated into the software of ultrasound machines to guide the sonographer in his or her analysis.

However, over the past year, she has started to have more worries and unusual behavior.Chloe and her mother report that when she walks through doorways, she will almost always go back and walks through again. At home, she will walk through doorways multiple times and at school, she will pretend she forgot something so her friends do not notice. She often will not walk downstairs and occasionally her mother has to carry her. Clothes are problematic for Chloe. If her father touches something of a specific color and then touches Chloe, she will have to change her clothes or take a shower. Sometimes, she will never be able to wear those clothes again. She had a recent episode where she could not stop tapping a red paper, because if she stopped, she said it would burst into flame. During the 2 weeks before the pediatric visit, symptoms increased to the point that she is now refusing to go to school. When she stays home, she lays in 1 place all day.Chloe is a fourth grade student. The family does not report academic concerns. She has friends. She denies any appetite or sleep problems. She endorses periods of sadness, lack of energy, and decreased interest in social activities, mostly because she worries and is embarrassed. She kept her behaviors hidden from her 5 siblings for the past year, and she talked only to her mother about them. She is worried her friends might discover her behaviors.The family history is notable for multiple paternal family members with anxiety and bipolar disorder and depression on mother's side.

177,177,12050604,"Doppler tissue imaging allows the measurement of tissue motion velocity in real time. However, tissue velocities are affected by translational motion and by the angle of Doppler interrogation. The myocardial velocity gradient and myocardial wall thickening velocity, determined by color Doppler tissue imaging, can be used to evaluate regional wall thickening and thinning motion independent of translational motion. To determine the control values for myocardial velocity gradient and myocardial wall thickening velocity for the interventricular septum and posterior wall, we studied 120 healthy children (mean age: 7.8 +/- 5.0 years). Peak values of myocardial velocity gradient and myocardial wall thickening velocity at each cardiac phase were measured: systole, early diastole, and atrial contraction. The peak values of myocardial velocity gradient and myocardial wall thickening velocity were higher in the posterior wall than those in the interventricular septum, suggesting that thickening and thinning are more dynamic in the posterior wall. Linear regression analysis demonstrated that absolute values of myocardial velocity gradient at systole, early diastole, and atrial contraction, and wall thickening velocity at atrial contraction decreased with body surface area (BSA). On the other hand, absolute values of myocardial wall thickening velocity at systole and early diastole increased with BSA, and myocardial wall thickening velocity at early diastole in interventricular septum did not change. Myocardial velocity gradient at systole and early diastole, and myocardial wall thickening velocity at systole were strongly related to BSA. In contrast, myocardial velocity gradient and myocardial wall thickening velocity at atrial contraction strongly correlated with time interval between 2 consecutive QRS complexes. Because myocardial wall thickening velocity at early diastole in the interventricular septum did not correlate with BSA or time interval between 2 consecutive QRS complexes, it might evaluate diastolic function of interventricular septum independent of body size or heart rate.

The lesions are most common in the head-neck region and are characterized by single or multiple smooth-top papules or plaques of varying color. Microscopically, ALHE consists of anomalous vascular proliferations and varying degrees of nodular and diffuse lymphocytic infiltrates with eosinophils at all levels of the corium and subcutaneous tissue. In fifty-three cases an arterial structure, confirmed by the presence of an internal elastic lamina, was observed in close association with venular structures or was the site of endothelial cell proliferation. ALHE comprises a spectrum of unusual vascular proliferation with inflammation, encompassing such entities as inflammatory angiomatous nodules, pseudo or atypical pyogenic granuloma, histiocytoid hemangioma, epithelioid hemangioma, and Kimura's disease. The existence of arterial structures among venules and endothelial cell proliferations suggests the presence of arteriovenous (AV) shunts, which may help explain the pathogenesis and biologic behavior of this condition.

Most were flat (77%), warm to the touch (60%), and red or pink-red in color (35%), with heterogeneous color saturation (73%) and well-defined borders (71%). Regional soft tissue swelling/overgrowth was common (47%). Head and neck location was most common (38%). Among 34 HFVS with photographic review over time, all demonstrated changes in appearance. Retrospective design, recall bias, lack of standardized time points or visual analog scale, and image variability. Heterogeneity of stain color saturation, warmth to touch, peripheral pallor, and overgrowth/soft tissue swelling help distinguish HFVS from port wine stains.

183,183,36977985,"Anesthesiologists need to appreciate the impact of preoperative anxiety in children. The present study aimed to explore whether interactive multimedia-based home-initiated interventions could effectively relieve preoperative anxiety in pediatric patients. In this prospective study, we compared preoperative anxiety between two groups of children aged 4-9 years. Children in the control group received a question-and-answer (Q&A) introduction, and children in the intervention group received multimedia-based home-initiated preoperative education using comic booklets, videos, and coloring game books. Differences in anxiety between the two groups were evaluated by the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale-Short Form (mYPAS-SF) at four time points: in the ophthalmology outpatient clinic before intervention as the baseline (T0); in the preoperative waiting area (T1); at the time of separating from their parents and moving to the operating room (T2); and at the time of anesthesia induction (T3). Parental anxiety was assessed by the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at T0 and T2. Other related information was collected by questionnaire. Eighty-four children who underwent pediatric strabismus in our center between November 2020 and July 2021 were included in this study. An intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was performed on data from 78 enrolled children. Children in the intervention group exhibited lower m-YPAS-SF scores at T1, T2, and T3 than those in the control group (all p < 0.001). By using a mixed-effect model with repeated measurement (MMRM) after adjusting the m-YPAS score at T0 as a covariate, the interventional effect in terms of themYPAS-SF score was also significant over time (p < 0.001). The percentage of children with perfect induction compliance (ICC = 0) in the intervention group was significantly higher than that in the control group [18.4% vs. 7.5%], and poor induction compliance (ICC>4) was lower (2.6% vs. 17.5%, p = 0.048). The mean parental VAS score at T2 in the intervention group was significantly lower than that in the control group (p = 0.021).

While 75% of participants were confident in managing common medical issues in SOC 85% were not confident in managing common cosmetic issues in SOC and 75% were not confident performing procedures on SOC. Over 80% stated they would have liked more teaching in SOC during their training and over 50% of those surveyed believe they had enough time to undertake further training in this area. We propose here the first analysis of issues relating to SOC dermatology among Australian dermatologists in the context of the changing patient demographic in the country.

A prospective cross-sectional study of all sick children presenting to the emergency department of a government referral hospital in Eldoret, Kenya, was performed. Measured weight was compared with predicted weights according to the Broselow tape and commonly used advanced pediatric life support (APLS) and Nelson's age-based formulas. A Bland-Altman analysis was used to determine agreement between each method and actual weight. The method for weight prediction was determined a priori to be equivalent to the actual weight if the 95% confidence interval for the mean percentage difference between the predicted and actual weight was less than 10%. Nine hundred sixty-seven children were included in analysis. The overall mean percentage difference for the actual weight and Broselow predicted weight was -2.2%, whereas APLS and Nelson's predictions were -5.2% and -10.4%, respectively. The overall agreement between Broselow color zone and actual weight was 65.5%, with overestimate typically occurring by only 1 color zone.

191,191,8921487,"Although most epidemiological data are gathered by interviews, few studies ascertain their reliability. This study quantified inter-observer reliability of environmental, biological and health characteristics of underprivileged children, in a southern Brazilian state. Five health care professionals who had received extensive standardized interview and observation training interviewed mothers and observed the home environments of a random sample of 102 children. A second interview was conducted by a sixth health professional who had received separate but identical training without the initial interviewer knowing a follow-up interview would be conducted. Data from the two independent interviews and observations were compared for agreement using the kappa statistic. There was excellent agreement (kappa > 0.75) for most of the household characteristics, such as type of walls, ceiling, floor and windows in spite of the diversity of buildings. Presence of the parents, number of people in the house-hold, age of the mother and health assistance were reliable as well. However, information about skin colour of the mother and the number of cracks in the house only reached fair agreement. These results showed that data gathered by observation and interviews generate accurate information about environmental, biological and health care characteristics. Those based on written information, such as birth date, were highly concordant. In Brazil, data from a case control study of risk factors for pneumonia among low-income children less than 24 months old were used to quantify the reliability of inter-observer information about environmental, biological, and health characteristics of these children. Five experienced field workers who underwent training in role play, classroom lectures, discussions, and closely-supervised field practice interviewed the mothers of 102 children and observed their home environments. Another experienced professional, unknown to the other field workers, who received the same instructions as the others but independently of them conducted a second independent assessment three weeks after the initial assessment. All the interviewers were blind to the objective of this study. Even though the dwellings were quite diverse, the researchers found excellent agreement (kappa statistic 75) for most household characteristics (type of walls, presence and type of ceiling, type of floor, and presence, type, and number of windows in child's bedroom). Agreement was also good to excellent for presence of parents, number of people in the household, age of the mother, and history of previous pneumonia, hospitalization, and immunization. Agreement was relatively good when the number of cracks in the wall was 0 (0.76) or more than 20 (0.65) but not when it ranged from 1 to 19 (0.3-0.38). Agreement on skin color was more reliable when skin color was White or Black (0.77 and 0.78, respectively) than it was for mixed (0.63). Data based on written information yielded the most concordance while observation of sensitive risk factors (i.e., skin color and number of cracks [indicator for poor housing]) yielded the lowest concordance. These findings show that observation- and interview-collected data yield accurate information about environmental, biological, and health care characteristics.

192,192,38108513,"The United States holds the distinction of being the developed country with the worst perinatal outcomes despite spending the most per capita on health care. Black women are three to four times more likely than White women to experience adverse birth outcomes. These outcomes persist despite access to prenatal care, insurance, and college education. A long overdue racial reckoning has arrived, beginning with acknowledging the fallacy of race-based medicine and the role of enduring systemic racism as foundational to obstetric racism in the reproductive lives of Black women. Centering voices of Black women and honoring their lived experiences are essential to providing respectful maternity care. Naming micro- and macroaggressions experienced by Black women allows for dismantling of systemic barriers which perpetuate inequitable outcomes and enable substandard care. Racial concordance (shared racial identity) is one tool to consider in creating safe health care spaces for Black women. Improving diversity of the nursing workforce specifically, and the health care workforce in general, is necessary to affect racial concordance. Application of skills in cultural humility can mitigate challenges associated with adverse patient encounters for Black women as diversity pipeline strategies are explored.

193,193,30439844,"Music therapy and attachment is an expanding field and the number of studies addressing the theoretical work is slowly growing. There are both qualitative and quantitative approaches to studying the effect of regular music therapy sessions on parent-child interactions and these cover a range of patient populations including: children at risk of neglect, parents with a trauma history, children coping with bereavement and a large number addressing the disability population, including autism spectrum disorder. These studies suggest that music therapy benefits the parent-child relationship through the improvement communication, especially non-verbal communication, and so increased the feeling of closeness and understanding. Following a review of the available literature, a pilot study is described using transcripts of video recordings of music therapy sessions, and subsequent colour coding and conversion of the data into pie charts provides a potential method of analysis that produces an ""interaction profile"" of each parent-child dyad. Preliminary results of this method of analysis suggest that music therapy sessions might be able to improve interactions through therapists addressing the power dynamics within a relationship. The new method developed in this pilot study to visualise and study the parent-child relationship in music therapy sessions was effective and could be used and developed by music therapy researchers in the future.

However, diagnostic catheterization remains necessary in other instances. The aims of this study were to determine whether echocardiography alone was sufficient to delineate the anatomic and flow abnormalities in patients subsequently selected to undergo catheterization and, if not, under what circumstances was echocardiography unable to establish the definitive diagnosis. Echocardiograms of 252 infants and children who underwent catheterization during a 14-month interval were analyzed retrospectively to determine whether the echographic assessment was nondiscrepant (group 1) or discrepant (group 2) with the catheterization assessment. Any deviation in the complete accurate assessment constituted a discrepancy; identification of more than one discrepancy in a single patient was possible. Independent variables included patient's age, weight, operative status, use of color flow mapping, echocardiograph operator, and interval between echocardiogram and catheterization. To determine whether the discrepancies were clinically significant, data from patients in group 2 were reviewed independently by three cardiologists to determine whether patient management would have changed given the added data provided by catheterization. Echocardiographic evaluations were discrepant in 155 instances. In 54 of 155 instances (35%), discrepancies were judged to be clinically significant (group 3).

Simple visual stimuli differed dichotomously in shape, color, number, and shading. A target object presented alone was followed by two choices from which subjects selected according to preference. Considering all four characteristics, similarity between target and subject choice was scored for 30 trials. A high score implied a context-dependent response selection bias and a low score, a context-independent bias. Similarity increased significantly with age. The youngest children (5-7 years) scored lower than ages from 11 years to adulthood. Between 7 and 9 years, scores began to increase with age to reach an adult level by age 13-16.

Children were excluded if they were intoxicated, had altered sensorium, were clinically unstable, did not speak English, or had developmental delays. Children marked their current pain severity on a standardized Color Analog Scale (CAS) and a 7-point Faces Pain Scale (FPS). They were then asked whether their pain was mild, moderate, or severe. Children were then administered an analgesic at the discretion of the attending physician and asked to repeat these measurements. For assessing content validity, the scales were also administered to age- and gender-matched children in the ED for nonpainful conditions. Convergent validity was assessed by determining the Spearman correlation coefficient between the 2 pain scales.

210,210,38189745,"The supracondylar humeral fracture (SCHF) is the most common fracture seen in children, forming up to 70% of all pediatric elbow fractures. The decision to surgically explore the brachial artery in a well-perfused, pulseless arm remains a controversial one among vascular and orthopedic surgeons and is something we seek to explore in this article. We reviewed the literature from electronic databases such as PubMed and Embase for studies focusing on the management of the pink pulseless hand (PPH) following SCHF. We gathered a total of 23 articles to be analyzed in this review. We found 336 PPH postreduction and evaluated the management as well as the follow-up and complications of the PPH involved. Most recent articles have cited the close observation strategy as the most reliable strategy. It is clear that the management of a SCHF requires immediate reduction and fixation. In the management of a postoperatively pulseless pink humerus, we do agree with the latest conclusion of Delionitis et al . who advocate the traditional dogma of watchful waiting in the case of a PPH postreduction and fixation as long as no signs of vascular deterioration appear. However, the outcome of this study also advocates for the monitoring of up to 24-48 h postreduction and the use of noninvasive tools such as ultrasound Doppler, Color flow duplex Ultrasound and pulse oximetry to monitor perfusion as they all have had good outcomes in the articles cited in this review. Still, in the event of vascular deterioration or development of complications of the hand, immediate vascular exploration is still indicated.

On the basis of these findings, a study was carried out to investigate the effect of the scar-specific Contractubex gel (Merz+Co., D-Frankfurt/Main), containing 10% onion extract, 50 U sodium heparin per g of gel and 1% allantoin, in the treatment of children who underwent thoracic surgery and to evaluate its effect on scar development. Before and during the six-month treatment period, both macromorphology and scar colour were assessed; furthermore, a global evaluation of the therapeutic result was made. Additionally, the scars were characterized after a six-month treatment-free follow-up period. The results of 38 Contractubex-treated and 27 untreated patients were compared. In the treated scars, the global evaluation of the therapeutic result was better than in the untreated scars. In the Contractubex group, the rating was ""good"" and ""very good"" in 84% of cases, as compared to 59% of the untreated cases. In the treated group, the increase in scar size was markedly lower than in the untreated patients. The treated scars showed a tendency towards quicker paling than the untreated scars. In the treated group, the conversion of primary physiological scars to unphysiological scars (hypertrophic or keloidal scars) was less frequent than in the untreated group.

Overall, care, and socioeconomic completeness scores were compiled based on selected variables, by using ad hoc weights assigned by experts. The completeness scores were analysed, considering the region and area of residence, the pregnant woman's race/colour, and the year of case notification. Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to validate the scores obtained by the weighted average method, compared with the values obtained by principal component analysis (PCA). Most selected variables presented a good or excellent degree of completeness for GS and CS, except for clinical classification, pregnant woman's level of education, partner's treatment, and child's race/colour, which were classified as poor or very poor. The overall (89.93% versus 89.69%) and socioeconomic (88.71% versus 88.24%) completeness scores for GS and CS, respectively, were classified as regular, whereas the care score (GS-90.88%, and CS-90.72%) was good, despite improvements over time.

Overestimation of oxygen saturation by pulse oximeters, particularly in hypoxic states, is disparately higher in Black compared to other racial groups. Compared to adult literature, pediatric studies are relatively few and mostly reliant on birth certificates or maternal race-based classification of comparison groups. Neonates, infants, and young children are particularly susceptible to the adverse life-long consequences of hypoxia and hyperoxia. Successful neonatal resuscitation, precise monitoring of preterm and term neonates with predominantly lung pathology, screening for congenital heart defects, and critical decisions on home oxygen, ventilator support and medication therapies, are only a few examples of situations that are highly reliant on the accuracy of pulse oximetry. Undetected hypoxia, especially if systematically different in certain racial groups may delay appropriate therapies and may further perpetuate health care disparities. The role of biological factors that may differ between racial groups, particularly skin pigmentation that may contribute to biased pulse oximeter readings needs further evaluation. Developmental and maturational changes in skin physiology and pigmentation, and its interaction with the operating principles of pulse oximetry need further study. Importantly, clinicians should recognize the limitations of pulse oximetry and use additional objective measures of oxygenation (like co-oximetry measured arterial oxygen saturation) where hypoxia is a concern.

217,217,24916386,The aim of this study was to develop a low-cost antifilarial immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 detection kit for the diagnosis of lymphatic filariasis. The kit was designed to be used by minimally trained personnel without the constraints of expensive laboratory equipment. We provide a description of the development and validation of a single-serum-dilution based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit with ready-to-use reagents for measuring antifilarial IgG4 antibodies. The kit was tested on residents in Brugia malayi-endemic areas in southern Thailand. Detection was performed by naked-eye observation of the resultant colour of the immunological reactivity. The coefficient of variation (CV) was used to assess the reproducibility of the results. Long-term stability was measured over a 6-month period. Sensitivity of the test kit was 97% when compared with microfilariae detection in thick blood smears. Specificity was 98.7% based on the sera of 57 patients living outside the endemic areas who were infected with other parasites and 100 parasite-free subjects. All positive CVs were < 10%. The test kit was remarkably stable over 6 months. Field validation was performed by the detection of antifilarial IgG4 in 4365 serum samples collected from residents of brugian filariasis-endemic areas and compared with outcome colours of the test samples by the naked eye. Subsequent ELISA evaluation of these results using an ELISA reader indicated high agreement by the kappa statistic.

221,221,28871935,"Dear Editor, Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a very common skin infection caused by a molluscipox virus gene of the poxvirus family. It usually occurs in young children, sexually active adults, and immunocompromised individuals. The typical clinical picture of this infection is characterized by asymptomatic flesh-colored, single or multiple papules, measuring 2-6 mm in diameter with a central umbilication that occur on the skin and the mucous membranes. In adults, the skin lesions are predominantly located in the genital region, whereas in children they are found on the trunk, the extremities, and the face. MC is generally regarded as a self-limited disease; however, its treatment is usually advisable considering its potentially protracted course and the risk of superinfection, scarring, autoinoculation, and transmission to other members of the community. A large number of approaches to the treatment of MC have been used so far (none of them approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)) including ablative regimens (curettage, electrodessication, cryotherapy, laser therapy) and topical or systemic pharmacologic agents (tretinoin, cantharidin, trichloroacetic and salicylic acid, potassium hydroxide, interferon-alfa, and cimetidine). Imiquimod is a topically applicable Toll-like receptor (TLR)-7/8 agonist, which is capable of stimulating the innate cutaneous immunity and the cellular arm of the adaptive immune response and of exerting potent anti-viral, anti-tumor and immunoregulatory effects (1). Originally approved for the treatment of external genital and perianal warts in adults, imiquimod was later approved for the therapy of basal cell carcinomas and actinic keratoses and has also been used in the management of several off-label indications including cutaneous infections and neoplasms. Our group has successfully used topical imiquimod in the treatment of a variety of dermatoses including granuloma annulare, pyogenic granuloma, herpes labialis, and lichen striatus (2-6). Moreover, we have examined the topical application of imiquimod over the last twelve years in the treatment of 23 children with MC, the demographic data and the therapeutic response of which are summarized in Table 1. Seventeen out of 23 children (73.91%) treated with topical imiquimod once daily under occlusion (including two cases with disseminated lesions) showed a complete remission within 3 to 8 weeks of treatment. Furthermore, 6 other children who switched to other forms of treatment showed a partial remission (55.55%-84.61%) after 10 to 12 weeks of therapy. The only cutaneous adverse reaction to topical imiquimod was a mild to moderate irritation in the application area that was observed in all treated children, whereas no systemic side effects could be seen. Our findings are compatible with those of other groups, who also demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy and safety of topical imiquimod in MC. Interestingly, in two very similar subsequent papers Katz and Swetman (7) and Katz (8,9) expressed the view that ""imiquimod is neither efficacious nor safe in the treatment of MC in children"". This view was not the result of the author's clinical experience but was exclusively based on the findings of two randomized clinical trials (RCTs). These were carried out in 2006 upon request of the FDA from the drug's original manufacturer (3M) and ""definitely showed that imiquimod does not effectively treat MC in children"". Surprisingly, today, 10 years after their completion, these RCTs still remain unpublished, whereas the corresponding FDA site provides no information with regard to the researchers, the centers in which these trials were conducted, their research protocol, and the demographic data of the enrolled patients. In a very recent review on childhood skin infections, Rush and Dinulos (10), exclusively based on Dr. Katz's paper, fully adopted this view and stated that ""imiquimod is neither efficacious nor safe in the treatment of MC"", although they admit that the RCTs cited by the latter still remain unpublished. In contrast to these authors, we reject Dr Katz's inexplicable request to the medical community to fully ignore all articles published in peer-reviewed journals that demonstrate the efficacy and safety of imiquimod in MC. We do not claim that imiquimod is a panacea. However, based on our clinical experience and that of other groups, we are convinced that this compound represents a very useful and painless tool in the dermatologic arsenal for the treatment of MC, an otherwise difficult to manage dermatosis, particularly in children.

While there is optimism with SDF with regard to caries management, there is no true consensus on the number and frequency of applications for children. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of 38% SDF to arrest early childhood caries (ECC) at three different application regimen intervals. Children with teeth that met International Caries Detection and Assessment System codes 5 or 6 criteria were recruited from community dental clinics into an open-label, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial from October 2019 to June 2021. Participants were randomized to one of three groups using sealed envelopes that were prepared with one of three regimens inside: visits one month, four months, or six months apart. Participants received applications of 38% SDF, along with 5% sodium fluoride varnish (NaFV), at the first two visits to treat cavitated carious lesions. Lesions were followed and arrest rates were calculated. Lesions were considered arrested if they were hard on probing and black in colour. Statistics included descriptive and bivariate analyses (Kruskal one-way analysis of variance and Pearson's Chi-squared test). A p-value of ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Eighty-four children participated in the study (49 males and 35 females, mean age: 44.4 ± 14.2 months). Treatment groups were well matched with 28 participants per group. A total of 374 teeth and 505 lesions were followed. Posterior lesions represented only 40.6% of affected surfaces. Almost all SDF treated lesions were arrested for the one-month (192/196, 98%) and four-month (159/166, 95.8%) interval groups at the final visit. The six-month group experienced the lowest arrest rates; only 72% (103/143) of lesions were arrested (p < 0.001). The duration of application intervals was inversely associated with improvements in arrest rates for all lesions. Two applications of 38% SDF and 5% NaFV in one-month and four-month intervals were comparable and very effective in arresting ECC.

Parameters for this study were: (1) donor sex, age, and body weight; (2) recipient sex, age, body weight, liver disease, preoperative prothrombin time, and type of arterial reconstruction; and (3) previous liver transplantation. Hepatic artery thrombosis occurred in 12 patients (5.4%) at 3 to 15 days posttransplant. Recipient female sex and metabolic disorder as the original disease were found to be significantly associated with hepatic artery thrombosis. The 5-year patient survival rate in recipients with hepatic artery thrombosis (58.3%) was significantly lower than that in recipients without this complication (84.4%). Female sex and metabolic disease may be factors contributing to hepatic artery thrombosis after living-donor liver transplantation. More intensive anticoagulation therapy for this patient population might decrease the incidence of hepatic artery thrombosis and, thus, posttransplant recipient mortality.

224,224,26124497,"Minimal residual disease (MRD) is highly prognostic in pediatric B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). In Children's Oncology Group high-risk B-ALL study AALL0232, we investigated MRD in subjects randomized in a 2 × 2 factorial design to receive either high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) or Capizzi methotrexate (C-MTX) during interim maintenance (IM) or prednisone or dexamethasone during induction. Subjects with end-induction MRD ≥0.1% or those with morphologic slow early response were nonrandomly assigned to receive a second IM and delayed intensification phase. MRD was measured by 6-color flow cytometry in 1 of 2 reference labs, with excellent agreement between the two. Subjects with end-induction MRD <0.01% had a 5-year event-free survival (EFS) of 87% ± 1% vs 74% ± 4% for those with MRD 0.01% to 0.1%; increasing MRD amounts was associated with progressively worse outcome. Subjects converting from MRD positive to negative by end consolidation had a relatively favorable 79% ± 5% 5-year disease-free survival vs 39% ± 7% for those with MRD ≥0.01%. Although HD-MTX was superior to C-MTX, MRD retained prognostic significance in both groups (86% ± 2% vs 58% ± 4% for MRD-negative vs positive C-MTX subjects; 88% ± 2% vs 68% ± 4% for HD-MTX subjects). Intensified therapy given to subjects with MRD >0.1% did not improve either 5-year EFS or overall survival (OS). However, these subjects showed an early relapse rate similar to that seen in MRD-negative ones, with EFS/OS curves for patients with 0.1% to 1% MRD crossing those with 0.01% to 0.1% MRD at 3 and 4 years, thus suggesting that the intensified therapy altered the disease course of MRD-positive subjects. Additional interventions targeted at the MRD-positive group may further improve outcome. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00075725.

A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in the Faculty of Medicine, The National Ribat University, Khartoum, Sudan between January and June 2010. The study consists of 139 subjects, which includes 41 Sudanese identical twins (82 subjects), 50 subjects from the general population, and 7 Chinese. All subjects were free of skin lesions. Based on reflectance spectrophotometry, the skin color has been read for all subjects from the inner upper arm using the Medisun skin check. Visual judgment on color differences was carried out directly with 3 normal observers, and through digital photos. Skin color was found to be different in all subjects under the study depending on visual judgment, digital photos, and skin color readings. Differences in skin color were also found between different parts of the body (color map). Color intensity reading in the first twin was 4.010 +/- 0.5, and in the second twin was 3.89 +/- 0.44 with a significant difference (p=0.001). The general population sample showed significant differences in skin color from each other, and from the Chinese group (p=0.002).

226,226,32593509,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients develop severe lung disease including chronic airway infections, neutrophilic inflammation, and progressive fibrotic remodeling in airways. However, cellular and molecular processes that regulate excessive collagen deposition in airways in these patients remain unclear. Fibrocytes are bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal cells that express the hematopoietic cell marker CD45, and mesenchymal cell markers and implicated in collagen deposition in several fibrotic diseases. It is unknown whether fibrocytes accumulate in the lungs of CF patients, so the current study evaluates the presence of fibrocytes in the fibrotic lesions of airways in explanted CF lungs compared to non-CF unused donor lungs (control). We used immunofluorescence staining to determine if fibrocytes accumulate in explanted CF lungs compared to healthy donor lungs. Simultaneously, we evaluated cells collected by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in CF patients using multi-color flow cytometry. Finally, we analyzed transcripts differentially expressed in fibrocytes isolated from the explanted CF lungs compared to control to assess fibrocyte-specific pro-fibrotic gene networks. Our findings demonstrate fibrocyte accumulation in CF lungs compared to non-CF lungs. Additionally, fibrocytes were detected in the BAL of all CF children. Transcriptomic analysis of fibrocytes identified dysregulated genes associated with fibrotic remodeling in CF lungs. With significantly increased fibrocytes that show increased expression of pro-fibrotic gene transcripts compared to control, our findings suggest an intervention for fibrotic remodeling as a potential therapeutic target in CF.

Randomized controlled trial. Pediatric ICU in a university teaching hospital. Seventy-four critically ill patients < 18 years of age receiving mechanical ventilation were randomized to receive gastric or small-bowel feeding. All feeding tubes were inserted at the bedside. Color, pH, and bilirubin concentration of the feeding tube aspirates were used to guide placement. Final tube position was confirmed radiographically. Continuous feedings were advanced to achieve a caloric goal based on age and body weight. Tracheal secretions were collected daily and tested for gastric pepsin by immunoassay. Thirty-two patients were randomized to the gastric group, and 42 patients were randomized to the small-bowel group. Twelve patients exited the study because a small-bowel tube could not be placed at the bedside, leaving 30 patients in the small-bowel group. Gastric and small-bowel groups were similar at baseline in age, sex, percentage of ideal body weight, serum prealbumin concentration, and pediatric risk of mortality score. The percentage of daily caloric goal achieved was less in the gastric group compared to the small-bowel group (30 +/- 23% vs 47 +/- 22%, p < 0.01). No difference was found in the proportion of tracheal aspirates positive for pepsin between the gastric and small-bowel groups (50 of 146 aspirates vs 50 of 172 aspirates, respectively; p = 0.3). No differences were found in the frequency of feeding tube displacement, abdominal distension, vomiting, or diarrhea between groups.

We combine 25 months of behavioural data on 75 wild, white-faced capuchins (Cebus imitator) with measurements of fruit colours and scents from 18 dietary plant species. We show that frequency of fruit-directed olfactory behaviour is positively correlated with increases in the volume of fruit odours produced during ripening. Monkeys with red-green colour blindness sniffed fruits more often, indicating that increased reliance on olfaction is a behavioural strategy that mitigates decreased capacity to detect red-green colour contrast.

231,231,38112802,"Point-of-care brain ultrasound and transcranial doppler or color-coded doppler is being increasingly used as an essential diagnostic and monitoring tool at the bedside of critically ill neonates and children. Brain ultrasound has already established as a cornerstone of daily practice in the management of the critically ill newborn for diagnosis and follow-up of the most common brain diseases, considering the easiness to insonate the brain through transfontanellar window. In critically ill children, doppler based techniques are used to assess cerebral hemodynamics in acute brain injury and recommended for screening patients suffering from sickle cell disease at risk for stroke. However, more evidence is needed regarding the accuracy of doppler based techniques for non-invasive estimation of cerebral perfusion pressure and intracranial pressure, as well as regarding the accuracy of brain ultrasound for diagnosis and monitoring of acute brain parenchyma alterations in children. This review is aimed at providing a comprehensive overview for clinicians of the technical, anatomical, and physiological basics for brain ultrasonography and transcranial doppler or color-coded doppler, and of the current status and future perspectives of their clinical applications in critically ill neonates and children. In critically ill neonates, brain ultrasound for diagnosis and follow-up of the most common cerebral pathologies of the neonatal period may be considered the standard of care. Data are needed about the possible role of doppler techniques for the assessment of cerebral perfusion and vasoreactivity of the critically ill neonate with open fontanelles. In pediatric critical care, doppler based techniques should be routinely adopted to assess and monitor cerebral hemodynamics. New technologies and more evidence are needed to improve the accuracy of brain ultrasound for the assessment of brain parenchyma of critically ill children with fibrous fontanelles. • In critically ill neonates, brain ultrasound for early diagnosis and follow-up of the most common cerebral and neurovascular pathologies of the neonatal period is a cornerstone of daily practice. In critically ill children, doppler-based techniques are more routinely used to assess cerebral hemodynamics and autoregulation after acute brain injury and to screen patients at risk for vasospasm or stroke (e.g., sickle cell diseases, right-to-left shunts). • In critically ill neonates, research is currently focusing on the use of novel high frequency probes, even higher than 10 MHz, especially for extremely preterm babies. Furthermore, data are needed about the role of doppler based techniques for the assessment of cerebral perfusion and vasoreactivity of the critically ill neonate with open fontanelles, also integrated with a non-invasive assessment of brain oxygenation. In pediatric critical care, new technologies should be developed to improve the accuracy of brain ultrasound for the assessment of brain parenchyma of critically ill children with fibrous fontanelles. Furthermore, large multicenter studies are needed to clarify role and accuracy of doppler-based techniques to assess cerebral perfusion pressure and its changes after treatment interventions.

235,235,31318849,"BACKGROUND This study aimed to evaluate superb microvascular imaging (SMI) as an adjunctive imaging method to evaluate mesenteric lymph nodes in children with mesenteric lymphadenitis compared with healthy children. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective study compared children with mesenteric lymphadenitis (n=27) and healthy children (n=30). Lymph node size was determined using grayscale ultrasonography and parameters of lymph node vascularity were compared using color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) and SMI. The diagnostic performance of ultrasound (US), US combined with SMI, and US combined with CDFI were compared. RESULTS Lymph nodes from children with mesenteric lymphadenitis (n=77) and normal lymph nodes (n=84) were evaluated by SMI, which showed that the least diameter of lymph nodes in cases of mesenteric lymphadenitis was 0.58±0.15 mm and of normal mesenteric lymph nodes was 0.47±0.08 mm (p<0.001). SMI identified 92.6% of abnormal mesenteric lymph nodes while CDFI detected 85.2%. US combined with SMI had the highest sensitivity (81.5%), and specificity (78.9%) compared with US alone (sensitivity, 63.0%; specificity, 64.9%), and compared with US combined with CDFI (sensitivity, 74.1%; specificity, 75.4%). US combined with SMI and US combined with CDFI achieved the same specificity (76.7%), which was higher than that of US alone (66.7%).

237,237,10842391,"Recent reports suggest reopening of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) after complete occlusion with three-loop Gianturco coils. We hypothesize that five-loop coils may produce a larger thrombus than three-loop coils, which will result in no or less probability of recanalization of PDA during follow-up. This study is designed to test this hypothesis. Follow-up echocardiographic and Doppler data of 30 patients who underwent five-loop coil occlusion of small to medium-sized PDA during a 33-month period ending December 1998 were examined. Thirty patients had no residual shunt on echo Doppler study on the day following the procedure and were followed for 6 to 30 months (median, 12) after coil implantation. At the last follow-up study, none of the patients had a residual shunt and left atrial size decreased. Careful pulsed, continuous wave, and color Doppler interrogation of left/main pulmonary artery junction and proximal descending aorta did not reveal any evidence for obstruction. The follow-up data suggest that complete occlusion of small- to medium-sized PDAs is feasible with five-loop coils without evidence for recanalization at a mean follow-up of 12 months. Much longer (2 to 5 years) follow-up data may be necessary to confirm these observations. We speculate that a greater degree of thrombosis is produced within the ductus by the five-loop coils, which in turn may be responsible for lack of shunt recurrence. We recommend use of five-loop instead of three-loop coils for transcatheter occlusion of small- to medium-sized PDAs.

In multivariate analysis, higher DIFF was associated with higher cycloplegic refractive error (P<0.001; standardized regression coefficient beta:0.50; regression coefficient B: 0.19; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.18, 0.20), followed by lower intraocular pressure (P<0.001; beta: -0.06; B: -0.02; 95%CI: -0.03, -0.01), rural region of habitation (P = 0.001; beta: -0.04; B: -0.07; 95%CI: -0.11, -0.03), and, to a minor degree, with age (P = 0.006; beta: 0.04; B: 0.009; 95%CI: 0.003, 0.016). 66.4% of all eyes with non-cycloplegic myopia (≤-0.50D) remained myopic after cycloplegia while the remaining 33.6% of eyes became emmetropic (18.0%) or hyperopic (15.7%) under cycloplegia. Prevalence of emmetropia decreased from 37.5% before cycloplegia to 19.8% after cycloplegia while the remaining eyes became hyperopic under cycloplegia. The error committed by using non-cycloplegic versus cycloplegic refractometry in children with mid to dark-brown iris color decreased with older age, and in parallel manner, with more myopic cycloplegic refractive error. Non-cycloplegic refractometric measures lead to a misclassification of refractive error in a significant proportion of children.

239,239,31971950,"Young children with brain tumours are at high risk of developing treatment-related sequelae. We aimed to assess neuropsychological outcomes 5 years after treatment. This cross-sectional study included children under 4 years of age with medulloblastoma (MB) or ependymoma (EP) enrolled in the German brain tumour trials HIT2000 and HIT-REZ2005. Testing was performed using the validated Wuerzburg Intelligence Diagnostics (WUEP-D), which includes Kaufman-Assessment-Battery, Coloured Progressive Matrices, Visual-Motor Integration, finger tapping ""Speed"", and the Continuous Performance Test. Of 104 patients in 47 centres, 72 were eligible for analyses. We assessed whether IQ was impacted by disease extent, disease location, patient age, gender, age at surgery, and treatment (chemotherapy with our without craniospinal irradiation [CSI] or local radiotherapy [LRT]). Median age at surgery was 2.3 years. Testing was performed at a median of 4.9 years after surgery. Patients with infratentorial EPs (treated with LRT) scored highest in fluid intelligence (CPM 100.9±16.9, mean±SD); second best scores were achieved by patients with MB without metastasis treated with chemotherapy alone (CPM 93.9±13.2), followed by patients with supratentorial EPs treated with LRT. In contrast, lowest scores were achieved by patients that received chemotherapy and CSI, which included children with metastasised MB and those with relapsed MB M0 (CPM 71.7±8.0 and 73.2±21.8, respectively). Fine motor skills were reduced in all groups. Multivariable analysis revealed that type of treatment had an impact on IQ, but essentially not age at surgery, time since surgery or gender. Our results confirm previous reports on the detrimental effects of CSI in a larger cohort of children. Comparable IQ scores in children with MB treated only with chemotherapy and in children with EP suggest that this treatment strategy represents an attractive option for children who have a high chance to avoid application of CSI.

The exact cause of glaucoma in SWS is poorly understood and difficult to treat. The purpose of this study is to investigate the ocular hemodynamics of children with SWS-associated glaucoma using color Doppler imaging techniques. This is a prospective study of 10 pediatric patients with unilateral SWS-associated glaucoma. Color Doppler imaging was used to measure the peak systolic velocity and the end diastolic velocity of both the ophthalmic and central retinal arteries in the glaucomatous eye compared to the fellow healthy eye. Twenty eyes of 10 children with SWS (6 boys) with unilateral glaucoma were included in the prospective study. The mean age of the 10 participants was 5.5 years. When compared to their contralateral normal eyes, the glaucomatous eyes had greater CDR (p<0.001) and a myopic shift (p=0.04). No significant differences were found in the measurements of ocular blood flow velocities of the ophthalmic and central retinal arteries. Vascular pathology has been proposed to play a role in SWS glaucoma etiology. The authors did not find arterial retrobulbar blood flow differences between the glaucomatous and the fellow normal eye. Since the primary vascular anomaly in patients with SWS is in the venous plexus, a bigger prospective trial is warranted in order to better understand and treat children with SWS glaucoma.

The cytologist looked for the presence of and the number of oil red O-positive macrophages on tracheal aspirate smears. The specimens were easily assigned grades of absent (grade = 0), low positive (grade 1: 1-25 lipid-laden macrophages), moderate positive (grade 2: 26-50 lipid-laden macrophages), and high positive (grade 3: > 50 lipid-laden macrophages).

The purpose of this investigation was to determine the level of interobserver variability among a large group of Belgian nuclear medicine physicians who evaluated a randomly selected series of DMSA planar scintigraphic examinations performed on children and adults. All Belgian nuclear medicine centers (n = 82) were invited to participate in a reproducibility study on 99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy. 99mTc-DMSA scans obtained on 10 adults and 40 children were randomly selected from the databases of 2 hospitals. Those participating in this investigation (65 centers = 79%) received a series of computer disks containing 50 99mTc-DMSA studies. To avoid potential problems related to unfamiliar display, the disks were formatted to be interpretable using the participants' own computer systems. Each participant was then free to use his or her usual display (hard copies, contrast enhancement, color scale, gray scale, and so forth). For each kidney, the observers had to choose between the following answers: normal, abnormal, equivocal, and lack of quality. Forty-two responses were obtained from a wide variety of institutions and from observers with different levels of experience in interpreting 99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy. Altogether, the following data were obtained: 60.8% normal, 25.2% abnormal, 7.0% equivocal, and 3.2% lack of quality.

This injury can cause dysfunction in both motor and cognitive domains; however, most literature focuses on single-task neuropsychological tests which only assess cognition. Although dual-task research on concussed children and youth is needed as many daily activities require both motor and cognitive domains, we must first investigate whether performing simultaneous motor and cognitive tasks of varied complexity impact these domains in healthy children and youth. Data collected from 106 healthy children and youth (5-18 years) created a normative dataset. Participants performed motor (postural stability) and cognitive (visual attention) tasks under single- and dual-task conditions. The cognitive task difficulty remained constant while the motor task had four conditions of increasing difficulty. The relationship between the number of correct responses (cognitive performance) and sway index (motor performance) was determined using two repeated measures ANOVAs (p<0.05). Dual-task conditions resulted in reduced postural stability, with greater differences on the foam surface (F Postural stability decreased under dual-task conditions, but attention was maintained or improved. Consequently, attention took precedence over postural control when performing tasks concurrently, demonstrating the ability for dual-task methodology to isolate specific processes.

Eczema improved in 49 of 66 (74 per cent) (skin score fall greater than or equal to 3) after stopping cows' milk, eggs and various other foods, with significant decreases in erythema, excoriation, lichenification and extent of eczema. One hundred and ninety-four food challenges were given to 64 patients who had shown objective or subjective improvement. Eczema and associated symptoms were significantly worse after cows' milk and tomato compared with placebo. Egg did not worsen eczema, but 48 per cent of 44 challenges were incomplete, mainly due to hypersensitivity reactions and challenge refusal. The longer a food had been avoided, the less likely was the chance of a positive food reaction. Clinical history did not predict response to dietary manipulation. A standard elimination diet avoiding cows' milk, egg, tomatoes and possibly colours and preservatives should help up to three-quarters of patients, and is easy to implement with the help of a dietician. This diet may be considered in all children with moderate or severe eczema. ",1256,Children with atopic eczema.

We report a case of a 3-year-old boy who had lipoblastoma with massive invasion into the lower lumbosacral spinal canal. A 3-year-old boy had suffered from progressive urinary incontinence and uncontrolled defecation during past 3 months. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans showed that a large lobulated pelvic cavity mass had invaded the lumbosacral spinal canal. The mass was located over the epidural space from L4 to the lower sacral spinal canal, resulting in the compression of the thecal sac. After total laminectomy from L4 to S3 with flavectomy, a subtotal mass removal for the intraspinal canal mass was done. Histopathologic diagnosis confirmed the lipoblastoma. Lipoblastoma is a rare benign neoplasm and lumbosacral invasion is unique. Complete surgical excision is the treatment of choice. If an incomplete surgical excision is performed, close observation and clinical follow-up must be done because a recurrence is possible.

258,258,36364754,"The goal of this work was to examine whether elevated iodine intake was associated with adverse effects on IQ among school-age children in Portugal. In a representative sample of children from the north of the country, IQ percentiles by age (assessed with Raven’s Colored Progressive Matrices) were dichotomized to <50 (“below-average” IQs) and ≥50. Morning urine iodine concentrations, corrected for creatinine, were dichotomized to <250 µg/g and ≥250 µg/g, according to the European Commission/Scientific Committee on Food’s tolerable upper level of daily iodine intake for young children. Data were examined with Chi-square tests, logistic regression, and GLM univariate analysis. The sample (N = 1965) was classified as generally iodine-adequate (median urinary iodine concentration = 129 µg/L; median iodine-to-creatinine ratio = 126 µg/g) according to the WHO’s criteria. A greater proportion of children in the ≥250 µg/g group had below-average IQs, compared to children with less than 250 µg/g (p = 0.037), despite a sizable (though non-significant) proportion of children in the less-than-250 µg/g group also presenting below-average IQs, at the bottom of the iodine distribution (<50 µg/g). The proportion of below-average IQs increased with increasingly elevated iodine concentrations (p = 0.047). The association remained significant after the adjustment for confounders, with the elevated iodine group showing increased odds of having below-average IQs when compared with the non-elevated iodine group (OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.11−2.17; p = 0.011). Consistently, the former group presented a lower mean IQ than the latter (p = 0.006). High iodine intake was associated with lower IQs even in a population classified as iodine-adequate.

259,259,18025926,"Accurate inference of genetic ancestry is critical because common diseases and drug responses can be influenced by genetic factors that vary in frequency or differ altogether among populations. Frequently, clinicians and researchers use popular notions of race to make inferences about a child's genetic ancestry and predict whether he or she carries specific risk factors that influence health. The extent to which race is useful for making such predictions depends on how well race corresponds with genetic inferences of ancestry and whether ancestry is predictive of genotypes associated with risk. Recent studies of human population genetic variation show that while race captures some information about genetic ancestry, particularly in US populations, it often fails to account for admixture and population structure. Ancestry is more accurately inferred by geographical origin or, better yet, explicit genetic data. This is an important result because the genetic variants predicted to underlie common disease are often not common across populations with different ancestry or differ significantly in frequency among such populations. Geographical origin and explicit genetic data are more accurate predictors of ancestry than race. Using such alternatives is an important step toward identifying genetic risk variants for common pediatric diseases and personalizing disease prevention and intervention strategies.

262,262,34172296,"Accreditation standards in medical education require curricular elements dedicated to understanding diversity and addressing inequities in health care. The development and implementation of culturally effective care curricula are crucial to improving health care outcomes, yet these curricular elements are currently limited in residency training. A needs assessment of 125 pediatric residents was conducted that revealed minimal prior culturally effective care instruction. To address identified needs, an integrated, longitudinal equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) curriculum was designed and implemented at a single institution using Kern's Framework. This consisted of approximately 25 h of instruction including monthly didactics and sessions which addressed (1) EDI definitions and history and (2) microaggressions. A mixed methods evaluation was used to assess the curricular elements with quantitative summary of resident session scores and a qualitative component using in-depth content analysis of resident evaluations. Thematic analysis was used to code qualitative responses and identify common attitudes and perceptions about the curricular content. 109/125 (87.2%) residents completed the needs assessment. Over one year, 323 resident evaluations were collected for curricular sessions. Average overall quality rating for sessions was 4.7 (scale 1-5), and 85% of comments included positive feedback. Key themes included lecture topic relevance, adequate time to cover the content, need for screening tools and patient resources, importance of patient case examples to supplement instruction, and novel/ ""eye opening"" content. In addition, several broader institutional impacts of the curriculum were noted such as recognizing the need for comprehensive support for residents of color, corresponding EDI faculty training, and a resident reporting system to identify learning climate issues. The implementation of a comprehensive resident EDI curriculum was feasible earning positive evaluations in its first year, with requests for additional content. It has also spurred multiple institution-wide ripple effects. Suggestions for improvement included more case-based learning, skills practice, and simulation. Future steps include expansion of this EDI curriculum to faculty and examining its impact in resident of color affinity groups.

We found a strong association between the carboxyhemoglobin level and the cherry-pink coloring of livor mortis. In 98.4% of unintentional carbon monoxide-related deaths livor mortis were clearly cherry-pink. During the 10-year study period Viennese coroners recognized only 61% of unintentional carbon monoxide-related deaths immediately at the death scene. The percentage of unrecognized carbon monoxide fatalities with a clear cherry-pink coloring of livor mortis almost doubled from 1984 to 1993. The older the victim, the worse the coroners recognition. In summary, we have shown that coroners should be able to recognize unintentional carbon monoxide-related deaths immediately at the death-scene, because fresh corpses with carboxyhemoglobin levels greater than 31% show a clear cherry-pink coloring of livor mortis. Therefore, coroners should be encouraged to examine naked corpses thoroughly, especially regarding the color of livor mortis.

Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to choose among competing classification schemes. In total 603 lesions (472 naevi and 131 AMs) were included in the study. A scoring system (named BRAAFF) composed of six variables was associated with optimal area under the curve and sensitivity for the diagnosis of AM. This method includes four positive (irregular blotches, ridge pattern, asymmetry of structures and asymmetry of colours) and two negative predictors (furrow pattern and fibrillar pattern). The BRAAFF checklist significantly improves the diagnostic accuracy of dermoscopy for the diagnosis of AM.

Juan Gandulfo, died tragically, at a very young age, in 1931. Juan Gandulfo, remembered in Neruda's memoirs, as the most formidable leader of the Anarchist movement of that time and that engraved in wood the cover and all the illustrations of the first edition of Crepusculario, published in 1923. Neruda qualified these as the ""most impressive engravings made by a man that nobody relates to artistic creation"". Juan Gandulfo, as a medical student, made the color illustrations used to teach biology and histology by Professor Juan Noe. Juan Gandulfo wrote more than one hundred articles in the magazine ""Claridad"", pertaining to the Student Federation of Chile. Juan Gandulfo was consequent with his writings and went to jail twice as a student leader and fought a duel for a woman. Later on, with the same vehemence, he dedicated himself to the care of children in the Arriaran Hospital and to teach general surgery at the San Vicente Hospital, but fate truncated his career at the age of 36.

We examined the use of peripheral blood as a less invasive means of MRD assessment at days 8 and 15 of induction therapy and established the cutoff level that would allow the most accurate prediction of BM MRD postinduction therapy. MRD analysis was performed using 5-color flow cytometry on BM and PB samples from 77 B-ALL patients. BM MRD at diagnosis and day 29 of induction therapy was analyzed using the following antibody combinations: CD45-PC5/CD19-PC7/CD20-PE/CD10-ECD/CD38-FITC/CD13 + CD33-PE/CD10-ECD/CD34-FITC. PB MRD at days 8 and 15 was determined using CD45-PC5/CD19-PC7/CD20-ECD/CD10-PE/CD34-FITC. Day 8 and day 15 PB MRD levels were significantly higher in patients who had persistent BM MRD at day 29. PB MRD <0.01% at day 8 and/or day 15 predicted negative day 29 BM MRD status with 100% sensitivity but poor specificity. ROC curve analysis showed that day 15 PB MRD level of 0.1% yielded the highest sensitivity (78%) and specificity (82%). PB MRD cutoff level of 0.1% at day 15 has the best predictive value in determining positive day 29 BM MRD. ,1273,The significance of peripheral blood minimal residual disease to predict early disease response in patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"Setiadi A, Owen D, Tsang A, Milner R, Vercauteren S.",Int J Lab Hematol. 2016 Oct;38(5):527-34. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12535.

The socioeconomic data to this study were collected at the 48-month follow-up and oral health studies of 1993, 2004 and 2015 Pelotas birth cohort studies. The outcome was untreated dental caries in children aged 6 (1993 cohort), 5 (2004 cohort) and 4 years (2015 cohort), dichotomized into absence/presence. Analyses were stratified by maternal skin colour/race, maternal education and family income. For statistical purposes, the prevalence difference, relative risk and absolute and relative indices of health inequality (Slope Index of Inequality-SII and Concentration Index-CIX) were used. The prevalence of untreated dental caries in primary dentition was 63.4%, 45.5% and 15.6%, in 1993, 2004 and 2015 cohorts, respectively. The prevalence of untreated dental caries was concentrated in the poorest quintile and lower maternal education group in both absolute (SII) and relative (CIX) measures of inequality, being characterized as a pro-poor event. A higher risk of untreated caries was found in the poorest quintile of family income compared with the richest quintile in the 1993 cohort (RR 1.44 [95% CI 1.05; 1.98]). That risk was higher considering the 2004 Cohort (RR 1.78 [95% CI 1.42; 2.23]) and 2015 cohort (RR 4.20 [95% CI 2.97; 5.94]) data.

Also, there are limited objective assessment tools to support the diagnosis. Thus, in this study, a new electrooculography (EOG) based on visual stimulus tracking to support the diagnosis of ADHD was proposed. Reference stimulus one-to-one tracking numbers (RSOT) and colour game detection (CGD) were applied to 53 medication-free children with ADHD and 36 healthy controls (HCs). Also, the test was applied six months after the treatment to children with ADHD. Parameters obtained during the visual stimulus tracking test were analyzed and Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD) and Hjorth parameters were calculated for all EOG records. The average test success rate was higher in HCs than in children with ADHD. Based on machine learning algorithms, the proposed system can distinguish drug-free ADHD patients from HCs with an 89.13% classification performance and also distinguish drug-free children from treated children with an 80.47% classification performance. The findings showed that the proposed system could be helpful to support the diagnosis of ADHD and the follow-up of the treatment.

276,276,16425650,"Numerous factors are known to affect the academic performance of students. These include prenatal conditions, birth conditions, postnatal events, nutritional, socio-economic factors and environmental factors. This paper examines the nutritional status and its relationship with academic performance of 9-10 years old primary school children recruited randomly in Selangor, Malaysia. A standard self-administered questionnaire was utilized to obtain pertinent information and a face-to-face interview was also conducted with the parents. Results of the academic performances were extracted from the students' report cards. The intellectual performance was assessed using Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices. Physical examination was also conducted on these students by doctors. Overall 1,405 students and 1,317 parents responded to the survey. Of these 83.6% were Malays, 11.6% Indians, and 4.2% Chinese. The majority of them (82.9%) were from urban areas. The female: male ratio was 51:49; mean age was 9.71 years. The mean height and weight were 32.3 kg and 135.2 cm respectively. Their mean BMI was 17.42 kg/cm2, with 0.9% underweight, 76.3% normal BMI, 16.3% overweight, and 6.3% obese. Academic performance was significantly correlated with breast feeding, income and educational level of their parents, BMI, and whether they have been taking breakfast. There was a weak correlation between presence of anaemia and intellectual performance. Improving the socio-economic status of the parents will lend a helping hand in the academic performance of the students. Since breast feeding is associated with better academic and intellectual performance it must be emphasized, particularly to expectant mothers in the antenatal clinics.

278,278,19875647,"To determine the dependency of straylight on ocular biometry. This prospective study included 518 eyes of 277 volunteers of diverse ethnic backgrounds with healthy eyes of various iris colors. The eyes had retinal straylight tested using a commercial psychophysical device. Ocular axial length and refraction were also measured with an ocular biometer and an autorefractometer, respectively. The measured retinal straylight was validated by comparing data with the age model described in the literature as log(s) = P(1) + log[1 + (age/65)(4)], where P(1) is the logarithm of the average straylight for the eyes of a newborn. The data agreed well with this model, although P(1) was slightly higher (0.931 vs. 0.87). When this model was subtracted from the measured straylight values, a quadratic increase was found in the function of axial length, L: log(s) = 0.931 + log[1 + (age/65)(4)] + (0.01089L(2) - 0.4820L + 5.330). A similar model was defined for the spherical equivalent refraction SE. This corresponds to an increasing amount of straylight for increasing degrees of myopia. No correlation was found with keratometry and corneal astigmatism or with iris color. Retinal straylight increases not only with age, but also with axial length. Further study is needed to identify the cause of this dependency.

279,279,36722564,"The most common complication of circumcision is bleeding. Monitoring bleeding by visual assessment of the diaper can cause errors due to the high absorbency of diapers. The patient may have had significant problems before the visible changes. The amount of liquid that wets the cloth does not necessarily lead to a visual change consistent with the amount, and the nature of the liquid contaminating the diaper may cause difficulties in terms of visual evaluation. Making a decision based on the visual changes in the patient's diaper cannot be considered as reliable. We planned to evaluate the visual changes that are caused by liquids of various volumes and contents that wet the diaper, according to measurable criteria. We aimed to emphasise the importance of the subject in circumcision practices of diapered children. Wetting of diapers with different volumes and variable blood load was performed utilising blood with different haematocrits and fluids. One hundred and sixty different diapers in four groups were moistened utilising the drip method. Visual changes in the soaked diapers were evaluated with the colorimetric method and five different colour criteria. The saturation and lightness values, which indicate the colour value, were obtained by using the numerical equivalents of the three main components, red, green and blue. Analysis was carried out by subjecting statistical evaluation within and between groups. There was a significant difference between the control group and the study group. It was observed that visual changes caused by the moistened cloths with linear increase did not make the same linear interaction. There was not a significant difference between Group II and Group IV, which were soaked with the same amount of blood and different volume of fluid. In Group III, colour saturation changes were found to have a parabolic effect instead of a linear change. In two different analyses of moistened diapers in terms of volume and blood load; it was not determined that the expected linear changes between the groups were not observed. Visual changes in diapers related to volume or blood load effects of fluids may not be compatible with the amount of bleeding. Mistakes may occur when super absorbent wipes are used when determining the amount of bleeding from the use of colour changes in the diaper. Visual changes should not be relied on in bleeding due to circumcision. Rather, vital signs follow-up and measurable laboratory tests should be used as a basis.

288,288,37014804,"This review defines intersectionality, discusses recent studies that use an intersectional framework in adolescent health research, and outlines ways where clinicians can use intersectionality to address health disparities in youth of color through clinical practice, research, and advocacy. Research using an intersectional framework can identify populations at risk for certain disorders or behaviors. Recent studies in adolescent health research using an intersectional lens identified lesbian girls of color as an at-risk population for e-cigarette use, demonstrated lower skin color satisfaction among Black girls of all ages predicted greater binge-eating disorder symptoms, and showed that two-thirds of Latine (gender-neutral term that refers to people with Latin American roots) youth who recently immigrated to the United States experienced at least one traumatic event during their migration journey, putting them at risk for PTSD and other mental health disorders. Intersectionality refers to how multiple social identities intersect to produce a specific experience that reflects overlapping systems of oppression. Diverse youth contain multiple identities that intersect to produce unique experiences and health inequities. Using an intersectional framework acknowledges that youth of color are not homogenous.

289,289,21839473,"To investigate whether abnormal regional white matter architecture in the perisylvian region could be used as an easy and sensitive quantitative method to demonstrate language pathway abnormalities in children with developmental delay (DD). We performed diffusion tensor imaging in 15 DD subjects (age, 61.1 ± 20.9 months) and 15 age-matched typically developing (TD) children (age, 68.4 ± 19.2 months). With diffusion tensor imaging color-coded orientation maps, we quantified the fraction of fibers in the perisylvian region that are oriented in anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) directions, and their ratio (AP/ML) was calculated. The AP/ML ratio was more sensitive than tractography in characterizing perisylvian regional abnormalities in DD children. The AP/ML ratio of the left perisylvian region was significantly lower in DD children compared with TD children (P = .03). The ML component of bilateral perisylvian regions was significantly higher in DD children compared with TD children (P = .01 [left] and P = .004 [right]). No significant difference was found in the AP component in the two groups. A significant negative correlation of the left ML component with Vineland communication skills was observed (r = -0.657, P = .011).

The study included 3 children (ages 5-8 years) who presented with hematemesis. All had mild hepatosplenomegaly and normal liver function. Esophageal varices were demonstrated in all on upper endoscopy. Color and spectral Doppler sonography was performed to assess the hepatic vasculature, including the hepatic veins (HVs), portal vein (PV), hepatic artery (HA), and inferior vena cava (IVC). The HVs were all patent but with ostial occlusion at the point of their communication with the IVC. Complete flow reversal was shown inside the HVs, with blood draining into collateral vessels at the liver surface and paraumbilical vein. In one patient, the paraumbilical vein could be traced to its communication with the right external iliac vein. In all children, the direction of flow in the PV, HA, and IVC was normal. After endoscopic sclerotherapy, all children were shown to be in good general condition and to have normal liver function for a follow-up period of 15-36 months.

The development of simple, inexpensive, and accurate point-of-care (POC) assays represents an important advance for global hematology, one that could facilitate timely and life-saving medical interventions. In this prospective study, Robust Assays for Point-of-care Identification of Disease (RAPID), we simultaneously evaluated a POC immunoassay (Sickle SCAN™) to diagnose SCD and a first-generation POC color-based assay to detect anemia. Performed at Bugando Medical Center in Mwanza, Tanzania, RAPID tested 752 participants (age 1 day to 20 years) in four busy clinical locations. With minimally trained medical staff, the SCD POC assay diagnosed SCD with 98.1% sensitivity and 91.1% specificity. The hemoglobin POC assay had 83.2% sensitivity and 74.5% specificity for detection of severe anemia (Hb ≤ 7 g/dL). Interobserver agreement was excellent for both POC assays (r = 0.95-0.96). Results for the hemoglobin POC assay have informed the second-generation assay design to be more suitable for low-resource settings.

293,293,32955684,"This study evaluated a new light-emitting diode (LED-S) photic stimulator and compared skin electroretinogram (ERG) responses obtained to those evoked by the Grass Instrument stimulator (GP-S). Two sub-studies were combined to evaluate the difference in responses resulting from the LED-S and GP-S stimuli. The first was a photometry study that matched the LED-S stimuli to the GP-S. In the second study, electroretinograms (ERGs) were recorded under scotopic and photopic conditions using stimuli each stimulator. The stimuli were matched photometrically to measurements obtained from the photometer located 30 cm in front of the stimulators. In addition, the ERG responses were recorded from the LED stimulator when photometrically matched to the GP-S blue stimulus presented through a ganzfeld. The amplitudes and time peaks of the resulting ERG a- and b-waves were then measured and compared using paired T-tests. Study 1: The LED-S was matched to the GP-S at various intensity settings measured 30 cm away from the stimulator. Measurement through a ganzfeld full-field stimulator (GFFS) demonstrated that the GP-S had a significant hot spot centrally. Study 2: Photometrically matched ERGs evoked by both stimulators while employing the direct head-on measurements demonstrated multiple similarities. Similarities included component morphology, amplitude and implicit time across the two stimulators, excluding the rod-driven stimulus (GP-S setting employing a blue filter). Differences between the rod-driven ERGs evoked by the GP-S and LED-S while employing head-on photometric measurements were due to the significant difference in intensities between the two stimulators. The GP-S and LED-S evoked similar rod-driven ERG responses when they were matched using the GFFS photometrically matched intensities protocol. A hand-held stimulator is essential when recording ERG's in the practice of paediatric visual electrophysiology. The LED-S can match the GP-S stimulus intensities, making it a potential replacement for the GP-S. In addition, the LED-S has uniform intensity across the surface of the device compared to the GP-S, is silent for standard stimuli and can generate prolonged duration stimuli for the recording of on-off ERGs.

Inclusion of social determinants minimally improved models' predictive performance (operative: 0.834-0.844; longitudinal 0.808-0.811), but significantly improved model discrimination; 10.0% more survivors and 4.8% more mortalities were appropriately risk classified with inclusion. Wide variation in reclassification was observed by site, resulting in changes in the center performance classification category for 2 of 8 centers.

There is a major clinical need to develop computational methods enabling clinicians to translate heterogeneous biomedical images into accurate and quantitative diagnostics. This need is particularly salient with small bowel enteropathies; environmental enteropathy (EE) and celiac disease (CD). We built upon our preliminary analysis by developing an artificial intelligence (AI)-based image analysis platform utilizing deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for these enteropathies. Data for the secondary analysis was obtained from three primary studies at different sites. The image analysis platform for EE and CD was developed using CNNs including one with multizoom architecture. Gradient-weighted class activation mappings (Grad-CAMs) were used to visualize the models' decision-making process for classifying each disease. A team of medical experts simultaneously reviewed the stain color normalized images done for bias reduction and Grad-CAMs to confirm structural preservation and biomedical relevance, respectively. Four hundred and sixty-one high-resolution biopsy images from 150 children were acquired. Median age (interquartile range) was 37.5 (19.0-121.5) months with a roughly equal sex distribution; 77 males (51.3%). ResNet50 and shallow CNN demonstrated 98% and 96% case-detection accuracy, respectively, which increased to 98.3% with an ensemble. Grad-CAMs demonstrated models' ability to learn different microscopic morphological features for EE, CD, and controls. Our AI-based image analysis platform demonstrated high classification accuracy for small bowel enteropathies which was capable of identifying biologically relevant microscopic features and emulating human pathologist decision-making process.

We hypothesized that children with autism who are homozygous for the MTHFR 677 T allele (TT) and, to a lesser extent those with the CT variant, would exhibit more behavioral problems and/or more severe problematic behaviors than homozygous wild-type (CC) individuals because of difficulties in effectively converting 5,10-MTHF to 5-MTHF.

Chi-square tests, logistic regression, and one-way ANOVAs were used to determine whether differences existed among MTHFR genotypes for specific behaviors on the ADI-R and indices for level of functioning. Exploratory results indicated four behaviors from the ADI-R that were more common and problematic (95% CI) among those with at least one copy of the T allele as compared to homozygous wild-type individuals: direct gaze, current complex body movements, a history of self-injurious behavior, and current overactivity (ORs=2.72, 2.33, 2.12, 2.47, respectively).

303,303,23566563,"South African adolescents have high HIV risk, yet few prevention interventions are effective. Parents play a pivotal role in youths' healthy sexual development and may be at risk themselves. We tested whether Let's Talk!, a worksite-based parenting program, improves parent-child communication about HIV and sexual health and parent condom use self-efficacy and behavior. We culturally adapted Let's Talk! in two languages, drawing on formative research and community stakeholder input. We then conducted a small randomized test at a large public worksite in Cape Town, South Africa. The intervention consisted of 5 weekly 2-hour group sessions for parents of youth aged 11-15. Sixty-six parents (64% female) and their 64 adolescents (41% female) completed surveys before and 1-2 weeks post-intervention; surveys assessed comfort with talking about sex, communication about 16 HIV- and sex-related topics, and parents' condom use self-efficacy and behavior. Thirty-four black African (Xhosa language) and 32 coloured (mixed-race; Afrikaans language) parent-child dyads participated. Parents were randomized to intervention (n = 34) and control (n = 32) groups; randomization was stratified by language. Multivariate regressions indicated that the intervention significantly increased parents' comfort with talking to their adolescent about sex, b(SE) = .98(.39), p = .02, and the number of sex- and HIV-related topics discussed with their adolescent, b(SE) = 3.26(1.12), p = .005. Compared with control parents, intervention parents were more likely to discuss new sex- and HIV-related topics not discussed before the intervention, b(SE) = 2.85(.80), p <.001. The intervention significantly increased parents' self-efficacy for condom use, b(SE) = .60(.21), p = .007.

The clinical data of 183 children with newly-diagnosed acute B-ALL and who accepted MRD detection between October 2010 and March 2012 was retrospectively reviewed. According to the detection time and result of MRD, the 183 children were classified into four groups: MRD negative (n=37) and positive (n=18) in the induction chemotherapy and MRD negative (n=113) and positive (n=15) in the maintenance chemotherapy. During both induction and maintenance chemotherapy, the percentage of patients at high and median risk in the MRD positive group was higher than in the MRD positive group (P<0.05). In the maintenance chemotherapy group, the 3- year cumulative incidence of relapse in MRD positive patients was higher than negative patients (P=0.04). The Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis showed that insensitive reaction for prednisone (RR=1.005, 95%CI: 0.864-1.170, P=0.032), bone marrow morphology that did not meet M1 on the 15th day (RR=6.454, 95%CI: 2.191-19.01, P=0.002) and MRD≥0.01% (RR=1.923, 95%CI: 0.750-4.933, P=0.043) were risk factors for relapse in children with B-ALL. The four-color flow cytometry with the antibody panel can distinguish from MRD positive patients from negative patients with B-ALL. The result of MRD detection, as prednisone sensitivity and bone marrow morphology on the 15th day, is also a independent prognostic factor in children with B-ALL.

306,306,22353490,"In Vietnam, efforts are underway to improve latrine use in rural and remote areas with particular focus on increasing coverage of sanitation in schools. However, there is a lack of information on how the school program affects latrine use by schoolchildren and at community level. This paper analyzes sanitation use among schoolchildren in a multi-ethnic area to inform future school-based sanitation promotion programmes. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was applied during a 5 months period in six primary and secondary schools and in the homes of schoolchildren in four different ethnic villages in Northern rural Vietnam. Using a structured questionnaire, 319 children were interviewed face-to-face to collect quantitative data. Qualitative methods included extensive observations at schools and in the homes of 20 children, a single day's diary writings of 234 children, in-depth interviews with children (20), their parents (20) and school staff (10), and focus group discussions with parents (4) and teachers (6), and picture drawing with children (12). All surveyed schools had student latrines. However, the observed schoolchildren most commonly urinated and defecated in the open. Main barriers for latrine use included inadequate number of latrines, limited accessibility to latrines, lack of constant water supply in latrines and lack of latrine maintenance by school management. Programs promoting latrine use for children were not conducted in either schools or communities and were not established as a preferred social norm in such settings. Children perceived existing school latrines as unappealing and expressed a wish to have basic, functional, clean, and colorful school latrines with privacy. The paper shows that the current school based sanitation promotion is insufficient to change sanitation behavior of school children irrespective of their ethnicity. It is important that schools, households and communities work more closely together to increase use and uptake of latrine use among schoolchildren. Also, the contractors of latrine facilities must work more closely with local school management when constructing latrines, including identifying location, design and appropriate systems of water supply. A separate budget needs to be allocated to allow the school to maintain the sanitation infrastructure and keep it hygienic and appealing for users.

The purpose of this paper is to describe his contributions to pediatric otorhinolaryngology. Cerrahiyyetu'l Haniyye consists of three chapters totaling 412 pages, in which there are 191 sections dealing with a wide range of surgical specialties, including pediatric otorhinolaryngologic surgery. Sabuncuoglu explains some of child diseases and their treatment in a whole section, and gives information on the same subject in relevant part of sections. The illustrations he provides are not at a state of the art level with those of his contemporaries, but they bear a great importance considering the attitudes of Islam to the art of painting. For each section, a single, poetic sentence describes in detail the diagnosis, classification and surgical technique. Some authors have claimed that he only translated Ebu Kasim-al Zahravi (Albucasis)'s Al-Tasrif (Textbook of Surgery) and added the illustrations of the surgical techniques. Even if this is accepted, the illustrations are enough to entitle this work as a milestone. Serefeddin Sabuncuoglu describes medical and surgical management pediatric otorhinolaryngologic diseases such as harelip, hypertrophy of adenoids, atresia of external auditory canal, a foreign body in external auditory canal, short frenulum, abscess of head, mass and abscess of neck in children and unpleasant odor in nose in his textbook. Although not recognized and rewarded in his time, Serefeddin Sabuncuoglu was a great surgeon in Turkish medical history. The sections on children in his book are of great importance in pediatric otorhinolaryngology which became a different speciality in the last century.

Prospective collection of language tested data in profound hearing-impaired children. Pediatric CI can potentially be effective to development of practical communication skills and early implantation is more effective. We proposed a set of language tests (assessment package of the language development for Japanese hearing-impaired children; ALADJIN) consisting of communication skills testing (test for question-answer interaction development; TQAID), comprehensive (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised; PVT-R and Standardized Comprehension Test for Abstract Words; SCTAW) and productive vocabulary (Word Fluency Test; WFT), and comprehensive and productive syntax (Syntactic processing Test for Aphasia; STA). Of 638 hearing-impaired children recruited for this study, 282 (44.2%) with >70 dB hearing impairment had undergone CI. After excluding children with low birth weight (<1800 g), those with >11 points on the Pervasive Developmental Disorder ASJ Rating Scale for the test of autistic tendency, and those <2 SD on Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices for the test of non-verbal intelligence, 190 children were subjected to this set of language tests. Sixty children (31.6%) were unilateral CI-only users, 128 (67.4%) were CI-hearing aid (HA) users, and 2 (1.1%) were bilateral CI users. Hearing loss level of CI users was significantly (p<0.01) worse than that of HA-only users. However, the threshold level, maximum speech discrimination score, and speech intelligibility rating in CI users were significantly (p<0.01) better than those in HA-only users. The scores for PVT-R (p<0.01), SCTAW, and WFT in CI users were better than those in HA-only users. STA and TQAID scores in CI-HA users were significantly (p<0.05) better than those in unilateral CI-only users. The high correlation (r=0.52) has been found between the age of CI and maximum speech discrimination score. The scores of speech and language tests in the implanted children before 24 months of age have been better than those in the implanted children after 24 months of age.

Flow patterns across the four valves were examined by pulsed- (PW), continuous-wave (CW) and color Doppler. Regurgitation was detected in 59.7% of the valves. Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) was most commonly found in 32.8% (n=57), pulmonary regurgitation (PR) in 17.2% (n=30), mitral regurgitation (MR) in 8.6% (n=15), and aortic regurgitation (AR) in 1.1% (n=2). The range of peak velocities of the regurgitant flow with CW were as follows: TR:0.98-2.54 m/sec, PR:0.50-1.80 m/sec, MR:0.72-2.30 m/sec, and AR:1.22-1.25 m/sec. The mean peak velocities of the regurgitant flow were similar with CW and PW measurements (p>0.05). The length of the regurgitant flow with color Doppler was less than 1 cm beyond the mitral and aortic valves. It reached up to 1.8 cm behind the pulmonary and 1.83 cm behind the tricuspid valves. Frequency of valvular regurgitation was unchanged with age (p>0.05). Tricuspid regurgitation was more frequent in males (40.9% versus 23.5%; p=0.016).

These inequities have been further underscored by the recent murders of Black Americans by police and a resulting spotlight on racial injustice in the United States. Results Efforts to lessen the spread of the virus, have resulted in changes in pediatric primary and subspecialty service delivery which may affect access for BIPOC communities. BIPOC trainees including those with debt or caregiving responsibilities may be faced with new barriers resulting in delays in completion of their training. Further, clinical, community-based, and translational research has been disrupted by heightened safety precautions and social distancing which may affect BIPOC representation in research downstream. Conclusion In our roles as clinicians, supervisors, trainees, and researchers in primary and subspecialty care as well as in academia, pediatric psychologists have an ethical responsibility to address the disproportionate burden of this pandemic on vulnerable communities and to allocate our time and resources to ensuring health equity now and in the aftermath of COVID-19.

Three patients presented with fever, and respiratory distress following scorpion sting. Their cardiac enzymes were abnormal. Electrocardiogram (ECG) of 3 patients showed features of myocardial strain with ST elevation. Bedside chest X-ray taken in emergency showed marked bilateral infiltrates suggestive of pulmonary oedema. M-mode, two-dimensional colour-flow Doppler echocardiogram showed left ventricular dysfunction. At paediatric intensive care unit admission, they were treated with antivenom, prazosin (0.03 mg/kg/dose), dopamine (15 mcg/kg/ min), dobutamine (10 mcg/kg/min) and nitroprussid (1 mcg/kg/min). Epinephrine (0.1 mcg/kg/ min) were added later. They were hypoxic and dyspnoeic. A slight sedation was induced with ketamine and/or midazolam. Non-invasive pressure support ventilation (NPSV) was delivered via the helmet by means of an intensive care unit ventilator. We evaluated the effect of NPSV delivered by helmet on oxygenation, respiratory rate, haemodynamics, complications and outcome. An improvement of oxygenation was observed within 2 hours of treatment.The helmet was well tolerated by all the children. No complications occurred in the 3 patients. This new approach of delivering NPSV through a helmet allows the successful treatment of cardiogenic pulmonary oedema in children with scorpion sting envenomation, assuring a good tolerance without complications. Future studies are needed before recommending the extensive application of this technique in all cases of cardiogenic pulmonary oedema due to scorpion sting envenomation.

About 100 children were examined from each age category of 11 to 16 years for extrinsic stains, and information on their dietary and oral habits was obtained. A 64.0% prevalence of extrinsic stains was found among the study population (boys =64.5%, girls = 63.4%). The colour of the extrinsic stains ranged from yellow, brown, green, orange, black to red and were mainly due to poor oral hygiene. The extrinsic stains were derived mainly from food consumption and the action of chromogenic bacteria. The high level of extrinsic stains seen in this study is also a reflection of the low utilisation of dental services and subsequently of professional oral prophylaxis among the subjects as 91.5% had never visited a dentist and 94.8% had never had a professional oral prophylaxis. The prevalence of stains seen in the study population is higher than would be expected in adolescents who should be rather self-conscious at that age, the older adolescents even having a significantly higher prevalence of stains than younger adolescents (p < 0.05). No statistical difference in extrinsic stains prevalence was found among the sexes (p = 0.7) or among social classes (p> 0.05). The establishment of a school oral health care programme in the Local Government Area is advocated, as this may be the only source of oral care for these children.

317,317,19933660,"The purpose of our study was to compare chest ultrasound and chest CT in children with complicated pneumonia and parapneumonic effusion. We retrospectively compared chest ultrasound and chest CT in 19 children (nine girls and 10 boys; age range, 8 months-17 years) admitted with complicated pneumonia and parapneumonic effusion between December 2006 and January 2009. Images were evaluated for effusion, loculation, fibrin strands, parenchymal consolidation, necrosis, and abscess. In the subset of patients who underwent surgical management, imaging findings were correlated with operative findings. Eighteen of 19 patients had an effusion on both chest ultrasound and chest CT. The findings of effusion loculation as well as parenchymal consolidation and necrosis or abscess were similar between the two techniques. Chest ultrasound was better able to visualize fibrin strands within the effusions. Of the 14 patients who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopy, five had surgically proven parenchymal abscess or necrosis. Preoperatively, chest ultrasound was able to show parenchymal abscess or necrosis in four patients, whereas chest CT was able to show parenchymal abscess or necrosis in three. In our series, chest ultrasound and chest CT were similar in their ability to detect loculated effusion and lung necrosis or abscess resulting from complicated pneumonia. Chest CT did not provide any additional clinically useful information that was not also seen on chest ultrasound. We suggest that the imaging workup of complicated pediatric pneumonia include chest radiography and chest ultrasound, reserving chest CT for cases in which the chest ultrasound is technically limited or discrepant with the clinical findings.

There is limited literature on the imaging of liver masses in Alagille syndrome. We report the ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearances of incidental benign giant hepatic regenerative nodules in this population. To describe the imaging findings of giant regenerative nodules in patients with Alagille syndrome. A retrospective search of the hospital database was performed to find all cases of hepatic masses in patients with Alagille syndrome during a 10-year period. Imaging, clinical charts, laboratory data and available pathology were reviewed and analyzed and summarized for each patient. Twenty of 45 patients with confirmed Alagille syndrome had imaging studies. Of those, we identified six with giant focal liver masses. All six patients had large central hepatic masses that were remarkably similar on US and MRI, in addition to having features of cirrhosis. In each case, the mass was located in hepatic segment VIII and imaging showed the mass splaying the main portal venous branches at the hepatic hilum, as well as smaller portal and hepatic venous branches coursing through them. On MRI, signal intensity of the mass was isointense to liver on T1-weighted sequences in four of six patients, but hyperintense on T1 in two of six patients. In all six cases, the mass was hypointense on T2- weighted sequences. The mass post-contrast was isointense to adjacent liver in all phases in five the cases. Five out of six patients had pathological correlation demonstrating preserved ductal architecture confirming the final diagnosis of a regenerative nodule. Giant hepatic regenerative nodules with characteristic US and MR features can occur in patients with Alagille syndrome with underlying cirrhosis. Recognizing these lesions as benign giant hepatic regenerative nodules should, thereby, mitigate any need for intervention.

320,320,27110747,"This study was designed to establish preliminary feasibility testing of a set of inherently benign somatosensory stimulus-response tests (to cutaneous and deep stimuli) for bedside or office evaluation of pain disorders in children and adolescents. Associations between, and the relative influence of, cutaneous somatosensory testing (SST) responses, deep SST responses, and psychological factors (depression, pain-related catastrophizing) on pain outcomes (worst pain intensity, pain-related disability) were considered. Sixty participants (6 to 18 y) were recruited from the pediatric chronic pain clinic. SST responses were assessed at the pain site (PS) and control sites to diverse stimuli (static/dynamic touch, punctate pressure, vibration, cool, deep pressure) using Colored Analogue Scales (CAS) with modified anchors. Validated measures of depression, pain-related catastrophizing, and pain-related functional interference were administered. Responses at the PS were more frequently hypersensitive than hyposensitive for all SST measures except vibration. Deep pressure responses were the only statistically significant predictor of worst pain intensity. Depression and pain-related catastrophizing accounted for a statistically significant amount of variance of pain-related disability, over and above that which was accounted for by SST responses. Preliminary feasibility of a set of somatosensory stimulus-response tests for bedside or office evaluation of pain disorders in children and adolescents was established. Deep pressure responses contributed unique information in predicting worst pain intensity but not functional interference. Although cutaneous SST responses at the PSs were frequently abnormal, cutaneous SST responses were not confirmed in this study to have clinical utility, but rather might be centrally mediated epiphenomena.

The immuno-phenotype of the leukemic cells were detected by flow cytometry with two sets of 4-color combinations of antibodies against TdT/CD5/cCD3/HLA-DR(+)CD19(+)CD33 and CD34/CD5/cCD3/HLA-DR(+)CD19(+)CD33 in 32 cases of de novo T-ALL and were compared with the results in 10 normal controls. The antibody combination in regions of the two-parameter plots where the leukemic cells appeared were different from the normal cells was screened as the effective combination which was used to monitor MRD in the bone marrows of the T-ALL children after the inductive treatment. The results indicated that the respective effective frequencies of antibodies against TdT/CD5/cCD3/HLA-DR(+)CD19(+)CD33 and CD34/CD5/cCD3/HLA-DR(+)CD19(+)CD33 were 90.6% and 62.5%. 32 cases of childhood T-ALL were successively screened for antibodies combinations of interest and were identified in 100% (32/32) of these cases. After inductive treatment, the positive rate in 129 times of MRD monitoring was 19.4% (25/129) by flow cytometry and 5.43% (7/129) by FAB morphology. It is concluded that monitoring MRD in patients with T-ALL by flow cytometry with two 4 color combinations of fluorescent antibodies is an quick and effective method.

324,324,7823336,"We conducted this study to determine if color Doppler ultrasonography can identify increased vascularity associated with gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions and to determine if specific diagnoses can be established based on flow patterns. Twenty-five children with acute right lower quadrant pain and discharge diagnoses of inflammatory bowel processes were examined by color Doppler sonography, as an adjunct to routine gray-scale examinations. Final diagnoses included gastroenteritis (10 cases), Crohn's disease (five cases), neutropenic colitis (four cases), peritonitis (four cases), and Yersinia enterocolitis (two cases). The results of color Doppler sonography were considered positive for inflammation if increased vascularity was demonstrated in the bowel mucosa, muscularis layer, or adjacent tissues. A control group of 19 patients was examined. No sonographic abnormalities were identified in any patients in the control group. Diffuse, concentric wall thickening with increased blood flow centrally within the mucosa was seen in Crohn's disease (60%) and Yersinia enterocolitis (100%), whereas wall thickening with increased transmural vascularity was identified in neutropenic colitis (50%) and Crohn's disease (40%). In contrast, in peritonitis color Doppler sonography showed thickened bowel wall and hypervascularity within peripheral bowel wall or in adjacent soft tissues. No demonstrable bowel vascularity was seen in gastroenteritis. Our experience suggests that mucosal or transmural hypervascularity on color Doppler sonography can be seen with several inflammatory bowel processes, but it is nonspecific. However, color Doppler sonography may aid in differentiating primary bowel disease from extrinsic inflammatory conditions, such as peritonitis.

Same-day procedures are becoming prevalent among children in the United States. While studies conducted in different types of healthcare settings show that the physical environment influences healthcare experiences of patients, there is a lack of research on patient and family perceptions of the physical environment of the outpatient centers where such procedures are conducted. This study used ecological momentary assessment to collect patient experience and anxiety data at different points during the patient's journey through an ambulatory surgical center where pediatric gastrointestinal (GI) procedures were performed. Objective and subjective measures of anxiety were collected. A Qualtrics survey asked participants' perceptions about four spaces-waiting, preprocedure, procedure, and recovery. Child participants reported liking murals, double chairs, patient beds, wall color, and access to a television. They disliked medical equipment and lack of child-friendly furniture. Most parents liked the murals, access to a television, and nature photos, while disliking the lack of privacy, lack of toys in waiting areas, and lack of child-friendly furniture. On average, both children and parents experienced the highest anxiety levels before and during the procedure and the lowest during recovery. Between the four spaces, no significant differences were observed in the heart rate variability and skin conductance responses for both groups.

329,329,11112814,"Ultrasonography (US) is of value in the evaluation and characterization of breast masses in children. Most masses represent either normal breast tissue, cysts, or fibroadenomas. Premature thelarche may be unilateral, and normal breast tissue is found at US. Cysts are commonly retroareolar; when they become infected, they appear sonographically as a complex mass. Fibroadenoma is the most frequent breast tumor in adolescent girls, and it is usually solitary, homogeneous, and hypoechoic. Malignant breast lesions are very rare in children; most are due to metastatic disease secondary to rhabdomyosarcoma, leukemia, lymphoma, and neuroblastoma, and their US appearance is nonspecific. Gynecomastia in boys can be mimicked by general obesity and pectoral hypertrophy; US is helpful in the diagnosis, especially when gynecomastia is asymmetric. Most breast lesions in children and adolescents are benign, and surgery should be avoided to prevent later deformity. US is the ideal imaging modality to evaluate breast lesions and may be used to guide a fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Color Doppler US evaluation is helpful; cysts are avascular, fibroadenomas may be avascular or hypovascular, and abscesses show peripheral increased flow.

332,332,38149216,"It is often a challenge for a child to communicate their pain, and their possibilities to do so should be strengthened in healthcare settings. Digital self-assessment provides a potential solution for person-centered care in pain management and promotes child participation when a child is ill. A child's perception of pain assessment differs when it is assessed using digital or analog formats. As we move into the digital era, there is an urgent need to validate digital pain assessment tools, including the newly developed electronic Faces Thermometer Scale (eFTS). This study protocol describes three studies with the overall aim to evaluate psychometric properties of the eFTS for assessing pain in children 8-17 years of age. A multi-site project design combining quantitative and qualitative methods will be used for three observational studies. Study 1: 100 Swedish-speaking children will report the level of anticipated pain from vignettes describing painful situations in four levels of pain and a think-aloud method will be used for data collection. Data will be analyzed with phenomenography as well as descriptive and comparative statistics. Study 2: 600 children aged 8-17 years at pediatric and dental settings in Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, and USA will be included. Children will assess their pain intensity due to medical or dental procedures, surgery, or acute pain using three different pain Scales for each time point; the eFTS, the Faces Pain Scale Revised, and the Coloured Analogue Scale. Descriptive and comparative statistics will be used, with subanalysis taking cultural context into consideration. Study 3: A subgroup of 20 children out of these 600 children will be purposely included in an interview to describe experiences of grading their own pain using the eFTS. Qualitative data will be analyzed with content analysis. Our pilot studies showed high level of adherence to the study procedure and rendered only a small revision of background questionnaires. Preliminary analysis indicated that the instruments are adequate to be used by children and that the analysis plan is feasible. A digital pain assessment tool contributes to an increase in pain assessment in pediatric care. The Medical Research Council framework for complex interventions in healthcare supports a thorough development of a new scale. By evaluating psychometric properties in several settings by both qualitative and quantitative methods, the eFTS will become a well-validated tool to strengthen the child's voice within healthcare.

The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the subtype of leaflet fusion, right and noncoronary leaflet (R/N) fusion versus right and left leaflet (R/L) fusion, and the patterns of aortic dilation and valve dysfunction in young patients with bicuspid aortic valves. We performed a retrospective review of 642 patients who presented with bicuspid aortic valves between 1994 and 2014. Of these patients, 210 (33%) had aortic dilation (z score >3) by echocardiogram. For each patient, the most recent study or the last study before intervention was reviewed. Median patient age was 15 years (range, 0 to 40 years) with patients with R/N fusion being younger. The most prevalent subtype was R/N fusion (R/N, n = 114, 54% versus R/L, n = 96, 46%). Dilation of the ascending aorta was seen more often in patients with R/N fusion (R/N, 88% versus R/L, 68%; p = 0.004), whereas the prevalence of dilation of the sinuses of Valsalva was significantly higher in patients with R/L fusion (R/L, 46% versus R/N, 20%; p = 0.01). The magnitude of dilation differed as well. The z value of the sinuses of Valsalva was significantly higher in patients with R/L fusion (R/L, 2.03 versus R/N, 1.2; p = 0.003), whereas the z values of the ascending aorta and sinotubular junction were similar between the groups. Patients with R/N fusion were more likely to have aortic stenosis, and within the R/N group, patients with aortic insufficiency had a greater degree of ascending aorta dilation (p = 0.04). Our study suggests that in young patients with bicuspid aortic valves and aortic dilation, aortic valve morphology may be associated with the patterns of aortic dilation and valve dysfunction. Patients with R/N fusion were more likely to have ascending aorta dilation, whereas patients with R/L fusion were more likely to have dilation of the aortic root. In addition, patients with R/N fusion presented at a younger age and were more likely to have aortic stenosis. Recognition of these differences may eventually be helpful for patient counseling and the planning of follow-up.

Among 919 898 patients, GD diagnosis was more prevalent among youth with an ASD diagnosis compared with youth without an ASD diagnosis (1.1% vs 0.6%), and adjusted regression revealed significantly greater odds of GD diagnosis among youth with an ASD diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio = 3.00, 95% confidence interval: 2.72-3.31). Cooccurring ASD/GD diagnoses were more prevalent among youth whose electronic medical record-reported sex was female and those using private insurance, and less prevalent among youth of color, particularly Black and Asian youth. Results indicate that youth whose electronic medical record-reported sex was female and those using private insurance are more likely, and youth of color are less likely, to have cooccurring ASD/GD diagnoses. This represents an important step toward building services and supports that reduce disparities in access to care and improve outcomes for youth with cooccurring ASD/GD and their families.

335,335,27773359,"Certain pesticides may affect children's neurodevelopment. We assessed whether pesticide exposure was associated with impaired neurobehavioral outcomes in children aged 6-9 years. We conducted a cross-sectional study in 140 children living near banana plantations and plantain farms in the Talamanca County, Costa Rica and assessed their neurobehavioral performance. Exposure was determined by analyzing urinary metabolites of chlorpyrifos (3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol, TCPy), mancozeb (ethylenethiourea, ETU), and pyrethroids (3-phenoxybenzoic acid, 3-PBA). Repeated urine samples were obtained for 36 children. We estimated associations of pesticide concentrations with neurobehavioral outcomes using multivariable linear and logistic regression models. Median (25th-75th percentiles) TCPy, ETU, and 3-PBA concentrations were 1.4 (.7-3.1), 1.2 (.7-3.0), and .8 (.5-1.5) μg/L, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) ranged between .32 and .67. After adjustment for potential confounders, higher urinary TCPy concentrations were associated with poorer working memory in boys (n = 59) (β per 10-fold increase in TCPy concentrations = -7.5, 95% CI: -14.4, -.7); poorer visual motor coordination (β = -1.4, 95% CI: -2.7, -.1); increased prevalence of parent-reported cognitive problems/inattention (adjusted OR per 10-fold increase in urinary concentrations = 5.8, 95% CI: 1.6, 22.9), oppositional disorders (aOR = 3.9, 95% CI: 1.0, 16.0), and ADHD (aOR = 6.8, 95% CI: 1.8, 28.6), and; decreased ability to discriminate colors (aOR = 6.6, 95% CI: 1.6, 30.3; the higher the score the worse). Higher ETU concentrations were associated with poorer verbal learning outcomes (β = -7.0, 95% CI: -12.7, -1.3). Higher 3-PBA concentrations were associated with poorer processing speed scores, particularly in girls (β = -8.8, 95% CI: -16.1, -1.4). Our findings indicate that children living near banana and plantain plantations are exposed to pesticides that may affect their neurodevelopment, which for certain domains may differ between boys and girls.

336,336,28634695,"Assessment of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is vital in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF). The early diastolic intraventricular pressure gradient (IVPG) in the LV plays an important role in diastolic function. IVPG is calculated as the intraventricular pressure difference divided by the LV length, which allows to account for differences in LV size and therefore calculate IVPG in children. We aimed to investigate the mechanisms of LV diastolic dysfunction by measuring mid-to-apical IVPG as an indicator of the active suction force sucking blood from the left atrium into the LV. We included 38 rTOF patients and 101 healthy controls. The study population was stratified based on age group into children (4-9 years), adolescents (10-15 years), and adults (16-40 years). IVPGs were calculated based on mitral inflow measurements obtained using color M-mode Doppler echocardiography. Although total IVPGs did not differ between rTOF patients and controls, mid-to-apical IVPGs in adolescents and adults were smaller among rTOF patients than among controls (0.15 ± 0.05 vs. 0.21 ± 0.06 mmHg/cm, p < 0.05; 0.09 ± 0.07 vs. 0.17 ± 0.05 mmHg/cm, p < 0.001; respectively). Additionally, only mid-to-apical IVPG correlated linearly with peak circumferential strain (ρ = 0.217, p = 0.011), longitudinal strain (ρ = -0.231, p = 0.006), torsion (ρ = -0.200, p = 0.018), and untwisting rate in early diastole (ρ = -0.233, p = 0.006). In rTOF, the mechanisms underlying diastolic dysfunction involve reduced active suction force, which correlates with reduced LV deformation in all directions.

337,337,37067808,"Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in children is a low-incidence, high-risk event associated with cognitive overload and potential errors producing unfavourable outcomes. Cognitive aids, such as charts, algorithms and flow diagrams, are prompts that externalise and structure mental processes to reduce cognitive load, thereby reducing errors. The Paediatric Anaesthetic Emergency Drug Solution (PAEDS) approach combines a colour-coded chart and medication box with a simplified mathematical system of volume-based dosing; the effect of which on cognitive load during a simulated RSI has not previously been described. A randomised, cross-over trial was conducted with 26 multi-disciplinary emergency medicine clinicians (doctors and nurses) allocated to four groups, performing four high-fidelity RSI simulations, two mandating the use of the PAEDS approach. This mixed methods study followed the pragmatic ontology using grounded theory methodology. Qualitative data were collected from nine individual interviews by a process of thematic analysis via an inductive approach, to allow for appropriate open and axial coding to occur. Quantitative data collected included cognitive loading using the raw NASA-Task Load Index as well as time to intubation and drug dosage details to assess for safety. Qualitative results showed that the PAEDS approach reduced cognitive loading through the use of both the labelled medication box and colour-coded medication charts. The PAEDS approach also showed improved perceived time pressure without feeling rushed, and with no recorded drug errors. Differences in the quantitative data for total cognitive load, error and time were not statistically significant, likely due to sample size. The PAEDS approach is a multifaceted system which is not inferior to current practice, with some components described as an improvement. Further research on a larger sample size needs to be conducted to assess the aspects of the PAEDS approach both collectively and independently.

342,342,18294820,"The pathophysiology of pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) impacts both affective and cognitive brain systems. Understanding disturbances in the neural circuits subserving these abilities is critical for characterizing developmental aberrations associated with the disorder and developing improved treatments. Our objective is to use functional neuroimaging with pediatric bipolar disorder patients employing a task that probes the functional integrity of attentional control and affect processing. Ten euthymic unmedicated pediatric bipolar patients and healthy controls matched for age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, and IQ were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging. In a pediatric color word matching paradigm, subjects were asked to match the color of a word with one of two colored circles below. Words had a positive, negative or neutral emotional valence, and were presented in 30-s blocks. In the negative affect condition, relative to the neutral condition, patients with bipolar disorder demonstrated greater activation of bilateral pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and left amygdala, and less activation in right rostral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dorsolateral PFC at the junction of the middle frontal and inferior frontal gyri. In the positive affect condition, there was no reduced activation of PFC or increased amygdala activation. The pattern of reduced activation of ventrolateral PFC and greater amygdala activation in bipolar children in response to negative stimuli suggests both disinhibition of emotional reactivity in the limbic system and reduced function in PFC systems that regulate those responses. Higher cortical cognitive areas such as the dorsolateral PFC may also be adversely affected by exaggerated emotional responsivity to negative emotions. This pattern of functional alteration in affective and cognitive circuitry may contribute to the reduced capacity for affect regulation and behavioral self-control in pediatric bipolar disorder.

Previous South African studies have examined hunger at the sub-national level without a specific focus on children and adolescents. This study determines the national prevalence of childhood food insecurity, from birth to adolescence, and identifies factors associated with hunger within the household. Individual and household-level data were extracted from the South African National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (SANHANES-1). Prevalence of food insecurity was assessed using the Community Childhood Hunger Identification Project (CCHIP) index. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted on all households (with and without children) to determine the predictors of food insecurity, with additional analyses adjusting for child dependency and sociodemographic characteristics of household heads in households with children. Of 5 098 households surveyed, 68.6% had children and adolescents present (0-19 years). Of these households, 32.5% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 29.5-35.7) were experiencing hunger and 26.3% (95% CI: 23.9-28.8) were at risk of hunger. Among all the households, significant associations for experiencing hunger were the presence of children and adolescents: Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 1.68 (95% CI: 1.12-2.53); being female-headed: AOR = 1.53 (95% CI: 1.21-1.94) and informally-located; AOR = 1.6 (95% CI: 1.07-2.43).

Receiving social grants, pensions, or remittances more than doubled the odds of experiencing hunger; AOR = 2.15 (95% CI: 1.49-3.09). After adjusting for child dependency in households with children, having at least one older child (age 15-19 years old) did not change the odds of food insecurity. In summary, only 41% of South African households with children and adolescents were food secure. The associations between household head sociodemographics, household location and size on household food insecurity indicate a need for multi-sectoral interventions to bolster sustainable food systems for households with children and adolescents and to improve public protections for female-headed, African-headed and informally-located households dependent on social grants.

Ten comparative studies were included with a total of 419 children. A meta-analysis was not performed due to the considerable heterogeneity across studies. Some evidence showed that beta-blockers are superior to steroids in reducing volume and improving the overall appearance of IHs, such as lightening of the color and flattening of the surface. Conclusions regarding improved eye function and adverse events were divided, and no consensus has been reached on the superiority of one treatment over another. No episodes of severe-onset asthma, hypotension, or bradycardia occurred in the beta-blocker treatment due to the rigorous exclusion of patients with contraindications. Available studies indicate that beta-blockers are an alternative option to corticosteroids for IH treatment with respect to volume shrinkage and improvement in appearance.

To compare the morphological characteristics of the nailfold capillaries in different rheumatology patient groups and controls. A colour digital video camera attached to a stereomicroscope was used to capture nailfold capillary images. Computerised image processing was used to analyse and store data. Subsequent quantitative and qualitative morphological analysis was performed in the following paediatric patient and control groups: 18 children with connective tissue diseases (CTD: juvenile dermatomyositis, systemic sclerosis, and undifferentiated connective tissue disease), eight with systemic lupus erythematosus, nine with primary Raynaud's disease, three with primary vasculitis, 15 with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 17 healthy children and 20 healthy adults. Images were analysed by a single assessor who was unaware of the patient details. The NFC technique was simple to perform and gave reproducible results, although some intra- and intersubject variation was noted. Capillary density and width was age related, with younger children having fewer and wider capillaries than older children and adults. Linear capillary density was significantly higher in healthy adults (mean (SD) 8.6 (1.6) capillaries/mm) compared with healthy children (HC 6.9 (0.9) capillaries/mm). The group with CTD had the most abnormal findings, with lower linear density (4.9 (1.7) capillaries/mm) and increased capillary loop width (10.7 (7.3) mm) compared with HC (3.5 (1.7) mm). In addition, 11/18 (61%) patients in the CTD group had more than two definitely abnormal capillaries in at least two nailfolds, an abnormality not seen in other subjects. Two qualitative measures, the degree of avascularity and general disarrangement of capillary pattern, were more commonly observed in the CTD group than in HC. The proportion of tortuous capillaries did not differ significantly between study groups. This study is unique in measuring objective quantitative and qualitative parameters of the nailfold vasculature across a wide spectrum of age and disease.

For this purpose labial salivary glands under local anesthesia were excised from the lower lip of ten diabetic children at the onset of diabetes (mean age, 10 years). Additionally ten similar biopsies were obtained from ten healthy children (mean age, 9 years). The tissues were conventionally processed and embedded in paraffin wax. The first section was stained with hematoxylin/eosin, while two additional sections were stained immunohistochemically using the indirect immunoperoxidase avidin-biotin method to detect T and B lymphocytes. The results showed that a mononuclear infiltration was apparent in all diabetic children. Lymphocytes were particularly seen around various ducts. In contrast, the salivary glands of healthy controls were free of infiltrates. The immunohistochemical analysis showed that the majority of these cells were T cells. B cells were found to a lesser extent. These findings indicate that a destruction of labial salivary glands takes place in type I diabetes. This phenomenon is T-cell mediated.

One-hundred one of 1,510 consecutive admissions (6.7%) during the study period underwent quantitative electroencephalography monitoring. Status epilepticus (35%) and suspected hypoxic-ischemic injury (32%) were the most common indications for quantitative electroencephalography. Electrographic seizure was diagnosed by the neurophysiologist in 12% (n = 12) of the cohort. PICU clinicians correctly diagnosed all 12 patients (100% sensitivity and negative predictive value). An additional eleven patients had a false-positive diagnosis of electrographic seizure (false-positive rate = 52% [31-73%]) leading to a specificity of 88% (79-94%).

This study evaluates echocardiography (two-dimensional, pulsed Doppler, and color flow mapping) as a method to establish the diagnosis of ALC. To diagnose ALC, a modified parasternal short-axis view was used to demonstrate continuity of the ALC with the pulmonary trunk and to detect the retrograde flow through the ALC into the pulmonary trunk. Absence of these imaging characteristics ruled out ALC. From June 1985 to January 1990, 16 patients who presented with or had previously had a dilated poorly contracting left ventricle were prospectively assessed by echocardiography to rule out ALC. Four patients had ALC (age 2 to 120 months, mean +/- 1SD = 32 +/- 59) and 12 patients (age 1 to 192 months, mean +/- 1SD = 57 +/- 80) had myocardiopathy.

363,363,23800185,"Visual clinical methods of skin color evaluation for diagnostic purposes are so far mostly subjective and thus inaccurate. We present a modified method of melanin amount measurement based on diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). This method is non-invasive and objective, and allows easy quantification and comparison of melanin levels. Skin pigmentation was measured by DRS method in 0-18 year old patients at the Department of Pediatric Dermatovenerology, School of Medicine Comenius University Bratislava. Patients were treated for their vitiligo by Balneo PUVA treatment twice weekly. Each patient had measured his remittance spectra from the treated vitiliginous skin before the treatment was started, after 10 irradiations of Balneo PUVA and at the end of the treatment after 25 irradiations of Balneo PUVA. In our study as a reference skin for spectroscopic assessment of melanin in vivo was used the averaged remittance spectra (measured on the inner arm) from the sample of 10 albino patients. The remittance spectra obtained from the vitiligo patients were ratioed against the newly described remittance reference albino skin. We exploited the linear behavior of the spectral curve in the 620-720 nm interval (significant for melanin absorption) and used the slope of the regression line to compute the quantification index α. By clinical examination before the Balneo PUVA therapy, after the 10th dose of Balneo PUVA therapy as well as at the end of the complete course of Balneo PUVA therapy (after 25 irradiations) we recorded a marked increase of pigmentation in all treated patients for their vitiligo. In each patient the values of melanin quantification angle α were calculated. Statistically we found a significant difference between the melanin quantification angle α in vitiliginous skin before, during the 10th dose of treatment and after the treatment. Similar significant difference was also observed between treated and non-involved skin. We could confirm a clear association between clinical visual examination of treated vitiligo lesions, objective data collected by DRS and melanin quantification angle α. By using a new standard for the reference skin (albino skin) we could more exactly compare melanin levels in different subjects. Our proposed melanin quantification angle α expresses the extent of the difference in melanin levels between the examined skin lesions. We successfully used this index to quantify the variations of melanin (progress of repigmentation) throughout different stages of treatment of the same lesion and also to objectively evaluate the final effect of the therapy. In the present study, we showed that the diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) may be suitable method to measure skin colour and the content of human skin melanin in vivo.

This was a retrospective observational study analyzing cases which underwent an ultrasound examination at the end of the first trimester at the Fetal Medicine and Surgery Unit of Gaslini Children's Hospital, Genoa, Italy, in the period January 2015 to December 2021. The study population included both low-risk pregnancies that underwent standard first-trimester combined screening and high-risk ones referred to our unit because of a positive combined test or suspicion of fetal anomalies raised in a regional community hospital. For each case, the following variables were retrieved and analyzed: number of fetuses, maternal body mass index, gestational age at first-trimester screening, whether the pregnancy was low or high risk, nuchal translucency thickness (normal or > 99 Gestational age at ultrasound ranged from 12 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks (crown-rump length (CRL), 50.1-84.0 mm) in the low-risk group and from 11 + 5 to 13 + 6 weeks (CRL, 45.1-84.0 mm) in the high-risk group. Over the 7-year study period, 7080 pregnancies were evaluated in the first trimester. Of these, 6879 (7167 fetuses) were low-risk and 201 were high-risk cases. In the low-risk group, there were 30 fetuses with CHD (including 15 major and 15 minor CHD), yielding a prevalence of 4.2/1000 (2.1/1000 for major CHD). Nine of the 30 CHD cases were suspected at screening ultrasound (7/15 major CHD). Excluding cases in which the CHD would not be expected to be associated with a modification of the screening views and would therefore not be detectable on screening ultrasound, 7/12 cases of major CHD were detected, corresponding to a sensitivity of 58.3%. Among the 201 high-risk cases, there were 46 fetuses with CHD (including 44 major and two minor CHD), of which 43 were detected, corresponding to a sensitivity for early fetal echocardiography of 93.5%, or 97.7% if the two cases that were unlikely to be detectable on first-trimester screening were excluded. Analysis of the 11 (of 24) false-negative cases that would be expected to be picked up on screening views revealed that human error (image interpretation and/or scanning approach) was involved in all 11 cases and technical factors (excessive color priority (color-balance function) and/or incorrect plane alignment) were present in two. There was impairment of the acoustic window (associated with maternal obesity and/or twin gestation) as a cofactor in five of the 11 cases. The sensitivity for detection of major CHD of early cardiac screening in low-risk pregnancy is under 60%, partly due to the natural history of CHD and, it seems, partly relating to human error and technical issues with image quality. Factors associated with false-negative diagnoses may be categorized into three types: human error, technical factors and acoustic-window impairment. We recommend: appropriate assessment with fetal posterior spine; that sufficient time is spent on assessment of the fetal situs; and that color/power Doppler settings are adapted to the individual case. A lower threshold for referring doubtful cases for early fetal echocardiography should be adopted in cases of maternal obesity and in twin gestation. © 2022 The Authors.

Application of these techniques can enhance the diagnosis of organ injury, viable tumor, and vascular pathologies at bedside. This has significant clinical implications in pediatric patients who are not easy candidates for lengthy MRI or radiation-requiring examination, and are also in need of a highly sensitive bedside technique for therapeutic guidance. To best use the currently available, advanced ultrasound techniques for pediatric patients, it is necessary to understand the diagnostic utility of each technique. In this review, we will educate the readers of emerging ultrasound techniques and their respective clinical applications.

368,368,38619154,"Layla is a 6.7-year-old girl diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-predominantly hyperactive/impulsive type-delayed adaptive skills, enuresis, unspecified malnutrition, and feeding difficulties. She presented to developmental-behavioral pediatrics (DBP) in January 2022 due to caregiver concerns for autism spectrum disorder (ASD).Layla lives in a polyamorous family with her biological mother and father, mother's partner whom Layla refers to as her uncle, and her 2 half-siblings. There is a maternal history of special education services, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, multiple sclerosis, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and ADHD. Layla's father is a veteran diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Layla's siblings, aged 5 and 9 years, have established diagnoses of ADHD, ASD, global developmental delays, behavioral concerns, and poor sleep. There is a history of adverse childhood experiences, including parental mental health, poverty, and involvement with child protective services. Acknowledgement and inclusion of all members of this diverse family structure, as well as consistent validation from the DBP and social worker, allowed a strong treatment alliance to form and the mother continued to contact the DBP clinic, even for those questions related to other specialties. A social worker received weekly calls from the mother sharing grievances related to feeling misunderstood and spoke about the assumptions she felt external providers made about her family, culture, and parenting styles. For example, she recalls the pediatrician commenting about their family structure being ""confusing for the children"" and describing their home as ""chaotic,"" assumptions that may not have been made of nuclear family structures. Behavioral therapies were a repeated recommendation, but the mother verbalized not being interested in these options as she had participated in parent management training several years earlier and felt that the strategies taught were not applicable to her unique family structure, to which the clinician replied, ""this is the standard recommendation for all children this age with disruptive behaviors."" Although the mother was initially hesitant to trial medications, she eventually agreed that Layla's symptoms were negatively affecting her school performance, and the DBP initiated a stimulant medication.Layla's initial evaluation included a developmental history, behavioral observations, and standardized testing. The results from developmental testing demonstrated age equivalents between 4 and 6 years across gross motor, adaptive, visual motor, and speech-language domains.On observation, Layla was extremely active. During the visit, she walked over to her mother, made eye contact, and showed her the picture that she had drawn. She engaged in imaginary play, reciprocal conversation, and responded to social bids. The mother felt strongly that Layla had ASD and reported symptoms such as motor stereotypies (hand flapping), covering ears with certain noises/sounds, and rigidity when it came to things being a certain way or a certain color. These behaviors did not occur in the initial or subsequent clinic visits with DBP, her general pediatrician, or during other outside evaluations the mother pursued. The DBP felt strongly that Layla was mimicking her siblings' symptoms and provided ongoing education regarding ADHD symptomology.In terms of behavior management, the mother did not attempt to redirect Layla's behaviors during the initial clinic visit and in subsequent visits, and both adult men yelled loudly, clapped, and hit their hands on the table as a form of redirection. The mother continued to voice her diagnostic disagreement with the DBP and the pediatrician and insisted that Layla met the criteria for ASD. When the mother reviewed the report, a statement insinuating that Layla's behaviors were ""understandable given parental inconsistency and complicated family structure"" upset her.What factors would you consider when thinking about caregiver disagreement with the diagnosis and treatment plan? Does diagnostic overshadowing apply here?

To systematically review the literature regarding precision and accuracy of history taking and physical examination in diagnosing AOM in children. We searched MEDLINE for English-language articles published from 1966 through May 2002. Bibliographies of retrieved articles and textbooks were also searched. We located studies with original data on the precision or accuracy of history or physical examination for AOM in children. Of 397 references initially identified, 6 met inclusion criteria for analysis. Two authors independently reviewed and abstracted data to calculate likelihood ratios (LRs) for symptoms and signs. Four studies of symptoms used clinical diagnosis as the criterion standard and were limited by incorporation bias. Ear pain is the most useful symptom (positive LRs, 3.0-7.3); fever, upper respiratory tract symptoms, and irritability are less useful. One study of clinical signs used tympanocentesis as the criterion standard, and we adjusted the results to correct for verification bias. A cloudy (adjusted LR, 34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 28-42), bulging (adjusted LR, 51; 95% CI, 36-73), or distinctly immobile (adjusted LR, 31; 95% CI, 26-37) tympanic membrane on pneumatic otoscopy are the most useful signs for detecting AOM. A distinctly red tympanic membrane is also helpful (adjusted LR, 8.4; 95% CI, 6.7-11) whereas a normal color makes AOM much less likely (adjusted LR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.19-0.21). Although many of the studies included in this analysis are limited by bias, a cloudy, bulging, or clearly immobile tympanic membrane is most helpful for detecting AOM. The degree of erythema may also be useful since a normal color makes otitis media unlikely whereas a distinctly red tympanic membrane increases the likelihood significantly.

370,370,33334921,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on the health of people globally. Yet, not all people are being affected by this crisis equally. In the United States, this pandemic has exacerbated long-standing inequities and entrenched structural racism. At the onset of the crisis, few data were available detailing the demographic characteristics of individuals with COVID-19. However, as data emerged, it became apparent that communities of color were disproportionately affected. To illustrate these inequities, we analyzed publicly available race and ethnicity data on COVID-19 cases and deaths and were one of the first groups to compile these findings. We launched a social media campaign to highlight these racial and ethnic inequities and raise awareness among public and elected officials. Given the tremendous amount of missing data, we demanded transparency in state reporting of race and ethnicity data. Using both messaging and mapping tools, we publicized state and city efforts to address these inequities, focusing on the creation of task forces tackling the racial inequities of COVID-19. As racial and ethnic data on COVID-19 cases and mortality became more widely reported, statistics emerged about the downstream effects of these inequities. Despite initial false reassurance that COVID-19 largely spared children, the pandemic has exacerbated many social needs, leading to significant negative impacts on children. For example, as pediatricians, we saw how worsening food insecurity was affecting children. Using social media and infographics, we launched an additional stage of the campaign to illustrate these inequities and highlight advocacy opportunities.

However, many studies have relied on predominately White samples, and on brief symptom screening measures which may not fully capture the experiences of individuals of color (who are disproportionately affected by poverty in the United States.) The present study examines prevalence rates of probable major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use disorder, and alcohol use disorder in a predominately Black sample that grew up in urban poverty, utilizing structured neuropsychiatric interview methods. Data are drawn from a subsample of the Chicago Longitudinal Study (CLS), which has followed a large cohort for over four decades. Outcomes were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) 7.0.2. Results indicate high probable rates of all measured outcomes, with notably high rates of substance use and alcohol use disorder compared to rates reported in previous national studies. Differences by sex and childhood neighborhood poverty, as well as significant comorbidity among psychiatric, substance and alcohol use disorders were also detected. Findings underscore an urgent need for community-based, culturally tailored prevention and intervention initiatives to support the mental health of individuals living in poverty. The high prevalence of psychiatric, substance and alcohol use disorders in this study likely reflect systematic inequities faced by low-income people of color in the United States.

Several epidemiological studies have reported an increased risk for childhood brain tumours (CBT) associated with exposure to N-nitroso compounds (NOC). Hair-colouring products (hair ""dyes"") that contain NOC-related aromatic amines have shown mutagenicity in vitro and carcinogenic properties in vivo. The potential public health impact of the relationship between hair dye use and carcinogenesis has prompted epidemiological research, given that a large proportion of American women have used hair dyes. A large population-based case-control study was conducted on the west coast of the USA to investigate risk factors for CBT including exposure to NOC. Eligible CBT patients (<20 years of age and diagnosed between 1984 and 1991) were identified from cancer registries in Los Angeles County, the San Francisco Bay Area in California and the Seattle area in Washington state. A total of 540 biological mothers of these children were interviewed, and 801 control subjects who were frequency matched to the CBT patients on birth year and sex were obtained using random digit dialling. Mothers were asked details about personal use of hair dyes during the index pregnancy including frequency of use, trimester of use and type of dye used. Results from age- and sex-adjusted unconditional logistic regression analyses showed no association between risk for CBT and use of hair dyes 1 month before and/or during pregnancy nor during specific trimesters. A nearly twofold increased risk for CBT was associated with single-interval use during the 1 month before pregnancy, but the confidence interval (CI) was imprecise and the estimate was not different from unity (OR = 1.9, 95% CI [0.5, 7.0]).

Exclusive use of semi-permanent dye during the month before pregnancy and/or first trimester also was associated with an elevated risk for CBT, again not different from unity and with an imprecise CI (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = [0.58, 10.3]).

The validated color histogram mode technique was utilized to quantify primary malacia lesions and airway sites' CSA. Illness frequency, validated scales of illness and cough diary scores were prospectively used to assess clinical profiles. Thirty-five malacia sites were defined from the 2 studies of 21 children. CSA of 21 (60%) of the malacia lesions increased, 5 (14%) new lesions appeared, 5 (14%) decreased in size, 3 (8%) remained unchanged, and 1(3%) was indeterminate. Overall there was no statistically significant change in paired-data assessments of malacia sites' area while there was a significant increase in area of non-malacia sites. The median yearly growth rate for the malacia sites and non-malacia was 3.65 mm2/year sites and 5.38 mm2/year, respectively (P = 0.31). The type and severity of lesion was not associated with any difference in growth rates, illness frequency or clinical scores. Malacia lesions increase in size at the same rate as non-malacia sites.

384,384,38394179,"This systematic review aimed to establish the extent to which each Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptom criterion is being assessed without being influenced (biased) by factors such as informant, sex/gender, and age. Measurement invariance (MI) testing using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is the prime statistical method to ascertain how these factors may affect the measurement and colour the perception or interpretation of symptom criteria. Such effects (non-invariance) can be operationalised in the form of altered association of a symptom criterion with the measured trait (expressed via variations in CFA loadings which represent the weight of each symptom criterion) due to the factor(s) and/or artificially alter the probability of endorsement of a particular symptom criterion (expressed via variations in the CFA threshold(s) representing how mild or severe a given symptom is). Based on a pre-registered protocol (CRD42022276105), we searched PubMed, Global Health, Embase and PsycInfo up to 21-02-23 for studies that included MI assessments on specific ADHD symptom criteria in individuals aged 0-18 years old, using parental and/or teacher report. Self-reports were excluded, given the poor reliability of self-report in ADHD. All included studies met specific COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) criteria. Results were synthesised in tabular form, grouping results by factors (e.g. informant) from 44 studies retained. Most comparisons indicated both metric (same loadings) and scalar invariance (same thresholds) with regard to informant, gender, age, temporal (repeated assessments) and co-morbidity. Therefore, the available evidence supports the current diagnostic criteria. However, findings could have been improved by systematic reporting of the direction of bias and its effect size. There appears to be a bias towards reporting MI instead of non-invariance. More studies in the literature are needed where the amalgamation of information provided by different informs and the association of specific symptoms with comorbidity are analysed.

386,386,32896906,Infantile hemangiomas (IHs) are the most common benign tumors in children. Color Doppler ultrasound is a noninvasive imaging modality that can show subclinical anatomic parameters in a wide range of dermatologic conditions. The purpose of this study was to describe the ultrasound characteristics of IHs and look for subclinical features with the potential to influence the involution and therapeutic response. A review of the ultrasound database of children with clinical and ultrasound IH diagnoses was conducted. The clinically reported duration and the ultrasound assessment of the proliferative phase were compared. Descriptive and statistical analyses of qualitative and quantitative parameters of the series were performed. Significance was set at P < .05. A total of 204 IHs were included. Twenty percent had arteriovenous shunts; 15% had afferent branches from main regional arteries; and almost 30% showed involvement of deep structures. Sixty-one percent of IHs were in the head and neck. Deep hemangiomas showed significantly thicker lesional vessels. A prolonged proliferative stage was significantly associated with a higher presence of arteriovenous shunts and a higher peak systolic velocity of the arterial vessels (≥15 cm/s) within the lesions. Color Doppler ultrasound can support the detection of subclinical anatomic features that may potentially influence the involution and response to treatment of IHs. Some of these characteristics may serve as potential markers to predict and manage IHs in prolonged proliferative stages. ,1386,Subclinical Ultrasound Characteristics of Infantile Hemangiomas That May Potentially Affect Involution,"McNab M, García C, Tabak D, Aranibar L, Castro A, Wortsman X.",J Ultrasound Med. 2021 Jun;40(6):1125-1130. doi: 10.1002/jum.15489.

394,394,37598395,"Beeswax is a naturally occurring product that worker bees produce. Beeswax is used in a variety of industries and pharmaceuticals. Humans utilize it extensively in cosmetics, medicinal formulations, and food manufacturing. Beeswax is an essential component of advanced contemporary beekeeping. Beekeepers, in particular, utilize significant amounts of beeswax to make beeswax comb foundation. In its natural condition, beeswax is white, but it becomes yellow then dark in color when it comes into touch with honey and pollen. The ongoing use of wax comb in bee activities (such as brood rearing, storage honey and bee bread), combined with environmental factors such as heavy metal and pesticide residues, resulted in a black color. Because of heavy metals can accumulate in wax for decades, beeswax can be a helpful tool for gathering data on hazardous contaminants in the environment. Because of their lipid-based chemical composition, beeswax combs act as a sink for numerous ambient pollutants as well as poisons when in the hive. The current study aims to measure nine heavy metals and important elements, including iron (Fe), chromium (Cr), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and cobalt (Co) in beeswax collected in the Behaira governorate region of Egypt between 2018 and 2022. Sample collection was conducted each year in triplicate. The samples were analyzed using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The quantity of metals in beeswax at different ages differed significantly. Depending on the wax age, Fe has the highest concentration in the range of 2.068 to 5.041 ppm, while Cd has the lowest ratio at 0.024 to 0.054 ppm from the first to fifth years old of comb age.

MATERIAL AND METHODS An observational study was conducted in a public school in the Andes region of Ecuador (August-November 2019). Twenty-five children, males and females, age 5-15 years were assessed by complete physical examination, digital dermoscopic photographs, and punch biopsies. Descriptive statistics and Fisher's exact test were used to summarize and analyze the data. RESULTS We included 17 (68%) boys and 8 (32%) girls with a mean age of 9.8±2.0 years. Clinical lips findings reported desquamation [52% Upper Lip (UL); 40% Lower Lip (LL)], fissuring (8% UL; 8% LL), scabs (8% UL; 8% LL), and discoloration (40% UL; 20% LL).

400,400,33302860,"Vitiligo is a relatively common acquired pigmentation disorder that can cause significant psychological stress and stigmatism. This article aims to familiarize physicians with the clinical manifestations, evaluation, diagnosis, and management of vitiligo. A Pubmed search was conducted in Clinical Queries using the key term ""vitiligo"". The search included meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, observational studies, and reviews. The search was restricted to English language. The information retrieved from the above search was used in the compilation of the present article. Approximately one quarter of patients with vitiligo have the onset before 10 years of age. Genetic, immunological, neurogenic and environmental factors may have a role to play in the pathogenesis. Vitiligo typically presents as acquired depigmented, well-demarcated macules/patches that appear milk- or chalk-white in color. Lesions tend to increase in number and enlarge centrifugally in size with time. Sites of predilection include the face, followed by the neck, lower limbs, trunk, and upper limbs. The clinical course is generally unpredictable. In children with fair skin, no active treatment is usually necessary other than the use of sunscreens and camouflage cosmetics. If treatment is preferred for cosmesis, topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, and narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy are the mainstays of treatment. The therapeutic effect of all the treatment modalities varies considerably from individual to individual. As such, treatment must be individualized. In general, the best treatment response is seen in younger patients, recent disease onset, darker skin types, and head and neck lesions.

Such three-color analyses provide more information than single- or dual-color analyses. The present study was undertaken in order to establish age-related differences in lymphocyte subpopulations by simultaneously measuring three surface antigens in newborns, children, and adults. A whole blood method was used to label cells with antibodies conjugated to FITC, PE, and perCP. We found that the percentage of lymphocytes expressing HLA-DR/CD28/CD8, HLA-DR/ CD38/CD8, CD95/CD45RO/CD8, CD95/CD45RO/CD4, CD95/CD4, and CD95/CD8 showed relative increases with age. The percentage of lymphocytes expressing CD28/CD8, CD38/CD8, and CD38/CD4 showed relative decreases with age, while the subset HLA-DR/CD38/ CD4 did not change.

We analysed all clear facial photos contained within the textbooks Smith's Recognizable Patterns of Human Malformation and Genetic Diseases of the Eye using F2G under standard lighting conditions. Variables captured include colour versus grey scale photo, the gender of the patient (if known), age of the patient (if known), disease categories, diagnosis as listed in the textbook, and whether the disease has ophthalmic involvement (as described in the textbook entries). Any photos rejected by F2G were excluded. We analysed the data for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity based on disease categories as outlined in Smith's Recognizable Patterns of Malformation. We analysed 353 photos found within two textbooks. The exact book diagnosis was identified by F2G in 150 (42.5%) entries, and was included in the top three differential diagnoses in 191 (54.1%) entries. F2G is highly sensitive for craniosynostosis syndromes (point estimate [PE] 80.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 56.3-94.3%, P = 0.0118) and syndromes with facial defects as a major feature (PE 77.8%, 95% CI 52.4-93.6%, P = 0.0309).

403,403,37065421,"Early childhood caries (ECC) is a chronic but preventable disease affecting young children worldwide. Many young children face access to care barriers to early preventive dental visits for a variety of reasons, which can increase their risk for ECC. Non-dental primary health care providers are well positioned to assist in assessing a child's risk for ECC by performing caries risk assessment (CRA). The purpose of this project was to report on primary health care provider and stakeholder feedback in order to refine a drafted CRA tool for Canadian children <6 years of age intended for use by non-dental primary health care providers. In this mixed methods project, we conducted six focus groups with primarily non-dental primary health care providers followed by a short paper-based survey to quantify preferences and feedback. Data were thematically and descriptively analyzed. Participants' feedback on the drafted CRA tool included the need for it to be relatively quick to complete, easy and practical to score, easy to implement into practitioners' clinic schedules, and to include anticipatory guidance information to share with parents and caregivers. All participants (100%) welcomed a CRA tool. Many (85.4%) liked a layout that could be added to tools they already utilize. Most (73.2%) wanted the tool to be in colour, and many (90.2%) wanted the tool to include pictures. Non-dental primary health care providers informed the final development and layout of the newly released Canadian CRA tool.

To determine the accuracy of pulsed, color, and continuous-wave (CW) Doppler echocardiographic indexes in assessing the degree of AR in children, the correlation between the non-invasive measurements and angiographic grading of the regurgitant flow (1+ to 4+) was examined in 14 children (mean age 11 +/- 3 years) with chronic AR. Forward and reverse flows in the aortic arch were evaluated from the suprasternal notch using pulsed Doppler. Aortic time-velocity integrals (TVI) were measured during systole (forward flow) and diastole (reverse flow), and the ratio of reverse to forward TVI (%) was calculated. Doppler color flow mapping was used to detect and assess the severity of AR (which appears as mosaic turbulent signals extending in the left ventricular outflow tract during diastole) by using four color Doppler grades of severity. The envelope of the flow velocity pattern in diastole was recorded from the CW Doppler signal of AR with the transducer in the lower sternal border to determine the peak flow velocity and deceleration slope (alpha) indexes. The ratio of reverse to forward aortic TVI and color flow mapping grading showed strong correlation with angiographic grade (r=0.92 and r=0.86, respectively) but AR slope (alpha) and peak flow velocity did not correlate well with the angiographic grade (r=-0.039 and r=0.74, respectively). We concluded that the severity of AR in children as determined by angiographic grading can be estimated with reasonable accuracy by noninvasive technique based on color and pulsed wave Doppler. Use of these indexes may obviate the need for angiography to detect the severity of AR in children.

406,406,9610598,"To analyze and identify collagen subtypes in the primary obstructed and refluxing megaureter of childhood. Anticollagen monoclonal antibodies to collagen types I, III, and IV were used in control ureters (n = 4), obstructed (n = 7), and refluxing (n = 13) megaureters. Additionally, all were stained with Masson's trichrome to further define the extracellular matrix. After staining and serial sectioning, representative ureteral sections, focusing on the muscularis and lamina propria regions, were digitized and analyzed with a color image analysis system. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated increases in collagen types I and III for both obstructed and refluxing megaureters compared with controls (P <0.05). Collagen type IV was not detected in statistically significant amounts in any ureter. In control ureters most was type I (83% +/- 9%) collagen. Obstructed megaureters produced similar results with virtually all collagen being type I (84% +/- 26%) with very little type III collagen present, 5.3% +/- 3%. Refluxing megaureters contained only 55% +/- 15% type I collagen. However, there was an increase in type III collagen (16% +/- 4%) versus (4.5% +/- 2%) in controls (P <0.05). These data suggest that the greater contribution of type III collagen may play a role in the pathophysiology of refluxing megaureters. Because type III collagen is a less distensible fiber, it may cause an intrinsically stiffer ureter and play a role in the lower surgical success in the reimplantation of refluxing megaureters.

Since then, publishers of rheumatology educational materials have focused on addressing this shortcoming. This study investigates the change in representation of P-SOC following the review of Strait et al. METHODS: We used the methods of the aforementioned study to collect images from commonly referenced rheumatology educational materials and categorized the skin tones within them as ""light"" or ""dark."" We calculated the proportional change in images depicting dark skin tones between 2020 and 2022 from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Image Library, the 10th edition of Kelley's Textbook of Rheumatology, and New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) as well as between 2020 and 2024 from rheumatology articles within UpToDate. We compared results using one-sided Z-tests. Overall, the proportion of images depicting dark skin tones increased 40.6% (P < 0.0001). The 10th edition of Kelley's Textbook of Rheumatology most significantly increased inclusion of P-SOC (90.1%; P = 0.0039), with ACR Image Library, UpToDate, and NEJM also enhancing representation (41.9%, P < 0.0001; 31.0%, P = 0.0083; 28.2%, P = 0.3046, respectively). This study assesses the progress of rheumatology educational materials toward equitable representation of P-SOC.

410,410,32964824,"Pityriasis rosea is a common acute, self-limited papulosquamous dermatosis that primarily affects children and young adults. The condition and its clinical variants may pose a diagnostic challenge, especially in the absence of the herald patch. This article aimed to familiarize pediatricians with clinical manifestations, evaluation, diagnosis, and management of pityriasis rosea. A search was conducted in March 2020 in Pubmed Clinical Queries using the key term "" pityriasis rosea"". The search strategy included all clinical trials (including open trials, non-randomized controlled trials, and randomized controlled trials), observational studies, and reviews (including narrative reviews and meta-analyses) published within the past 10 years. Only papers published in the English literature were included in this review. The information retrieved from the above search was used in the compilation of the present article. Pityriasis rosea occurs mainly in individuals between 10 and 35 years of age with a peak during adolescence. Human herpesvirus (HHV)-7 and HHV-6 have been implicated as the causative agents in some patients with pityriasis rosea. A mild prodrome consisting of headaches, fever, malaise, fatigue, anorexia, sore throat, enlarged lymph nodes and arthralgia is present in about 5% of patients. The most common presenting sign, found in approximately 80% of patients, is a ""herald"" or ""mother"" patch which is larger and more noticeable than the lesions of the later eruption. A generalized, bilateral, symmetrical eruption develops in approximately 4 to 14 days and continues to erupt in crops over the next 12 to 21 days. Typical lesions are 0.5 to 1 cm, oval or elliptical, dull pink or salmon-colored macules with a delicate collarette of scales at the periphery. The long axes tend to be oriented along the skin lines of cleavage (Langer lines). Lesions on the back may have a characteristic ""Christmas tree"", whereas lesions on the upper chest may have a V-shaped pattern. There are many conditions that may mimic pityriasis rosea. Pityriasis rosea in the absence of the herald patch and its variants may pose a diagnostic challenge. The typical course is 6 to 8 weeks. In the vast majority of cases, reassurance and symptomatic treatment should suffice. Active intervention may be considered for individuals with severe or recurrent pityriasis rosea and pregnant women with the disease. Treatment options include acyclovir, macrolides (in particular, erythromycin), and ultraviolet phototherapy. If active intervention is needed, there is evidence supporting the use of oral acyclovir to shorten the duration of illness. Pityriasis rosea is a common, acute, self-limiting exanthematous skin disease that primarily affects children and young adults. The condition is characterized by a ""herald patch"" after which oval erythematous squamous lesions appear along Langer's lines of cleavage on the trunk and proximal extremities, giving it a ""Christmas tree"" appearance. The disease presenting in its classical form can easily be diagnosed. Clinical variants of the disease may pose a diagnostic challenge for the general pediatrician.

This is a retrospective review of records of 3 children (aged 18, n = 2 and age = 8, n = 1) with SLC52A2- RTD. Patients underwent comprehensive ophthalmic evaluations including color vision testing, pattern visual-evoked potentials (pVEPs, 1 patient) and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging. Patients received riboflavin supplements from the time of the molecular diagnosis of RTD. Two unrelated 18-year-old patients with SLC52A2- RTD had a symptomatic onset with sensorineural hearing loss and auditory neuropathy/dys-synchrony since age 3 and 11, respectively. On examination 7 years after symptomatic onset, they showed subnormal visual acuities (20/30 and 20/60, both eyes, respectively), preserved color vision, and a thin but measurable retinal ganglion cell layer (GCL) and nerve fiber (RNFL). The inner and outer nuclear layers were normal. The asymptomatic SLC52A2- positive brother of one of these patients started riboflavin supplementation right after the molecular diagnosis and had normal vision and SD-OCTs 7 years later. Onset of riboflavin supplementation in one of the 2 symptomatic cases resulted in acute improvement of the pattern visual-evoked potential and vision. Retinal ganglion cells and their axons are uniquely susceptible to RTD compared with other highly energy-dependent retinal neurons, such as photoreceptors, raising the possibility for alternative mechanisms of disease or protection. Riboflavin supplementation results in acute functional improvement of vision and long-term preservation of GCL and RNFL if initiated early.

415,415,33369057,"This panel was designed to identify, quantify and phenotypically characterize putative leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in bone marrow (BM) samples from individual pediatric patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Based on an aberrant expression on immunophenotypically defined hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), several antigens have been proposed as LSC markers in AML research, using healthy adult BM samples as reference material. Generally, these antigens have been evaluated individually in smaller panels (e.g. 8-color panels). This necessitates several tubes to characterize the LSC phenotype and compromises the ability to evaluate LSC heterogeneity. The present 15-color OMIP incorporates nine suggested LSC markers to comprehensively capture LSC immunophenotypes and to explore heterogenic marker-patterns within LSC populations in a single tube. Importantly, this single tube approach requires less input material, which is essential when sampling BM aspirates from pediatric patients where sample volumes often are sparse. As knowledge on normal expression levels of the included LSC markers in HSCs from hematologically healthy children are a prerequisite for labelling a phenotype as abnormal, we have evaluated the applicability of the panel on cryopreserved mononuclear cells (MNCs) isolated from BM samples from pediatric patients without hematological disorders as well as pediatric AML patients. The panel is optimized for cryopreserved BM MNCs, but could in principle, be utilized for LSC detection in any biological material containing human hematopoietic cells.

This study clarifies the feasibility of intraoperative ICG fluorescent imaging for the resection of hepatoblastoma. In three hepatoblastoma patients, a primary tumor, recurrent tumor, and lung metastatic lesions were intraoperatively examined using a near-infrared fluorescence imaging system after the preoperative administration of ICG. ICG fluorescent imaging was useful for the surgical navigation in hepatoblastoma patients. In the first case, the primary hepatoblastoma exhibited intense fluorescence during right hepatectomy, but no fluorescence was detected in the residual liver. In the second case, a recurrent tumor exhibited fluorescence between the residual liver and diaphragm. A complete resection of the residual liver, with a partial resection of the diaphragm, followed by liver transplantation was performed. In the third case with multiple lung metastases, each metastatic lesion showed positive fluorescence, and all were completely resected.

The present study was carried out to determine the prevalence of ocular morbidity among street children in the Kathmandu Valley. A cross-sectional study consisting of an eye examination program among 569 street children aged younger than 18 years was conducted from March 2013 to February 2014. Children were included from 11 safe houses of 6 non-governmental organizations and an independent eye camp. Eye examination included visual acuity testing, anterior segment and posterior segment examination, retinoscopy and refraction, cover test, convergence, accommodation and color vision tests. Chi-square test was used to analyze the association of ocular morbidity with age, sex and living conditions. The majority of children (43.8%) were in the age group of 12-15 years, and the male to female ratio was 3.9:1. Uncorrected and best-corrected visual acuity ≥6/9 in at least one eye was found in 89.8% and 98.4% of children, respectively. Total ocular morbidity was observed at 31.6%.

This cross-sectional study was conducted with 47 patients diagnosed with MIS-C and 32 healthy age- and gender-matched children. All patients underwent two-dimensional, colour, pulsed, and tissue Doppler, and 2D speckle tracking echocardiography examination at admission, 2 weeks, and 2 months after discharge. The MIS-C patient group was compared with the control group. Echocardiographic changes in MIS-C patients during follow-up were evaluated. Of 47 patients, 30 (63.8%) were male and 17 (36.2%) were female. The mean age at diagnosis was 9.1 ± 4.3 (1.25-17) years. At admission, 25 patients had abnormal findings on conventional echocardiography. Among them, eight patients had left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Ejection fraction and fractional shortening were significantly lower in the patient group at admission compared to controls (p = 0.013, p = 0.010, respectively). While the ejection fraction was <55% in eight patients, and global longitudinal strain was lower than -2SD in 29 patients at admission. Global longitudinal strain z-score <-2SD persisted in 13 patients at 2-month follow-up. Ejection fraction increased above 55% in 3.42 ± 0.53 days in 7 of 8 patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, ejection fraction was 51% at discharge in one patient, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction persisted at the 6-month of follow-up.

Mixed population-based ecological study with spatial and temporal trend analysis of epidemiological indicators based on new cases reported to the Information System for Notifiable Diseases of the Ministry of Health occurring in individuals residing in North and Northeast states of Brazil. A total of 396 987 new cases were analysed; 9.2% of these involved children <15 years of age, and 5.4% involved individuals with grade 2 disability (G2D). The Northeast region recorded 66.4% of the new cases. Most cases involved males between 15 and 59 years of age and of brown race/colour. The temporal trend showed a reduction in most of the indicators and study variables. The G2D rate did not have trends over time in the Northeast Region, in individuals 0-14 years of age, or in municipalities with 'very high' social vulnerability indexes. The spatial and spatiotemporal analysis showed the presence of hyperendemic foci with high detection risk involving municipalities in the states of Tocantins, Pará and Maranhão. Leprosy in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil persists as a critical public health problem. Temporal and spatiotemporal patterns identified in this study confirm that leprosy remains epidemiologically relevant in vulnerable areas. Surveillance and control interventions are needed in municipalities with low detection in the general population, in children and in individuals with G2D, to reduce late diagnosis.

Long-term effects of ACEs on psychological well-being, engagement in risk behaviors, and physical health have been observed. Moreover, many individuals exposed to ACEs are also affected by an accumulation of stressors due to broader structural inequities. The current study examined heterogeneity in patterns of ACEs, explored how these patterns varied based on race/ethnicity, biological sex, and socioeconomic status, and assessed how ACE patterns were associated with physical health, mental health, and risk-related outcomes in adulthood. Drawing on the Add Health dataset, survey data from Waves I, III, IV (n = 12,288) were analyzed. Mean age of participants was 28.3 (SD = 1.9), more than half were female (54.4%), and a little less than half identified as youth of color (46.7%). Multigroup latent class analysis explored heterogeneity in ACE exposure and variations based on structural inequities. Latent class regression assessed associations between ACE classes and outcomes. A four-class solution was identified. Class sizes and latent structures differed by biological sex. Among males and females, the low adversity class had more positive physical health, mental health, and risk-related outcomes compared to all classes, while the childhood maltreatment and high adversity/community violence classes engaged in more risk-related behaviors.

Since under these conditions a manual plausibility check is hardly feasible, we have developed a simple algorithm that facilitates this check. An open-source R tool is available as a Shiny application at github.com/SandraKla/Zlog_AdRI. Based on the zlog standardization, we can possibly detect critical jumps at the transitions between age groups, regardless of the analytical method or the measuring unit. Its advantage compared to the standard z-value is that means and standard deviations are calculated from the reference limits rather than from the underlying data itself. The purpose of the tool is illustrated by the example of reference intervals of children and adolescents from the Canadian Laboratory Initiative on Pediatric Reference Intervals (CALIPER). The Shiny application identifies the zlog values, lists them in a colored table format and plots them additionally with the specified reference intervals. The algorithm detected several strong and rapid changes in reference intervals from the neonatal period to puberty. Remarkable jumps with absolute zlog values of more than five were seen for 29 out of 192 reference limits (15.1%). This might be attenuated by introducing shorter time periods or mathematical functions of reference limits over age. Age-partitioned reference intervals will remain the standard in laboratory routine for the foreseeable future, and as such, algorithmic approaches like our zlog approach in the presented Shiny application will remain valuable tools for testing their plausibility on a wide scale.

Parent/guardians of youth meeting inclusion criteria participated in separate focus groups. Data were analyzed using an interpretative phenomenological analysis approach. Major findings were divided into 2 categories: 1) racism-related experiences in the health care setting; and 2) patient and parent/guardian recommendations to support pediatric patients experiencing racism. Among health care setting experiences, primary emerging themes included racism experienced in the health care setting, patient-clinician communication around racism, patient-clinician concordance, and high-quality clinical care. Recommendations were presented within the 4 domains of racism: intrapersonal, interpersonal, structural, and institutional. Racism experiences worsen child biological, psychological, and behavioral functioning, yet research is lacking on how health care professionals may best support pediatric patients experiencing racism. Study findings suggest opportunities for providing safer and more supportive health care spaces for youth experiencing racism.

434,434,10982698,"Although the assessment of right ventricular (RV) function is important in the clinical management of children with congenital heart disease, available imaging techniques have been limited because of the complex geometry of the right ventricle. A new Doppler index combining systolic and diastolic time intervals (the Tei index) has been reported to be useful for the assessment of global RV function in adults. However, normal values in children, age-related changes, and the clinical utility of the Tei index with regard to congenital heart disease have not been demonstrated. The purpose of this study was to prospectively assess RV function in children with normal heart and congenital heart disease using the Tei index. The subjects included 150 healthy children and 43 patients with congenital heart disease (35 patients with atrial septal defects and 8 patients who had had a Senning operation). The index was defined as the sum of isovolumetric contraction time and isovolumetric relaxation time divided by ejection time and was measured from conventional RV outflow and inflow Doppler velocity profiles. The Tei index was not affected by age in healthy children (0.24 +/- 0.04). There was a significant difference in index rating between patients who had had a Senning operation (0.58 +/- 0.09) and healthy children (p < 0.01), but there was no significant difference between children with atrial septal defect (0.25 +/- 0.13) and healthy children.

435,435,34670797,"In December 2014, the Kidney Allocation System (KAS) was implemented to improve equity in access to transplantation, but preliminary studies in children show mixed results. Thus, we aimed to assess how the 2014 KAS policy change affected racial and ethnic disparities in pediatric kidney transplantation access and related outcomes. We performed a retrospective cohort study of children <18 years of age active on the kidney transplant list from 2008 to 2019 using the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. Log-logistic accelerated failure time models were used to determine the time from first activation on the transplant list and the time on dialysis to deceased donor transplant, each with KAS era or race and ethnicity as the exposure of interest. We used logistic regression to assess odds of delayed graft function. Log-rank tests assessed time to graft loss within racial and ethnic groups across KAS eras. All children experienced longer wait times from activation to transplantation post-KAS. In univariable analysis, Black and Hispanic children and other children of color experienced longer times from activation to transplant compared with White children in both eras; this finding was largely attenuated after multivariable analysis (time ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.32; time ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.28; and time ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.96 to 1.41 post-KAS, respectively). Multivariable analysis also showed that racial and ethnic disparities in time from dialysis initiation to transplantation in the pre-KAS era were mitigated in the post-KAS era. There were no disparities in odds of delayed graft function. Black and Hispanic children experienced longer times with a functioning graft in the post-KAS era. No racial and ethnic disparities from activation to deceased donor transplantation were seen before or after implementation of the KAS in multivariable analysis, whereas time on dialysis to transplantation and odds of short-term graft loss improved in equity after the implementation of the KAS, without compromising disparities in delayed graft function.

Evidence of the negative effects of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) on mental health has not been convincing, although a few studies have found an association between high SSB levels and attention problems in children. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that SSB consumption is associated with ADHD among children. Doctor-diagnosed ADHD cases (n = 173) and non-ADHD controls (n = 159) between age 4 to 15 were recruited. SSB consumption, socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics of the children, as well as of their mothers' characteristics during pregnancy, were collected using a questionnaire. Blood lead levels and polymorphisms of two commonly verified dopaminergic-related genes (the D4 dopamine receptor gene DRD4 and the dopamine transporter gene DAT1) were also analyzed. There was a dose-response relationship between SSB consumption and ADHD. After covariates were adjusted, children who consumed SSBs at moderate levels and high levels had 1.36 and 3.69 odds, respectively, of having ADHD, compared with those who did not consume SSBs (p for trend < 0.05). Similar results were obtained when females were excluded.

A weighing scale was placed below the manikin. This procedure was repeated once again at least 1 week apart. The feedback system used 3 different colours to indicate the force range achieved as below target, achieve target, above target. Significantly higher proportion of target cricoid pressure was achieved with the use of sensor feedback in Group C; 85.9% (95%CI: 82.7%-88.7%) compared to when blinded from sensor in Group B; 31.3% (95%CI: 27.4-35.4%).

Performance was evaluated on both interference and facilitation components of the task. On the standard version of the task, with equal numbers of color words and neutral words, children with ADHD showed increased Stroop interference (prolongation of color-naming times by color-incongruent stimuli) but normal amounts of facilitation (speeding of color naming by color-congruent stimuli). This finding suggests that children with ADHD show increased disruption of color-naming performance by task-irrelevant information, probably secondary to decreased attentional control over the interference process. In contrast to findings of studies in adults, both groups of children failed to use an attentional strategy to reduce interference when they were administered blocks of trials that varied their expectancy for color word trials. This precluded a direct test of the diminished control hypothesis. There were no significant correlations between abnormal Stroop performance and impairment on the Continuous Performance Test or the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test or measures of IQ or reading performance. The implications of these findings for our understanding of information-processing deficits in children with ADHD and of the neurobiological underpinnings of these deficits are discussed.

442,442,39312767,"Up to half of the children with new-onset type 1 diabetes present to the hospital with diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening condition that can develop because of diagnostic delay. Three-quarters of Australian children visit their general practitioner (GP) the week before presenting to the hospital with diabetic ketoacidosis. Our prototype, DIRECT-T1DM (Decision-Support for Integrated, Real-Time Evaluation and Clinical Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus), is an electronic clinical decision support tool that promotes immediate point-of-care testing in general practice to confirm the suspicion of diabetes. This avoids laboratory testing, which has been documented internationally as a cause of diagnostic delay. In this investigation, we aimed to pilot and assess the feasibility and acceptability of our prototype to GP end users. We also explored the challenges of diagnosing type 1 diabetes in the Australian general practice context. In total, 4 GPs, a pediatric endocrinologist, and a PhD candidate were involved in conceptualizing the DIRECT-T1DM prototype, which was developed at the Department of General Practice and Primary Care at the University of Melbourne. Furthermore, 6 GPs were recruited via convenience sampling to evaluate the tool. The study involved 3 phases: a presimulation interview, simulated clinical scenarios, and a postsimulation interview. The interview guide was developed using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) as a guide. All phases of the study were video, audio, and screen recorded. Audio recordings were transcribed by the investigating team. Analysis was carried out using CFIR as the underlying framework. Major themes were identified among three domains and 7 constructs of the CFIR: (1) outer setting-time pressure, difficulty in diagnosing pediatric type 1 diabetes, and secondary care considerations influenced GPs' needs regarding DIRECT-T1DM; (2) inner setting-DIRECT-T1DM fits within existing workflows, it has a high relative priority due to its importance in patient safety, and GPs exhibited high tension for change; and (3) innovation-design recommendations included altering coloring to reflect urgency, font style and bolding, specific language, information and guidelines, and inclusion of patient information sheets. End-user acceptability of DIRECT-T1DM was high. This was largely due to its implications for patient safety and its ""real-time"" nature.

447,447,29090844,"Retinal imaging is an important and effective tool for detecting retinal diseases. However, degraded images caused by the aberrations of the eye can disguise lesions, so that a diseased eye can be mistakenly diagnosed as normal. In this work, we propose a new image enhancement method to improve the quality of degraded images. A new method is used to enhance degraded-quality fundus images. In this method, the image is converted from the input RGB colour space to LAB colour space and then each normalized component is enhanced using contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization. Human visual system (HVS)-based fundus image quality assessment, combined with diagnosis by experts, is used to evaluate the enhancement. The study included 191 degraded-quality fundus photographs of 143 subjects with optic media opacity. Objective quality assessment of image enhancement (range: 0-1) indicated that our method improved colour retinal image quality from an average of 0.0773 (variance 0.0801) to an average of 0.3973 (variance 0.0756). Following enhancement, area under curves (AUC) were 0.996 for the glaucoma classifier, 0.989 for the diabetic retinopathy (DR) classifier, 0.975 for the age-related macular degeneration (AMD) classifier and 0.979 for the other retinal diseases classifier. The relatively simple method for enhancing degraded-quality fundus images achieves superior image enhancement, as demonstrated in a qualitative HVS-based image quality assessment.

The coloured and black subgroups considered together had a significantly lower mean haemoglobin concentration than the white subgroup (12.8 +/- 1.2 g/dl v. 13.4 +/- 1.0 g/dl) (F = 37.47; P less than 0.0001). The urban population as a whole had a significantly lower geometric mean (1 SD range) serum ferritin concentration than the rural population (25.6 (13.5-48.6) micrograms/l v. 34.1 (21.3-54.6) micrograms/l) (F = 42.94; P less than 0.0001). The lowest geometric mean serum ferritin values were found in the urban coloured (23.1 (11.5-46.4) micrograms/l) and urban black schoolchildren (23.7 (13.2-42.6) micrograms/l), with figures of less than 12 micrograms/l in 11.7% and 12.5% respectively. Although 28% of the children had red cell folate values below the recommended lower limit of normal (175 ng/ml), probability plot analysis of the data suggested that folate deficiency was not a major problem in the study population. The calculated daily iron and folate intakes were below the age-related recommended dietary allowance (RDA) in all the subgroups, yet anaemia was relatively uncommon. These findings suggest that the RDA values are too high. Overall the prevalence of nutritional anaemia was low and only the urban coloured subgroup showed significant second populations with low haemoglobin and serum ferritin measurements.

449,449,38958831,"This review explores the emerging evidence regarding pathogenesis, future trajectories, treatment options, and phenotypes of youth-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D). Youth-onset T2D is increasing in incidence and prevalence worldwide, disproportionately affecting First Nations communities, socioeconomically disadvantaged youth, and people of colour. Youth-onset T2D differs in pathogenesis to later-onset T2D and progresses more rapidly. It is associated with more complications, and these occur earlier. While there are limited licensed treatment options available, the available medications also appear to have a poorer response in youth with T2D. Multiple interacting factors likely contribute to this rising prevalence, as well as the increased severity of the condition, including structural inequities, increasing obesity and sedentary lifestyles, and intergenerational transmission from in-utero exposure to maternal hyperglycemia and obesity. Youth-onset T2D is also associated with stigma and poorer mental health, and these impact clinical management. There is an urgent need to develop effective interventions to prevent youth-onset T2D and enhance engagement of affected youth. It is also critical to better understand the differing phenotypes of youth-onset T2D, to effectively target treatments, and to address intergenerational transmission in high-risk populations.

Color vision testing was performed using Ishihara's test and the City University color vision test. The prevalence of color vision deficiency was 1.68%, with 2.81% in boys and 0.16% in girls. Color-deficient cases consisted of 91.6% deutan and 8.3% protan.

Over the five-year study period, the change in spherical equivalent refraction in the color vision-deficiency group (-1.81 D) was also significantly lower than that in the color normal group (-2.41 D) (P = 0.002). The lower incidence and slower progression of myopia in children with color-vision deficiency over the five-year follow-up period suggest that color-deficient individuals are less susceptible to myopia onset and development.

Only 28% of the respondents knew that mosquitoes transmitted malaria. However, most people believed correctly that August to October was the main malaria season. Eighty-six per cent of the subjects were bed net users. The majority of nets were produced locally, usually white in colour and made of sheeting fabrics. Usage of nets was correlated with ethnic group, age and polygamy but not with education, income, occupation or ownership of certain items which indicate high social status. Analysis of expenditure on mosquito coils indicated that non-users of nets spent 43% more on coils than did users.

Generally, it was possible to obtain a canine-specific STR profile from the dog's saliva left on the wound area, even when high background of human DNA was present (blood). Interestingly, we found canine STR typing to be more successful when the bandages and swabs showed high amounts of human blood, i.e. when the dog bite was severe. Canine saliva was then sometimes visible as white-coloured secretion on the human blood surface. Less severe bite cases, which did not result in bleeding wounds, showed less success in obtaining useful STR results, probably due to the fact that the surface of the wounds may have been treated before the victims consulted medical aid which therefore removed the canine cells.

M-mode echocardiograms of the left ventricle were digitized and analyzed with a computer-assisted measurement format for left ventricular size, mass, and wall motion in systole and diastole. These echocardiographic parameters were clustered and analyzed by a unique echocardiographic scoring algorithm blinded to the biopsy interpretation. In eight cases in which findings of biopsies were consistent with moderate to severe rejection, left ventricular mass was increased and indexes of systolic and diastolic function were depressed compared with the remainder of the cases (n = 18), in which findings of biopsies included either no evidence or mild evidence of rejection. The echocardiographic score of the group with moderate to severe rejection was significantly greater than the score of the group that was normal or had mild rejection (5.4 +/- 0.7 vs 2.2 +/- 0.3; p < 0.001).

Four had normal arteriograms, but the remaining four had hepatic artery thrombosis with collateral formation. Patients with hepatic artery thrombosis and collateral circulation tended to have increased diastolic flow (decreased resistive index).

467,467,36389468,"We present a conceptual model of the ways in which built and social environments shape the development of self-regulation in early childhood. Importantly, in centering children of color growing up in historically disinvested neighborhoods, we first describe how systemic structures of racism and social stratification have shaped neighborhood built and social environment features. We then present evidence linking these neighborhood features to children's development of self-regulation. Furthermore, we take a multilevel approach to examining three potential pathways linking neighborhood contexts to self-regulation: school environment and resources, home environment and resources, and child health behaviors. Finally, we consider how racial-ethnic-cultural strengths and multilevel interventions have the potential to buffer children's development of self-regulation in disinvested neighborhood contexts. Advancing multilevel approaches to understand the development of self-regulation among children of color living in historically disinvested neighborhoods is an important step in efforts to promote equity in health and education.

Our aim was to study the burden of high-intensity transient signals (HITS) during these procedures in infants. We used a novel color M-mode Doppler (CMD) technique by NeoDoppler, a non-invasive ultrasound system based on plane wave transmissions for transfontanellar continuous monitoring of cerebral blood flow in infants. The system displays CMD with 24 sample volumes and a Doppler spectrogram. Infants with CHD undergoing transcatheter interventions (n = 15) and surgery (n = 13) were included. HITS were manually detected based on an ""embolic signature"" in the CMD with corresponding intensity increase in the Doppler spectrogram. Embolus-to-blood ratio (EBR) defined HITS size. A total of 1169 HITS with a median EBR of 9.74 dB (interquartile range [IQR]: 5.10-15.80 dB) were detected. The median number of HITS in the surgery group was 45 (IQR: 11-150), while in the transcatheter group the median number was 12 (IQR: 7-24). During cardiac surgery, the highest number of HITS per hour was seen from initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass to aortic X-clamp.

Two thousand five hundred cases were examined by routine transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in both pediatric and adult cardiology outpatient clinics. ASA was detected in 20 cases and evaluated by two-dimensional color Doppler echocardiography (CDE). The length of the base, the maximum radius and the maximum displacement of ASA were measured. The shunt between the atria was examined by CDE. In cases where a shunt could not be found, galactose and palmitic acid was injected. Standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and exercise stress test were also performed. No clinical signs or symptoms were found, suggesting a systemic or cerebral embolism. The maximum displacement of ASA was between 2 and 5 mm. All of the aneurysms were localized in the right atrium, and the walls of the aneurysm did not move beyond the base of the left atrium during the maximum displacement. Interatrial shunt was detected in 14 of 20 patients (70%) by CDE and in the remaining six cases by contrast TTE. Frequent ventricular ectopic beats were observed in one patient. During routine TTE we observed 0.8% asymptomatic ASA in our population. The use of a contrast agent was found to be a valuable additional method in patients with ASA when the shunt could not be detected by CDE. The risk for embolism is not high when the maximum displacement of the wall of ASA was 5 mm or less and no bulge into the left atrium was observed. Based on our experience with this method, TTE is easy to perform, well-tolerated and acceptable.

471,471,28899405,"Congenital erythropoietic porphyria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that affects heme-porphyrin synthesis. This disorder is due to the genetic defect of uroporphyrinogen III cosynthase. This defect results in the accumulation of high amounts of uroporphyrin I in all tissues, leading to clinical manifestations ranging from mild to severe chronic damage of the skin, cartilage and bone. Hypertrichosis, erythrodontia and reddish-colored urine are often present, as well as hemolytic anemia accompanied by hepatosplenomegaly. Here, we present a case of a 5-year-old male child of Middle Eastern origin who had been diagnosed as having alpha thalassemia and was undergoing chronic blood transfusions. He later presented with hypopigmented skin lesions and atrophy post-photosensitivity, persistent red-colored urine and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory investigations showed a high level of porphyrin metabolites in his plasma and erythrocytes. As a result, he was diagnosed as having Congenital erythropoietic porphyria. Here, we diagnose a case of congenital erythropoietic porphyria which was initially missed, although the clinical features were clear (red-colored urine, hepatosplenomegaly and hemolytic anemia were present since birth, and skin manifestations appeared at the age of 22 months after being exposed to sunlight). After a DNA test was performed, the patient was initially diagnosed as having alpha thalassemia. We identified two causes of hemolytic anemia (congenital erythropoietic porphyria and alpha thalassemia) in this patient.

This may yield mixed findings for associations of an exposure-neurobehavioral outcome. We develop an item response theory (IRT) approach to integrate multiple task variables together to improve measurement precision of the underlying construct. We apply this approach to create an integrative measure of childhood inhibitory control, and study impacts of pre/post-natal lead exposure. Using data from a prospective cohort based in Mexico (N = 533), we created an inhibitory control scale that integrates accuracy and reaction time information from four inhibitory control tasks (Go/NoGo Letter, Go/NoGo Neutral, Go/NoGo Happy, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Color-Word Interference Test, Condition 3). Using a generalized partial credit item response theory model, we estimated an inhibitory control index for each participant. We then assessed adjusted associations between umbilical cord blood and 4-year lead and childhood inhibitory control. We developed a resampling approach to incorporate error estimates from the inhibitory control variable to confirm the consistency of the lead-inhibitory control associations. We modeled time-varying associations of lead with each inhibitory control measure separately. Participants had a median age of 9 years; 51.4% were males. Umbilical cord blood [-0.06 (95% CI: -0.11, -0.01)] and 4-year lead [-0.07 (95% CI: -0.12, -0.02)] were associated with inhibitory control index at 8-10 years. A resampling approach confirmed that 4-year lead was consistently associated with childhood inhibitory control index. Umbilical cord blood and 4-year lead were each associated with 3 out of 8 measures in separate models. This is the first application of IRT in environmental epidemiology to create a latent variable for inhibitory control that integrates accuracy and reaction time information from multiple, related tasks.

481,481,35319572,"Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) and restrictive cardiomyopathies (RCM) are rare diseases with high morbidity and mortality in the pediatric age group, particularly the restrictive. They can be diagnosed at any age even in fetal life, in isolation or association with other cardiomyopathies or congenital heart disease. The causes may be genetic, neuromuscular, metabolic, storage, or idiopathic disorders. The main morphological characteristic of LVNC is the presence of a non-compact myocar dium with numerous prominent trabeculations and deep recesses, which may results in myocardial dysfunction, malignant arrhythmias and thromboembolism. On the other hand, in RCM there is an abnormal myocardial stiffness, which generates a restrictive ventricular filling and atrial dilatation secondary. Clinically it manifested by severe diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, arrhyth mias and sudden death. For both cardiomyopathies, the Doppler color echocardiography, electro cardiography and Holter monitoring of arrhythmias are the gold standard for diagnosis and follow up. Cardiac resonance adds information on functional assessment and quantification of myocardial fibrosis. The therapy is oriented to improve symptoms and quality of life. Patients with severe forms of LVNC and RCM may require extracorporeal ventricular support and cardiac transplantation, even in early stages of the disease.

The genetic basis of SAH is currently unknown. To perform molecular genetic investigations in 48 individuals with a clinical phenotype suggestive of SAH to identify, if any, the genetic basis of this condition. Exome sequencing was performed in 27 patients diagnosed with SAH or with a complaint of short, nongrowing hair. The cohort was screened for variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) < 5% in the general population and a Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) score > 15, to identify genes whose variants were enriched in this cohort. Sanger sequencing was used for variant validation and screening of 21 additional individuals with the same clinical diagnosis and their relatives. Genetic association testing of SAH-related variants for male pattern hair loss (MPHL) was performed using UK Biobank data. Analyses revealed that 20 individuals (42%) carried mono- or biallelic pathogenic variants in WNT10A. Rare WNT10A variants are associated with a phenotypic spectrum ranging from no clinical signs to severe ectodermal dysplasia. A significant association was found between WNT10A and SAH, and this was mostly observed in individuals with light-coloured hair and regression of the frontoparietal hairline. Notably, the most frequent variant in the cohort [c.682T>A;p.(Phe228Ile)] was in linkage disequilibrium with four common WNT10A variants, all of which have a known association with MPHL. Using UK Biobank data, our analyses showed that c.682T>A;p.(Phe228Ile) and one other variant identified in the SAH cohort are also associated with MPHL, and partially explain the known associations between WNT10A and MPHL. Our results suggest that WNT10A is associated with SAH and that SAH has a genetic overlap with the common phenotype MPHL.

484,484,38408130,"To investigate superb microvascular imaging (SMI), a novel Doppler ultrasound technique that can visualize low-velocity microvascular flow, for assessing pediatric focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH). Nine FNH lesions in 6 patients were enrolled. On SMI and color Doppler imaging (CDI), intralesional vascularity was assessed visually and categorized as typical spoke-wheel pattern (central vessel radiating from the center to the periphery), multifocal spoke-wheel pattern, and nonspecific pattern. We compared the vascular features of the lesions between SMI and CDI and evaluated vascular patterns according to lesion size. In terms of vascularity pattern, the typical spoke-wheel pattern of FNH was noted more frequently on SMI (67%) than on CDI (11%; P < 0.05). In addition, a multifocal spoke-wheel pattern was noted in all remaining lesions (33%) on SMI. On the contrary, a nonspecific vascular pattern was detected in the majority (78%) of CDI. Regarding the lesion size and vascularity on SMI, the typical spoke-wheel pattern was seen more frequently in the small FNH group than in the large FNH group. The intralesional vascular signal was detected more frequently on SMI (100%) than on CDI (89%). SMI is feasible in evaluating FNH in children and has a greater ability to demonstrate the spoke-wheel pattern than CDI.

486,486,27562977,"To test the hypothesis that continuous intramural vascular signal measuring at least 3 mm on color Doppler imaging is highly specific for appendicitis in patients with diagnostically borderline-size appendices. Two blinded observers independently reviewed color Doppler images of the appendix in 94 consecutive patients who had undergone sonography for suspected appendicitis and whose appendices were of diagnostically borderline size (6-8 mm maximum outer diameter). Intramural vascular flow on color Doppler images was classified as absent, type 1 (only punctate and dispersed signal), or type 2 (continuous linear or curvilinear signal measuring at least 3.0 mm in long- or short-axis views). Histopathologic examination and clinical follow-up served as reference standards. Proportions were assessed by the exact binomial test. Of the 94 patients, 33 (35.1%) had type 1 flow (of whom 5 [15.2%] had appendicitis); 23 (24.5%) had type 2 flow (of whom 20 [87.0%] had appendicitis); and 38 (40.4%) had absent flow (of whom 10 [26.3%] had appendicitis). The sensitivity, specificity, and odds ratio of type 2 flow as an indicator of appendicitis were 57.1%, 94.9%, and 24.9 (P< .001), respectively; the corresponding values for type 1 flow as an indicator of normal appendices were and 47.5%, 85.7%, and 5.4 (P = .002).

Participants were children who were aged 8 to 18 years, presented to a pediatric ED with abdominal pain suggestive of appendicitis, and were recruited to participate in a randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of morphine. Patients were initially asked to grade their pain on a plasticized color analog scale, a paper visual analog scale, a paper Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale, and then with a verbal numeric scale. Thirty minutes after morphine or placebo administration, the assessment was repeated. All scores were then converted to a value of 0 to 100. Agreements between scores were evaluated with the Bland-Altman method, and the 95% lower and upper limits were reported. We defined a priori the maximum limit of agreement at +/-20 mm.

Since the introduction of transesophageal echocardiography nearly 15 years ago, addition of high-resolution cross-sectional imaging combined with Doppler color flow mapping has provided a new window to examine the heart. Recently, miniaturization of the transesophageal probe to ""pediatric-size"" has enabled its use in the smallest of infants to add significantly to the assessment of congenital heart malformations. Most recently, addition of a longitudinal-plane probe to the already-existent, transverse-plane probe has made biplane transesophageal echocardiography a reality with significant additional information being provided by orthogonal images of the cardiac structures. We used these probes in complementary fashion in 30 studies performed in 23 patients ages 1 day to 12 years with a mean of 35 months, weighing 2.6-40 kg (mean 12.4 kg). These studies were performed in the operating room, intensive care unit, cardiac catheterization laboratory, and outpatient department. Limitations of single-plane, transverse transesophageal echocardiography were overcome using the longitudinal-axis pediatric probe: left and right ventricular outflow tracts, distal pulmonary arteries, and all of the interventricular and atrial septa were easily visualized. Its use in the operating room and postoperative cardiac intensive care unit for continuous ventricular monitoring in otherwise-inaccessible patients also provided critical information.

499,499,15574605,"Dental care is a major unmet health need of refugee children. Many refugee children have never received oral health care or been exposed to common preventive oral health measures, such as a toothbrush, fluoridated toothpaste, or fluoridated water. Oral health problems among refugee children are most likely to be detected first by pediatricians and family practitioners. Given the increased influx of refugees into the United States, particularly children, it is important for the pediatric community to be aware of potential oral health problems among refugee children and be able to make referrals for treatment and recommendations for the prevention of future oral diseases. The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of caries experience and untreated decay among newly arrived refugee children stratified by their region of origin and compared with US children. Oral health assessments were conducted within 1 month of arrival to the United States as part of the Refugee Health Assessment Program of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. The outcome variables include caries experience and untreated decay. Caries experience is determined by the presence of an untreated caries lesion, a restoration, or a permanent molar tooth that is missing because it has been extracted as a result of dental caries. Untreated caries is detected when 0.5 mm of tooth structure is lost and there is brown coloration of the walls of the cavity. Comparisons of the refugee children with US children in Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data were made using chi2 test of independence and multiple logistic regression. Oral health screenings were performed on 224 newly arrived refugees who ranged in age from 6 months to 18 years and had a mean age of 10.6 years (SD: 4.82; median: 10.7 years). African refugees represented 53.6%, with the majority from Somalia, Liberia, and Sudan. Eastern European refugees composed 26.8% of the study sample. The remaining 19.6% come from a number of countries, such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Middle East. Refugee children had 51.3% caries experience and 48.7% with untreated decay. Caries experience in refugees varied by region of origin, with 38% from Africa exhibiting a history of caries compared with 79.7% of Eastern Europeans. The highest proportion of children with no obvious dental problems was from Africa (40.5%) compared with 16.9% from Eastern Europe. US children had caries experience similar to that of refugees (49.3%) but significantly lower risk of untreated decay (22.8%). Comparisons between refugee children and US children found significant differences for treatment urgency, untreated caries, extent of dental caries, and presence of oral pain. White refugee children, primarily from Eastern Europe, were 2.8 times as likely to have caries experience compared with white US children, with 9.4 times the risk of untreated decay compared with white US children. In contrast, African refugee children were only half as likely to have caries experience compared with white US children (95% confidence interval: 0.3-0.7) and African American children (95% confidence interval: 0.3-0.7). However, African refugee children were similar to African American children in risk of untreated decay (odds ratio: 0.94). African refugee children had significantly lower dental caries experience as well as fewer untreated caries as compared with similarly aged Eastern European refugee children. They were also less likely to have ever been to a dentist. Possible reasons for these findings may include differences in exposure to natural fluoride in the drinking water, dietary differences, access to professional care, and cultural beliefs and practices. The prevalence of caries experience and untreated caries differed significantly between refugee children and US children. These differences varied significantly by race. When refugee children were compared with US children, the African refugee children had only half the caries experience of either white or African American children. However, African refugee children had similar likelihood of having untreated caries as compared with African American children, despite that very few African children had previous access to professional dental care. These findings are consistent with previous studies on health disparities in the United States. White refugee children, primarily from Eastern Europe, were also 3 times as likely to have caries experience compared with either white or African American children and were 9.4 times as likely to have untreated caries as white US children.

500,500,9799323,"Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is an unusual hepatic tumour in children and should be distinguished from other hepatic lesions. To describe the imaging characteristics of FNH in children. We examined five patients (three boys and two girls, mean age 9.4 years) with pathologically confirmed FNH. The diagnosis was obtained by tumour resection (n = 4) and percutaneous needle biopsy (n = 1). One patient with multiple FNHs showed recurrent lesions after tumour resection. All patients were studied with US (including colour and power Doppler US [n = 3]) and CT. Dynamic enhanced CT scans were available in three patients. MRI (n = 2) or coeliac angiography (n = 1) was performed in three patients. Seven of eight FNH lesions in five patients were demonstrated by imaging. The average size of the lesions was 6.5 cm. Six lesions detected on US showed variable echogenicity with a central hyperechoic scar (n = 2). On Doppler examination, central or peripheral hypervascular areas were seen (n = 3). Six lesions detected on contrast-enhanced CT showed high attenuation (n = 4) or iso-attenuation (n = 2). On early phase scans, all the lesions (n = 3) showed high attenuation. Irregular linear or ovoid central scars were detected in two patients on CT. MR demonstrated three lesions in two patients, one of which had not been detected by US or CT. A central low signal intensity scar (n = 1) was seen on T2-weighted MRI. Coeliac angiography performed in one patient showed a hypervascular mass with homogeneous staining. FNH in children shows a wide spectrum of imaging findings on various radiological examinations and the typical central scar was not always seen on imaging studies. Dynamic enhanced CT obtained in the early phase and colour Doppler studies may be helpful in the diagnosis of FNH by allowing characterisation of tumour vascularity. FNH should be included in the differential diagnosis of liver mass in children.

501,501,26030086,"To investigate the independent and combined associations of cardiorespiratory performance (CP), neuromuscular performance (NP; including motor performance [MP]) and body fat percentage (BF%) with cognition in children. The participants were 202 boys and 201 girls age 6-8 yr. Cardiorespiratory performance was assessed using maximal cycle ergometer test and was expressed as maximal workload per lean body mass. Neuromuscular performance score included muscle strength, speed, agility, balance, manual dexterity, and flexibility; and MP included speed and agility, balance, and manual dexterity. Body fat percentage was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Cognition was assessed using Raven Coloured Progressive Matrices (CPM). Linear regression and general linear models were used to analyze the independent and combined associations of CP, NP, MP, and BF% with Raven CPM score. Neuromuscular performance and MP were directly associated with the Raven CPM score (β = 0.138-0.190; P < 0.01). Children in the lowest or the highest thirds of BF% and in the lowest third of MP had a lower Raven CPM score than other children (P < 0.05). Children in the lowest or highest third of BF% along with the poorest MP had a lower Raven CPM score than those in the middle third of BF% and higher MP (P < 0.05). These associations and differences were much stronger in boys than in girls. Cardiorespiratory performance was not related to the Raven CPM score. Poorer NP and MP were associated with a worse cognition in children and particularly in boys.

In addition, we also probed the associated cognitive and motivational mechanisms by examining correlations with other behavioral tasks. Participants included 8-12 year-old children with ADHD (n = 30) and typically developing controls (n = 26). Children were instructed to visually search for color-defined targets and received monetary rewards for accurate responses. In a subsequent search task in which color was explicitly irrelevant, we manipulated whether a distractor item appeared in a previously reward-associated color. We examined whether children responded more slowly on trials with the previously-rewarded distractor present compared to trials without this distractor, a phenomenon referred to as value-driven attentional capture (VDAC), and whether children with and without ADHD differed in the extent to which they displayed VDAC. Correlations among working memory performance, immediate reward preference (delay discounting) and attentional capture were also examined. Children with ADHD were significantly less affected by the presence of the previously rewarded distractor than were control participants. Within the ADHD group, greater value-driven attentional capture was associated with poorer working memory. Although both ADHD and control participants were initially distracted by previously reward-associated stimuli, the magnitude of distraction was larger and persisted longer among control participants.

504,504,9619611,"Transthoracic Doppler color flow and spectral velocity patterns of normal coronary arteries in children have not been well studied. We designed this study to evaluate coronary artery flow velocity characteristics in normal and hypertrophied hearts. Sixty-eight children with optimal two-dimensional echocardiographic images of the left coronary artery (LCA) and right coronary artery (RCA) were prospectively studied. The heart was normal in 45 children, and 23 had left and/or right ventricular hypertrophy assessed by echocardiography (mean age 5.8 versus 5.2 years, p = NS). Color flow signals were detected in the LCA in 63(92%) of the 68 children studied, and pulsed Doppler spectral waveforms were recorded in 47 (69%). The latter were recorded in 26 (58%) of 45 normal children and in 21 (91%) of 23 children with left ventricular hypertrophy. Diastolic RCA flow signals were detected mostly in those with right ventricular hypertrophy (10 of 10). Higher levels of LCA maximum diastolic velocity (42 +/- 23 versus 24 +/- 6 cm/sec, p = 0.0004), increased diastolic flow (16 +/- 15 versus 6 +/- 4 ml/min, p = 0.01), and delayed time to peak diastolic velocity expressed as a percentage of diastolic spectral duration (38% +/- 14% versus 20% +/- 8%, p = 0.0001) were observed in children with left ventricular hypertrophy than in those in normal children. A strong correlation was present between Doppler-derived LCA flow and left ventricular mass/m2 (r = 0.7, p = 0.001). In normal hearts, LCA spectral velocity pattern did not change with increasing age, but the time velocity integral became progressively larger, resulting in a strong correlation with weight (p < 0.001, r = 0.78). This study demonstrates (1) LCA flow signals can be detected and quantitated in the majority of children with and those without left ventricular hypertrophy. (2) Left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with increased LCA flow, higher diastolic velocity, and delayed peak diastolic velocity. (3) RCA flow signals are mostly detected when there is right ventricular hypertrophy.

Altogether, 371 children (188 boys and 183 girls) 6-9 yr of age at baseline participated in this 2-yr follow-up study. We assessed CRF by maximal cycle ergometer test, computed the MC score from the z-scores of the 50-m shuttle run, static balance, and box and block test results, measured BF% by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and assessed cognition using the Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (RCPM) score. The associations were studied by linear regression analysis and repeated-measures ANCOVA. In boys, a higher MC score (β = -0.161, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.314 to -0.009), a shorter 50-m shuttle run test duration (β = 0.152, 95% CI = 0.007-0.296), and a higher number of cubes moved in the Box and block test (β = -0.161, 95% CI = -0.309 to -0.013) at baseline were associated with a smaller increase in the RCPM score during follow-up. These associations were largely explained by the RCPM score at baseline. However, boys in the highest third (mean difference = 2.5, 95% CI for difference = 0.66-4.33) and the middle third (mean difference = 2.1, 95% CI for difference = 0.39-3.82) of the MC score at baseline had a higher RCPM score over the 2-yr follow-up than boys in the lowest third. CRF, MC, or adiposity was not associated with the RCPM score in girls. Changes in CRF, MC, or BF% were not associated with changes in cognition.

506,506,26299519,"Visual object recognition develops during the first years of life. But what if one is deprived of vision during early post-natal development? Shape information is extracted using both low-level cues (e.g., intensity- or color-based contours) and more complex algorithms that are largely based on inference assumptions (e.g., illumination is from above, objects are often partially occluded). Previous studies, testing visual acuity using a 2D shape-identification task (Lea symbols), indicate that contour-based shape recognition can improve with visual experience, even after years of visual deprivation from birth. We hypothesized that this may generalize to other low-level cues (shape, size, and color), but not to mid-level functions (e.g., 3D shape from shading) that might require prior visual knowledge. To that end, we studied a unique group of subjects in Ethiopia that suffered from an early manifestation of dense bilateral cataracts and were surgically treated only years later. Our results suggest that the newly sighted rapidly acquire the ability to recognize an odd element within an array, on the basis of color, size, or shape differences. However, they are generally unable to find the odd shape on the basis of illusory contours, shading, or occlusion relationships. Little recovery of these mid-level functions is seen within 1 year post-operation. We find that visual performance using low-level cues is relatively robust to prolonged deprivation from birth. However, the use of pictorial depth cues to infer 3D structure from the 2D retinal image is highly susceptible to early and prolonged visual deprivation.

In the comprehensive medical rehabilitation of children with allergic pathology, non-drug methods of treatment are widely used, which help to reduce the number of drugs used, achieve and prolong the remission of the disease, favorably affect the clinical and functional indicators. Is the scientific justification for the use of selective chromotherapy in children with bronchial asthma (BA) and atopic dermatitis (AD). The study included 120 children with allergic diseases (BA and AD). Among 100 patients with BA, the main group included 50 children, who received exposure to monochromatic polarized green light on biologically active zones for 10 days, 50 - a comparison group that did not receive physiotherapy. The main group of children with AD included 10 patients who received selective blue chromotherapy for foci of skin lesions; the comparison group included 10 children who used only moisturizers without physiotherapy methods. In order to assess the effectiveness of the impact of physical factors in all patients, clinical and functional studies were conducted in the dynamics before and after treatment. The results of clinical and functional examinations showed high therapeutic efficacy of the use of monochromatic polarized green light in children with BA (92.0%). The effectiveness of treating children with blood pressure AD using monochromatic polarized light (blue) was 80%. Indications for the use of selective chromotherapy in children with allergic diseases have been developed. For children with BA, selective chromotherapy of the green spectrum is indicated in the presence of a mild to moderate course of the disease, a period of incomplete remission, and an increased level of anxiety. It is advisable to prescribe selective chromotherapy of the blue spectrum to children with a moderate and mild course of AD. The positive effect of selective chromotherapy of the green spectrum on the clinical course of BA in children, bronchial patency, the functional state of the central nervous system and its autonomic part, and the psychoemotional status of children have been identified. The use of selective blue spectrum chromotherapy in children with AD helps to decrease the severity of objective symptoms, reduce the intensity of itching and sleep disturbance, as well as a marked decrease in the area of skin lesion.

511,511,33327937,"Literature on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suggests lower ASD prevalence and higher age of diagnosis among children of color, from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, and from families with lower educational levels. These disparities have been attributed to factors such as limited access to diagnostic and treatment services, less opportunity for upward mobility to locales with ample resources, and linguistic barriers. However, few studies describe prevalence and geographic differences of ASD diagnoses by English Language Learner (ELL) status. The primary objectives of this study are to (1) spatially explore the prevalence of ASD among New York State school districts and (2) examine differences of ASD prevalence rates between ELLs and native English-speaking peers. Using the 2016-2017 district-level data on public and non-public school age students (3-21 years old) receiving special education services in New York, we analyzed sociodemographic trends among school districts with varying percentages (low, medium, and high ranges) of students with ASD and ELLs. To do this, we conducted exploratory spatial analyses using GIS software, analysis of school district level demographic data, and multivariate linear regression. In contrast to prior research on ASD prevalence among minority groups, we found disproportionately higher rates of ASD among school districts with higher proportions of Black and Hispanic students. Geographic analysis revealed statistically significant clustering of school districts with high ASD rates in New York City and Albany. Higher proportions of ELLs tended to be concentrated in densely populated, urban, and geographically smaller school districts and had higher proportions of Black, Hispanic, and Asian students. Schools with higher rates of ASD and ELL students tend to be concentrated in urban regions throughout New York and have higher representation of Black and Hispanic/Latino students, as well as higher rates of learning disabilities in general. Further research is warranted to explore possible reasons for this phenomenon.

515,515,19426960,"To determine the testability of several vision and refraction tests in preschool-aged children. Population-based study of Chinese preschool-aged children in Singapore. One thousand five hundred and forty-two Singaporean Chinese children aged 6 to 72 months were recruited through door-to-door screening of government-subsidized apartments in Singapore. Trained eye professionals administered all tests, including monocular logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution visual acuity with the Sheridan Gardiner chart, monocular Ishihara color testing (Richmond Products Inc, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA), biometric measurements using IOLMaster (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany), and Randot stereoacuity (Stereo Optical Co, Chicago, Illinois, USA) for children 30 to younger than 72 months. Cycloplegic refraction and keratometry measurements also were determined using a table-mounted autorefractor (Canon Autorefractor RK-F1; Canon, Tokyo, Japan) in children 24 to younger than 72 months. Testabilities were 84.8% for visual acuity (40.7% for age 30 to < 36 months, 70.8% for age 36 to < 42 months, 86.7% for age 42 to < 48 months, 94.8 for age 48 to < 54 months, 98.6 for age 54 to < 66 months, and 98.7% for age 66 to < 72 months), 81.1% for the Ishihara color test, 82.2% for Randot stereoacuity, 62.2% for table mounted autorefraction, and 91.7% for IOLMaster. All testabilities significantly increased with age (P < .0001). Girls had higher testability rates than boys for the autorefraction and Randot stereoacuity tests (P = .036 and .008, respectively). The vision and refraction tests were testable in a high proportion of preschool-aged Chinese Singaporeans.

To consolidate the current literature with expert opinion to make recommendations that will guide treatment and referral for patients with port-wine birthmarks (PWBs). In this consensus statement, 12 nationally peer-recognized experts in dermatology with experience treating patients with SWS were assembled. Key topics and questions were formulated for each group and included risk stratification, optimum treatment strategies, and recommendations regarding light-based therapies. A systematic PubMed search was performed of English-language articles published between December 1, 2008, and December 1, 2018, as well as other pertinent studies identified by the expert panel. Clinical practice guidelines were recommended. Treatment of PWBs is indicated to minimize the psychosocial impact and diminish nodularity and potentially tissue hypertrophy. Better outcomes may be attained if treatments are started at an earlier age. In the US, pulsed dye laser is the standard for all PWBs regardless of the lesion size, location, or color. When performed by experienced physicians, laser treatment can be safe for patients of all ages. The choice of using general anesthesia in young patients is a complex decision that must be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Clinical data were reviewed for two children of penile involvement of IgAV/HSP in our hospital. More clinical cases were retrieved from the databases of PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus from database inception to February 1, 2020. We presented two boys aged three and five years both of whom had penile lesions after presenting with the typical rash of IgAV/HSP on lower extremities. The penile lesions improved entirely in a few days without treatment in one and with corticosteroid treatment in the other. The literature review revealed 12 articles describing 20 patients with penile involvement of IgAV/HSP. The penile findings were edema, erythema, ecchymosis, purpuric rash, edema, color change, stiffness of the shaft or prepuce, and tenderness. Penile lesions appeared before the purpuric rash of IgAV/HSP in three of 22 patients. The penile involvement could make the diagnosis challenging especially if the penile lesions appear before the typical rash of the disease. The lesions improved entirely in the short term in all patients; in five without treatment in fifteen after corticosteroid or immunosuppressive drug treatment.

Sixty-two children with ADHD and 33 age-matched, typically developing students were evaluated with Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices and the spelling and arithmetic subtests of the Brazilian School Achievement Test. Dimensional ADHD symptomatology was reported by parents. Our findings suggest that fluid intelligence has a significant impact on academic tests through inattention. The inattentive dimension was the principal behavioral source of influence, also accounting for the association of hyperactive-impulsive manifestations with school achievement. This cognitive-to-behavioral influence path seems to be independent of diagnosis related group, and gender, but lower socioeconomic status might increase its strength.

These unmet needs for partnership in care or support were particularly experienced by parents of color or of low socioeconomic status.

533,533,34981493,"With a prevalence of 0.7 to 29.6%, functional constipation (FC) is a common pediatric complaint worldwide. Current therapeutic strategies for FC mainly include prevention and treatment of fecal impaction, by administration of oral laxatives or rectal medications. However, these agents have been reported to have limited efficacy and a number of serious side effects. In traditional Persian medicine, local application of olive oil was used to relieve childhood constipation. In this pilot placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, the laxative effects of the external use of olive oil ointment in 1- to 4-year-old children with functional constipation were investigated. Forty patients with FC were randomly assigned in olive oil ointment or placebo groups, receiving either an ointment containing 85% olive oil or a comparable placebo or an ointment containing 85% liquid paraffin adjusted to have color and odor similar to those of intervention ointment, twice a day for 4 days. Rome III criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) were used to identify eligible patients from three hospitals. The primary outcome measure was treatment success, defined as ≥1 spontaneous stools per day, without episodes of fecal impaction at endpoint (day 4). The secondary outcome measure was the frequency of fecal incontinence, abdominal discomfort or flatulence, painful defecation, and dermal irritations (adverse effect). Improvements in stool frequency started from day 1 and continued up to day 4 (end of the study) and were significantly greater in patients receiving olive oil ointment in comparison with placebo group (p < 0.05). No adverse effect (including fecal incontinence, painful defecation, gripe and skin reaction, etc.) was reported in intervention and placebo groups during the study. Olive oil ointment used in this study can be presented as a safe, well-tolerated, and effective herbal preparation in children with functional constipation.

BN has been described as acquired as found in a similar entity, congenital smooth muscle hamartoma (CSMH). This study was aimed at evaluating the clinicopathological aspects of BN in Korean cases in differential diagnosis with CSMH. We performed a retrospective study of 103 patients histopathologically diagnosed as having BN or CSMH. The cases included 40 cases diagnosed with BN or CSMH before the age of 10 years who had clinical monitoring and a second skin biopsy after puberty to determine the disease course. Among cases of children to adolescents (<18 years), we observed a slight male predominance. Among children aged <14 years, sex ratio converged at 1:1. Early-onset BN showed a female predominance and hyperpigmented skin lesions. All BN cases showed hyperpigmentation, and face and neck involvement tended to make severe cosmetic concerns. In contrast, hypertrichosis was more frequent in CSMH. Either skin-colored lesion or pseudo-Darier's sign was not seen in early-onset BN. BN showed less dermal smooth muscle than CSMH. Androgens themselves do not seem to be related to the development of BN but play only an aggravating role especially in male patients. Considering high occurrence in exposed areas, BN may distress patients severely. As early laser treatment may be helpful in some patients with BN, early-onset BN in comparison to CSMH should be diagnosed appropriately.

535,535,34155974,"Hair greying is a hallmark of aging generally believed to be irreversible and linked to psychological stress. Here, we develop an approach to profile hair pigmentation patterns (HPPs) along individual human hair shafts, producing quantifiable physical timescales of rapid greying transitions. Using this method, we show white/grey hairs that naturally regain pigmentation across sex, ethnicities, ages, and body regions, thereby quantitatively defining the reversibility of greying in humans. Molecularly, grey hairs upregulate proteins related to energy metabolism, mitochondria, and antioxidant defenses. Combining HPP profiling and proteomics on single hairs, we also report hair greying and reversal that can occur in parallel with psychological stressors. To generalize these observations, we develop a computational simulation, which suggests a threshold-based mechanism for the temporary reversibility of greying. Overall, this new method to quantitatively map recent life history in HPPs provides an opportunity to longitudinally examine the influence of recent life exposures on human biology. This work was supported by the Wharton Fund and NIH grants GM119793, MH119336, and AG066828 (MP). Hair greying is a visible sign of aging that affects everyone. The loss of hair color is due to the loss of melanin, a pigment found in the skin, eyes and hair. Research in mice suggests stress may accelerate hair greying, but there is no definitive research on this in humans. This is because there are no research tools to precisely map stress and hair color over time. But, just like tree rings hold information about past decades, and rocks hold information about past centuries, hairs hold information about past months and years. Hair growth is an active process that happens under the skin inside hair follicles. It demands lots of energy, supplied by structures inside cells called mitochondria. While hairs are growing, cells receive chemical and electrical signals from inside the body, including stress hormones. It is possible that these exposures change proteins and other molecules laid down in the growing hair shaft. As the hair grows out of the scalp, it hardens, preserving these molecules into a stable form. This preservation is visible as patterns of pigmentation. Examining single-hairs and matching the patterns to life events could allow researchers to look back in time through a person’s biological history. Rosenberg et al. report a new way to digitize and measure small changes in color along single human hairs. This method revealed that some white hairs naturally regain their color, something that had not been reported in a cohort of healthy individuals before. Aligning the hair pigmentation patterns with recent reports of stress in the hair donors’ lives showed striking associations. When one donor reported an increase in stress, a hair lost its pigment. When the donor reported a reduction in stress, the same hair regained its pigment. Rosenberg et al. mapped hundreds of proteins inside the hairs to show that white hairs contained more proteins linked to mitochondria and energy use. This suggests that metabolism and mitochondria may play a role in hair greying. To explore these observations in more detail Rosenberg et al. developed a mathematical model that simulates the greying of a whole head of hair over a lifetime, an experiment impossible to do with living people. The model suggested that there might be a threshold for temporary greying; if hairs are about to go grey anyway, a stressful event might trigger that change earlier. And when the stressful event ends, if a hair is just above the threshold, then it could revert back to dark. The new method for measuring small changes in hair coloring opens up the possibility of using hair pigmentation patterns like tree rings. This could track the influence of past life events on human biology. In the future, monitoring hair pigmentation patterns could provide a way to trace the effectiveness of treatments aimed at reducing stress or slowing the aging process. Understanding how ‘old’ white hairs regain their ‘young’ pigmented state could also reveal new information about the malleability of human aging more generally.

537,537,28987706,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are carcinogenic and neurotoxic combustion by-products commonly found in urban air. Exposure to PAH is disproportionately high in low income communities of color who also experience chronic economic stress. In a prospective cohort study in New York City (NYC) we previously found a significant association between prenatal PAH exposure and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) behavior problems at age 9. Here, we have evaluated the joint effects of prenatal exposure to PAH and prenatal/childhood material hardship on ADHD behavior problems. We enrolled nonsmoking African-American and Dominican pregnant women in New York City between 1998 and 2006 and followed their children through 9 years of age. As a biomarker of prenatal PAH exposure, PAH-DNA adducts were measured in maternal blood at delivery and were dichotomized at the limit of detection (to indicate high vs. low exposure). Maternal material hardship (lack of adequate food, housing, utilities, and clothing) was self-reported prenatally and at multiple time points through child age 9. Latent variable analysis identified four distinct patterns of hardship. ADHD behavior problems were assessed using the Conners Parent Rating Scale- Revised. Analyses adjusted for relevant covariates. Among 351 children in our sample, across all hardship groups, children with high prenatal PAH exposure (high adducts) generally had more symptoms of ADHD (higher scores) compared to those with low PAH exposure. The greatest difference was seen among the children with hardship persisting from pregnancy through childhood. Although the interactions between high PAH exposure and hardship experienced at either period (""persistent"" hardship or ""any"" hardship) were not significant, we observed significant differences in the number of ADHD symptoms between children with high prenatal PAH exposure and either persistent hardship or any hardship compared to the others. These differences were most significant for combined high PAH and persistent hardship: ADHD Index (p < 0.008), DSM-IV Inattentive (p = 0.006), DSM-IV Hyperactive Impulsive problems (p = 0.033), and DSM-IV Index Total (p = 0.009). The present findings add to existing evidence that co-exposure to socioeconomic disadvantage and air pollution in early life significantly increases the risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. They suggest the need for multifaceted interventions to protect pregnant mothers and their children.

Parenchymal echogenicity changes, renal pelvis dilatation, and the presence of a focal suspected lesion were assessed using conventional grayscale ultrasound. The presence and location of a decreased perfusion area were evaluated using color Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) and CEUS. Agreement between each ultrasound examination and a 99mTc‒dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan was assessed using the κ value, and the most visible period of the lesion was evaluated using CEUS. This study enrolled 21 participants (median age, 8.0 months; range, 2.0-61.0 months) with isolated urinary tract pathogens. Five increased parenchymal echotextures (11.9%) and 14 renal pelvic dilatations (33.3%) were confirmed, but no focal lesions were detected on the grayscale images. CDUS and CEUS showed decreased local perfusion suggestive of APN in two and five kidneys, respectively. DMSA scan showed substantial agreement with CEUS findings (κ = 0.80, P = 0.010), but other grayscale and CDUS findings did not agree with DMSA scan results (P > 0.05).

539,539,9007465,"It is known that the etiology of congenital biliary dilatation (CBD) is closely associated with pancreaticobiliary maljunction (PBMJ). Treatment of CBD today is primary excision of the cyst followed by hepaticoenterostomy. However, PBMJ without dilatation of the biliary tract has recently been reported and its treatment is still controversial. In adults, simple cholecystectomy without biliary reconstruction is often performed, because it usually presents as an anomaly of the gallbladder. Over 30 years, we have encountered 8 patients with PBMJ without dilatation of the common bile duct in 180 pediatric cases of CBD. The presenting symptoms of these patients were those of pancreatitis i.e. abdominal pain associated with elevation of serum amylase levels. Five cases presented with jaundice or a history of pale colored stools. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed to confirm the diagnosis. Five (62.5%) of these 8 patients were found to have dilatation of the common channel, which was seen in 50 (29%) of the 172 other cases with biliary tract dilatation. Three cases (37.5%) had proven protein plugs or debris at the level of the common channel, and this was observed in 28 (16%) of the 172 other cases. It is strongly suggested that the manifestation of clinical symptoms in these patients results from stasis or obstruction at the level of the common channel. In children who present with recurrent pancreatitis, PBMJ must be suspected even if the common bile duct appears to be normal. It is difficult to resolve these anomalies without operative repair. The authors consider that radical treatment of PBMJ is required in these children to prevent serious long-term complications.

Intrinsic host factors, such as age, can influence disease severity. Glycosylation plays a critical role in influenza pathogenesis; however, the molecular drivers of influenza outcomes remain unknown. In this work, we characterized the host glycomic response to the H1N1 2009 pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1pdm09) as a function of age-dependent severity in a ferret model. Using our dual-color lectin microarray technology, we examined baseline glycosylation and glycomic response to infection in newly weaned and aged animals, models for young children and the elderly, respectively. Compared to adult uninfected ferrets, we observed higher levels of α-2,6-sialosides, the receptor for H1N1pdm09, in newly weaned and aged animals. We also observed age-dependent loss of O-linked α-2,3-sialosides. The loss of these highly charged groups may impact viral clearance by mucins, which corresponds to the lower clearance rates observed in aged animals. Upon infection, we observed dramatic changes in the glycomes of aged animals, a population severely impacted by the virus. In contrast, no significant alterations were observed in the newly weaned animals, which show mild to moderate responses to the H1N1pdm09. High mannose, a glycan recently identified as a marker of severity in adult animals, increased with severity in the aged population. However, the response was delayed, in line with the delayed development of pneumonia observed.

In this study, we present a flap pedicled by the thoracic branch of supraclavicular artery (TBSA). The flap is located at the subclavicular region, and has the advantage of large dimension, matching colour and thin thickness. In this series, 24 patients with ages ranging between 3 and 49 years (30 flaps with six patients in bilateral fashion) were treated in the authors' institution. The maximum size of the flap was 25 cm × 25 cm, whereas the minimum size was 15 cm × 10 cm. The average size of the flaps was 241.1 ± 95.7 cm(2). Twenty-six flaps (86.7%) survived completely. Total flap loss was seen in one patient (3.3%) and was treated with reverse harvesting skin graft. Partial flap necrosis occurred in three flaps (10.0%). Through a mean time of 10-month follow-up, the colour and the texture of the flaps matched with the recipient area. No conspicuous flap contracture was observed. This expanded subclavicular flap pedicled by the TBSA has proved to be a promising method with satisfactory outcome and high success rate.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic reliability of the Tzanck smear in erosive vesiculobullous, tumoral, and granulomatous diseases. Patients evaluated by Tzanck smear at Başkent University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Dermatology, between February 2009 and July 2010, were included. Three dermatologists were involved in the study. Dermatologist A performed a clinical dermatologic examination, took the smear material, made a clinical diagnosis, and compared the clinical and cytological diagnoses. Dermatologists B and C evaluated the smears. Agreement between the latter two dermatologists on the cytological diagnoses was determined. In 500 patients, a total of 272 (54%) erosive vesiculobullous, 190 (38%) tumoral, and 38 (8%) granulomatous lesions were diagnosed. The diagnostic reliability of the Tzanck smear was reasonably substantial (κ = 0.59) for all types of lesions, substantial for erosive vesiculobullous (κ = 0.79) and granulomatous (κ = 0.68) lesions, and moderate (κ = 0.50) for tumoral lesions.

This population-based study was carried out in 26 children, 5-7 years of age, born prematurely without ROP. All children underwent a full ocular examination, including corrected visual acuity, cycloplegic refractive errors, color vision, ocular alignment, and anterior and posterior segment examinations. Anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, vitreous length, and total axial length were measured. There was no correlation between the degree of prematurity and visual acuity or refractive state. Two (7.7%) subjects had strabismus, two (7.7%) had amblyopia, and four (15%) had anisometropia. Total axial length was significantly correlated with both gestational age at birth (r=0.822, P<0.001) and birth weight (r=0.569, P=0.003). Similarly, vitreous length was also significantly correlated with gestational age (r=0.744, P<0.001) and birth weight (r=0.553, P=0.004). This study showed that although the globe gets longer as gestational age approaches term and as birth weight increases, this condition does not result in any significant refractive error.

557,557,36753150,"Morphea is an insidious inflammatory disorder of the skin and deeper tissues. Determining disease activity is challenging yet important to medical decision-making and patient outcomes. To develop and validate a scoring tool, the Morphea Activity Measure (MAM), to evaluate morphea disease activity of any type or severity that is easy to use in clinical and research settings. This pilot diagnostic study was conducted from September 9, 2019, to March 6, 2020, in 2 phases: development and validation. During the development phase, 14 morphea experts (dermatologists and pediatric dermatologists) used a Delphi consensus method to determine items that would be included in the MAM. The validation phase included 8 investigators who evaluated the tool in collaboration with 14 patients with pediatric morphea (recruited from a referral center [Medical College of Wisconsin]) during a 1-day in-person meeting on March 6, 2020. During the development phase, online survey items were evaluated by experts in morphea using a Likert scale (score range, 0-10, with 0 indicating not important and 10 indicating very important); agreement was defined as a median score of 7.0 or higher, disagreement as a median score of 3.9 or lower, and no consensus as a median score of 4.0 to 6.9. During the validation phase, reliability (interrater and intrarater agreement using intraclass correlation coefficients), validity (using the content validity index and κ statistics as well as correlations with the modified Localized Scleroderma Severity Index and the Physician Global Assessment of Activity using Spearman ρ coefficients), and viability (using qualitative interviews of investigators who used the MAM tool) were evaluated. Descriptive statistics were used for quantitative variables. Data on race and ethnicity categories were collected but not analyzed because skin color was more relevant for the purposes of this study. Among 14 survey respondents during the development phase, 9 (64.3%) were pediatric dermatologists and 5 (35.7%) were dermatologists. After 2 rounds, a final tool was developed comprising 10 items that experts agreed were indicative of morphea activity (new lesion in the past 3 months, enlarging lesion in the past 3 months, linear lesion developing progressive atrophy in the past 3 months, erythema, violaceous rim or color, warmth to the touch, induration, white-yellow or waxy appearance, shiny white wrinkling, and body surface area). The validation phase was conducted with 14 patients (median age, 14.5 years [range, 8.0-18.0 years]; 8 [57.1%] female), 2 dermatologists, and 6 pediatric dermatologists. Interrater and intrarater agreement for MAM total scores was good, with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.844 (95% CI, 0.681-0.942) for interrater agreement and 0.856 (95% CI, 0.791-0.901) for intrarater agreement. Correlations between the MAM and the modified Localized Scleroderma Severity Index (Spearman ρ = 0.747; P < .001) and the MAM and the Physician Global Assessment of Activity (Spearman ρ = 0.729; P < .001) were moderately strong. In qualitative interviews, evaluators agreed that the tool was easy to use, measured morphea disease activity at a single time point, and should be responsive to changes in morphea disease activity over multiple time points.

The current study aimed to assess the image quality, indications and limitations of a portable pocket ""EchoScope"" compared with a high-end ultrasound system in abdominal diseases. 231 consecutive patients were included in this study. Physician A performed ultrasound examinations with a high-end ultrasound system (HEUS), then physician B performed the same ultrasound examination using an EchoScope (Vscan™). In patients with focal lesions, physician B also measured the largest diameters and graded the vascularity by using colour Doppler imaging (CDI) within the lesion on the same plane with both ultrasound systems. Compared with the excellent image quality using HEUS, the image quality of the EchoScope was graded as good, sufficient or non-sufficient. Out of all 231 patients, 167 had focal lesions, 19 patients were found with diffuse pathological findings, six with ascites, six after liver puncture and 33 without any pathological findings. The image quality of the pocket device was considered as being good or sufficient to delineate the pathology in 225/231 (97.4 %). The detection rate of the EchoScope for abdominal focal lesion was 162/167 (97 %), only five superficially located lesions could not be detected.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the technical feasibility and clinical efficiency of confocal laser endomicroscopy in patients with Hirschsprung's disease and allied disorders in vivo. Confocal laser endomicroscopy was performed in vivo in two patients to confirm the presence of the enteric nervous system during surgery in patients with Hirschsprung's disease and allied disorders. Cresyl violet was gently injected from the serosal side into the muscular layer of the intestine, and scanning was performed within 30 min. Then, the scanned intestines were resected, and the visualized area of the specimens was pathologically evaluated. The ganglion cell nuclei and the enteric nervous system network were clearly visualized intraoperatively in both cases.

566,566,38364572,"Chemical exposures often occur in mixtures and exposures during pregnancy may lead to adverse effects on the fetal brain, potentially reducing lower cognitive abilities and fine motor function of the child. We investigated the association of motheŕs exposure to a mixture of chemicals during pregnancy (i.e., organochlorine compounds, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, phenols, phthalates, organophosphate pesticides) with cognitive abilties and fine motor function in their children. We studied 1097 mother-child pairs from five European cohorts participating in the Human Early Life Exposome study (HELIX). Measurement of 26 biomarkers of exposure to chemicals was performed on urine or blood samples of pregnant women (mean age 31 years). Cognitive abilities and fine motor function were assessed in their children (mean age 8 years) with a battery of computerized tests administered in person (Raveńs Coloured Progressive Matrices, Attention Network Test, N-back Test, Trail Making Test, Finger Tapping Test). We estimated the joint effect of prenatal exposure to chemicals on cognitive abilities and fine motor function using the quantile-based g-computation method, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. A quartile increase in all the chemicals in the overall mixture was associated with worse fine motor function, specifically lower scores in the Finger Tapping Test [-8.5 points, 95 % confidence interval (CI) -13.6 to -3.4; -14.5 points, 95 % CI -22.4 to -6.6, and -18.0 points, 95 % CI -28.6 to -7.4) for the second, third and fourth quartile of the overal mixture, respectively, when compared to the first quartile]. Organochlorine compounds, phthalates, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances contributed most to this association. We did not find a relationship with cognitive abilities.

We, therefore, assessed current vitiligo treatment coverage policies across major United States health insurers to determine current patterns and coverage gaps for vitiligo. The study surveyed 15 commercial health care insurers, 50 BlueCross BlueShield (BCBS) plans, Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Affairs. Information on treatment coverage for vitiligo, specifically pimecrolimus and tacrolimus, excimer laser therapy, PUVA, and narrow-band (nb)UVB, was collected via an online review of insurance policy documents, confirmed with phone calls to organization representatives, or via a survey of Medicaid providers, and state Medicaid directors. Of 17 organizations with regional or national coverage policies, 12% did not cover topical calcineurin inhibitors, 56% did not cover nbUVB phototherapy, 53% did not cover PUVA phototherapy, and 41% did not cover laser therapy. For BCBS, pimecrolimus and tacrolimus were not covered in 39% and 35% of states, respectively. NbUVB and PUVA therapy were not covered in 20% and 10% of states, respectively. Excimer laser therapy was not covered in 82% of states. Out of 32 states with accessible Medicaid information, 11 did not cover topicals, 5 did not cover nbUVB, 4 did not cover PUVA, and 7 did not cover laser. Two commonly cited reasons for coverage denial were that the treatment indication was considered cosmetic, and certain therapies are not FDA-approved. There is inequity in the distribution of health among vitiligo patients given current patterns of insurance coverage for treatment, which may have disproportionate impact on patients of color.

A total of 241 patients from 168 families across 15 sites in 9 countries with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in PRPH2 were included. Records were reviewed for age at symptom onset, visual acuity, full-field ERG, fundus colour photography, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), and SD-OCT. Images were graded into six phenotypes. Statistical analyses were performed to determine genotype-phenotype correlations. The median age at symptom onset was 40 years (range, 4-78 years). FAF phenotypes included normal (5%), butterfly pattern dystrophy, or vitelliform macular dystrophy (11%), central areolar choroidal dystrophy (28%), pseudo-Stargardt pattern dystrophy (41%), and retinitis pigmentosa (25%). Symptom onset was earlier in retinitis pigmentosa as compared with pseudo-Stargardt pattern dystrophy (34 vs 44 years; P = 0.004). The median visual acuity was 0.18 logMAR (interquartile range, 0-0.54 logMAR) and 0.18 logMAR (interquartile range 0-0.42 logMAR) in the right and left eyes, respectively. ERG showed a significantly reduced amplitude across all components (P < 0.001) and a peak time delay in the light-adapted 30-Hz flicker and single-flash b-wave (P < 0.001). Twenty-two variants were novel. The central areolar choroidal dystrophy phenotype was associated with 13 missense variants. The remaining variants showed marked phenotypic variability. We described six distinct FAF phenotypes associated with variants in the PRPH2 gene. One FAF phenotype may have multiple ERG phenotypes, demonstrating a discordance between structure and function.

570,570,16479861,"The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of creating archetypal 3D faces through computerized 3D facial averaging. A 3D surface scanner Fiore and its software were used to acquire the 3D scans of the faces while 3D Rugle3 and locally-developed software generated the holistic facial averages. 3D facial averages were created from two ethnic groups; European and Japanese and from children with three previous genetic disorders; Williams syndrome, achondroplasia and Sotos syndrome as well as the normal control group. The method included averaging the corresponding depth (z) coordinates of the 3D facial scans. Compared with other face averaging techniques there was not any warping or filling in the spaces by interpolation; however, this facial average lacked colour information. The results showed that as few as 14 faces were sufficient to create an archetypal facial average. In turn this would make it practical to use face averaging as an identification tool in cases where it would be difficult to recruit a larger number of participants. In generating the average, correcting for size differences among faces was shown to adjust the average outlines of the facial features. It is assumed that 3D facial averaging would help in the identification of the ethnic status of persons whose identity may not be known with certainty. In clinical medicine, it would have a great potential for the diagnosis of syndromes with distinctive facial features. The system would also assist in the education of clinicians in the recognition and identification of such syndromes.

571,571,1410042,"We compared the survival of cultured epithelial allografts and epithelial autografts applied to donor sites for split-thickness skin grafts. Before grafting, cultured epithelium was devoid of Langerhans cells (LCs) or lymphoid cells by immunohistochemical and electron microscopic examinations. The autografts attached to the wounds permanently, without any clinical evidence of rejection. In contrast, allografts, which were mismatched for MHC and blood-type antigens, appeared to adhere firmly only until day 7. By the second week, signs of graft rejection were apparent: The graft changed color, and the underlying dermis underwent ""microerosion"" and denudation. By the third week, the area formerly occupied by the allograft had the same coloration as ungrafted wounds and apparently had undergone reepithelialization by the host. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies clearly demonstrated that host Langerhans-like cells (without Birbeck granules) appeared in both autografts and allografts. However, these cells were numerous and distributed widely throughout allografts, whereas they were scarce and confined to the basal layer of autografts. Typical Langerhans cells (containing Birbeck granules) were present in the prickle-cell layer of autografts by day 7. The present study strongly indicates that allografts of cultured epithelium are rejected. Furthermore, given the known ability of Langerhans-like cells to function as accessory cells in T-cell activation, our results point to a role for host Langerhans-like cells in immunologically mediated rejection of the epithelial allografts.

Understanding the anatomic features associated with transplantation was crucial to understanding the post-surgical imaging characteristics. Changes in visceral anatomic structure caused a variety of imaging appearances, some of them misleading: (a) Some patients had unusual bowel gas patterns on plain radiographs because of a shift in location by bowel loops; (b) gastrointestinal studies showed gastric compression by an oversized left lobe that mimicked mass effect; and (c) displacement or migration of the duodenum, jejunum, or cecum into the right hepatic fossa sometimes mimicked malrotation.

574,574,28372570,"Malaria is a major world health issue and its continued burden is due, in part, to difficulties in the diagnosis of the illness. The World Health Organization recommends confirmatory testing using microscopy-based techniques or rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for all cases of suspected malaria. In regions where Plasmodium species are indigenous, there are multiple etiologies of fever leading to misdiagnoses, especially in populations where HIV is prevalent and children. To determine the frequency of malaria infection in febrile patients over an 8-month period at the Regional Hospital in Bamenda, Cameroon, we evaluated the clinical efficacy of the Flourescence and Staining Technology (FAST) Malaria stain and ParaLens Advance Peripheral blood samples from 522 patients with a clinical diagnosis of ""suspected malaria"" were evaluated using GS and FM methods. A nested PCR assay was the gold standard to compare the two methods. PCR positivity, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were determined. Four hundred ninety nine samples were included in the final analysis. Of these, 30 were positive via PCR (6.01%) with a mean PPV of 19.62% and 27.99% for GS and FM, respectively. The mean NPV was 95.01% and 95.28% for GS and FM, respectively. Sensitivity was 26.67% in both groups and specificity was 92.78% and 96.21% for GS and FM, respectively. An increased level of diagnostic discrepancy was observed between technicians based upon skill level using GS, which was not seen with FM. The frequency of malarial infections confirmed via PCR among patients presenting with fever and other symptoms of malaria was dramatically lower than that anticipated based upon physicians' clinical suspicions. A correlation between technician skill and accuracy of malaria diagnosis using GS was observed that was less pronounced using FM. Additionally, FM increased the specificity and improved the PPV, suggesting this relatively low cost approach could be useful in resource-limited environments. Anecdotally, physicians were reluctant to not treat all patients symptomatically before results were known and in spite of a negative microscopic diagnosis, highlighting the need for further physician education to avoid this practice of overtreatment. A larger study in an area with a known high prevalence is being planned to compare the two microscopy methods against available RDTs.

To investigate effects of ASAP on cardiac function and atrioventricular mechanical interactions in the young, 26 subjects (ages 10 to 23 years) with normal cardiac anatomy, function, and atrioventricular node conduction underwent echocardiography during electrophysiology studies while in sinus rhythm (NSR), and with temporary pacing from high right atrium (HRA), RAA, mid septal right atrium approximating Bachmann's bundle (BB), and left atrium (LA) via the distal coronary sinus (CS). After a paced steady state of 10 minutes, left atrial total and systolic ejection fractions, color-guided mitral inflow, and annular tissue Doppler indices were obtained. Left ventricular ejection fraction and myocardial performance indexes (MPI) were calculated. The total and systolic LA ejection fractions were higher during the NSR compared to all ASAP. Mitral inflow velocities changed significantly with ASAP. The passive/active ventricular filling ratio (E/A) deteriorated from NSR to HRA to BB to CS. There were significant changes in late diastolic tissue Doppler velocities during ASAP compared to NSR. The MPI during ASAP differed from those during the NSR. HRA and Bachmann bundle pacing provided better MPIs than RAA or CS pacing. The location of atrial pacing leads has an acute impact on cardiac function and atrioventricular mechanical interaction.

This study seeks to assess the accuracy of the Broselow tape and age-based formulas in predicting weights of South Sudanese children of varying nutritional status. This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study using data from existing acute malnutrition screening programs for children less than 5 years of age in South Sudan. Using anthropometric measurements, actual weights were compared with estimated weights from the Broselow tape and three age-based formulas. Mid-upper arm circumference was used to determine if each child was malnourished. Broselow accuracy was assessed by the percentage of measured weights falling into the same color zone as the predicted weight. For each method, accuracy was assessed by mean percentage error and percentage of predicted weights falling within 10% of actual weight. All data were analyzed by nutritional status subgroup. Only 10.7% of malnourished and 26.6% of nonmalnourished children had their actual weight fall within the Broselow color zone corresponding to their length. The Broselow method overestimated weight by a mean of 26.6% in malnourished children and 16.6% in nonmalnourished children (p < 0.001). Age-based formulas also overestimated weight, with mean errors ranging from 16.2% over actual weight (Advanced Pediatric Life Support in nonmalnourished children) to 70.9% over actual (Best Guess in severely malnourished children). The Broselow tape and age-based formulas selected for comparison were all markedly inaccurate in both the nonmalnourished and the malnourished populations studied, worsening with increasing malnourishment.

Although GT has shown great success in clinical trials enrolling these individuals, evidence for stability and durability of this treatment over time is still unknown. Herein we explored the value of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as an objective measure to assess independently the longevity of retinal GT. Individuals with RPE65 mutations who underwent GT in their worse-seeing eye in a phase 1 clinical trial received a second subretinal injection in their contralateral eye in a follow-on clinical trial. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed longitudinally to assess brain responses of patients with RPE65 mutations after stimulation of their most recently treated eye before and 1 to 3 years after GT. Seven participants with RPE65 mutations who were part of the follow-on clinical trial gave informed consent to participate in a longitudinal neuroimaging fMRI study. All participants underwent fMRI using a 3-Tesla MRI system and a 32-channel head coil. Participants' cortical activations were assessed using a block design paradigm of contrast reversing checkerboard stimuli delivered using an MRI-compatible video system. The primary parameters being measured in this study were the qualitative and quantitative fMRI cortical activations produced by our population in response to the visual task. Functional MRI results showed minimal or no cortical responses before GT. Significant increase in cortical activation lasting at least 3 years after GT was observed for all participants. Repeated measures analysis showed significant associations between cortical activations and clinical measures such as full-field light sensitivity threshold for white, red, and blue colors; visual field; and pupillary light reflex. Participants with RPE65 mutations showed intact visual pathways, which became responsive and strengthened after treatment. Functional MRI results independently revealed the efficacy and durability of a 1-time subretinal injection. The fMRI results paralleled those recently reported during the long-term clinical evaluations of the same patients. Results from this study demonstrated that fMRI may play an important role in providing complementary information to patients' ophthalmic clinical evaluation and has usefulness as an outcome measure for future retinal intervention studies.

Post-resuscitative clinical features associated with survival included sinus cardiac rhythm (p=0.012), normal heart rate (p=0.008), normal blood pressure (p<0.001), urine output>1 ml/kg/h (p=0.002), normal skin color (p=0.016), lack of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)-induced rib fracture (p=0.044), initial Glasgow Coma Scale score>7 (p<0.001), and duration of in-hospital CPR<or=10 min (p<0.001). Furthermore, these variables were also significantly associated with the duration of survival (all p<0.05). The most important predictors of survival to hospital discharge in children with OHCA who achieve sustained ROSC are a normal heart rate, normal blood pressure, and an initial urine output>1 ml/kg/h.

In the face of acute and slow-moving natural disasters, women, and particularly women of color, will be more susceptible to gender-based violence, displacement, and other socioeconomic stressors, all of which have adverse mental health outcomes. Among the social consequences of climate change, eco-anxiety resulting from these negative impacts is also increasingly a significant factor in family planning and reproductive justice, as well as disruptions of the feminine connection to nature that numerous cultures historically and currently honor. This narrative review will discuss these sociologic factors and also touch on ways that practitioners can become involved in climate-related advocacy for the physical and mental well-being of their patients.

582,582,28538724,"The organization of the eukaryotic cell into discrete membrane-bound organelles allows for the separation of incompatible biochemical processes, but the activities of these organelles must be coordinated. For example, lipid metabolism is distributed between the endoplasmic reticulum for lipid synthesis, lipid droplets for storage and transport, mitochondria and peroxisomes for β-oxidation, and lysosomes for lipid hydrolysis and recycling. It is increasingly recognized that organelle contacts have a vital role in diverse cellular functions. However, the spatial and temporal organization of organelles within the cell remains poorly characterized, as fluorescence imaging approaches are limited in the number of different labels that can be distinguished in a single image. Here we present a systems-level analysis of the organelle interactome using a multispectral image acquisition method that overcomes the challenge of spectral overlap in the fluorescent protein palette. We used confocal and lattice light sheet instrumentation and an imaging informatics pipeline of five steps to achieve mapping of organelle numbers, volumes, speeds, positions and dynamic inter-organelle contacts in live cells from a monkey fibroblast cell line. We describe the frequency and locality of two-, three-, four- and five-way interactions among six different membrane-bound organelles (endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, lysosome, peroxisome, mitochondria and lipid droplet) and show how these relationships change over time. We demonstrate that each organelle has a characteristic distribution and dispersion pattern in three-dimensional space and that there is a reproducible pattern of contacts among the six organelles, that is affected by microtubule and cell nutrient status. These live-cell confocal and lattice light sheet spectral imaging approaches are applicable to any cell system expressing multiple fluorescent probes, whether in normal conditions or when cells are exposed to disturbances such as drugs, pathogens or stress. This methodology thus offers a powerful descriptive tool and can be used to develop hypotheses about cellular organization and dynamics.

585,585,36149727,"T cell-mediated immunity plays an important role in controlling flavivirus infection, either after vaccination or after natural infection. The ""quality"" of a T cell needs to be assessed by function, and higher function is associated with more powerful immune protection. T cells that can simultaneously produce two or more cytokines or chemokines at the single-cell level are called polyfunctional T cells (TPFs), which mediate immune responses through a variety of molecular mechanisms to express degranulation markers (CD107a) and secrete interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-2, or macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α. There is increasing evidence that TPFs are closely related to the maintenance of long-term immune memory and protection and that their increased proportion is an important marker of protective immunity and is important in the effective control of viral infection and reactivation. This evaluation applies not only to specific immune responses but also to the assessment of cross-reactive immune responses.

587,587,23558836,"Color flow Doppler ultrasonography has been used to confirm caudal epidural injection, but its ability to detect accidental intrathecal injection is unknown. We hypothesized that, when using color flow Doppler, the injection of fluid into the epidural space would result in turbulent flow which would appear as a burst of color while intrathecal injection would show an absence of a color flow Doppler signal. Two groups of pediatric patients (up to 6 years of age) were prospectively enrolled for this observational study during a 2-month period. One group (group E) consisted of patients suitable for elective surgery using caudal epidural analgesia, and the other (group I) included patients receiving lumbar puncture for intrathecal chemotherapeutic injection. After induction of general anesthesia and placement of the patient in the lateral position, an 8 MHz curved array probe (Sonosite TITAN, Bothell, WA) was applied to obtain a transverse image of the lumbar region (L1-L3). Real-time images using color flow Doppler were obtained and recorded during initial injections of 2 consecutive (20 seconds apart) aliquots of 0.1 mL/kg medication of local anesthetic (0.25% bupivacaine) or chemotherapy drugs (mixture of methotrexate, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone) at a rate of 0.5 to 1.0 mL/s. After obtaining the study images, the rest of the medication was injected in standard fashion. A blinded anesthesiologist later evaluated the recorded images to determine a positive or negative result (positive = presence of turbulence as illustrated by a medley of color; negative = no turbulence or color). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated for those patients who had successful analgesia (group E) and intrathecal (group I) injections. Forty recorded images from 41 patients (group E, n = 21; group I, n = 20) were included in the analysis.

The assessment of the results of this technique of vaginoplasty was undertaken in several stages: (a) The evaluation of the cosmetic result. (b) The research for a urinary incontinence and urethrovaginal fistulas. (c) The research for a vaginal stenosis by the introduction of a lubricated feeding tube into the vaginal cavity. The labia minora was evaluated by three criteria: its skin should be thin and very supple, it should have a free edge which partially or totally covers the clitoris, urethral meatus, and vaginal orifice; and it is preferable that its color be darker than the rest of the skin. The cosmetic outcome was considered by parents and the surgeon as very satisfactory in 11 patients (50% of cases), satisfactory in 4 patients (18.2%), and unsatisfactory in 7 patients (31.8%). The postoperative complications were five cases of proximal stenosis (22.7%), one distal stenosis (stenosis of introitus) and two necrosis of the preputial flap.

The cannulation of the tract with a guide wire, in these cases, was useful for identifying the thin membranous tract. In one of these three cases sinus fistula recurred, but a complete excision of the tract was then performed by introducing a 10F Nelaton catheter over a guide wire, which allowed for easy handling of the remnant tract. In the remaining case, cannulation proved not to be useful because the tract was short and ran inside the thyroid cartilage.

We examined for evidence of CA stenosis at follow-up angiography and assessed any other CA complications associated with vascular access. There were 61 PCA catheterizations performed in 55 unique patients. Follow-up CA imaging with angiography was available in 43 patients (78%, 43/55). There was no vessel stenosis nor lumen irregularity in 28 (65%) patients. In 15 cases (35%), there was a mild degree of irregularity or narrowing by angiography (median 4.1%, range 2.3%-12.5%). Nine patients underwent repeat PCA catheterizations. Seven of these had no visible vascular stenosis on follow-up angiographic imaging, including a patient who was accessed three separate times from the CA. No statistically significant risk factors for developing mild CA stenosis were identified. PCA access for pediatric interventional catheterization appears to be safe with a very low rate of mild stenosis, and very few complications. Follow-up outcomes in our series are excellent, with a CA patency rate of 100%, even after multiple procedures. Mild CA stenosis was not associated with patient size or sheath introducer caliber. While the acute results from percutaneous CA catheterization have proven safe in recent literature, longer-term outcomes remain unreported. At our institution, the outcomes following percutaneous carotid access are associated with an excellent patency rate of 100%, even after multiple procedures on the same vessel. A low incidence of mild vessel stenosis can be appreciated on follow-up angiography.

We studied the sonographic findings of eight patients with MC, with attention paid to its size, shape, internal echoes, and especially the presence or absence of lateral shadowing and the mode of back echoes. In four cases, the sound velocity and acoustic impedance of cystic fluid were also measured. The mode of blood flow was evaluated by color Doppler sonography. Six cases showed an oval or comma-shaped mass. Internal echoes were present in six cases, and two of them showed a pseudosolid pattern. In these cases, M-mode sonography confirmed the movement of these internal echoes. Only one case showed a posterior echo enhancement, and no case showed lateral shadowing. Sound velocity measured in four cases was 1,515-1,537 m/s, with an acoustic impedance of 1.550-1.576 kg/m2/s. No blood flow signals were obtained from the lesion.

Its advantage in minimally dehydrated children is unproven. To determine if oral hydration with dilute apple juice/preferred fluids is noninferior to electrolyte maintenance solution in children with mild gastroenteritis. Randomized, single-blind noninferiority trial conducted between the months of October and April during the years 2010 to 2015 in a tertiary care pediatric emergency department in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Study participants were children aged 6 to 60 months with gastroenteritis and minimal dehydration. Participants were randomly assigned to receive color-matched half-strength apple juice/preferred fluids (n=323) or apple-flavored electrolyte maintenance solution (n=324). Oral rehydration therapy followed institutional protocols. After discharge, the half-strength apple juice/preferred fluids group was administered fluids as desired; the electrolyte maintenance solution group replaced losses with electrolyte maintenance solution. The primary outcome was a composite of treatment failure defined by any of the following occurring within 7 days of enrollment: intravenous rehydration, hospitalization, subsequent unscheduled physician encounter, protracted symptoms, crossover, and 3% or more weight loss or significant dehydration at in-person follow-up. Secondary outcomes included intravenous rehydration, hospitalization, and frequency of diarrhea and vomiting. The noninferiority margin was defined as a difference between groups of 7.5% for the primary outcome and was assessed with a 1-sided α=.025. If noninferiority was established, a 1-sided test for superiority was conducted. Among 647 randomized children (mean age, 28.3 months; 331 boys [51.1%]; 441 (68.2%) without evidence of dehydration), 644 (99.5%) completed follow-up. Children who were administered dilute apple juice experienced treatment failure less often than those given electrolyte maintenance solution (16.7% vs 25.0%; difference, -8.3%; 97.5% CI, -∞ to -2.0%; P < .001 for inferiority and P = .006 for superiority). Fewer children administered apple juice/preferred fluids received intravenous rehydration (2.5% vs 9.0%; difference, -6.5%; 99% CI, -11.6% to -1.8%). Hospitalization rates and diarrhea and vomiting frequency were not significantly different between groups. Among children with mild gastroenteritis and minimal dehydration, initial oral hydration with dilute apple juice followed by their preferred fluids, compared with electrolyte maintenance solution, resulted in fewer treatment failures. In many high-income countries, the use of dilute apple juice and preferred fluids as desired may be an appropriate alternative to electrolyte maintenance fluids in children with mild gastroenteritis and minimal dehydration. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01185054.

The echocardiographic diagnosis of CAS and COS in children has not been described. We report on the transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) findings of CAS and COS in children. Six patients, aged 1 week to 12 years, with clinically confirmed COS (n = 5) and CAS (n = l) were diagnosed by TTE. Their echocardiographic findings were compared with 26 healthy control subjects of a similar age range. Left COS was associated with an aberrant left coronary artery (CA) from the contralateral aortic sinus (n = 2), an intramural left CA with d-transposition of the great vessels (n = l), and supravalvular aortic stenosis (n = l). Right COS was present in a patient with aortic valvular stenosis. Acquired left main CAS was diagnosed in the sixth patient 3 years after orthotopic heart transplantation. Coronary ostial stenosis was recognized when a color flow acceleration signal was present proximal to and extending into the coronary ostium (CO). Coronary artery stenosis was detected when a coarctated color flow stream was present within the stenosed CA segment with turbulent distal flow. These findings were not detected in the control cohort who demonstrated laminar CA and CO flow signals. All patients had increased spectral velocity in the CA distal to the stenosed segment (patients = 50 +/- 5 cm/s, controls = 24 +/- 6 cm/sec; P <.01). Delayed peak diastolic velocity seemed to indicate severe stenosis. We conclude that (1) CO acceleration signals and turbulent coarctated CA flow signals are abnormal findings in TTE coronary Doppler assessment. They indicate COS and CAS, respectively. (2) Knowledge of the normal TTE CA flow velocity patterns is essential so that abnormal velocity signals such as seen with CAS and COS can be recognized and a timely diagnosis made.

Children may also present with a reduction of expected hair pigmentation, referred to as pigment dilution, or the development of hair graying. This review aims to provide a streamlined diagnostic approach for pediatric dermatologists when presented with these hair findings. Poliosis should be recognized as a potential diagnostic feature or initial sign in many syndromes and thus can guide clinicians in diagnosing and managing conditions earlier in a patient's care.

The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value in the diagnosis of mesenteric lymphadenitis were 80.00%, 81.97%, 52.17%, and 94.34%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of high-frequency probe in the diagnosis of intussusception in children were 93.44%, 80.00%, 95.00%, and 75.00%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value in the diagnosis of mesenteric lymphadenitis were 93.33%, 95.08%, 82.35%, and 98.31%, respectively. Among the children with appendicitis confirmed by operation and pathology, 69 cases were detected by high-frequency ultrasound and 4 cases were missed (including 3 cases of acute simple appendicitis and 1 case of perforated appendicitis). The false negative was 4%, there was no false positive, and the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 95%, 100%, and 96%. In the same cases, 28 cases were detected by low-frequency ultrasound, 45 cases were missed, the false negative was 61%, and there was no false positive. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 39%, 100%, and 53%. The sensitivity, accuracy, and false negative of high-frequency ultrasound in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis were significantly higher than that of low-frequency ultrasound. This study shows that ultrasound has high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Low-frequency ultrasound can show the whole picture of the disease and the situation in the abdominal cavity, which can better guide the clinical treatment. Color Doppler hemodynamics is a useful supplement to two-dimensional ultrasound, and ultrasound also plays a positive role in the differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis in children.

To estimate the association of gestational age at birth with early childhood trajectories of DD in early childhood for infants born ≥34 and <41 weeks, and determine how various maternal, pregnancy and infant characteristics relate to these trajectory groups. Analysis of mother-child dyad data with infants born ≥34 and <41 weeks gestational age within an observational pregnancy cohort in Alberta, Canada, from 2008 to 2011 (n = 2644). The association between gestational age and trajectories of the total number of Ages and Stages Questionnaire domains indicating risk of DD from 1 through 5 years of age were estimated using group-based trajectory modelling along with other perinatal risk factors. Three distinct trajectory groups were identified: low-risk, moderate-risk (transiently at risk of DD in one domain over time) and high-risk (consistently at risk of delay in ≥2 domains over time). Per week of decreasing gestational age, the risk ratio of membership in the high-risk group increases by 1.77 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.43, 2.20) or 1.84 (95% CI 1.49, 2.27) relative to the moderate-risk and low-risk respectively. Increasing maternal age, identifying as Black, indigenous or a person of colour, elevated maternal depressive symptoms in pregnancy, and male infant sex were associated with high- and moderate-risk trajectories compared to the low-risk trajectory. In combination with decreasing gestational age, poor maternal mental health and social determinants of health increase the probability of membership in trajectories with increased risk of DD, suggesting that additional monitoring of children born late preterm and early term is warranted.

This study investigated the prevalence, predictors of reversibility and the effect of living-related liver transplantation (LRLT) on IPS using contrast echocardiography in patients with end-stage biliary atresia. Fifty consecutive patients with biliary atresia were examined for IPS using contrast echocardiography before and after LRLT until IPS disappeared. The severity of IPS was classified into five grades according to the extent of contrast in the left ventricle (0, none; 1, trivial; 2, apparent; 3, complete but less than in right ventricle; 4, as dense as in right ventricle). Thirty-two patients (grade 1, n = 15; grade 2, n = 7; grade 3, n = 4; grade 4, n = 6) had IPS before LRLT. Forty-four patients have survived for 9-26 months after LRLT. Among patients with grade 3 or 4 IPS (n = 8), there was a significant correlation between age at LRLT and the duration of IPS persistence after LRLT (P = 0.044). IPS takes longer to disappear in older children than in younger ones, but always disappears eventually. LRLT is an effective treatment for biliary atresia with IPS.

618,618,38413913,"Children and youth experienced marked impacts on day-to-day life in the COVID-19 pandemic that were associated with poorer familial and friend relationships, and greater mental health challenges. Few studies provide self-report data on mental health symptoms from children and youth themselves. We sought to examine the associations between social factors and child and youth self-reported symptoms of worsened mood, anxiety, and irritability during the COVID-19 pandemic. A nationally representative cross-sectional survey was administered online to collect self-report data across 10 Canadian provinces among children (11-14 years) and youth (15-18 years), April-May 2022. Age-appropriate questions were based on The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn & Child Health and the World Health Organization of the United Nations H6 + Technical Working Group on Adolescent Health and Well-Being consensus framework and the Coronavirus Health and Impact Survey. Associations between a priori defined social factors (e.g., relationship quality) and respondent self-reported mental health were evaluated using ordinal logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, and geographic location. We analyzed data from 483 (51.7%) children (11-14 years; 227, 47.0% girls) and 450 (48.3%) youth (15-18 years; 204, 45.3% girls). The parents of most children and youth had resided in Canada for over 20 years (678, 72.7%). Over one-quarter of children and youth self-identified as Black, Indigenous, or a Person of Color (134, 27.7%; 134, 29.8%, respectively).

619,619,10541325,"Peripheral blood basophils are sparse in the circulation, but they express high-affinity receptors for IgE (FCepsilonRI) and bind IgE efficiently. The present study was performed to elucidate the role of IgE bound on the basophil surface in the development of allergic responses during infancy and early childhood. IgE-binding and FcepsilonRI expression on basophils were evaluated by two-color flow cytometry. Basophil-bound IgE increased rapidly and reached adult levels during infancy in atopic patients, while it gradually increased with advancing age in parallel with serum IgE in normal controls. IgE-binding and FcepsilonRI expression in atopic children were higher than in normal controls among various age groups. They correlated with serum IgE levels but reached a plateau when serum IgE exceeded 300 ng/mL. A low, but significant level of FcepsilonRI expression was observed on cord blood basophils, although IgE-binding was usually undetectable. Incubation of cord blood with IgE rapidly saturated the preexisting IgE receptors and basophil-bound IgE levels increased. When neonatal basophils were cultured for 48 h with IgE, FcepsilonRI expression was upregulated dose-dependently and IgE-binding increased further. The up-regulation of FcepsilonRI was completely inhibited by cycloheximide, indicating that it was dependent on de novo protein synthesis. These results suggest that IgE-binding on basophils serves as a sensitive indicator of allergic sensitization, and that IgE functions as a positive regulator of FcepsilonRI expression in vivo.

In the second phase, an unblinded, nonconcurrent, nonintervention control group (n = 47) was examined to describe any effect of using the jet device. Patients reported pain upon administration of the jet device and at needle insertion using a 100-mm color analog scale (CAS). Patients also reported their satisfaction with this device. The physicians and nurses performing needle insertions were asked to rate their ability to visualize the vein and their satisfaction with the device. The mean (+/-standard deviation [SD]) needle insertion pain score for jet lidocaine, 28 (+/-7) mm, was similar to the mean needle insertion pain score for jet placebo, 34 (+/-7) mm. The mean needle insertion pain score for both the jet lidocaine and the jet placebo groups were lower than the needle insertion pain scores for the no device group, 52 (+/-8) mm.

Youth-onset T2DM has been reported in all racial and ethnic groups, but Indigenous peoples and people of colour are disproportionately affected. People with youth-onset T2DM often have a more aggressive clinical course than those with adult-onset T2DM or those with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Moreover, the available treatment options for children and adolescents with T2DM are more limited than for adult patients. Intermediate complications of youth-onset T2DM, such as increased albuminuria, often develop in late childhood or early adulthood, and end-stage complications, including kidney failure, develop in mid-life. The increasing frequency, earlier onset and greater severity of childhood obesity in the past 50 years together with increasingly sedentary lifestyles and an increasing frequency of intrauterine exposure to diabetes are important drivers of the epidemic of youth-onset T2DM. The particularly high risk of the disease in historically disadvantaged populations suggests an important contribution of social and environmental factors, including limited access to high-quality health care, healthy food choices and opportunities for physical activity as well as exposure to stressors including systemic racism and environmental pollutants.

626,626,28673115,"This paper presents a novel application of an assistive robotic system with virtual assistance to enhance manual performance of individuals with cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy affects one's voluntary motor movements resulting in limited opportunities to actively engage in physical manipulative activities that require fine motor movements and coordination. Lack of object manipulation and environmental exploration can result in further impairments such as cognitive and social delays. The proposed assistive robotic system has been developed to enhance hand movements of people with disabilities when performing a functional task colouring. This paper presents the usability testing of the effectiveness of the developed system with an individual with cerebral palsy in a set of colouring tasks. Assisted and unassisted approaches were compared and analysed through quantitative and qualitative measures. The robotic-based approach was further compared with the participant's typical alternate access method to perform the same proposed tasks. The robotic system with virtual assistance was clinically validated to be significantly more effective, compared to both unassisted and typical approaches, by increasing the hand controllability, reducing the physical load and increasing the easiness of maintaining movements within the lines. Future studies will inform the use of the system for children with disabilities to provide them with assisted play for functional and playful activities. Implications for rehabilitation Robotic system can enhance manual performance in individuals with disabilities. Participating in a robot-mediated play activity could increase children's motivation and engagement.

For quantitative assessments of PR using noninvasive methods, we performed Doppler color flow imaging in 38 children, whose ages ranged from three to 15 years. All images were obtained from one to 10 years after surgery. The right ventricle and pulmonary valve were demonstrated in the parasternal short-axis view. The images of PR flow were in red and were frozen when the area of a signal was maximum (early to mid diastole). The PR distance index (PRDI), which is the maximum PR flow distance divided by square root of the body surface area, was measured. The PR area index (the maximum PR flow area/body surface area) (PRAI) was also calculated using a track ball. Cardiac catheterization was performed for 12 patients without residual L-R shunts or any apparent tricuspid regurgitation. PR was graded (0 = absent, 1 = trivial, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe) according to the projection of contrast medium in the right ventricle as seen on the main pulmonary arteriogram. The size of the right ventricle was expressed as the right ventricular end-diastolic volume (RVEDV; % of normal), as determined from the cineangiogram, and the tricuspid valve annulus diameter (TVD; % of normal) from a four-chamber view of the two-dimensional echocardiogram. There were significant differences between the PRDI and the PRAI of five patients with PR of grades 1-2 and those of seven patients with PR of grade 3-4 (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.01, respectively).

It is our belief that replantation serves many therapeutic functions. At the very least, there is the psychological/emotional factor that is involved in attempting to replace a native body part that has been severed. Also, it is difficult to persuade parents and patients that the amputated tissue that has been handled with kid gloves by paramedics, maintaining its pink ""alive"" color, is ultimately doomed to failure. Forehead flaps and conchal cartilage grafts are more willingly accepted after a ""failed"" replantation than as primary reconstructions.

Forty-five children with unilateral incomplete cleft lip (UICL), evaluated longitudinally at the ages of 2.4 and 23.2 months were used as controls. A standardised radiocephalometric technique was used for image acquisition. The radiocephalograms were analysed using a modification of a method developed by Kreiborg, which included the digitisation of 89 landmarks of the calvaria, cranial base, and orbit (43 in the lateral and 46 in the frontal projections), the production of mean shape plots for each group, and the intergroup comparison of a series of 78 variables (linear distance between selected landmarks, and angles defined by groups of three landmarks). Paired and unpaired t tests were used to assess the differences between the variables studied. These were accepted as significant for values of p<0.01 and were presented as coloured segments or areas in the respective plots. In a comparative analysis with the mean UICL lateral plots, the mean preoperative lateral plots of the study group (SS) showed that the anterior slope of the forehead was more pronounced and it was also more convex. The vertex area was located more anteriorly and was less convex. The occipital curvature was more prominent. Comparison of the mean frontal plots showed a deficiency in convexity and lateral projection of the upper parietal regions, and the line of maximum skull width was lower. The postoperative mean lateral plots of the study group showed a correction of the exaggerated anterior inclination of the forehead and a reduction of the abnormal occipital convexity. However, there was little change in the vertex region and it remained flatter than in the control group. In the mean frontal plots, the increase in convexity and in the lateral projection of the upper parietal areas led to a shape that was similar to that of the UICL group. The mean (SD) cephalic index changed from 64.9% (1.8%) to 71.4% (3.5%) (p<0.001). The longitudinal comparison between the mean postoperative plots at 3 and 5 years of age showed that there had been little change in cranial shape. In conclusion, after a modified pi-plasty for sagittal synostosis, significant objective changes in cranial shape towards normality were produced. The postoperative profile cranial shape was improved except in the vertex area, which remained flatter than normal. In the frontal projection an almost normal shape was obtained. The postoperative cranial shape obtained at 3 years of age had remained stable at the age of 5 years. ",1630,Sagittal synostosis: II.

The authors describe early studies and interim standardized assessment reports to highlight effects of educational disruption and present critical questions for neuropsychologists. A summary of pre-pandemic and interim literature was compiled, including analyses of national and local assessment data and preliminary studies on academic gains related to remote learning, educational and school services disruption, chronic absenteeism, and child and adolescent mental and physical health during 2020-2021. Ten major themes were identified in the early reports on impacts of educational disruption. Preliminary information indicates prolonged educational disruption has resulted in attenuated learning gains, most remarkably for those already at risk for educational disparities: students of color, students with disabilities, English learners, and students from low-income households. There have also been increased mental and physical health challenges for some youth during the pandemic. Other literature highlights challenges such as diagnosis of learning disabilities, reliance on normative data and development of academic recovery programs. The effects of prolonged educational disruption and psychological stressors on learning and mental health should be considered in the neuropsychological evaluation of children and adolescents, especially marginalized students. Normative data collected prior to the pandemic may be insufficient for interpretation of scores, and evaluation and treatment may be delayed due to backlog and increased demand.

AST combines weekly use of the Asthma Control Test with a color-coded graph for visual trending. Prospective cohort study of children age 2 to 18 years admitted for asthma. Parents or children (n = 210) completed baseline AST assessments during hospitalization, then over 6 months after discharge. Concurrent with the first 5 AST assessments, the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) was administered for comparison. Test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation) was moderate, with a small longitudinal variation of AST measurements within subjects during follow-ups. Internal consistency was strong at baseline (Cronbach's α 0.70) and during follow-ups (Cronbach's α 0.82-0.90). Criterion validity demonstrated a significant correlation between AST and ACQ scores at baseline (r = -0.80, P < .01) and during follow-ups (r = -0.64, -0.72, -0.63, and -0.69). The AST was responsive to change over time; an increased ACQ score by 1 point was associated with a decreased AST score by 2.65 points (P < .01) at baseline and 3.11 points (P < .01) during follow-ups. Discriminant validity demonstrated a strong association between decreased AST scores and increased oral corticosteroid use (odds ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.16, P < .01) and increased unscheduled acute asthma visits (odds ratio 1.23, 95% confidence interval, 1.18-1.28, P < .01).

DNA, associated with nucleoli, could be roughly divided in four types based on the presence or absence of peri-nucleolar clumps and intra-nucleolar clumps. In cases of AMKL, we often observed a type that did not have peri-nucleolar DNA clumps but did have DNA flecks within the nucleoli. By analytical evaluation there were no differences among cells from several subtypes of megakaryocytic leukemia, such as AMKL in children with Down's syndrome, AMKL in children without Down's syndrome, AMKL in adults, and CML-MK crisis.

636,636,18614327,"Malfunctioning or dislodged gastrostomy tubes (G-tubes) often require urgent replacement and reinsertion in the Emergency Department (ED). Few data exist regarding the best technique for bedside catheter replacement and verification, and individual operator preferences vary. Although a few reports have described the use of ultrasound guidance during the initial percutaneous insertion, no data are available concerning its role during subsequent G-tube replacements. We sought to investigate the utility of bedside ultrasonography during G-tube replacements in the ED. This was a prospective pilot study conducted at a Level 1 Trauma Center with an annual census of 90,000 patients. Seven adults and three children with malfunctioning G-tubes were enrolled. Three tubes were cracked and leaking, and seven tubes had been dislodged. Under ultrasound, a new G-tube was inserted through the previously fashioned tract. After insertion, color Doppler was applied over the catheter tip to enhance visualization during gentle tube oscillation. Ultrasound successfully visualized G-tube replacement in all 10 patients. Application of color Doppler over the G-tube tip during catheter oscillation enhanced placement confirmation. Sonographic findings were corroborated with gastric content aspiration, contrast-enhanced radiographs, and successful use of the new G-tubes. No false tracts were identified during ultrasound-guided insertion, post-procedure sonographic confirmation, or subsequent radiographs. The improper replacement of a G-tube can lead to devastating consequences. Verifying appropriate placement through aspirate evaluation can be misleading, and post-procedure radiographs increase radiation exposure and ED wait times. Bedside ultrasonography can be used to guide catheter insertion while providing a safe and quick adjunct to confirm proper G-tube placement.

LQTS is a rare inherited disease with a prevalence of 0.21 per cent in children with congenital deafness from other reports. These patients carry a high risk of recurrent syncope and fatal ventricular arrhythmia. Cross-sectional survey from January 2000 to August 2000. A total of 276 children with congenital sensori-neural hearing loss were included. A questionnaire was employed and all children were examined by a pediatric cardiologist to rule out organic heart disease. EKGs were obtained and QTc intervals were blindly measured using standard methods in L2, V5 or any other leads with the longest QTc interval by three pediatric cardiologists. If QTc interval is prolonged, additional EKG (up to 3) were done to confirm the finding. Schwartz criteria was used to identify index cases with LQTS after repeated EKGs, and exercise stress tests. Also, echocardiography were done in patients suspected of having LQTS. A total of 14 children needed a third EKG and more work ups due to persistent long QTc interval after 2 consecutive EKG studies with QTc intervals ranged from 456 msec to 466 msec, and Schwartz score from 1.5 to 2.5. There were 6 twins and no triplets in the study. Finally, two subjects (not twins or siblings) had persistent prolonged QTc intervals after 3 EKG studies.

This systematic review investigates the effectiveness of dietary interventions (DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, Vitamin D3 supplementation, magnesium, and impact of artificial food colors and marine oils) and supplements alongside standard pharmacotherapy in managing ADHD symptoms. Adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines, we extensively searched various databases for studies published from 2016 to 2022. Out of an initial pool of 7873 records, 14 randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria following rigorous screening. Our findings suggest that gluten-free diets may alleviate ADHD symptoms despite negative celiac serology, highlighting the role of non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Moreover, vitamin and mineral supplements like vitamin D and magnesium showed varying degrees of effectiveness in improving behavioural and emotional symptoms. Innovative treatments, such as combining saffron with methylphenidate and using marine oil extracts, also demonstrated potential in enhancing behaviours associated with ADHD. The review underscores the importance of dietary approaches, such as the DASH diet and specific exclusions (e.g., a few foods diet and an oligoantigenic diet), in managing symptoms by addressing nutritional factors. Studies on probiotics and interventions targeting gut microbiota composition yielded mixed results, necessitating further exploration. Limitations include study diversity and short-term outcome assessments, cautioning against broad generalizations. Integrating personalized dietary assessments and interventions into ADHD treatment strategies could optimize therapeutic outcomes and potentially reduce reliance on pharmacotherapy alone. In summary, this systematic review highlights the potential benefits of dietary modifications and supplements in managing ADHD symptoms. Future research should prioritize long-term efficacy, interactions with conventional medications, and personalized dietary approaches to refine ADHD treatment strategies.

Cortisol concentrations in hair of 554 subjects were measured and a comparative statistical analysis was performed. The analysis showed that cortisol levels significantly differ depending on age. The toddler group (7 months (0.6 years) to 3 years) showed significantly higher values (median 10pg/mg, p-value<0.0001, d=0.78) than the adolescent group. The adolescent groups showed significantly lower (p-value<0.0001, d=0.58 and p<0.0001, d=0.13) values (median 2.4pg/mg and 2.8pg/mg) than the adult group (median 5.8pg/mg). Furthermore, in the adult group men showed significantly higher cortisol values than women (p-value<0.05, d=0.17). This effect could not be seen in the adolescent group. Black hair showed higher cortisol concentrations than blond hair (p-value<0.0001, d=1.3). In addition, two rounds of interlaboratory comparisons for hair cortisol samples between four laboratories revealed very consistent results.

The risk of rectal puncture or intravascular injection is inherent to this blinded technique. We described a new technique of transperineal pudendal nerve block, with ultrasound guidance, to improve safety of the technique. The first goal of this study was to describe this new technique and to test its feasibility. The second objective was to evaluate intra operative effectiveness and postoperative pain control. After parental and children consent, this prospective descriptive study included children aged 1-15 years, ASA status I-III, scheduled for general anesthesia associated with bilateral pudendal nerve block for an elective perineal surgery. After standardized general anesthesia, the anesthesiologist performed pudendal nerve block under ultrasound guidance with ""out of plane"" approach and evaluated the visualization of anatomical structures (ischial tuberosity, rectum, and pudendal artery), of the needle and of the local anesthetic spread. Pudendal nerve block failure was defined as an increase in mean arterial blood pressure or heart rate more than 20% compared to baseline values after surgical incision. In the postoperative period, the need for rescue analgesia was noted. During the study period, 120 blocks were performed in 60 patients, including 59 boys. Quality of the ultrasonographic image was good in 81% of blocks, with easy visualization of ischium and rectum in more than 95% of cases. Localization of the tip of the needle was possible for all pudendal nerve blocks, directly or indirectly. The spread of local anesthetic was seen in 79% of cases. The block was effective in 88% of cases.

645,645,32410108,"In an examination of three unwrapped mummified children from the Graeco-Roman Period of ancient Egypt there was an unexpected finding of fair hair. In the majority of unwrapped ancient Egyptian mummified bodies the hair was not fair but rather dark brown or black. To determine if exposure to natron during the mummification process was responsible for the fair hair color an experiment was carried out to partially replicate the environment in which bodies were desiccated. Fourteen samples of modern hair from various age groups, sex and ethnicity were subjected to synthetic natron for a period of 40 days to replicate the time taken to mummify a body. Macroscopic and microscopic examinations of samples were employed to ascertain any significant changes in hair color after treatment. Ancient wigs were studied for evidence of post mortem changes to hair color since construction over 2,000 years ago. Results of the study showed no significant lightening of hair color and in several samples the hair significantly darkened as the result of exposure to the natron. There was not any evidence that hair lightened as the result of natural post mortem changes and this was confirmed by the study of the natural hair wigs that had not changed color post mortem. This study concluded that the fair hair observed in the three child mummies was not the result of exposure to natron or post mortem changes but rather it was probably due to ancestry because of the presence of diverse genomes that were introduced into ancient Egypt during the Greco-Roman Period.

The aim of this study was to determine the clinical features during the early postresuscitative period that may predict survival or neurologic outcomes in children with traumatic OHCA. Information on 362 children (<19 years) who presented to the emergency departments of three medical centers and experienced traumatic OHCA during the study period (January 2003 to December 2010) were retrospectively included. The postresuscitative clinical features during the early postresuscitative period, defined as the first hour after achieving sustained return of spontaneous circulation, which correlated with survival and neurologic outcomes were analyzed. Among 152 children (42%) who achieved sustained return of spontaneous circulation, 34 (9.4%) survived to discharge, and 11 (3%) had good neurologic outcomes (Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category Scale, 1 or 2). Early postresuscitative clinical features, which reflected initial cardiac output and end-organ perfusion, can predict the chance of survival. Such features included the following: high or normal blood pressure, normal heart rate, sinus rhythm, urine output of more than 1 mL/kg per hour, and noncyanotic skin color (all p < 0.05). Initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of greater than 7 predicted a good neurologic outcome in survivors (p = 0.008). Predictors of survival were high or normal blood pressure, normal heart rate, sinus rhythm, urine output of more than 1 mL/kg per hour, and noncyanotic skin color.

Two boys had blunt perineal trauma and 1 had penile trauma (ages 6, 6 and 10 years). Painless priapism developed within 24 hours and lasted for 4 to 7 days before the patients presented to the hospital. Primary diagnosis was made on color Doppler ultrasound. When high flow priapism was diagnosed angiography of the internal iliac artery and embolization of the arteriocavernosal fistula were performed. Mean followup was 26 months. Color Doppler ultrasound revealed bilateral arteriocavernosal fistulas in 2 boys and a unilateral fistula in 1. Angiography showed fistulas of the branches of the internal pudendal artery in 2 patients and fistulas of the bulbourethral artery in 1. Microcoils were used in the bulbourethral artery and a gelatin sponge was used in other penile arteries. Complete detumescence with restored erectile function was achieved in all cases. High flow priapism in children can be diagnosed easily by typical clinical features combined with color Doppler ultrasound. In children with posttraumatic priapism embolization of the arteriocavernosal fistula is superior to surgical or medical procedures and should be the first line therapy. Embolization using microcoils for bulbourethral arteries and a gelatin sponge for other penile arteries has proved to be safe and successful therapy.

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between experiences of racial discrimination and parenting among African American mothers and to identify psychological mediators and moderators of this relationship. African American mothers (N = 250) with young children (mean age = 3.7 years old) reported on perceived racial discrimination (Race-Related Events Scale), parenting (Parenting Stress Index, Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire), coping (Coping Strategies Index), and mental health (Stress Overload Scale, Beck Depression Inventory). Multivariable linear regression was used to examine associations between perceived racial discrimination and parenting and to test coping as a moderator of these relationships. Ordinary least-squares regression-based path analysis with bootstrapping was used to examine mediation by stress overload and depressive symptoms. At least one experience of racial discrimination was reported by 57% of women. Experiences of racial discrimination were associated with increased parenting stress (β = 0.69, p = .02), and this relationship was mediated by stress overload (95% CI [0.35, 1.09]) and depressive symptoms (95% CI [0.27, 1.18]). Racial discrimination was not associated with parenting styles, and coping strategies largely did not moderate the relationships examined. Racial discrimination has harmful intergenerational effects on African American children and families.

On average, TL children exhibited the shape bias in an object naming context, but children with SLI did not. In Experiment 2, we tested whether the failure to exhibit the shape bias might be linked to ability to detect systematicities in the visual domain. Experiment 2 supported this hypothesis, in that children with SLI failed to learn simple paired visual associations that were readily learned by children with TL. Analyses of individual differences in the two studies revealed that visual paired-associate learning predicted degree of shape bias in children with SLI and TL better than any other measure of nonverbal intelligence or standard assessments of language ability.

The sample (567 individuals) was divided between females (n = 290) and males (n = 277). The RP Atlas was handcrafted, scanned, colored, and clustered in two atlases divided by sex. The development of a specific atlas for the Brazilian population has the potential to enhance the accuracy of age estimation in forensic scenarios, notably in a mixed country like Brazil. Further research is needed to assess the suitability of the newly developed atlas for the Brazilian population.

663,663,30571200,"Background Pediatric patients with atrioventricular valve disease have limited options for prosthetic valve replacement in sizes <15 mm. Based on successful experience with the stented bovine jugular vein graft (Melody valve) in the right ventricular outflow tract, the prosthesis has been modified for surgical valve replacement in pediatric patients with atrioventricular dysfunction with the intention of subsequent valve expansion in the catheterization laboratory as the child grows. Methods and Results A multicenter, retrospective cohort study was performed among patients who underwent atrioventricular valve replacement with Melody valve at 17 participating sites from North America and Europe, including 68 patients with either mitral (n=59) or tricuspid (n=9) replacement at a median age of 8 months (range, 3 days to 13 years). The median size at implantation was 14 mm (range, 9-24 mm). Immediately postoperatively, the valve was competent with low gradients in all patients. Fifteen patients died; 3 patients underwent transplantation. Nineteen patients required reoperation for adverse outcomes, including valve explantation (n=16), left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (n=1), permanent pacemaker implantation (n=1), and paravalvular leak repair (n=1). Twenty-five patients underwent 41 episodes of catheter-based balloon expansion, exhibiting a significant decrease in median gradient ( P<0.001) with no significant increase in grade of regurgitation. Twelve months after implantation, cumulative incidence analysis indicated that 55% of the patients would be expected to be free from death, heart transplantation, structural valve deterioration, or valve replacement. Conclusions The Melody valve is a feasible option for surgical atrioventricular valve replacement in patients with hypoplastic annuli. The prosthesis shows acceptable short-term function and is amenable to catheter-based enlargement as the child grows. However, patients remain at risk for mortality and structural valve deterioration, despite adequate early valvular function. Device design and implantation techniques must be refined to reduce complications and extend durability. Clinical Trial Registration URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

664,664,25424497,"Multiple histologic measurements are commonly used to assess degenerative changes in intervertebral disc (IVD) structure; however, there is no consensus on which stains offer the clearest visualization of specific areas within the IVD. The objective of this study was to compare multiple tinctorial stains, evaluate their ability to highlight structural features within the IVD, and investigate how they influence the capacity to implement a degeneration scoring system. Lumbar IVDs from seven human autopsy specimens were stained using six commonly used stains (Hematoxylin/Eosin, Toluidine Blue, Safranin-O/Fast Green, Extended FAST, modified Gomori's Trichrome, and Picrosirius Red Alcian Blue). All IVDs were evaluated by three separate graders to independently determine which stains (i) were most effective at discerning different structural features within different regions of the IVDs and (ii) allowed for the most reproducible assessment of degeneration grade, as assessed via the Rutges histological scoring system (Rutges et al. A validated new histological classification for intervertebral disc degeneration. Osteoarthritis Cartilage, 21, 2039-47). Although Trichrome, XFAST and PR/AB stains were all effective at highlighting different regions of whole IVDs, we recommend the use of PR/AB because it had the highest degree of rater agreement on assigned degeneration grade, allowed greater resolution of degeneration grade, has an inferential relationship between color and composition, and allowed clear differentiation of the different regions and structural disruptions within the IVD. The use of a standard set of stains together with a histological grading scheme can aid in the characterization of structural changes in different regions of the IVD and may simplify comparisons across the field. This collection of human IVD histological images highlights how IVD degeneration is not a single disease but a composite of multiple processes such as aging, injury, repair, and disease, each of which are unique to the individual.

Unilateral RP has not often been reported in children. We present a series of cases that illustrate discrimination between unilateral and asymmetric disease and between dystrophy and acquired degeneration. Four patients (9-15 years of age; 3 females) were referred to our institution for possible unilateral RP based on fundus appearance and unilateral symptoms. All underwent full-field electroretinography (ERG), spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), widefield and color fundus photography, and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging. Genetic testing and a vitamin and essential fatty acids panel were also conducted in 1 patient. Unilateral retinal degeneration was confirmed in 2 patients, whose fellow eyes showed no abnormalities on ERG or imaging. The other 2 patients were found to have highly asymmetric retinal degeneration based on ERG, wide-angle images, and repeated examinations (range, 0.3-9.8 years). Genetic testing and blood testing in 1 unilateral case were negative. Childhood-onset ""unilateral RP"" remains a difficult and uncertain diagnosis.

In this regard, we examined the effectiveness of a simple and practical art-based intervention on pain and anxiety in children who underwent venipuncture procedures. In this parallel randomized control trial, children aged 6-12 years were randomly allocated to either an intervention or a control group. The intervention group (n = 73) received an art-based intervention called Trace Image and Coloring for Kids-Book (TICK-B) during the venipuncture procedure compared to no intervention in the control group (n = 71). The children, their parents, and an observer nurse rated the outcomes 1-2 min after the venipuncture procedure was finished. The patients in the intervention group had a substantially lower mean value of pain and anxiety-as rated by children, their parents, and an observer nurse-compared to the control patients. The average values of pain reported by the children, parents, and observer nurse were 3.50, 3.52, and 3.49 in the intervention group in contrast to 6.53, 6.59, and 6.45 in the control group (a large effect). Similarly, the patients in the intervention group had significantly lower mean values of anxiety compared to the control group: 0.88, 1.43, and 1.42 vs. 3.09, 2.52, and 2.52, respectively. This study showed that TICK-B is an effective technique to reduce the levels of pain and anxiety in children undergoing venipuncture procedures.

667,667,9044136,"The presence of squamous epithelium in the cyst wall of children with large splenic cysts has generally been thought to require complete resection of the cyst lining to prevent recurrence. The risks of major bleeding or possible total splenectomy necessitates a simplified procedure to preserve splenic function without cyst recurrence. Six patients treated for splenic cyst over a 10-year period underwent partial splenic decapsulation retaining the hilar portion of the spleen. The patient group, including five girls, ranged in age from 6 to 18 years (mean, 13 years). Presenting findings were splenomegaly (n = 4), progressive cyst enlargement (n = 4), left upper quadrant pain (n = 2), ultrasound for unrelated condition (n = 2), and prior history of trauma (n = 1). Cyst location varied from peripheral to deep cortical and ranged in size from 5 to 20 cm containing from 200 to 1,700 mL of sterile straw-colored to dark brown-colored liquid. Palpable splenomegaly resolved in all patients with progressive decrease in size of the splenic remnant, and return of vascularity to normal was confirmed by Doppler ultrasound. Each patient remains asymptomatic without recurrence of the splenic cyst from 1 to 10 years after surgery. Squamous epithelial lining cells found in sheets and clusters were seen within the cyst lining of all patients. Immunohistochemistry of the paraffin-embedded tissue showed that these cells expressed keratin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), but were negative for BerEP4 (conventionally positive in cells of epithelial origin). The authors conclude that splenic decapsulation is an effective treatment for splenic epithelial cysts, which both preserves splenic function and prevents recurrence despite retention of hilar cyst lining. Epithelial metaplasia of the mesothelial-mesodermal undifferentiated cells from exposure to an unidentified irritant may explain the histological presence of squamous epithelium within the cyst wall.

668,668,11156877,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the feasibility and potential value of the computer-controlled, 3D, echocardiographic reconstruction of the color Doppler-imaged vena contracta (CDVC) and the flow convergence (FC) region as a means of accurately and quantitatively estimating the severity of a ventricular septal defect (VSD). We performed a 3D reconstruction of the CDVC and the FC region in 19 patients with an isolated VSD using an ultrasound system interfaced with a Tomtec computer. The variable asymmetric geometry of the CDVC and the FC region could be 3D-visualized in all patients. The 3D-measured areas of CDVC correlated well with volumetric measurements of the severity of VSD (r=0.97, P:<0.001). Regression analysis between the shunt flow rate (calculated from the product of the area of CDVC and the continuous Doppler-derived velocity time integral) and the corresponding reference results (calculated by cardiac catheterization) demonstrated a close correlation (r=0.95, P:<0.001). There was also a good correlation between shunt flow rates calculated using the conventional 2D, 1-axis measurement of the FC isovelocity surface area with the hemispheric assumption (r=0.95, P:<0.001); shunt flow rates calculated using 3D, 3-axis measurements of the FC region (r=0.97, P:<0.01); and reference results by cardiac catheterization. However, the 2D method substantially underestimated the actual shunt flow rate. The 3D reconstruction of the CDVC and the FC region may aid in quantifying the severity of VSD.

Lead is more readily absorbed in the pediatric population. Additionally, prior regulations had published acceptable blood lead levels (BLLs) in children, but more recent evidence indicates a myriad of detrimental effects in BLLs below that cutoff. There is substantial evidence to suggest that there is no acceptable BLL. Lead toxicity is generally improving nationally but there still exists a considerable need for improvement.

When it was difficult to detect hair color with the naked eye or a magnifier, a digital microscope with 30× magnification was used.   Interestingly, all 82 patients showed leukotrichia in segmental vitiligo independent of age and disease duration. Some patients had more than 90% white hairs in the lesional skin, and they showed poor response to medical treatment.   Based on our results, a very high percentage of patients with segmental vitiligo may be associated with leukotrichia. Many white hairs in segmental vitiligo may contribute to the lack of response with medical treatment. The examination of hair color with a digital microscope may be very useful for the prediction of treatment outcome and decision of treatment modalities.

Isolated hair manifestations are usually observed; however, systemic involvement of the nervous system, eyes, and ears have also been reported. The syndrome has been classified into three subtypes, correlating with the three mutated genes: peptidyl arginine deiminase, type III; transglutaminase 3; and trichohyalin. This article presents the clinical picture of uncombable hair syndrome with special attention to its systemic manifestations. It also addresses its molecular aspects. Google Scholar was used to retrieve relevant publications. Clinical and molecular data were tabulated and frequencies were calculated. At least 127 cases were identified. Congenital hair defects were reported in two-thirds of cases, in which hair texture (83%), color (52%), density (15%), and growth (11%) were impaired. Uncombable hair rarely involves the eyebrows and eyelashes, and it may co-occur with loose anagen hair syndrome, androgenic alopecia, alopecia areata, and scarring alopecia. Pathologies of the skin, nails, and teeth were reported among 63%, 28%, and 25%, respectively. Systemic abnormalities were not uncommon.

Ultrahigh-resolution spectral optical coherence tomography (Copernicus, 3 μm axial resolution) was used to obtain tomograms of the fovea from five children and three adults with achromatopsia. Each patient was scanned twice with a mean follow-up time of 16 months. Progressive changes in reflectivity at the inner segment/outer segment (IS/OS) junction, the central macular and outer nuclear layer thickness were analysed. Younger patients (<10 years; patient 1-5) showed progressive morphological changes at the IS/OS junction between visits 1 and 2. However, older patients (>40 years; patients 6-8) did not have any changes in the retinal morphology between visits 1 and 2. In patients 1 and 2, IS/OS discontinuities (visit 1) developed into a hyper-reflective zone confined to the fovea (visit 2). In patient 3, the hyper-reflective zone (visit 1) progressed to form an IS/OS disruption and early formation of a small hypo-reflective zone (visit 2). Patients 4 and 5 had a hypo-reflective zone (visit 1) which subsequently increased in size (visit 2). There was a decrease in central macular and outer nuclear layer thickness between visits 1 and 2 in children. For the first time, we show progressive longitudinal changes in retinal morphology in achromatopsia. Early changes include subtle IS/OS reflectivity alterations.

The authors describe in detail the operative steps that allow for a successful ear reconstruction using porous high-density polyethylene. The key parts of this operation are to meticulously harvest a well-vascularized superficial temporoparietal fascia flap and to use appropriate color-matched skin grafts. This method allows for a pleasing ear reconstruction with excellent definition, projection, symmetry, and long-term viability. The use of porous high-density polyethylene with a thin superficial temporoparietal fascia flap coverage is the authors' preferred method of ear reconstruction because it can be performed at an earlier age, in a single stage, as an outpatient procedure, and with minimal discomfort and psychological trauma for the patients and parents.

689,689,29621281,"Otitis media (OM) remains a common paediatric disease, despite advances in vaccinology. Susceptibility to recurrent acute OM (rAOM) has been postulated to involve defective cell-mediated immune responses to common otopathogenic bacteria. We compared the composition of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 20 children with a history of rAOM (otitis-prone) and 20 healthy non-otitis-prone controls, and assessed innate and cell-mediated immune responses to the major otopathogen nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). NTHi was a potent stimulator of inflammatory cytokine secretion from PBMC within 4 hours, with no difference in cytokine levels produced between PBMC from cases or controls. In the absence of antigen stimulation, otitis-prone children had more circulating Natural Killer (NK) cells (p<0.01), particularly NKdim (CD56lo) cells (p<0.01), but fewer CD4+ T cells (p<0.01) than healthy controls. NTHi challenge significantly increased the proportion of activated (CD107a+) NK cells in otitis-prone and non-otitis-prone children (p<0.01), suggesting that NK cells from otitis-prone children are functional and respond to NTHi. CD8+ T cells and NK cells from both cases and controls produced IFNγ in response to polyclonal stimulus (Staphylococcal enterotoxin B; SEB), with more IFNγ+ CD8+ T cells present in cases than controls (p<0.05) but similar proportions of IFNγ+ NK cells. Otitis-prone children had more circulating IFNγ-producing NK cells (p<0.05) and more IFNγ-producing CD4+ (p<0.01) or CD8+ T-cells (p<0.05) than healthy controls. In response to SEB, more CD107a-expressing CD8+ T cells were present in cases than controls (p<0.01).

695,695,34809993,"Parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity is important to physiological regulation. Limbic structures are important in determining what information the PNS receives, potentially influencing concurrent physiological responsivity and, ultimately, shaping PNS development. Yet, whether individual differences in these structures are linked to PNS activity in early childhood remains unclear. Here, in an exploratory capacity, we examined the association between neonatal limbic structures (i.e., the left and right amygdala and hippocampus) and preschoolers' resting-state respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). RSA is a measure of heart-rate variability, a physiological marker that reflects fluctuation in the PNS and is often found predictive of emotion regulation and psychological wellbeing. Data were extracted from the ""Growing Up in Singapore towards Healthy Outcomes"" (GUSTO) cohort (n = 73, 39 girls). Neonatal limbic volume was collected within two weeks after birth while infants were asleep. Resting-state RSA was collected during a coloring session at 42 months of age. After controlling for potential confounders, a Bonferroni-corrected significant association between neonatal left hippocampal volume and resting-state RSA emerged wherein larger hippocampal volume was associated with higher resting-state RSA. No significant associations were present between resting-state RSA and right or left amygdala, or right hippocampal volume. These findings contribute to an increasing body of evidence aiming at enhancing our understanding of neurobiological underpinnings of parasympathetic activity and modulation. Results are also discussed with reference to ideas concerning biological sensitivity to context, as both left hippocampal volume and resting-state RSA were previously found to moderate associations between adversity and psychological function.

Moreover many of them have been related to health problems mainly in children that are considered a very vulnerable group. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of oral administration of Amaranth, Sunset Yellow and Curcumin for 4 weeks at doses of 47, 315 and 157.5 mg/kg b. wt. and after 2 weeks all animals were immunostimulated by intra peritoneal injection of sheep RBCs 10% (1 ml/rat). Body weight, relative body weight, total and differential leukocytes count, mononuclear cell count, delayed hypersensitivity, total protein and serum fractions were determined. Results revealed that oral administration of Amaranth, Sunset Yellow and Curcumin did not affect the body weight gain or the spleen weight. On the other hand Sunset Yellow and Curcumin significantly decreased the weight of thymus gland of the rats. Total leukocyte count were not affected while Amaranth and Curcumin-treated rats revealed a significant decrease in neutrophiles and monocytes and a compensatory increase in lymphocytes. Moreover, oral administration of Sunset Yellow revealed a significant decrease in monocyte percent. Amaranth, Sunset Yellow and Curcumin significantly decreased the delayed hyper sensitivity. Total serum protein, albumin, total globulin and albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio were not affected by administration of the colouring agents. Oral administration of Amaranth increases the density of albumin band. On the other hand oral administration of Curcumin decreases the density of the albumin band. Oral administration of any of the tested colouring agents did not change the density of globulin region as compared to control group. In conclusion we found that both synthetic (Amaranth and Sunset Yellow) and natural (Curcumin) colouring agents used at doses up to 10 times the acceptable daily intake exerted a depressing effect on the cellular but not humoral immune response.

698,698,33118264,"Dementia education for healthcare providers has gained growing attention in China. This study aimed to explore the current dementia care practices in care home setting in China because people with dementia have increased need for residential care as the cognitive function worsens. An exploratory qualitative study was conducted among care staff and residents with dementia in four care homes in a metropolitan city in China between May and August 2019. Participant observations were conducted to understand how the care environment and activities affect residents with dementia. Care records were reviewed to explore the kind of care provided. In-depth individual interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 15 care staff members of different ranks to clarify the care practices and understand their training needs with dementia care. Field notes of observations, nursing care records and interviews transcripts were triangulated for qualitative content analysis. The theme emerged is 'suboptimal dementia care practices'. Four categories about dementia care practices in care homes were identified: (a) care environment (hospital-like layout, inappropriate lighting, environmental noise, inappropriate use of colour and unclear signage), (b) care culture (being medical-oriented, overlooking individual uniqueness and privacy), (c) attitudes towards dementia (treating as children, being authoritative, adopting punitive approaches, trying to respect the residents and having a positive learning attitude) and (d) dementia care competence (questing for specific training and resources, questing for culturally specific practices and strengthening communication with family). Creating a dementia-friendly and enabling environment, shifting the care culture paradigm from disease-oriented to person-centred and developing culturally sensitive care practices are imperative. Dementia care education for care home staff using a systematic, comprehensive approach is fundamental to achieve these goals.

Children having teeth indicated for restorative/endodontic therapy and belonging to the age group of six to ten years were invited to participate in the study. Eighteen children received preformed metal crowns (PMCs) by Hall technique. Meanwhile, nineteen children received preformed metal crowns by the conventional technique. Their masticatory performance (MP) was assessed at T0 (pre-intervention), T1 (day 1 post-intervention), T2 (1 week), T3 (2 weeks), T4 (1 month) and T5 (3 months) using Hue-check Gum® (University of Bern, Switzerland). The chewing gum samples were scanned within 24 h of their collection and processed in the ViewGum Software©. The software calculated the hue value (VOH) which indicated the masticatory performance of the individual. A questionnaire was given to the parents at T4 and T5 to assess any discomfort or pain associated with PMCs placed in both groups. The evaluation of masticatory performance using the two-color chewing method revealed reduction in MP on day 1 post-intervention (p < 0.001) for both groups. However, the MP values recorded at T5 were comparable to the baseline values at T0 (p = 0.009). No significant discomfort or pain was reported in both groups. The findings of the current clinical study indicate that placement of PMCs by both conventional and Hall technique in children deteriorates their MP which equilibrates within 1 month.

This report concerns office-based pharyngeal and laryngeal foreign-body management using a videoendoscope. Three types of videoendoscopes (videoendoscopes equipped with and also without a hood at their tips and a rigid videoendoscope) were used in this study. Seventeen patients who complained of pharyngeal and laryngeal foreign bodies were treated with these videoendoscopes. The advantages of this intervention were (1) videoendoscopes presented clear dynamic color images on a color video monitor and provided excellent resolution and recording and thus yielded high diagnostic accuracy and fine intervention; (2) the videoendoscope's diameter was relatively small and resulted in less discomfort for patients, even for children; (3) patients could be examined and treated in a sitting position on a procedure chair at the otolaryngology outpatient clinic, which obviated general anesthesia; (4) the videoendoscope equipped with a hood enabled treatment in a closed cavity like the hypopharynx; (5) minute foreign bodies located at the portion of the pharynx, which were hard to examine, could be depicted clearly; (6) pernasal endoscopy allowed the doctor to examine patients who had a strong gag reflex; and (7) good image documentation on the color video monitor allowed the physician to carry out safe intervention. A disadvantage of this procedure was that the extraction of different kinds of foreign bodies was limited, but it depended in part on the efficacy of the forceps. Foreign-body extraction using a videoendoscope is one of the reliable procedures that has widened the indications for office-based endoscopy.

Closure of the residual shunt with a second device is expensive, associated with possible morbidity, can be technically challenging, and occasionally does not completely eliminate the shunt. Our objective was to assess the immediate and short-term results of transcatheter closure of residual PDA after the Rashkind device using single or multiple Gianturco coils. Five patients (one male/four female) underwent transcatheter closure of residual PDA at a median age of 8.4 yr (range 2-10.1 yr) and median weight of 23 kg (range 11.8-32 kg). A 4F catheter was used for delivery of the coils in all patients. Three patients underwent multiple coil and two single coil closure with complete elimination of the shunt. There was complete elimination of the shunt as documented by repeat angiography immediately after the coil closure. The median fluoroscopy time was 24 min (range, 22-55 min). All patients were discharged home on the same day. There were no complications Follow-up evaluation was performed with color flow mapping of the main pulmonary artery within 4 hr after closure and 6 weeks later with echocardiography and chest radiography. We conclude that transcatheter closure is an effective therapy for patients with residual PDA after the Rashkind device using the single or multiple coil technique. This technique can be performed on an out-patient basis without the need for general anesthesia and at a lower expense than a repeat occluder device or surgery.

The authors created life-sized, patient-specific models for 4 preoperative cases. Three of the cases involved adults (2 patients with petroclival meningioma and 1 with trigeminal neuralgia) and the remaining case involved a pediatric patient with craniopharyngioma. Models were derived from routine clinical imaging sequences and manufactured using commercially available software and hardware. Life-sized, 3D printed models depicting bony, vascular, and neural pathology relevant to each case were successfully manufactured. A variety of commercially available software and hardware were used to create and print each model from radiological sequences. The models for the adult cases were printed in separate pieces, which had to be painted by hand, and could be disassembled for detailed study, while the model for the pediatric case was printed as a single piece in separate-colored resins and could not be disassembled for study. Two of the models were used for patient education, and all were used for presurgical planning by the surgeon. Patient-specific 3D printed models are useful to neurosurgical practice.

On the morning of admission, his mother noticed a 2-mm crust on the patient's right calf with a 3-cm x 3-cm area of surrounding erythema. No history of recent trauma or bite was obtained. He had suffered two episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis during the last day. In addition, over the previous 12 h, he presented brown urine without dysuria. His mother and brother had suffered from gastroenteritis over the previous week without bloody diarrhea. On initial physical examination, there was a 6-cm x 11-cm macular tender purpuric plaque with a central punctum on the right inner calf, which was warm and tender to the touch, with erythematous streaking towards the popliteal fossa (Fig. 1). The inguinal area was also erythematous with tender lymphadenopathy and induration, but without fluctuance. Laboratory studies included an elevated white blood cell count of 20, 800/microL with 6% bands, 86% segs, and 7% lymphocytes, hemoglobin of 12.5 g/dL, hematocrit of 35.1%, and platelets of 282,000/microL. The prothrombin time/activated partial tissue thromboplastin was 10. 4/28.0 s (normal PT, 9.3-12.3 s; normal PTT, 21.3-33.7 s) and fibrinogen was 558 mg/dL (normal, 192-379 mg/dL). Urinalysis showed 1+ protein, 8-10 white blood cells, too numerous to count red blood cells, and no hemoglobinuria. His electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatine were normal. The urine culture was negative. Blood culture after 24 h showed one out of two bottles of coagulase negative Staphylococcus epidermidis. The patient's physical examination was highly suggestive of a brown recluse spider bite with surrounding purpura. Over the next 2 days, the surrounding rim of erythema expanded. The skin within the plaque cleared and peeled at the periphery. The coagulase negative staphylococci in the blood culture were considered to be a contaminant. Cefotaxime and oxacillin were given intravenously. His leg was elevated and cooled with ice packs. The patient's fever resolved within 24 h. The lesion became less erythematous and nontender with decreased warmth and lymphadenopathy. The child was discharged on Duricef for 10 days. Because the patient experienced hematuria rather than hemoglobinuria, nephritis was suggested. In this case, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis was the most likely cause. His anti-streptolysin-O titer was elevated at 400 U (normal, <200 U) and C3 was 21.4 mg/dL (normal, 83-177 mg/dL). His urine lightened to yellow-brown in color. His blood pressure was normal.

706,706,39147113,"Ancestrally admixed populations are underrepresented in genetic studies of complex diseases, which are still dominated by European-descent populations. This is relevant not only from a representation standpoint but also because of admixed populations' unique features, including being enriched for rare variants, for which effect sizes are disproportionately larger than common polymorphisms. Furthermore, results from these populations may be generalizable to other populations. The South African Cape Coloured (SACC) population is genetically admixed and has one of the highest prevalences of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) worldwide. We profiled its admixture and examined associations between ancestry profiles and FASD outcomes using two longitudinal birth cohorts (N=308 mothers, 280 children) designed to examine effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on development. Participants were genotyped via MEGAex array to capture common and rare variants. Rare variants were overrepresented in our SACC cohorts, with numerous polymorphisms being monomorphic in other reference populations (e.g., ∼30,000 and ∼ 221,000 variants in gnomAD European and Asian populations, respectively). The cohorts showed global African (51 %; Bantu and San); European (26 %; Northern/Western); South Asian (18 %); and East Asian (5 %; largely Southern regions) ancestries. The cohorts exhibited high rates of homozygosity (6 %), with regions of homozygosity harboring more deleterious variants when lying within African local-ancestry genomic segments. Both maternal and child ancestry profiles were associated with higher FASD risk, and maternal and child ancestry-by-prenatal alcohol exposure interaction effects were seen on child cognition. Our findings indicate that the SACC population may be a valuable asset to identify novel disease-associated genetic loci for FASD and other diseases.

707,707,10980218,"Quantitative assessment of ventricular function in patients with congenital heart disease is often challenging due to distorted ventricular geometry. A myocardial performance index (MPI) has been reported in adults and children that is a Doppler-derived nongeometric measure of ventricular function. The MPI measures the ratio of isovolumic time intervals (isovolumic contraction time and isovolumic relaxation time) to ventricular ejection time. The effects of altered ventricular preload or afterload on the MPI have yet to be determined. This study assesses the impact of altered preload or afterload on right ventricular (RV) function and the RV MPI in the clinical setting of congenital heart disease. Patient groups were compared with normal pediatric and adult populations before and after repair of their congenital heart lesion. Patients with large atrial septal defects (ASDs) represented the clinical setting of increased ventricular preload, whereas patients with isolated pulmonary valve stenosis represented increased RV afterload. Patients with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (CC-TGA) with severe left atrioventricular valve regurgitation represented a combined increase in RV preload and afterload. The RV MPI in 152 normal children (ages 3 to 18 years) and 37 adults (ages 18 to 51 years) was 0.32 +/- 0.03 and 0.28 +/- 0.04, respectively. In pediatric patients (n = 45) and adult patients (n = 40) with ASD, the RV MPI was 0.35 +/- 0.09 (p = NS) and 0.38 +/- 0.04 (p < 0.01 compared with normal adults), respectively. Patients with pulmonary stenosis (n = 21, ages 1 day to 19 years) had a RV MPI of 0.32 +/- 0.06 (p = NS). CC-TGA patients had a RV MPI of 0.72 +/- 0.17 (p < 0.001). No significant change in the RV MPI was seen in any postoperative patient group despite relief of RV volume or pressure overload. Thus, the MPI is a quantitative measure of RV performance that is appears to be relatively independent of changes in preload or afterload in the clinical setting.

Because of the effect of age and future occupation (standing upright for long periods) on the aetiology, pathogenesis and frequency of varicose veins of the lower extremity and incompetence of saphenofemoral junctions in adulthood, a comparison during adolescence is appropriate. On the basis of a close physiopathological and haemodynamic relationship between primary varicose veins and primary varicocoele, we decided to evaluate the competence of the saphenofemoral junctions in a selected group of adolescents affected by primary varicocoele and compare these results with age-matched healthy adolescents. Twenty-five adolescents with primary varicocoele and 23 age-matched healthy controls were included in the study. In all cases physical examination and colour Doppler US was used to diagnose or exclude the presence of primary varicocoele and to evaluate the continence of the saphenofemoral junction. On the right side, 10 of 25 varicocoele patients and on the left side 11 of 25 varicocoele patients had incompetence of the saphenofemoral junction. For the control patients the incidence was 2/23 on the right side and 4/23 on the left side. The difference is statistically significant. We demonstrated high concurrence of varicocoele and valvular incompetence of the saphenofemoral junction in a particular adolescent group.

We have developed a new laryngostroboscopic system using this videoendoscope. In this article, we report the performance of the clinical trial of this new and useful videoendoscopic system for stroboscopy, and compare it to conventional stroboscopy using a flexible fiberscope or rigid endoscope. This new thin videoendoscope has the following characteristics. A small charge-coupled device (CCD) chip is built into the tip of this endoscope, and an instantaneous RGB system is used. The outer diameters of its tip (4.1 mm) and the insertion tube (3.7 mm) of the videoendoscope are relatively small. The videoendoscope system is compact. Stroboscopic observation was conducted with this videoendoscope in conjunction with a laryngostroboscope. Compared to stroboscopy with a conventional flexible fiberscope or rigid endoscope, this stroboscopic system has several clear advantages. It presents clear dynamic color images on a color video monitor and provides excellent resolution and recording, thus yielding high diagnostic accuracy. The diameter of the videoendoscope is relatively small and results in less discomfort for patients, even for children. The videoendoscope allowed the doctors to perform pernasal endoscopy.

The result was that FEVR has electrophysiological varieties but a statistical significant relationship between electrophysiological findings and visual acuity. That is, cases with abnormal ERG or EOG have more impaired visual acuity than normal ones. Furthermore, there was a tendency that eyes with abnormal ERG or EOG showed more disturbed color vision and advanced fundus findings than normal ones.

Limited data exist on the levels and trajectories of these 2 hormones at birth and in childhood and their biological and social determinants. We examined the longitudinal trajectories of leptin and adiponectin from birth to early childhood, along with influential prenatal and infancy factors, and whether the trajectories and risk factors differ by preterm birth status. We included mother-infant pairs in the Boston Birth Cohort, a predominantly Black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) study population. We measured infant plasma leptin and adiponectin levels at birth and in early childhood. We examined longitudinal trajectories and the associated prenatal maternal and infancy factors. We analyzed 716 infants (158 preterm) who had leptin and adiponectin measured at birth and in early childhood (mean corrected age 2.18 years [interquartile range, 0.4-10.4]). Cord leptin was higher in term infants (40 230 vs 20 481 in preterm, P < 0.0001) but childhood leptin did not differ by prematurity (4123 in term vs 4181 in preterm, P = 0.92).

In order to optimize the treatment for this disease, there is a need to develop objective tools to assess treatment response. Since a color change in the lesion is a good indicator of treatment response, we have developed a digital imaging system to quantify the values of red, green, and blue (RGB) difference and RGB ratio between the tumor and normal tissue to take into account the variations in color between different skin types. The efficacy of the proposed system in assessing treatment response in superficial IH was evaluated in relation to established visual and biochemical tools used to grade hemangiomas. As the treatment progressed, the RGB ratio was almost 1, while the RGB difference was close to 0, which indicates a good response to treatment. There was a strong correlation between the RGB score and the other visual grading systems. However, the correlation between the RGB scoring system and the biochemical method was weak.

The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive values of different MRD levels detected at different chemotherapy phases in childhood ALL. One hundred and two patients were enrolled in this study from January 2002 to December 2004 in our hospital. All the patients were treated with modified National Protocol of Childhood ALL in China 1997. MRD levels were detected on the 15th day, 29th day, at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after initial chemotherapy. All samples were stained with a panel of four colour combinations of fluorochrome conjugated monoclonal antibodies according to the leukemia-associated immunophenotype (LAIP) defined at diagnosis and analyzed by multi-parametric flow cytometry. CD45CD19CD34CD10, CD45CD19CD34CD20 and CD45CD19CD10CD20 were the most common combinations in B lineage ALL, while CD45CD2CD3CD7 and CD45CD2CD3CD34 were the most frequently used immunophenotypes for T lineage ALL.

Eighty-eight cases were diagnosed as B lineage ALL and the remaining 14 were T-ALL. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate and event free survival (EFS) rate for this cohort were (86.9 +/- 3.4)% and (79.9 +/- 4.0)%, respectively. Twelve patients underwent relapse. Among the 102 patients, 14.3% had negative MRD (MRD < 10(-4)) on day 15, 43.9% on day 29, 39.1%, 39.7% and 45.6% had negative MRD at the third, sixth and twelfth month after chemotherapy. Patients who could achieve negative MRD within one year had superior outcome to the others [5-year EFS rates: (92.5 +/- 3.2)% vs. (58.3 +/- 8.6)%, P < 0.001].

The aim of this study was to classify CVID patients based on four known classifications (Paris, Freiburg, EUROclass, and B-cell patterns) by measurement of B-cell subsets and to assess the relation of each classification with clinical manifestations. We measured all B-cell subsets as both absolute count and percentage in 30 CVID patients and 30 healthy individuals using four-colour flow cytometry. Moreover, we evaluated antibody responses to pneumococcal vaccine in patients. A significant reduction in percentage of terminal B-cell subsets (total, marginal zone-like, switched memory, IgM-only memory, total memory B-cells and plasmablast) and absolute count of all B-cell subsets along with a strong increase in CD21 Classification of patients could provide useful information to guide clinicians in long-term follow-up of CVID patients.

729,729,9382008,"Feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of transcatheter occlusion of atrial septal defect (ASD) with the buttoned device has been demonstrated. Despite its effectiveness in occluding secundum ASD with left-to-right shunt and patent foramina ovalia, presumably responsible for paradoxic embolism, it has limitations in effectively occluding ASD with evident right-to-left shunts. Therefore, the device was modified so that the square-shaped occluder component of the device is on the right atrial side, the inverted buttoned device. This study determines the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of inverted buttoned device occlusion of atrial defects with right-to-left shunts. During a 17-month period ending August 1996, 12 patients, aged 1.6 to 39.0 years, underwent occlusion of residual ASD after repair of pulmonary atresia/stenosis with intact ventricular septum (n = 5), modified or fenestrated Fontan for tricuspid or pulmonary atresia (n = 5), and double-inlet left ventricle (n = 2). The systemic arterial oxygen saturation increased (p <0.001) from 82 +/- 7% (range 72% to 90%) to 94 +/- 3% (range 88% to 98%). There was no change in heart rate or cardiac index measured by Fick. Right atrial pressure increased by 1 to 4 mm in 5 of 12 patients (42%). There was trivial (n = 5) or no (n = 7) residual shunt by color Doppler study. Six- to 18-month (median 12) follow-up in all 12 patients revealed stable oxygen saturations (92 +/- 3%) by pulse oximetry. Color Doppler studies revealed small (n = 1), trivial (n = 1), or no (n = 10) residual shunt at follow-up. Based on these data, it is concluded that transcatheter occlusion of ASD with right-to-left shunts with inverted buttoned device is feasible in relieving arterial hypoxemia. Further clinical trials in a larger number of patients and careful evaluation of follow-up results are indicated to examine its safety and longer term effectiveness.

Clinical assessment and transthoracic color Doppler echocardiography were independently performed for each patient with an initial attack of Sydenham's chorea and also for each normal control (Khon Kaen University, Thailand; 1991-2001) at the time of their presentations. Serial clinical examinations and echocardiography were done for each patient at 1- and at 5-year follow-up. Of 44 patients, 17 (39%) had carditis (valvulitis) evident by auscultation at the time of the initial attack. Three (11%) of the 27 patients with no clinical evidence of carditis had echocardiographic evidence of acute mitral regurgitation (subclinical valvulitis). All 17 patients with carditis had echocardiographic evidence of acute mitral regurgitation. None of the 88 control children had evidence of pathologically significant valvular regurgitation. Of the 15 patients with carditis regularly followed, the persistence of a mitral regurgitation murmur and of pathologically significant valvular regurgitation by echocardiography were 33% (5/15) and 60% (9/15), respectively, at 1-year follow-up, but the persistence of both was 25% (1/4) at 5-year follow-up. Color Doppler echocardiography is a useful tool in the early diagnosis of rheumatic carditis (valvulitis) and at 1-year follow-up of rheumatic valvular heart disease in the patients with initial Sydenham's chorea but the incremental benefit beyond 5 years after the initial attack might be minimal.

Seventy-nine patients with subcutaneous epidermal inclusion cysts underwent US (n = 70), MR (n = 7), or both (n = 2). On US, the margin, shape, echogenicity, through-transmission, wall, internal debris and vascularity were evaluated. On MR, the shape, wall, signal intensity, internal debris, and enhancement pattern were evaluated. On US, characteristic findings were well circumscribed (n = 69, 96%), ovoid-shaped (n = 56, 78%), heterogeneously and mildly echogenic (n = 66, 92%), increased through-transmission (n = 66, 92%) and low echoic rim (n = 48, 67%).

733,733,37202915,"BACKGROUND This case illustrates the challenges in diagnosing linear scleroderma (LS) in a child who presented to a primary care setting. Diagnosis of LS is easily missed due to the lack of prominent symptoms, subtle visible skin changes, and under-recognition of this condition. CASE REPORT A 7-year-old boy presented with a linear, painless, non-itchy rash at the center of his forehead, which has been present for 6 months. The rash extends vertically from the hairline to the bridge of the nose. The color gradually evolved from reddish to purplish-grey and shiny within 3 months. He had underlying eczema, allergic rhinitis, and allergic conjunctivitis since birth. His condition remained unrecognized despite consultations with various medical specialties, including family medicine specialist, ophthalmologist, otorhinolaryngologist, and a general pediatrician. Six months after the onset of his lesion, he was subsequently referred to a pediatric dermatologist and pediatric rheumatologist, who made the diagnosis of LS. Laboratory investigations for autoimmune disease showed that negative antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and inflammatory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), were normal. Skin biopsy provided a tissue confirmation of the diagnosis. MRI of the lesion showed no extension into the underlying muscle or bone erosions. The patient was initially treated with intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone for 3 days, followed by oral methotrexate weekly and prednisolone. The lesion improved after 1 month of treatment, and after 15 months it was less pigmented and less noticeable. CONCLUSIONS LS is the commonest form of localized scleroderma in children. LS on the forehead can erode into the underlying tissues and is sometimes associated with extensive hemifacial atrophy. Treatment should be instituted early to prevent late irreversible fibrotic sequelae. This report aims to highlight the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of an uncommon but potentially disfiguring condition.

734,734,33871422,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has exacerbated the longstanding racial/ethnic health disparities in the USA, with a disproportionately negative effect on children of color. This review summarizes recently published studies that describe the clinical epidemiology and racial/ethnic disparities associated with SARS-CoV-2 in children. Children with SARS-CoV-2 infections manifest with a wide spectrum of disease. Most are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic with fever, gastrointestinal, and/or upper respiratory disease. Some children can progress to develop severe lower respiratory disease or a hyper-inflammatory, Kawasaki-like syndrome leading to cardiovascular shock. Although SARS-CoV-2-related deaths in children are rare, more children died within the first nine months of the pandemic than have died during any influenza season over the last decade.Black and Hispanic children represent less than 41% of the US population but account for three out of every four SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalizations and deaths in the USA. The drivers of these disparities in children are complex and likely a combination of societal, biological, and behavioral influences. This pandemic brought to light longstanding health disparities in historically marginalized populations, and minority children have suffered tremendously. It provides an opportunity to understand how a virus hijacked deep-rooted inequities, address these inequities, and work to prevent this outcome in future pandemics/epidemics.

Our aim was to evaluate the role and accuracy of US, MRA, and CTA compared to DSA in diagnosing RVD in children. A retrospective review of 127 children with suspected renovascular hypertension was performed in children referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital between 2006 and 2014 due to clinical suspicion of renovascular hypertension and/or findings on US and/or MRA or CTA. Ninety-nine of 127 children (78 %) were diagnosed with renovascular disease and 80 were treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty during the same procedure.

741,741,11781557,"Recent advances in Doppler and color echocardiographic techniques enable coronary flow dynamics to be estimated even in children. To assess quantitatively left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) volumetric flow and to determine its relation to age and left ventricular (LV) mass, healthy children participated in a study that used high-frequency transthoracic echocardiography. We also studied whether Doppler echocardiography can reliably measure LAD flow in a clinical setting. In 57 healthy children, 2-dimensional echocardiography was used to measure the diameter and cross-sectional area of the LAD and LV mass. LAD peak flow velocity, flow velocity integral, and flow volume were measured by Doppler echocardiography. We then calculated the ratio of LAD cross-sectional area to LV mass and the ratio of LAD flow volume to LV mass. In 12 patients with Kawasaki disease, LAD flow velocity and flow velocity integral were measured by Doppler echocardiography at the time of Doppler guide wire examination. There were significant correlations between echocardiographic and Doppler guide wire methods for flow velocity and flow velocity integral (r = 0.77 and 0.83, P <.01, respectively). The LAD flow velocity decreased significantly with age (r = -0.43, P <.01). The LAD flow volume per minute increased significantly with age (r = 0.55, P <.01). However, LAD flow volume/LV mass ratio in younger infants was high and decreased significantly with age (r = -0.66, P <.01). This study shows that LAD flow patterns can be reliably assessed by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography in the majority of pediatric subjects. In the current study, the LAD flow velocity and the ratio of LAD flow volume to LV mass in infants was high and decreased with age, suggesting high myocardial perfusion. High LAD peak velocity in infants may be related with high resting coronary flow.

This is important given the association of these visual conditions with reduced reading performance in the wider population, which may also contribute to the suboptimal reading performance reported in this population. The aim of this study was to develop a visual profile of Queensland Indigenous children. Vision testing was performed on 595 primary schoolchildren in Queensland, Australia. Vision parameters measured included visual acuity, refractive error, color vision, nearpoint of convergence, horizontal heterophoria, fusional vergence range, accommodative facility, AC/A ratio, visual motor integration, and rapid automatized naming. Near heterophoria, nearpoint of convergence, and near fusional vergence range were used to classify convergence insufficiency (CI). Although refractive error (Indigenous, 10%; non-Indigenous, 16%; p = 0.04) and strabismus (Indigenous, 0%; non-Indigenous, 3%; p = 0.03) were significantly less common in Indigenous children, CI was twice as prevalent (Indigenous, 10%; non-Indigenous, 5%; p = 0.04). Reduced visual information processing skills were more common in Indigenous children (reduced visual motor integration [Indigenous, 28%; non-Indigenous, 16%; p < 0.01] and slower rapid automatized naming [Indigenous, 67%; non-Indigenous, 59%; p = 0.04]). The prevalence of visual impairment (reduced visual acuity) and color vision deficiency was similar between groups. Indigenous children have less refractive error and strabismus than their non-Indigenous peers. However, CI and reduced visual information processing skills were more common in this group. Given that vision screenings primarily target visual acuity assessment and strabismus detection, this is an important finding as many Indigenous children with CI and reduced visual information processing may be missed.

All patients had nasal defects after removal of a benign nevus (diameter, >1.5 cm), which invaded distal nasal subunits (including the nasal tip, soft triangle, columella, and nasal ala) and could not be repaired using adjacent tissue. Preoperative and postoperative assessments of esthetic outcomes were analyzed, including skin color and texture match, appearance deformity, and scar appearance. All 6 female patients (ages 4 to 24 years) accepted the extended forehead flap technique and subsequent laser hair removal treatments. Among the 6 patients, 2 had nasal tip defects, 1 had a columella nasi defect, one had an alar defect, and 2 had multiunit defects. All transferred forehead flaps survived with no necrosis and underwent 2 to 5 subsequent laser hair removal treatments. The color and texture of the transferred flaps was similar to the adjacent skin in all patients. All patients were satisfied with the final outcome of the reconstructed nose with no obvious scarring during follow-up. Extending the forehead flap using the scalp is a practical and safe approach for the repair of large and distal nasal defects. Subsequent laser hair removal can eliminate the hair follicles of the scalp and improve the appearance and color of the flap.

745,745,9860071,"To describe the recent epidemic of photosensitive seizure that occurred in relation to an episode of the television animation program ""Pocket Monsters,"" we report four patients who experienced seizures while watching the episode in question. We also report some technical aspects of the program episode. We investigated the clinical symptoms of the four patients and performed routine EEGs with intermittent photic stimulation (IPS). If IPS provoked no photoparoxysmal response (PPR) during the routine EEG examination, a second EEG was performed with the photic stimulator placed 10 cm from the patient's eyes. In addition, we reviewed the ""Pocket Monsters"" episode, focusing our attention on the visual techniques used with reference to the Independent Television Commission (ITC) guidelines. One patient who had myoclonic jerks before the convulsion in question was diagnosed as having juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and the diagnosis of another patient was pure photosensitive epilepsy. The remaining two patients had their first seizures, which could be occasional seizures, and we therefore could not reach a diagnosis of epilepsy. In our four patients, only one showed PPR on the routine EEG. Two patients revealed PPR on the second EEG, and the remaining patient showed no PPR. Rapid changes in color are believed to be responsible for the photosensitive seizures because all four patients had seizures at around 18:50, when seconds of deep red and bright blue flashes, alternating at a frequency of 12 Hz, were shown. Regulations for technical aspects of children's programming, including the use of colors, are urgently needed in Japan to prevent a repeated incident. In addition, the IPS procedure needs to be standardized, especially for patients who are suspected to have photosensitivity.

747,747,25716758,"Management of full-thickness facial burns remains one of the greatest challenges. Controversy exists among surgeons regarding the use of early excision for facial burns. Unfortunately, delayed excision of deeper burns often results in more scarring and subsequent reconstruction becomes more difficult. A collagen-elastin matrix is used to improve the quality of the reconstructed skin, to reduce scarring and to prevent wound contraction. It serves as a foundation for split thickness skin graft and enhances short and long-term results. We report the usage of a collagen-elastin matrix during single-step wound closure technique of severe full-thickness facial burns in 15 children with large burned body surface area, and also we review the literature about pediatric facial burns. There were 15 pediatric patients with severe facial burns, 8 girls and 7 boys ranging in age from 10 months to 12 years, mean age 7 years and 6 months old. The facial burn surface area (FBSA) among the patients includes seven patients with 100%, five with 75%, and three with 50%. The average total body surface area (TBSA) for the patients was 72%, ranging between 50 and 90%. 5 of the patients' admissions were late, more than four days after burns while the rest of the patients were admitted within the first four days (acute admission time). The burns were caused by flame in eight of the patients, bomb blast in four, and scalding in three. All patients were treated by the simultaneous application of the collagen-elastin matrix and an unmeshed split thickness skin graft at Turgut Özal Medical Center, Pediatric Burn Center, Malatya, Turkey. After the treatment only two patients needed a second operation for revision of the grafts. All grafts transplanted to the face survived. The average Vancouver scar scales (VSS) were 2.55±1.42, ranging between one and six, in the first 10 of 15 patients at the end of 6 months postoperatively. VSS measurements of the last 5 patients were not taken since the 6 months postoperative period was not over. In regard to early results, graft quality was close to normal skin in terms of vascularity, elasticity, pliability, texture and color. Esthetic and functional results have been encouraging. This study shows us that the collagen-elastin matrix as a dermal substitute is a useful adjunct, which may result in quick healing with satisfying esthetic and functional results. It also may enhance short and long-term results in after burn facial wound closure in children.

Some authors consider these alterations a consequence of atherosclerotic vessel remodeling, while others ascribe them to anatomical variations of embryological origin. The objective was to establish whether carotid dolichoarteriopathies belonged to a congenital origin or to acquired conditions. Color Doppler ultrasonography of neck vessels was performed in 885 participants, whose age ranged from 1-day-old infants to 90-year-old adults. Prevalence of kinking and coiling was evaluated, and it was related to the presence of cardiovascular risk factors. Prevalence of either kinking or coil of carotid arteries showed no increase with age, as it was comparable across all ages; furthermore, frequency of these alterations showed no relationship to cardiovascular risk factors nor to the presence of atheromatous plaques. These findings suggest that carotid dolichoarteriopathies are a result of alterations in embryological development rather than vascular remodeling secondary to aging and/or atherosclerosis.

However, this method is not widely used because it is associated with problems at the donor site. To solve these problems, a new method was developed in which two different layers of the plantar skin are harvested from the same site. In this method, a split-thickness skin graft of the upper layer including the corneal layer of epidermis and a dermal graft of the lower layer are harvested from the same plantar skin. The split-thickness skin graft is returned to the original donor site, whereas the dermal graft is used for the palmar skin defects on the digits and hand. To prevent drying, the dermal graft was covered with a wound-covering material to achieve good graft takes. Reconstruction was performed for 17 patients using this method, involving digit-only reconstruction in 8 patients, and wider reconstruction in the other 9. Excellent color and texture match of the graft and donor sites were obtained with no noticeable marginal scarring, and the durability of the skin was satisfactory.

752,752,33497062,"Exposure to surgery and anesthesia in early childhood has been found to be associated with an increased risk of behavioral deficits. While the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned against prenatal exposure to anesthetic drugs, little clinical evidence exists to support this recommendation. This study evaluates the association between prenatal exposure to general anesthesia due to maternal procedures during pregnancy and neuropsychological and behavioral outcome scores at age 10. This is an observational cohort study of children born in Perth, Western Australia, with 2 generations of participants contributing data to the Raine Study. In the Raine Study, the first generation (Gen1) are mothers enrolled during pregnancy, and the second generation (Gen2) are the children born to these mothers from 1989 to 1992 with neuropsychological and behavioral tests at age 10 (n=2024). In the primary analysis, 6 neuropsychological and behavioral tests were evaluated at age 10: Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices (CPM), McCarron Assessment of Neuromuscular Development (MAND), Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), Symbol Digit Modality Test (SDMT) with written and oral scores, Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF) with Expressive, Receptive, and Total language scores, and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) with Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total behavior scores. Outcome scores of children prenatally exposed to general anesthesia were compared to children without prenatal exposure using multivariable linear regression models adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates (sex, race, income, and maternal education, alcohol or tobacco use, and clinical diagnoses: diabetes, epilepsy, hypertension, psychiatric disorders, or thyroid dysfunction). Bonferroni adjustment was used for the 6 independent tests in the primary analysis, so a corrected P value <.0083 (P = .05 divided by 6 tests, or a 99.17% confidence interval [CI]) was required for statistical significance. Among 2024 children with available outcome scores, 22 (1.1%) were prenatally exposed to general anesthesia. Prenatally exposed children had higher CBCL Externalizing behavioral scores (score difference of 6.1 [99.17% CI, 0.2-12.0]; P = .006) than unexposed children. Of 6 tests including 11 scores and subscores, only CBCL Externalizing behavioral scores remained significant after multiple comparisons adjustment with no significant differences found in any other score. Prenatal exposure to general anesthetics is associated with increased externalizing behavioral problems in childhood. However, given the limitations of this study and that avoiding necessary surgery during pregnancy can have significant detrimental effects on the mother and the child, further studies are needed before changes to clinical practice are made.

754,754,9464435,"A diagnostic tool to detect early renal dysfunction before it becomes irreversible would be useful in cirrhosis. This study was carried out to evaluate the role of Doppler sonography and Tc-99m DTPA renography in the detection of early renal dysfunction in patients with different grades of liver cirrhosis. Renal arteries of 43 patients with cirrhosis and normal renal function tests were compared with 15 age and gender matched normal subjects as a control group using colour Doppler sonography and Tc-99m DTPA scintigraphy. The patients were categorized into three groups, A (14), B (14) and C (15), according to a modified Child's classification that assesses the severity of liver cirrhosis. Doppler results revealed a highly significant increase in both the pulsatility and resistive indices in groups B and C compared with either group A patients or control subjects and in group C compared with group B (P < 0.001) in the main renal arteries as well as in the interlobar and arcuate arteries. Insignificant differences were observed between group A and controls (PI: control 0.96+/-0.08, group A 0.95+/-0.07, group B 1.26+/-0.06, group C 1.48+/-0.06; RI: control 0.57+/-0.02, group A 0.58+/-0.02, group B 0.66+/-0.01, group C 0.72+/-0.02). Abnormal renograms in the form of delayed appearance (34+/-14.6 s), diminished blood flow bilaterally with prolonged secretory (12+/-4.5 min) and excretory phases (> 30 min) and poor response to intravenous frusemide were only observed in group C patients. Radionuclide computed glomerular filtration rate was within the normal range in patients of group A (81+/-9.5 ml/min) and group B (78+/-8.4 ml/min) and reduced only in patients of group C (34+/-14.5 ml/min). Thus Doppler sonography can detect an increase in renal vascular resistance in patients with moderately severe cirrhosis (Child grade B) when renography was normal. We conclude that Doppler sonography can be used for earlier identification of cirrhotic patients with a higher risk of impending renal failure earlier than renography and may also be used to guide therapeutic approaches.

760,760,24394952,"This study had two purposes. The first was to develop a method to measure horizontal gaze tracking errors (based on synchronized eye and head tracking recordings) as subjects viewed many pitched balls. The second was to assess horizontal eye, head, and gaze tracking strategies of a group of Division 1 college baseball players. Subjects viewed, but did not swing a bat at, tennis balls projected by a pneumatic pitching machine. Subjects were to call out numbers and the color of these numbers (black or red) on the balls. The trajectory of each pitch was very predictable. Eye and head movements were monitored with a video eye tracker and an inertial sensor, respectively, and these movements were synchronized with ball position using an analog recording device. Data were analyzed for 15 subjects. Eye rotation, head rotation, gaze errors (GEs), and unsigned gaze errors (UGEs) were calculated at various elapsed times. On average, subjects tracked the pitched ball with the head throughout the pitch trajectory, while the eye was moved very little until late in the pitch trajectory. On average, gaze position matched the target position throughout the pitch trajectory. There was some variability in the mean amplitudes of head and eye movement between subjects. However, the eye and head were related by a common rule (partial rotational vestibulo-ocular reflex suppression) for all subjects. Although the mean amplitudes of the GE and UGE varied between subjects, these means were not consistent with anticipatory saccades for any subject.

761,761,2627421,"Literature reports of good correlation between two-dimensional color Doppler and ventriculography for estimation of the severity of atrioventricular valve regurgitation have appeared. Local experience has been variable. The purpose of this study was to evaluate three factors for their effect on two-dimensional color Doppler display of the apparent area of regurgitant flow. The factors studied were instrument gain setting, pulse repetition frequency (PRF), and carrier frequency. Sixteen regurgitant valves were examined with high quality commercial instrumentation from two manufacturers. Electrocardiographic-triggered image gating was used for recording and planimetry of maximal imaged flow area (IFA). Examinations were performed at two gain settings with constant carrier frequency and PRF, at three carrier frequencies (2.5, 3.5, and 5 MHz) at constant gain, and at differing PRF (3.0 to 12 kHz). Reduction in gain setting made little difference in asthetic quality of regurgitant jets, but their areas decreased by 29%. Carrier frequency was found to greatly affect IFA, with each higher carrier frequency giving significantly smaller IFAs. PRF also affected IFA consistently, with progressively smaller IFAs at each higher PRF. There was no useful correlation between IFA of a single jet evaluated on the two instruments at generally similar settings. It is concluded that instrument gain setting, PRF, and carrier frequency each significantly affects the size of IFA within a single instrument and between different instruments. Given the variety of instruments and settings employed within the cardiology community, it is unlikely that even moderately accurate grading of severity of regurgitation based on IFA can be done unless instrument settings are specified and standardized. There is a clear need for annotation of instrument settings during color Doppler examinations and a need for concensus regarding ""optimal"" settings. Finally, the consistency of reduction in IFA with increasing carrier frequency and PRF within each of the instruments tested suggests investigation of ""normalization"" of IFA displays.

762,762,32919901,"Based on our previous qualitative work, we created a web-based decision aid (DA) prototype to facilitate shared decision-making regarding hypospadias. The objective of this study was to obtain rapid feedback on the prototype as part of an iterative, human-centered design process. We conducted this study at a statewide, pediatric educational conference in May 2019, recruiting attendees by verbal/written announcements. The DA consisted of: hypospadias overview and surgery ""storyboard,"" frequently asked questions, parent testimonials, and a values clarification exercise. Participants viewed the DA on a tablet as they participated in semi-structured, qualitative interviews covering website acceptability, usability, and preference for surgical photographs versus illustrations. Three coders used qualitative content analysis to identify themes and resolved disagreements by consensus. Of 295 conference attendees, all 50 who approached us agreed to participate. Responses from 49 participants were available for analysis: 67% female, ages 20-69, 65% Caucasian, 55% MDs. 96% of participants thought the website design matched its purpose; 59.1% preferred surgical illustrations, 8.2% preferred photos, 30.6% preferred both and 2.0% did not like either. Participants recommended improvements in: a) usability/accessibility (e.g. site navigation, visual layout, page length), b) content coverage (e.g. epidemiology, consequences of no/delayed surgery, lifelong risks), c) parent-centeredness (e.g. reading level/writing style) and d) implementation (provider tools, printable handouts). The Extended Summary Figure shows a revised image of the first step of a hypospadias repair based on feedback about participants' preferences for illustrations rather than photographs. The main strength of our study was the valuable feedback we obtained to inform critical revisions of the DA prototype. We also demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of a conducting a usability evaluation of a web-based DA in a medical conference setting. One limitation of this study is that the relatively small population sampled limits generalizability and our findings may not reflect the views of all providers who care for hypospadias patients. The vast majority of providers thought that the design of the Hypospadias Homepage matched its purpose and most preferred surgical illustrations rather than photos to demonstrate the steps of hypospadias surgery. Based on their feedback, we plan to focus our efforts in the following areas: 1) improvement of navigation/menus, 2) reduction in the amount of text per page, 3) expansion of specific content coverage and 4) inclusion of ""parent-friendly"" visuals such as infographics to represent quantitative data and colorful illustrations to depict hypospadias and its surgical repair.

Remarkable advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging continue to evince a bidirectional relation between the functional flow of activation across the brain and the etiology of psychiatric disorders. This work is analogous to that of a city engineer surveying traffic to understand flow patterns, efficiency, congestion, and even the influence of city-wide conditions (eg, snowfall). Yet, the engineer further considers a factor long neglected in human neuroscience-the roads. Functional connectivity does not take place across the intercellular ether, but across a nexus of millions of interconnected axonal pathways or white matter (WM), so named for the color given by the fatty myelin surrounding the axons. Insight into the role of these tracts in the pathology of psychiatric illness continues to be limited, in contrast to the functional connectivity they support. WM tracts are among the last components of the brain to reach maturity, and their malleability in youth may play a key role in the manifestation of psychopathology in children.

766,766,38237634,"The CME review presented here is intended to explain the significance of pleural sonography to the interested reader and to provide information on its application. At the beginning of sonography in the 80 s of the 20th centuries, with the possible resolution of the devices at that time, the pleura could only be perceived as a white line. Due to the high impedance differences, the pleura can be delineated particularly well. With the increasing high-resolution devices of more than 10 MHz, even a normal pleura with a thickness of 0.2 mm can be assessed. This article explains the special features of the examination technique with knowledge of the pre-test probability and describes the indications for pleural sonography. Pleural sonography has a high value in emergency and intensive care medicine, preclinical, outpatient and inpatient, in the general practitioner as well as in the specialist practice of pneumologists. The special features in childhood (pediatrics) as well as in geriatrics are presented. The recognition of a pneumothorax even in difficult situations as well as the assessment of pleural effusion are explained. With the high-resolution technology, both the pleura itself and small subpleural consolidations can be assessed and used diagnostically. Both the direct and indirect sonographic signs and accompanying symptoms are described, and the concrete clinical significance of sonography is presented. The significance and criteria of conventional brightness-encoded B-scan, colour Doppler sonography (CDS) with or without spectral analysis of the Doppler signal (SDS) and contrast medium ultrasound (CEUS) are outlined. Elastography and ultrasound-guided interventions are also mentioned. A related further paper deals with the diseases of the lung parenchyma and another paper with the diseases of the thoracic wall, diaphragm and mediastinum.

The 14q32 breakpoints are heterogeneous. Because the t(5;14)(q35;q32) is hard to detect using conventional karyotyping, it is easily missed in routine diagnostics. Here we describe the development and application of split signal fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays for both HOX11L2 and CSX, for detection of t(5;14) possibly present in T-ALL patients. We developed and validated two split signal FISH assays for metaphase and interphase detection of t(5;14) in T-ALL patients. We also investigated the involvement of IGH on 14q32. In addition, HOX11L2 and SIL-TAL1 expression was studied using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The FISH assays were validated on cell lines and T-ALL patients. We did not identify cases with a t(5;14)(q35;q32) involving CSX, but we did identify 5 cases of t(5;14) involving HOX11L2 out of 32 T-ALL cases studied; in each case the 14q32 breakpoint was found to be centromeric to the IGH region. All 5 positive cases showed HOX11L2 expression, as did 1 case without t(5;14)(q35;q32). Cases with t(5;14)(q35;q32) involving HOX11L2 did not show TAL1 abnormalities, whereas 5 HOX11L2 negative cases did. Using the newly developed and validated FISH probe sets, we identified 5 new cases of t(5;14) involving HOX11L2 both on metaphases and interphases. The incidence of the t(5;14)(q35;q32) involving CSX is probably low.

The objective of this study was to determine whether a colour-banded MUAC strap would allow minimally trained mothers to screen their own children for malnutrition, without locating the mid-point of the left upper arm by measurement, as currently recommended. A non-randomised non-blinded evaluation of mothers' performance when measuring MUAC after minimal training, compared with trained Community Health Workers (CHW) following current MUAC protocols. The study was conducted in 2 villages in Mirriah, Zinder region, Niger where mothers classified one of their children (n = 103) aged 6-59 months (the current age range for admission into community malnutrition programs) using the MUAC tape. Mothers' had a sensitivity and specificity for classification of their child's nutritional status of > 90% and > 80% respectively for global acute malnutrition (GAM, defined by a MUAC < 125 mm) and > 73% and > 98% for severe acute malnutrition (SAM, defined by a MUAC < 115 mm).

772,772,27695660,"This paper considers the ethical, legal, and social issues raised by the prospect of increasing use of psychiatric genetic data in child custody litigation. Although genetic tests cannot currently confirm a parent or child's psychiatric diagnosis, it is likely that as relevant findings emerge, they will be introduced in family courts to challenge parental capacity. Here, we draw on three projected, but plausible, scenarios for obtaining psychiatric data about parents -- imposed genetic testing, access to medical records, and genetic theft -- then consider the use of psychiatric genetic data of children, to highlight the issues that judges, child custody evaluators, and clinicians who may provide treatment for parents or children with mental health issues will need to consider. These include: genetic privacy, stigma, genetic surveillance, and judicial and health professionals' bias. We argue that the unchecked introduction of psychiatric genetic data may have a detrimental effect on the administration of justice. In particular, the article highlights the risk that the (mis)use of psychiatric genetic data in custody disputes would 1) exacerbate stigma and treatment-avoidance among parents and incentivize privacy violations to pressure parents to relinquish parental rights; 2) disproportionately affect poor parents and single mothers of color involved with Child Protective Services; and 3) detract attention from social and environmental factors impacting mental health to the detriment of the families involved.

777,777,36670679,"Creativity offers new, interesting, and valuable things that can be intangible (ideas, a theory, songs, etc.) or physical objects (a painting, invention, machine). Creativity implies a lot of qualities of the creator such as imagination, creative work, and innovation and it also improves learning and memory. Many of history's most important discoveries are the results of creative activity. Repetition leads to mastery of a concept through understanding and produces increased self-confidence. Confidence increases the willingness to act on creativity-to explore, discover, and learn. This positive cycle of learning is fueled by the curiosity and enjoyment that comes from discovery and understanding. We are social creatures, so the greatest reward and pleasure comes from the admiration and support received from loved and respected people. Stimulating children's interest through play also defines solving through exploration regarding the accumulation of new essential information for knowing values and other useful information, by stimulating curiosity and creativity as well as discovering new resources that generate creative ideas, allowing the acquisition of practical skills. All these aspects are oriented and define the premises for the harmonious development of children towards a new existential stage. Thus, taking these aspects into account will have future effects on self-confidence, work strategies, school results, as well as the desire to study and the ability to store and organize accumulated information. The approach of the case study presents through the game, a motivational alternative, staged regarding the generation of creative ideas in the development and materialization of the concept. It is well known that during childhood, many things are acquired by children through selective association and depending on the sensory perception of objects, namely preferred colors, functions, and predefined shapes, proportional to the anthropometric dimensions specific to preschool age.

Subclinical ASEs have been related to the emergence of the risk for developing psychotic disorders, and inducing such states in the general population could shed light on the factors underlying interindividual differences in proneness to these phenomena. We aimed to examine the influence of schizotypal personality traits on proneness to experiencing induced ASEs from a developmental perspective, from childhood to adulthood. Two hundred and sixteen children, adolescents, and young adults participated in the MGT, and their schizotypal personality traits were assessed with the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire. Statistical analyses assessed the relationship between schizotypy dimensions and induced ASEs, and we further tested their dynamic relationship as function of age (from childhood to adulthood). Results confirmed the developmental trajectory of the different schizotypy dimensions, with scores peaking during adolescence, and proneness to induced ASEs seemed to follow a similar developmental trajectory. Moreover, positive (p = 0.001) and disorganized (p = 0.004) dimensions were found to contribute to the proneness to experiencing induced ASEs. Finally, the developmental model showed that positive schizotypy (p = 0.035) uniquely distinguished between experiencing other-identity phenomena between childhood and adulthood. This study has the potential to inform research on early detection of psychosis through a developmental approach and links the concept of schizotypy with processes of perceptual self-distortions.

We investigated the value of the significance and area of sodium retention and vasoactive hormones. In addition, we measured parameters such as inferior vena cava collapsibility index, left atrium diameter, and total body water (TBW) to determine the volume load and cause of edema in children with SSNS. TBW increased in the relapse-nephrotic syndrome group and the difference was statistically significant among groups (P < 0.001). However, inferior vena cava collapsibility index and left atrium diameter were not different among groups. Fractional sodium excretion was lower in children with relapse nephrotic syndrome (P < 0.05). Although TBW increases in children with SSNS, intravascular volume is normal.

784,784,33518485,"Obesity has been steadily rising in the last few decades and to some extent, have been linked to exposure of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). ACEs are intense stressors or traumatic events experienced or witnessed by children, ranging from all types of abuse (physical, emotional, and sexual), neglect, substance abuse or community violence. These traumatic events deprive the sense of safety and stability of a child, leaving psychological and physiological effects that span into adulthood. The prevalence of ACEs is common across developed and developing countries alike, though the rates differ across ethnicities. Using the United States as an example, the prevalence of ACEs experienced by communities of color is higher than white children. Children around the world could all be exposed to ACEs, hence the original questionnaire capturing the score of ACE has been adapted to different cultural situations. The mechanism linking ACEs to obesity during adulthood include biological, psychological, and environmental factors. Nevertheless, a higher ACE score heightens the risk of poor mental health, attempted suicide and development of obesity and diabetes in adulthood. Prevention of ACEs starts from building positive relationships within families, developing healthy relationship skills, and screening of ACEs during early and routine pediatrician's and primary care visits. Intervention needs to include case management services and psychosocial support programs. When these risk factors are intervened early, it lessens the risk of obesity and diabetes in adulthood.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Study subjects were 21 patients with PDA (mean age, 3.6 years). We measured VCW (mm/m(2)) and ESOA (cm(2)) by the PISA method using echocardiography. Color images were obtained from parasternal long-axis views. VCW (mm/m(2)) was measured at the narrowest region of PDA flow.

An adequate operation time (OT) for children decreases morbidity risk and improves hospital time utilization efficiency. The aim of the study is to assess the effect of pediatric dental resident training level on OT for pediatric dental rehabilitation procedures under GA at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC). A cross-sectional study included pediatric dental rehabilitation performed under GA by pediatric dental residents at (KAMC) -Jeddah from October/2015 to September/2022. The primary outcome was OT, and the predictive variable was resident training levels. A linear regression analysis was used to compare OT between procedures performed by junior (years 1-2) or senior (years 3-4) trainees, adjusting for patient and operative factors. One thousand seven pediatric dental rehabilitation cases were performed under GA by junior (13) and senior (31) residents. The univariant analysis indicated that OT for senior residents was significantly longer (13 min) than for junior residents. However, the linear regression analysis showed that senior residents had a significantly shorter OT when considering the more dental procedures performed per case under GA than junior residents. Senior residents took significantly more radiographs and performed more primary pulp therapies and multi-surface anterior colored restorations under GA than junior residents. The OT for pediatric dental rehabilitation procedures under GA is associated with resident training level. The total OT was significantly longer based on procedure number, type, and resident level. The study indicated that senior residents could manage more complex cases in a shorter time. The finding emphasizes the importance of assigning GA cases to residents based on their level and the case's complexity.

The clinical course usually involves chronic bronchial infection and inflammation, which are associated with progression. The cause of bronchiectasis should always be investigated, particularly when it can be treated. We recommend evaluating etiology, symptoms, bronchial colonization and infection, respiratory function, inflammation, structural damage, nutritional status, and quality of life in order to assess severity and to monitor clinical course. Care should be supervised by specialized units, at least in cases of chronic bronchial infection, recurrent exacerbations, or when there is a cause that is likely to respond to treatment. Improving symptoms and halting progression are the goals of management, which is based on treatment of the underlying cause and of acute or chronic infections and on the drainage of secretions. Complications that arise must also be treated. Antibiotic prescription is guided by how well infection is being controlled, and this is indicated by the color of sputum and a reduction in the number of exacerbations. We recommend inhaled antibiotics in cases of chronic bronchial infection that does not respond to oral antibiotics, when these cause side effects, or when the cause is Pseudomonas species or other bacteria resistant to oral antibiotics.

In this study, right ventricular systolic pressures (RVSP) and PASP of 36 patients (19 girls, 17 boys; aged 5 months to 15 years) with CHD were estimated by TRDS before and after galactose solution (GS) and were compared with catheterization measurements. Significant TRDS (> 1 m sec.) were obtained in nine of 36 (25%), patients before GS and in 23 of 36 patients (64%) after GS. TRDS were increased significantly by contrast agent. Estimated RVSP and PASP were significantly different from the measured pressures before and after GS. There were significant correlations between the estimated RVSP and PASP and measured RVSP after GS. Estimated pressures were underestimated. We conclude that it is better to use the estimated PASP on patients with significant TRDS for the classification of PASP.

As timely identification of liver fibrosis may result in management changes to Fontan patients, the aim of our study was to identify clinically meaningful semi quantitative/quantitative pathologic parameters for biopsy assessment. We performed a retrospective review of 74 liver needle biopsies from Fontan patients. Fibrosis was assessed using quantitative % collagen deposition by Sirius red image analysis, METAVIR, congestive hepatic fibrosis score, sinusoidal fibrosis score, and sinusoidal dilation score. Contemporaneous laboratory, hemodynamic, and ultrasound data were collected. Centrilobular and peri sinusoidal fibrosis was observed in all cases, with 39.2% high grade. Portal fibrosis was observed in 93.2%, with 36.2% high-grade (METAVIR F3-F4).

Mildly elevated prothrombin time/international normalized ratio was the only measure of liver function consistently associated with multiple high-grade fibrosis scores (METAVIR P = .046, sinusoidal fibrosis P = .018).

A total of 164 patients underwent extracorporeal HIFU ablation of malignant solid tumors. After HIFU treatment, enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), color Doppler ultrasound (US) imaging, dynamic radionuclide scanning, digital subtraction angiography, and histologic study were performed to monitor the response of tumor vessels to HIFU ablation. Compared with tumor images in the patients before HIFU, clinical images showed an abrupt interruption, followed by the cessation of blood flow within the tumor vessels after HIFU treatment. The histologic examination indicated that not only the treated tumor cells showed coagulative necrosis, but also small tumor vessels were severely damaged by the HIFU treatment. The results strongly imply that the damaged tumor vessels might play a critical role in secondary tumor cell death, and then indirectly strengthen the destructive force of focused US beams on tumor tissue.

Particularly vulnerable populations are affected, including women, pregnant women, children, the disabled, and the elderly, who comprise the majority of the poor globally. Additionally, the effects of climate change disproportionally affect disadvantaged communities, including low income and communities of color, and lower-income countries that are at highest risk of adverse impacts when disasters occur due to inequitable distribution of resources and their socioeconomic status. The climate crisis is tilting the risk balance unfavorably for women's sexual and reproductive health and rights as well as newborn and child health. Obstetrician/gynecologists have the unique opportunity to raise awareness, educate, and advocate for mitigation strategies to reverse climate change affecting our patients and their families. This article puts climate change in the context of women's reproductive health as a public health issue, a social justice issue, a human rights issue, an economic issue, a political issue, and a gender issue that needs our attention now for the health and well-being of this and future generations. FIGO joins a broad coalition of international researchers and the medical community in stating that the current climate crisis presents an imminent health risk to pregnant people, developing fetuses, and reproductive health, and recognizing that we need society-wide solutions, government policies, and global cooperation to address and reduce contributors, including fossil fuel production, to climate change.

813,813,32169527,"The purpose of this study was to use social indicators to compare adolescent health disparities across neighborhoods in Baltimore, Maryland, circa 2017. Neighborhoods heavily influence adolescent health outcomes. Baltimore remains a hypersegregated city along racial boundaries with a recently growing population of Latino immigrant youth. This segregation may promulgate adolescent health disparities, yet the magnitude of needs and how they may differ among Baltimore's minoritized adolescents remain unknown. The most predominantly white, black, and Latino neighborhoods in Baltimore were analyzed across six indicators relevant to adolescent health: teen birth rate, high school achievement, poverty, health insurance, youth mortality rate, and lead paint violation rate. The indicators were used to create a composite adolescent deprivation index. Measures of absolute and relative disparity were then calculated between white, black, and Latino neighborhood clusters. Both black and Latino neighborhoods had similar adolescent deprivation relative to white neighborhoods. Latino neighborhoods had the highest teen birth rate and children without health insurance. Black neighborhoods had the lowest educational achievement and the highest poverty, youth mortality, and lead paint violation rate. The overall magnitude of social deprivation is similar across communities of color in Baltimore. However, black adolescents tend to live in neighborhoods with greater physical deprivation and youth mortality that limits within-group bonding capacity, whereas Latino adolescents tend to live in neighborhoods with limited health and social resources that prevent between-group bridging capacity. These indicators thus orient policies and programs to promote differential asset-based strategies for positive youth development.

814,814,32986887,"Low calcium intake is common worldwide and can result in nutritional rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Calcium-fortified foods could improve calcium intake. However, there is limited calcium fortification experience, with technical and practical issues that may hamper its adoption. The objective of this landscape review is to summarize these issues to help policymakers guide the planning and design of calcium fortification as a public health strategy. One challenge is the low bioavailability of calcium salts (∼20-40%); thus, large amounts need to be added to food to have a meaningful impact. Solubility is important when fortifying liquids and acidic foods. Calcium salts could change the flavor, color, and appearance of the food and may account for 70-90% of the total fortification cost. Safety is key to avoid exceeding the recommended intake; so the amount of added calcium should be based on the target calcium intake and the gap between inadequate and adequate levels. Monitoring includes the quality of the fortified food and population calcium intake using dietary assessment methods. Calcium fortification should follow regulations, implemented in an intersectorial way, and be informed by the right to health and equity. This information may help guide and plan this public health strategy.

This study, during which the relationship between the symptomatology and patency has been studied, explores the influence of the local hemodynamic changes and the effect of microsurgical technique on patency rates. Thirty-five patients with a total of 44 arterial injuries were treated. Hemodynamic studies were done intraoperatively, and all patients were evaluated postoperatively with a neurologic, vascular, clinical examination and by radiodiagnostic methods. An overall patency of 77.2% was found. Color-Doppler ultrasonography (CDU) failed by 14.2% as compared with angiography, which did not fail. High blood pressure on the distal stump led to significantly reduced patency rates. Eight patients without nerve problems were found to be symptomatic as a result of the poor patency rate. Many factors are observed to influence patency rate. The nonpatent forearm artery can be symptomatic in anatomically and hemodynamically varied hands. CDU was more reliable for hemodynamic evaluation; conversely, angiography was more dependable for arterial morphology. The results of this study suggest that to correlate the clinical symptomatology and the patency rates, all arterial repairs should be assessed both clinically and radiodiagnostically.

A Step-Perturbation paradigm explored online corrections in control children and children with DCD aged between 7 and 13 years. Control children found the task straightforward: a distracter had no effect and they managed to stop relatively quickly. Children with DCD found the task difficult and the apparatus was modified accordingly (decreased postural and force production demands). The distracter affected some children with DCD and some found it difficult to stop. All of the DCD population showed poorer performance in both the perturbation and non-perturbation condition. Nevertheless, there was no interaction between group and condition. Thus, this study found no evidence for specific deficits in online correction mechanisms in DCD. We suggest that: (i) fundamental problems in generating basic movements can account for the documented difficulties in correcting on-going movements, and (ii) such fundamental difficulties make it very difficult to pinpoint specific mechanism deficits.

However, collective traumatic memories of past infectious diseases and the current impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in many Indigenous communities point to the need for Indigenous strengths-based public health resources. Further, recent data suggest that COVID-19 is escalating mental health and psychosocial health inequities for Indigenous communities. To align with the intergenerational strengths of Indigenous communities in the face of the pandemic, we developed a strengths- and culturally-based public health education and mental health coping resource for Indigenous children and families. Using a community-engaged process, the Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health collaborated with 14 Indigenous and allied child development, mental health, health communications experts and public health professionals, as well as a Native American youth artist. Indigenous collaborators and Indigenous Johns Hopkins project team members collectively represented 12 tribes, and reservation-based, off-reservation, and urban geographies. This group shared responsibility for culturally adapting the children's book ""My Hero is You: How Kids Can Fight COVID-19!"" developed by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Reference Group on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergency Settings and developing ancillary materials. Through an iterative process, we produced the storybook titled ""Our Smallest Warriors, Our Strongest Medicine: Overcoming COVID-19"" with content and illustrations representing Indigenous values, experiences with COVID-19, and strengths to persevere. In addition, parent resource materials, children's activities, and corresponding coloring pages were created. The book has been disseminated online for free, and 42,364 printed copies were distributed to early childhood home visiting and tribal head start programs, Indian Health Service units, tribal health departments, intertribal, and urban Indigenous health organizations, Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health project sites in partnering communities, schools, and libraries.

Central aortic cannulation through the same incision has been the usual strategy, but it has the disadvantage of cluttering of the operative field. We hereby present the results of femoral cannulation in minimally invasive pediatric cardiac surgery in terms of adequacy and safety. From January 2013 to June 2016, 200 children (122 males) with mean ± SD age of 9.2 ± 4.51 years (median = 6 years, range = 3-18 years) and weight of 19.22 ± 8.49 kg (median = 15 kg, range = 8-45 kg) were operated for congenital cardiac defects through anterolateral thoracotomy. The most common diagnosis was atrial septal defect (144 patients). In all the patients, femoral artery and femoral vein were cannulated along with direct superior vena cava cannulation for institution of cardiopulmonary bypass. There were no deaths or any major complications related to femoral cannulation. Femoral artery cannulation provided adequate arterial inflow, whereas femoral vein with direct superior vena cava cannulation provided adequate venous return in all the patients. No patient required vacuum-assisted venous drainage. No patient required conversion to sternotomy or developed vascular, neurological complications. At discharge and at 1-year follow-up, both femoral artery and vein were patent without a significant stenosis on color Doppler ultrasonography in all the patients. At mean ± SD follow-up period of 30.63 ± 10.09 months, all the patients were doing well without any wound-related, neurological, or vascular complications.

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients seen between September 1996 and August 2011. We enrolled those diagnosed with CAF via echocardiography (Philips SONOS 7500 system and Philips IE33) or angiography. The mean follow time was 42.58 ± 3.4 months (range, 1-166 months). For comparative purposes, participants were grouped as acquired versus congenital, and symptomatic versus asymptomatic. We also measured the size of the coronary artery (CA) in patients with CA dilatation (CAD). Out of 122 CAF patients, spontaneous closure was detected in 37 patients at 21.59 ± 3.45 months after diagnosis. This timeframe did not differ between the acquired and congenital groups (21.64 ± 6.26 months vs. 21.57 ± 4.15 months; p = 0.991). Ninety patients were asymptomatic and remained so; their spontaneous closure rate was 28.89%. Moreover, 24 patients had CAD, including 17 with Kawasaki disease and seven with congenital CAF. The CAs of all congenital-CAF-plus-CAD patients were initially > 5 mm; these patients underwent percutaneous transcatheter intervention, and their CA sizes decreased significantly (6.11 ± 0.79 mm vs. 3.76 ± 0.36 mm; p = 0.002). With the advanced sensitivity of echocardiography, CAF can be detected more easily than ever before. Most patients with small CAFs are asymptomatic and may experience spontaneous closure. Therefore, management of CAF depends on symptoms; if patients are asymptomatic and have small CAFs, intervention may not be necessary, especially in acquired cases. However, if patients present with symptoms or persistent dilatation of the proximal CA, surgical or percutaneous closure should be performed.

We sought to determine the distribution of lymphocyte subsets in healthy urban-dwelling infants, children, and adolescents in the United States. Lymphocyte subsets were determined by means of 3-color flow cytometry in a cross-sectional study of 807 HIV-unexposed children from birth through 18 years of age. Cell-surface marker analysis demonstrated that age was an extremely important variable in 24 lymphocyte subset distributions measured as percentages or absolute counts--eg, the CD4 (helper) T cell, CD8 (cytotoxic) T cell, CD19 B cell, CD4CD45RACD62L (naive helper) T cell, CD3CD4CD45RO (memory helper) T cell, CD8HLA-DRCD38 (activated cytotoxic) T cell, and CD8CD28 (activation primed cytotoxic) T cell. The testing laboratory proved to be an important variable, indicating the need for using the same laboratory or group of laboratories to assay an individual's blood over time and to assay control and ill or treated populations. Sex and race-ethnicity were much less important. The results of this study provide a control population for assessment of the effects of HIV infection on the normal development and distribution of lymphocyte subsets in children of both sexes, all races, and all ethnic backgrounds from birth through 18 years of age in an urban population. This study's findings will also prove invaluable in interpreting the immune changes in children with many other chronic diseases, such as primary immunodeficiency, malignancy, rheumatoid arthritis, and asthma.

Our purpose was to examine the clinical features of Ota's naevus in Koreans and to assess the clinical outcomes and histological changes induced by a Q-switched alexandrite laser at 755 nm. Eighty-seven Koreans with Ota's naevus were studied; the peak age of onset was during the first decade and adolescence. The infraorbital area was the most frequent site and black or dark brown colours predominated. Improvements were achieved in 52 patients (77%). Better results were obtained in unilateral lesions and patients who received a greater number of treatments. Mild hyperpigmentation after treatment was noticed in 14 patients and mild hypopigmentation in eight patients. However, all of these were reversed in time. Hypertrophic scarring or secondary infection did not occur. The histology of laser-irradiated lesions showed selective thermal damage of melanocytes in the upper dermis and the elimination of upper dermal pigmentation.

The thyroid glands of 80 patients with HT and 107 healthy, asymptomatic participants were examined using SMI. The thyroid parenchyma echogenicity was evaluated, and the thyroid gland volume was measured. Vascularization index measurements were performed by manually drawing the contours of the thyroid parenchyma using the free region of interest with color 2-dimensional SMI VI mode. The quantitative VI values of the patients and the asymptomatic group were compared. Correlations between VI values and thyroid autoantibodies and thyroid hormone levels were analyzed. The mean VI value of the thyroid gland was 4.74% ± 1.96% in the asymptomatic group and 12.45% ± 5.87% in HT patients with a statistically significant difference (P < 0.001). Hashimoto thyroiditis can be diagnosed with 86.3% sensitivity and 82.2% specificity when 6.00% VI value was designated as the cutoff value. There was a positive significant correlation between the VI value and the thyroid-stimulating hormone, antithyroglobulin antibodies, anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody levels (P < 0.05); however, no significant correlation was found between the VI values and thyroglobulin and free thyroxine levels (P > 0.05). There was a significant negative correlation between the VI values and the parenchyma echogenicity and positive significant correlation between the thyroid gland volume and the antithyroglobulin antibody and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody levels (P < 0.05). The VI obtained using the SMI technique can be effectively used as an imaging method for the diagnosis of HT because of its high sensitivity and specificity in representing objective, quantitative numerical values.

There was a pedunculated polyp in the transverse colon. Complete endoscopic electroresection of this polyp was performed and the polyp was sent for histopathologic analysis. Macroscopically, the polyp was described as a fragment of irregular round shape, size of about 2.5x2x1 cm, with fine-grained, reddish surface, showing dark red color on serial sections. Histologic examination of the polyp showed some irregularly distributed glands, some of which were cystically dilated. All glandular formations were coated with normal intestinal epithelium. The surface of the polyp was partially eroded and replaced by non-specific cellular granulation tissue. There were some signs of hemorrhagic infarction in the stroma of the polyp.

Sixteen patients underwent single coil embolization and three patients received two coils simultaneously with detachable coil systems. Follow-up evaluation was performed with color flow mapping and pulsed Doppler echo to identify residual shunt or acquired left pulmonary artery stenosis after embolization at 1 day, 1 week, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, and every 6 months thereafter. In two patients, a coil had migrated into the distal left pulmonary artery immediately after implantation, and could be safely retrieved. Minimum residual shunt was found in six patients (32%) on the day after the procedure. Spontaneous closure was noted in all patients within 6 months. Recanalization of completely occluded PDA was observed in one patient at 1 month after embolization. However, spontaneous closure of the residual shunt was found at 1 year and 6 months of follow-up. There was no evidence of acquired left pulmonary artery stenosis during the follow-up period (14.5 +/- 5.8 months). Coil embolization is an effective and safe therapy for PDA. Small residual shunt may be observed immediately after the coil embolization, but will close spontaneously during the follow-up.

Clinical records and pathological materials were critically reviewed in each case, including von kossa, CD3, CD20, and CD68 stains. The 14 cases presented clinically as nodular eyelid lesions. All were treated with surgical excision. The authors found 2 distinct histopathological patterns which correlated with the patients' age. In young patients, the authors observed multiple, small calcified bodies within the dermis surrounded by chronic inflammation and granulomatous foreign body reaction. On the other hand, in elderly patients, lesions were characterized by a single, large, well-demarcated amorphous calcified deposit surrounded by fibrous tissue, without chronic inflammation or foreign body reaction. One of these patients, a 70-year-old man, also suffered from gout. The presence of subepidermal calcified nodule was not documented as a preoperative diagnostic possibility in any of the cases. Subepidermal calcified nodule of the eyelid is a rare condition, but should be considered in any patient presenting with a painless white to yellowish colored nodule of the ocular adnexa, particularly during the teenage years.

846,846,28819144,"Cortisol concentrations in hair are used to create hormone profiles spanning months. This method allows assessment of chronic cortisol exposure, but might be biased by hair pigmentation: dark hair was previously related to higher concentrations. It is unclear whether this association arises from local effects, such as increased hormone extractability, or whether the association represents systemic differences arising from population stratification. We tested the hypothesis that hair pigmentation gene variants are associated with varying cortisol levels independent of genetic ancestry. Hormone concentrations and genotype were measured in 1674 children from the Generation R cohort at age 6. We computed a polygenic score of hair color based on 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms. This score was used to predict hair cortisol concentrations, adjusted for genetic ancestry, sex, age and corticosteroid use. A 1-standard deviation (SD) higher polygenic score (darker hair) was associated with 0.08 SD higher cortisol levels (SE = 0.03, p = 0.002). This suggests that variation in hair cortisol concentrations is partly explained by local hair effects. In multi-ancestry studies this hair pigmentation bias can reduce power and confound results.

Additionally, 11-color flow cytometry was performed on peripheral blood samples to determine helper T (Th), regulatory T (Treg), and CD27 FLG mutations were observed in 8.4% of the total population and in 15.7% of the AD cases. Children with any FLG mutation had higher Th22 cell numbers compared to FLG wild-type children in the general and non-AD population. Children with and without FLG mutations had no difference in Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg, or memory B-cell numbers. Furthermore, in children with AD, FLG mutation carriership was not associated with differences in T- and B-cell subsets. School-aged children of a general population with FLG mutations have higher Th22 cell numbers, which reflects the immunological response to the skin barrier dysfunction. FLG mutations did not otherwise affect the composition of the adaptive immunity in this general pediatric population.

849,849,30865233,"It is challenging to differentiate melanoma from melanocytic nevus on the volar skin in the absence of typical dermoscopic patterns. To identify the frequency and clinical and dermoscopic characteristics of melanocytic lesions on the volar skin not displaying a parallel furrow pattern, lattice-like pattern, fibrillar pattern, or parallel ridge pattern on results of dermoscopy. In this retrospective cohort study, a total of 504 melanocytic lesions on the volar skin were evaluated in the Shinshu University Hospital department of dermatology between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2012. Dermoscopic images were independently assessed by 3 dermoscopists for the presence of established dermoscopic criteria. Statistical analysis was performed from October 1, 2017, to April 30, 2018. Frequency of dermoscopic criteria and corresponding clinical (patient age and size and location of lesion) and histopathologic features. Of 504 lesions, 110 (21.8%) (melanocytic nevus, 97; melanoma, 8; and equivocal melanocytic lesion, 5) from 108 patients (68 female and 40 male patients; mean age, 40.1 years [range, 1-86 years]) did not show a parallel furrow pattern, lattice-like pattern, fibrillar pattern, or parallel ridge pattern. Among them, the mean patient age was significantly higher for melanoma than for melanocytic nevus (65.3 vs 38.0 years; P < .001), as was mean maximum lesion diameter (11.8 vs 5.7 mm; P < .001). Melanomas and equivocal melanocytic lesions tended to be distributed on weight-bearing areas of the foot sole, such as the heel, while nevi were spread over non-weight-bearing regions. Dermoscopically, 95 melanocytic nevi (97.9%) were symmetrical in 1 or 2 axes while melanomas were not. A total of 91 melanocytic nevi (93.8%) had 1 or 2 colors per lesion, and 4 melanomas (50.0%) had more than 2 colors. Vascular structures were seen in 3 melanocytic nevi (3.1%) and 3 melanomas (37.5%). Blue-white structures were seen in 18 melanocytic nevi (18.6%) and 3 melanomas (37.5%). Dots and globules were seen in 22 melanocytic nevi (22.7%) and 4 melanomas (50.0%). Vascular structures, blue-white structures, and dots and globules were irregularly distributed in the melanomas. Ulcer, hyperkeratosis, and irregular streaks were observed only in melanomas. More than one-fifth of melanocytic lesions on the volar skin did not display typical dermoscopic patterns. Asymmetry, numerous colors (≥3), and other melanoma-specific dermoscopic findings were more frequently observed for melanomas. Clinical information, including patient age and lesion size and location, was helpful in differentiating melanoma from melanocytic nevus.

This systematic review investigates the perceptions of adolescents towards these packaging interventions. Published, original-research, English-language articles from 1 January 2000 to 1 September 2017 were identified through a systematic literature search of the PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Articles describing investigations into the perceptions of adolescents aged 11 to 19 years towards graphic health warnings and/or plain-packaged cigarettes were included in this review. Nineteen articles, involving 15,935 adolescent participants, of which 72.85% were non-smokers or ex-smokers and 27.15% occasional or daily smokers, met the eligibility criteria. Graphic health warnings were perceived as more effective than text-only warnings, with warnings depicting lung cancer, and oral diseases being perceived as particularly effective. Health warnings increased viewer fear, anxiety, shock, and guilt and were considered effective in preventing non-smokers from experimenting with tobacco and prompting current smokers to quit. Plain packaging reduced the attractiveness and other positive attributes of cigarette packaging, with darker colours found to be the most effective. When used in combination, plain packaging increased the visibility of graphic health warnings, with participants also perceiving them as having an increased tar content and having more serious health risks, and increased thoughts of quitting amongst smokers. Graphic health warnings and plain packaging appear to increase adolescent awareness of the dangers of tobacco use. Further research into the most effective warnings to use in combination with plain packaging is needed to ensure the greatest reduction in tobacco use and prevent tobacco-attributable morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable population.

854,854,23269715,"The goals of this study were to investigate the difference in carotid arterial stiffness in obese children compared to healthy children and to study the correlation between carotid arterial stiffness parameters and obesity using ultrasound (US) radiofrequency (RF) data technology. Carotid artery stiffness parameters, including the compliance coefficient, stiffness index, and pulse wave velocity, were evaluated in 71 obese patients and 47 healthy controls with US RF data technology. In addition, all participants were evaluated for fat thickness in the paraumbilical abdominal wall and fatty liver using abdominal US. Compared to the control group, the blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), fat thickness in the paraumbilical abdominal wall, presence of fatty liver, and carotid stiffness parameters (stiffness index and pulse wave velocity) were significantly higher in the obese group, whereas the compliance coefficient was significantly lower in the obese group. Furthermore, the pulse wave velocity was weakly positively correlated with the BMI, systolic BP, diastolic BP, and paraumbilical abdominal wall fat thickness, whereas the compliance coefficient was weakly negatively correlated with the systolic BP, BMI, and paraumbilical abdominal wall fat thickness. The presence of a fatty liver was moderately positively correlated with the BMI and weakly positively correlated with the pulse wave velocity. Ultrasound RF data technology may be a sensitive noninvasive method that can be used to accurately and quantitatively detect the difference in carotid artery stiffness in obese children compared to healthy children.

The purpose of this study is to examine prevention of fall due to intervention from a fall working group established in our hospital. The working group focused on three main points. First, colored wrist bands for patients classified as grade 3 risk for fall are used to alert medical staff. Second, information on fall prevention was distributed to patients. Third, standardization of two bed fences and reduced use of slippers for inpatients have been introduced. We investigated falls during hospitalization for 5 years from April 2012 to March 2017. The risk of fall was evaluated as grade 1 (mild) to grade 3 (severe) using an assessment sheet developed by the working group. The incidence of fall decreased over time, with a significant decrease from 2.1% in 2012 to 1.3% in 2016 (p<0.01).

This article focuses on the association of heat with both adverse pregnancy and newborn health outcomes. Regarding pregnancy, studies link heat and preterm birth, low birth weight and stillbirth. Multiple potential mechanisms support the biological plausibility of these associations. Emerging evidence suggests that heat, via epigenetics, may affect maternal health far beyond pregnancy. For newborn health impacts, heat is associated with increased hospitalization, neurologic and gastrointestinal dysfunction, and infant death. Research gaps include the need to study neonates separately from children and determining the mechanisms linking heat to adverse outcomes.

865,865,30015751,"The artificial intelligence and image processing technology can develop automatic diagnostic algorithm for pediatric otitis media (OM) with accuracy comparable to that from well-trained otologists. OM is a public health issue that occurs commonly in pediatric population. Caring for OM may incur significant indirect cost that stems mainly from loss of school or working days seeking for medical consultation. It makes great sense for the homecare of OM. In this study, we aim to develop an automatic diagnostic algorithm for pediatric OM. A total of 1,230 otoscopic images were collected. Among them, 214 images diagnosed of acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME) are used as the database for image classification in this study. For the OM image classification system, the image database is randomly partitioned into the test and train subsets. Of each image in the train and test sets, the desired eardrum image region is first segmented, then multiple image features such as color, and shape are extracted. The multitask joint sparse representation-based classification to combine different features of the OM image is used for classification. The multitask joint sparse representation algorithm was applied for the classification of the AOM and OME images. The approach is able to differentiate the OME from AOM images and achieves the classification accuracy as high as 91.41%. Our results demonstrated that this automatic diagnosis algorithm has acceptable accuracy to diagnose pediatric OM. The cost-effective algorithm can assist parents for early detection and continuous monitoring at home to decrease consequence of the disease.

To evaluate these, data were collected from 365 RP patients including age, gender, visual acuity (VA), spherical equivalent (SE) of refractive errors, funduscopic findings, color vision test, visual field score (VFS) obtained from Goldmann perimetry, and the inheritance patterns from pedigrees. Simplex RP was the most common inheritance pattern (61.9%); followed by autosomal recessive RP (17.3%), autosomal dominant RP (12.1%) and X-linked recessive RP (8.8%). Myopia was the most common refractive errors (77.5%) including 16.1% of high myopia. The most common cataract type was posterior subcapsular cataract (25.8%). Observed retinal findings included changes of retinal pigment epithelium (88.8%), bony spicule-like pigmentation (79.7%), attenuation of retinal vessel (76.2%), waxy disc pallor (12.6%), golden ring around optic disc (2.2%), epiretinal membrane (0.8%) and cystoid macular edema (0.5%).

867,867,30273499,"Marketing unhealthy foods and beverages to children (M2K) fosters poor dietary patterns, increasing obesity and noncommunicable disease risk. Federal restrictions on M2K have been under development in Canada since 2016; however, at present, M2K is mostly self-regulated by food companies. This study aimed to compare M2K on Canadian websites of food companies with and without voluntary policies or commitments in this area. A systematic content analysis of company websites was conducted in spring/summer 2017 for major packaged food (n = 16), beverage (n = 12), and restaurant chain (n = 13) companies in Canada. M2K policies were sourced from company websites and published corporate documents. Sixteen companies (43%) reported national and/or global M2K policies, while 21 companies (57%) had no published policies. The websites of Canadian companies (n = 154) were scanned for child-directed products and marketing; type and frequency of marketing techniques were recorded. Child-directed marketing appeared on 19 websites of 12 companies (32%), including 9 companies with M2K policies. Websites featured products with unconventional flavours, colours, shapes, or child-oriented packaging, and used promotional characters, contests, games, activities, or lettering and graphics appealing to children. The nutritional quality of products marketed to children was evaluated using a nutrient profile model developed by Health Canada for proposed M2K regulations. Of the 217 products marketed to children, 97% exceeded Health Canada's proposed ∼5% Daily Value threshold for saturated fat, sodium, and/or sugars, 73% of which were products from 9 companies with policies. These findings highlight the limitations of self-regulation in restricting M2K on food company websites, reinforcing the need for government regulations.

871,871,24043246,"The aim of this study was to assess both burn prevention knowledge and the effectiveness of educational intervention in alleviating the current knowledge deficit in Zambian youth. In one rural Zambian district, a burn prevention program was implemented in June 2011. Children at two elementary schools completed a 10-question survey that aimed to assess knowledge regarding burn injuries. After completing the survey, children received a burn and fire safety presentation and a burn prevention coloring book. Children were reassessed in May 2012 using the same survey to determine program efficacy and knowledge retention. Burn knowledge assessments were also completed for children at other schools who did not receive the burn prevention program in 2011. Logistic regression analysis was used for statistical adjustment for confounding variables. Between June 2011 and May 2012, 2747 children from six schools were assessed for their burn knowledge, with 312 of them resurveyed after educational intervention since initial survey. Reassessed children performed significantly better on three questions after controlling for confounders. They did better on five questions but their performance on these failed to achieve statistical significance. Children performed significantly worse on one concept about first aid treatment of a burn. A majority of the children demonstrated knowledge deficit in three concepts, even after educational intervention. There is a large variation in first burn knowledge survey performance of children from different schools, with inconsistency between concepts. With half the questions, knowledge deficit did not improve with advancement in school grade. Low- and moderate-income countries (LMICs) face the largest burns burden. With the lack of adequate burn care facing LMICs, burn injury prevention is of particular importance in those countries. This study shows that burn educational intervention could be effective in reducing burn knowledge deficit; however, the residual deficit posteducation could still be large and potentially contributing to heightened burn injury incidence. Customized and integrated educational programs may be proposed regarding the epidemiological profile of burn knowledge deficit from various schools. This study represents one of the few reports on the effectiveness of a burn prevention program in an LMIC. Future epidemiological data will be needed from nearby healthcare facilities to determine whether this program decreased burn morbidity and mortality at the hospital level.

Two radiologists reviewed ultrasound images of 74 tissue-proven thyroid nodules in 62 children. Points were given for individual features and then added to determine the ACR TI-RADS category, ranging from 1 (benign) to 5 (high suspicion). Kappa coefficients were generated to assess intra- and interobserver agreement. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the odds of malignancy with construction of a supplementary ROC curve. Fifty-four nodules were benign and 20 were malignant, with a median ACR TI-RADS category of 4 (interquartile range, 4-5). Nineteen of 20 (95.0%) malignant nodules were rated as TI-RADS category 4 or 5. There was substantial intraobserver agreement (κ = 0.69-0.77; p < 0.001) and moderate interobserver agreement (κ = 0.37; p = 0.002) for TIRADS category.

880,880,16613800,"Emmy Gut was a psychotherapist who developed, in her later years, a unique theory distinguishing between ""productive"" and ""unproductive"" depression. Dr. John Bowlby was a leading psychoanalyst famous for his work on attachment theory. After the death of her second husband, Emmy contacted John because his work on mourning and grief spoke to her own depressed state. Although her views of the world and of her relationship with John were clearly coloured by bouts of depression, she was profoundly influenced by her personal, therapeutic, and intellectual involvement with him. Evidence of his influence is seen in the volumes of correspondence flowing between them beginning in 1971 and continuing until John's death in 1990. During that time, Emmy wrote more than 100-some very lengthy-letters to John.

The state's infant mortality rate (IMR) of 9.5 per 1,000 live births for 1995 decreased from 9.6 in 1994, but has essentially varied little over the past nine years and is currently higher than the nation's rate of 7.5. Neonatal mortality (zero to 27 days of life) in South Dakota decreased to 5.2 in 1995 from 5.5 in 1994 with the decline attributable to fewer deaths of newborns of color. Nonetheless, similar to 1994 this rate is higher than the provisional national 1995 rate of 4.8. Post neonatal mortality in the state increased in 1995 among both whites and infants of color. An examination of causes of infant deaths in South Dakota shows that the state's rates of infant deaths due to congenital anomalies and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) exceed those noted nationally. The US Public Health Service's ""Back to Sleep"" campaign, initiated in 1994, is described as a contributor to the recent declining national rate of SIDS and its acceptance is urged as a preventive measure to decrease tragic loss of new life in South Dakota.

We sought to identify predictors of disease progression in pediatric DCM. The Pediatric Heart Network evaluated chronic DCM patients with prospective echocardiographic and clinical data collection during an 18-month follow-up. Inclusion criteria were age <22 years and DCM disease duration >2 months. Patients requiring intravenous inotropic/mechanical support or listed status 1A/1B for transplant were excluded. Disease progression was defined as an increase in transplant listing status, hospitalization for heart failure, intravenous inotropes, mechanical support, or death. Predictors of disease progression were identified using Cox proportional hazards modeling and classification and regression tree analysis. Of the 127 patients, 28 (22%) had disease progression during the 18-month follow-up. Multivariable analysis identified older age at diagnosis (hazard ratio=1.14 per year; P<0.001), larger left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic M-mode dimension z-score (hazard ratio=1.49; P<0.001), and lower septal peak systolic tissue Doppler velocity z-score (hazard ratio=0.81; P=0.01) as independent predictors of disease progression. Classification and regression tree analysis stratified patients at risk of disease progression with 89% sensitivity and 94% specificity based on LV end-diastolic M-mode dimension z-score ≥7.7, LV ejection fraction <39%, LV inflow propagation velocity (color M-mode) z-score <-0.28, and age at diagnosis ≥8.5 months. In children with chronic stable DCM, a combination of diagnosis after late infancy and echocardiographic parameters of larger LV size and systolic and diastolic function predicted disease progression.

The outer table of the parietal bone can be split, usually at the level of the diploic interstice, with an osteotome. Inadvertently violating the inner table and the dura leads some surgeons to avoid using the outer table in the elderly. Sullivan and Smith measured the thickness of the outer tables, diploe, and inner table of 37 cadavers (average age, 59 years) and found each layer to be well preserved distinctly. However, they suggested that calvaria become brittle in patients older than 50 years of age. The current authors hypothesized that diploic composition is not changed, even in the elderly. The thickest part of the parietal bone of 49 Koreans and 30 whites were acquired, and undecalcified slides were made. Via light microscopy, using the National Institutes of Health image, the following measurements were made: the thickness of the parietal bone (PT), outer table (OT), diploe (DT), and inner table (IT); trabecular bone volume percent (TBV); trabecular thickness (TT); and trabecular separation (TS). There was no significant difference in the thickness of the OT, DT, and IT of the PT, TBV, TT, and TS among different ages. The PTs of women were thicker than men's. The PTs of whites were significantly thicker than Koreans'. This study disclosed that the DT is not different among varying age groups and is not sclerosed in the persons older than 80 years, and the OT of these individuals is not brittle. Thus, surgeons do not need to hesitate when taking the OT of the PT in older patients. However, the selection of the site is attentive to PT.

887,887,35773743,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) and blackwater fever (BWF) are related but distinct renal complications of acute febrile illness in East Africa. The pathogenesis and prognostic significance of BWF and AKI are not well understood. A prospective observational cohort study was conducted to evaluate the association between BWF and AKI in children hospitalized with an acute febrile illness. Secondary objectives were to examine the association of AKI and BWF with (i) host response biomarkers and (ii) mortality. AKI was defined using the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria and BWF was based on parental report of tea-colored urine. Host markers of immune and endothelial activation were quantified on admission plasma samples. The relationships between BWF and AKI and clinical and biologic factors were evaluated using multivariable regression. We evaluated BWF and AKI in 999 children with acute febrile illness (mean age 1.7 years (standard deviation 1.06), 55.7% male). At enrollment, 8.2% of children had a history of BWF, 49.5% had AKI, and 11.1% had severe AKI. A history of BWF was independently associated with 2.18-fold increased odds of AKI (95% CI 1.15 to 4.16). When examining host response, severe AKI was associated with increased immune and endothelial activation (increased CHI3L1, sTNFR1, sTREM-1, IL-8, Angpt-2, sFlt-1) while BWF was predominantly associated with endothelial activation (increased Angpt-2 and sFlt-1, decreased Angpt-1). The presence of severe AKI, not BWF, was associated with increased risk of in-hospital death (RR, 2.17 95% CI 1.01 to 4.64) adjusting for age, sex, and disease severity. BWF is associated with severe AKI in children hospitalized with a severe febrile illness.

AFM images of most of the younger subjects showed typical step-like topographic properties with clear scale edges. The AFM images of most of the older subjects revealed dilapidated structures, poorly demarcated scale edges and undulated surfaces.

While multiple modes of inheritance have been reported, autosomal dominant optic atrophy and mitochondrial inherited Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy are the most common forms. Optic atrophy type 1, caused by mutations in the OPA1 gene is believed to be the most common hereditary optic neuropathy, and most patients inherit a mutation from an affected parent. In this study we used whole-exome sequencing to investigate the genetic aetiology in a patient affected with isolated optic atrophy. Since the proband was the only affected individual in his extended family, and was a product of consanguineous marriage, homozygosity mapping followed by whole-exome sequencing were pursued. Exome results identified a novel de novo OPA1 mutation in the proband.

Detailed photographs and data of the cases in the 3D-printing group were presented. One patient underwent auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation using the left lobe graft, in which the abdominal cavity model was also printed to test whether the planned graft fit the recipient's abdominal cavity. The 3D-printed models facilitated surgical planning and procedures, particularly in the management of hepatic veins and in the prevention of large-for-size syndrome. The operative time of donors in the 3D-printing group was significantly shorter compared with the control group (2.3 ± 0.4 versus 3.0 ± 0.4 hours; P < 0.001).

Developing these new agents and making them accessible to patients requires global clinical studies and regulatory review and approval by different national regulatory agencies. Whereas these global trials present challenges for drug developers who conduct them and regulatory agencies who oversee them, they also raise practical issues about patients with low-frequency cancers who need these therapies. A lack of uniform standards in both regulatory approval for marketing and reimbursement for approved agents across countries may make the newly developed agent either unavailable or inaccessible to patients in certain countries or regions, even if patients from those countries or regions participated in the clinical research that established the safety and efficacy of the agent. In an effort to further understand and address this need, we convened an international workshop in 2017 in North Bethesda, MD.

Interestingly CD25 expression upon anti-CD3 mAb stimulation was recovered after complete remission had been achieved. These observations suggest the presence in ALL children at onset of an in vitro defect in the signal transduction pathway of the T-cell-receptor/CD3 complex, resulting in inefficient CD25 expression. However, immune-staining analysis indicated that protein kinase C was normally translocated from the cytosol fraction to the cell membrane fraction.

Color-encoded images were obtained in 194 normal subjects (95 males, 99 females, age 2 mo to 79 yr) in four standard views. Quantitative indexes of magnitude and timing of systolic and diastolic function were studied for age- and gender-related differences. Normal limits of all ejection and filling indexes were in a narrow range (< or =25% of the mean), with no major gender-related differences. Despite invariable ejection fractions, both peak filling and ejection rates decreased with age (30 and 20%, correspondingly) with a concomitant increase in mean filling and ejection times, resulting in five- and twofold increases in the late to early filling and ejection ratios, correspondingly. Diastolic asynchrony increased with age (from 4.7 +/- 2.0 to 6.4 +/- 3.2 from the 2nd to 7th decade).

903,903,21073484,"Classical eyeblink conditioning (EBC) involves contingent temporal pairing of a conditioned stimulus (e.g., tone) with an unconditioned stimulus (e.g., air puff). Impairment of EBC has been demonstrated in studies of alcohol-exposed animals and in children exposed prenatally at heavy levels. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was diagnosed by expert dysmorphologists in a large sample of Cape Coloured, South African children. Delay EBC was examined in a new sample of 63 children at 11.3 years, and trace conditioning in 32 of the same children at 12.8 years. At each age, 2 sessions of 50 trials each were administered on the same day; 2 more sessions the next day, for children not meeting criterion for conditioning. Six of 34 (17.6%) children born to heavy drinkers were diagnosed with FAS, 28 were heavily exposed nonsyndromal (HE), and 29 were nonexposed controls. Only 33.3% with FAS and 42.9% of HE met criterion for delay conditioning, compared with 79.3% of controls. The more difficult trace conditioning task was also highly sensitive to fetal alcohol exposure. Only 16.7% of the FAS and 21.4% of HE met criterion for trace conditioning, compared with 66.7% of controls. The magnitude of the effect of diagnostic group on trace conditioning was not greater than the effect on short delay conditioning, findings consistent with recent rat studies. Longer latency to onset and peak eyeblink CR in exposed children indicated poor timing and failure to blink in anticipation of the puff. Extended training resulted in some but not all of the children reaching criterion. These data showing alcohol-related delay and trace conditioning deficits extend our earlier findings of impaired EBC in 5-year-olds to school-age. Alcohol-related impairment in the cerebellar circuitry required for both forms of conditioning may be sufficient to account for the deficit in both tasks. Extended training was beneficial for some exposed children. EBC provides a well-characterized model system for assessment of degree of cerebellar-related learning and memory dysfunction in fetal alcohol exposed children.

Because variable-frequency ultrasound with color Doppler provides details of skin morphology and function, it may help in the categorization of morphea. We sought to evaluate color Doppler ultrasound as a probing tool for assessing activity in morphea lesions. Consecutive patients with cutaneous morphea referred by dermatologists were studied with color Doppler ultrasound, and the assessment of lesion activity was compared with histologic findings. Normal skin controls were obtained by performing ultrasound scans of healthy subjects or of unaffected areas of the patients themselves. Measurements included cutaneous layer thickness, relative echogenicity, and blood flow with peak systolic velocity. Ultrasound sensitivity and specificity were determined for each phase of morphea activity and the results correlated with histology. Fifty-one patients had a total of 104 morphea lesions. Of the lesions, 20% were active, 22% were atrophic, and 58% were inactive. Five of the patients had the Parry-Romberg syndrome with ipsilateral parotid gland inflammatory involvement, and one had an asymptomatic but sonographically active morphea lesion. Sensitivity and specificity for ultrasound diagnosis were 100% and 98.8%, respectively. The most accurate sonographic signs of lesion activity were increased subcutaneous tissue echogenicity and increased cutaneous blood flow (sensitivity and specificity 100% and 100% for each one). Ultrasound cannot define lesions less than 0.1-mm deep.

To describe and report a ""lateral"" (lateral to medial) approach for US-guided intraarticular hip injection. Cadaveric investigation. Academic institution, department of anatomy. One cadaveric specimen. Both hips of a single cadaver were injected using the US-guided lateral approach. In the left hip, the needle was inserted and kept in situ. The right hip was injected with white-colored water-diluted latex dye. Subsequently, a layer-by-layer anatomical dissection was performed. Presence and distribution of latex dye and location of needle tip within the joint capsule of the hip. Anatomical dissection of the left and right hips confirmed the correct intraarticular position of the needle tip and the placement of the latex dye, respectively. During layer-by-layer dissection of the left hip, positions of the lateral cutaneous nerve and the lateral circumflex femoral artery were observed anterior to the needle, 30 mm for the nerve and 8 mm for the artery. This preliminary study demonstrated that the US-guided lateral approach is a convenient technique to access the hip joint in a cadaveric specimen. Compared with the ""classical"" anterior technique, the lateral approach may provide several advantages, including improved needle visibility, theoretically decreased risk of vascular injury, and less risk of needle contamination. Because injury to the lateral epiphyseal arteries is possible when lateral approach is used, caution is required, especially in children.

Twenty-one children, ages 2-16 years, were investigated for VUR using voiding cystourethrography (VCU) and CFDS. Forty-two ureterovesical junctions were studied and a total of 27 were found to be refluxing at VCU. Five of these 21 patients were operated for VUR and they were also reevaluated 3 and 6 months after the operation. With good diuresis ureteric jets could easily be detected with CFDS and if there was a reflux of urine into the ureter this could also be displayed. Afterwards, the patient was asked to urinate and if reflux into the ureter was detected, particular attention was paid to the detection of ureteral and pelvicalyceal dilatation by conventional gray-scale sonography. Taking VCU as the gold standard, CFDS revealed reflux in all cases except 1. There were 3 patients who had only one-sided reflux at VCU and bilateral reflux at CFDS examination (false-positive: 20%). Correlation of CFDS and VCU was 90, 100 and 75% in low grade, grade III and grade IV reflux, respectively. The results of CFDS correlated well with the results of VCU during the follow-up of 5 patients who had antireflux operations. As a conclusion, CFDS could be used as an adjunct to standard ultrasonography for detection of VUR.

To contribute to the long term outcomes of ASD device closure with the STARFlex device. Results of a prospective FDA approved clinical trial (1999-2001) from a single institution of the STARFlex device for simple ASD was reviewed. The inclusion criteria included age >or=2 years, isolated secundum ASD, evidence of right ventricular volume overload, and maximum stretched diameter <22 mm. A retrospective review of the original study data with most recent follow-up was performed. Clinical success in the trial was defined as complete closure or residual leak <or=2 mm, absence of a severe complication and no need for an additional device or surgery to treat the ASD. Twenty seven (27) patients were prospectively enrolled in the study period with a procedural success in 23 (85%). There were two severe complications, both 40 mm device embolizations that underwent semiurgent surgical intervention for device removal and ASD closure (40 mm device subsequently withdrawn from trial). Device placement was unsuccessful in two patients due to malposition related to an insufficient retro-aortic rim, with elective surgical closure. Unsuccessful procedural outcomes were statistically associated with deficient rims (P < 0.01). Of the 23 long term follow-up device patients, 23 (100%) achieved clinical success: 22 (96%) had complete closure at 1 year and latest echocardiographic follow-up and one case had a small <2 mm residual defect that has persisted. There have been no late complications with normalization of RV volumes in 92% and no deleterious ECG changes. Device fractures occurred in 8/23 (35%) devices and were more common in the larger devices (P < 0.05) but had no sequelae. None required any further intervention to treat the ASD and there were no infectious or thrombotic issues. In this cohort the STARFlex device for secundum ASD closure provided procedural success in 85% with failures due to surgical referral.

The development of dentition can also be affected by a number of systemic factors and metabolic diseases such as porphyria. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), also known as Gunther's disease, is a metabolic disease caused by a transformation in the gene that codifies uroporphyrinogen-3 synthesis, leading to porphyrin aggregation in urine, skin, bone, and dentin. A 21-month-old girl with erythrodontia was referred to Paediatric Dentistry Department in September 2017. A physical examination revealed blisters on her face, nose, hands, and feet. Laboratory findings showed highly elevated urine total uroporphyrin and total coproporphyrin I and III levels. Next-generation sequencing multigene panel testing for porphyria demonstrated a homozygous c.10C>T (p.L4F) mutation in the UROS gene.

This narrative review shows the profound impact that environmental racism poses to healthy child development through 3 examples. Historical redlining provides compelling evidence of how historical policies continue to influence neighborhoods' physical and social conditions. Exploring chemicals in beauty products reveals how anti-Black perceptions of beauty work to expose children of color to endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Finally, by exploring childhood lead exposure, we see how decades of inequitable implementation of lead exposure prevention policies contribute to persistent disparities in the United States today.

We aimed at comparing the diagnostic efficacy of multicolor flow cytometry (MFC) and morphology/immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the detection of disseminated tumor cells in the bone marrow (BM) and body fluids of patients with solid tumors, and in pediatric neuroblastoma cases. We investigated 72 samples retrospecively from 50 patients by MFC. Morphology/IHC data were available in 48 cases. In the first cohort, 36 samples derived from 34 patients with various forms of suspected and proven solid tumors and in the second cohort, 36 samples of 16 children with suspected and proven neuroblastoma were analyzed at diagnosis or during follow-up in a 4-color setting by MFC, and the results were compared with those obtained by IHC. In the group of various solid tumors, we found 91% concordance between IHC and MFC, and it was 65% in the neuroblastoma group, and 77% overall. Detection of disseminated tumor cells was found to be more effective by MFC in de novo neuroblastoma samples (100% vs. 86%). The advantage of MFC was even more pronounced when minimal residual disease was evaluated (efficacy, 92% vs. 68%). In contrast, efficacy of IHC was 100% in the group of various solid tumors, whereas it was 91% for MFC. We conclude that MFC and IHC are both essential tools for examining infiltration of BM and body fluids by disseminating solid tumor cells. In the case of neuroblastoma, however, minimal residual disease detection by MFC in a hypoplastic/aplastic BM environment was more effective than IHC, as considerably more cells could be analyzed.

However, the histogenesis of IFS is still controversial. In a series of 122 chordomas, special emphasis was placed on the morphology of host tissues involved in IFS and on a transition between IFS and neighboring tissues. In 23 lesions, IFS was also characterized both histochemically and immunohistochemically. IFS was observed in 79 (64.8%) lesions. Occasionally, IFS contained bone fragments and hyalinized matrix with no lining of osteoblastic cells, suggesting degenerated rather than metaplastic bone tissue. Moreover, IFS occasionally showed a direct transition to host bone trabeculae. Histochemically and immunohistochemically, IFS included calcium deposits positive for Alizarin red S staining and expressed both type I and type III collagen. In extraosseous lesions extending to the adjacent soft tissues, IFS frequently involved muscle fibers or peripheral nerve fibers and displayed a smooth transition to neighboring soft tissues.

The Prevalance of RP patients in this island was estimated to be one in 473 persons. Among the RP patients observed, familial cases whose disorders are transmitted through successive generations comprised 25.7%. Although it seems that the inheritance mode of RP in these familial cases is autosomal dominant, an autosomal recessive fashion showing quasi-dominance cannot be ruled out, because inbreeding frequently occurs on this island. There were at least two types of RP, one with late onset (40 years of age or later) and the other with early onset, and patients with the latter RP tended to have a poor prognosis. Only a few RP patients had posterior subcapsular cataract, and none had pseudexfoliation in spite of advanced age. Color vision anomalies were found in 3.86% of high-school boys and in 0.41% of girls in this island, and they included protanopia (4.2%), protanomaly (10.4%), deuteranopia (37.5%), and deuteranomaly (47.9%). The prevalence in boys was comparable to that in the general Japanese population, but the prevalence in girls was higher in Kamigoto than in other districts.

942,942,26715637,"To explore the surgical strategy for postburn cervical scar contracture. Sixty-five patients with scar contracture as a result of burn injury in the neck were hospitalized from July 2013 to July 2014. Release of cervical scar contracture was conducted according to different demands of the 3 anatomic subunits of neck, i.e. lower lip vermilion border-supramaxillary region, submaxillary region, and anterior region of neck. After release of contracture, platysma was released. For some cases with chin retrusion, genioplasty with horizontal osteotomy was performed. The coverage of wound followed the principle of similarity, i.e. the skin tissue covering the wound in the neck should be similar to the characters of skin around the wound in terms of color, texture, and thickness. Based on this principle, except for the preschool children in whom skin grafting was performed, the wounds of the other patients were covered by local skin flaps, adjacent skin flaps, or free skin flaps. All patients underwent release of scar and platysma, while 9 patients underwent genioplasty with horizontal osteotomy. Wounds were covered with local skin flaps in 32 patients, with adjacent skin flaps in 7 patients, with free skin flaps in 11 patients, and with skin grafts in 15 patients. All skin grafts and flaps survived. Good range of motion was achieved in the neck of all patients, with the cervicomental angle after reconstruction ranging from 90 to 120°. All patients were followed up for 6 to 24 months. Six patients who had undergone skin grafting were found to have some degrees of skin contracture, while none of the patients who had undergone flap coverage showed any signs of contracture recurrence. Restoration of the cervicomental angle is critical in the treatment of postburn cervical scar contracture, and the release of scar contracture should conform to the subunit principle. The coverage of wound should be based on the principle of similarity, with repair by skin flaps as the first choice, and skin grafting as the second choice. Satisfactory effect of repair would be achieved by following the above surgical principles.

From August 2011 to June 2015, the SCIP flap was used in 80 patients for soft tissue defects at our institution. We utilized vessel imaging navigation to get a detailed overview of the vascular anatomy preoperatively. Flaps were designed on the basis of either the proximal or distal perforators of the SCIA. Backup strategies and surgical maneuvers were suggested to solve the problems that emerged during surgery. In total, 51 flaps were raised on the basis of the proximal perforators of the superficial branch of the SCIA, whereas 25 cases were based on the distal perforators from the deep branch, and in four cases, the pedicle was switched to the superficial inferior epigastric artery. In eight cases, the arterial pedicle lengthen technique was applied with a maximum length of 10 cm. All donor sites were closed directly with inconspicuous scars. These surgical strategies simplified the intraoperative decision-making and overcame the shortcomings of the SCIP flap.

945,945,12838126,"Finger amputation with bone exposure when replantation is not feasible requires a procedure for closure and padding of the stump. To preserve the length and provide adequate coverage, various flaps are used. A situation may occur in which local flaps are not sufficient and distant flaps are preferred. However, distant flaps often require a two-stage procedure, prolonged immobilization, and skin grafts. Thus, a simpler approach for fingertip or stump reconstruction while maintaining the padding effect of a flap was designed. The composite of glabrous skin and subcutaneous fat provided such padding, was performed in a single stage, and the donor site morbidity was negligible. During a 5-year period from 1996 to September 2002, 15 cases of finger stumps were reconstructed using the hypothenar composite graft. The age of the patients ranged from 1 to 63 years (average, 30 years). The average follow-up was 35 months. The donor sites were closed primarily and there were no marked complications related to this site. The graft showed relatively good contour and color match to the adjacent field, with an average two-point discrimination of 5.7 mm, indicating satisfactory reinnervation.

Both GCS and SWC were significantly correlated with the prognosis. However, there was substantial overlap in GCS between FP-group and PP-group. Although the absence of SWC was statistically an independent risk factor for poor prognosis but with a high false positive rate (0.143), a linear logistic regression showed the odds ratio of GCS for predicting prognosis was 0.93 (95% confidence interval: 0.48-1.80; P = .83) and that of SWC was 0.12 (95% confidence interval: 0.03-0.47; P = .03).

953,953,22652846,"To evaluate the predictive value of the seventh edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for conjunctival melanoma. Retrospective, observational case series of 42 eyes of 42 patients with conjunctival melanoma studied by reviewing medical records, pathology reports, and color photographs. The main evaluated outcomes were demographic information, laterality, tumor size, thickness, pathologic diagnosis, seventh edition AJCC stage (clinical and pathologic), recurrence, metastasis, and duration of follow-up. There was no sex preference, and the median age was 61 years. Recurrent disease was noted in 33% of patients (n = 14 of 42), with 64% occurring at a median of 2.5 years (range, 1-5 years) after primary treatment. Metastasis was noted in 19% of patients. The significant predictive factors for high risk of tumor recurrence were tumors involving more than 1 quadrant (P = .02), tumors thicker than 0.5 mm (P = .04), and tumor multifocality (P = .04). The significant predictive factors for high risk of tumor metastasis were tumors thicker than 0.5 mm (P = .005), tumor invasiveness (P = .04), pathologic diagnosis of conjunctival melanoma rather than melanoma in situ (P = .04), and tumor recurrence (P < .001). Similarly, increasing AJCC T stages (clinical and pathologic) were associated with unfavorable outcomes. For example, clinical stage-related recurrence rates were 19% (Tis), 27% (T1), 33% (T2), and 75% (T3). Clinical stage-related lymphatic and distant metastasis rates were 0% (Tis), 20% (T1), 0% (T2), and 63% (T3). Advanced AJCC T-stage (clinical and pathologic) tumors were at higher risk for recurrence and metastasis. In this study, the seventh edition AJCC staging system was predictive of local control and systemic spread of conjunctival melanoma.

954,954,2789910,Instantaneous cross sectional flow velocity profiles from early mitral flow in 10 healthy men were constructed by time interpolation of the velocity data from each point in sequentially delayed two dimensional digital Doppler ultrasound maps. This interpolation allows correction of the artificially produced skewness of velocities across the flow sector caused by the time taken to scan the flow sector for velocity recording of pulsatile blood flow. These results suggested that early mitral flow studied in an apical four chamber view is variably skewed both at the leaflet tips and at the annulus. The maximum flow velocity overestimated the cross sectional mean velocity at the same time by a factor of 1.2-2.2. Also the maximum time velocity integral overestimated the cross sectional mean time velocity integral to the same extent. This cross sectional skew must be taken into account when calculation of blood flow is based on recordings with pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound from a single sample volume. ,1954,Cross sectional early mitral flow velocity profiles from colour Doppler,"Samstad SO, Torp HG, Linker DT, Rossvoll O, Skjaerpe T, Johansen E, Kristoffersen K, Angelsen BA, Hatle L.",Br Heart J. 1989 Sep;62(3):177-84. doi: 10.1136/hrt.62.3.177.,Samstad SO,Br Heart J,1989,1989/09/01,PMC1216759,,10.1136/hrt.62.3.177

This was a prospective study of pediatric emergency department (ED) patients with suspected clavicle fractures conducted in a tertiary-care, freestanding pediatric hospital. A convenience sample of patients younger than 17 years underwent bedside US for detection of clavicle fracture by pediatric emergency physicians with limited US training. Ultrasound findings were compared with standard radiographs, which were considered the criterion standard. Pain scores using the validated color analog scale (0-10) were determined before and during US. Total length of stay in the ED, time to US, and time to radiograph were recorded. Fifty-eight patients were enrolled, of which 39 (67%) had fracture determined by radiograph. Ultrasound interpretation gave a sensitivity of 89.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 75.8%-97.1%) and specificity of 89.5% (95% CI, 66.9%-98.7%).

Non-adherence was assessed through a questionnaire and reviews of the Mulago Hospital TB register. Urine was obtained from 236 patients (127 adults and 109 children) on daily chemotherapy. Using commercial test strips as standard, the sensitivity of in-house urine dipsticks was 99.5% and specificity was 96.4%. The sensitivity and the specificity of n-butanol and of coloration of urine to detect rifampicin were low (64.0% and 54.9%, and 85.5% and 64.8%, respectively).

959,959,25632029,"In pediatric echocardiography, pulse wave Doppler, and tissue Doppler imaging velocities are widely used to assess cardiac function. Current reference values and Z scores, allowing adjustment for growth are limited by inconsistent methodologies and small sample size. Using a standardized approach for parametric modeling and Z score quality assessment, we propose new pediatric reference values and Z score equations for most left ventricular pulse wave Doppler and tissue Doppler imaging measurements. Two hundred thirty-three healthy pediatric subjects 1 to 18 years of age were prospectively recruited. Thirteen pulse wave Doppler and 14 tissue Doppler imaging measurements were recorded. Normalization for growth was done via a complete and standardized approach for parametric nonlinear regression modeling. Several analyses were performed to ensure adequate Z score distribution and to detect potential residual associations with growth or residual heteroscedasticity. Most measurements adopted a nonlinear relationship with growth and displayed significant heteroscedasticity. Compared with age, height, and weight, normalization for body surface area was most efficient in removing the effect of growth. Generally, polynomial and allometric models yielded adequate goodness-of-fit. Residual values for several measurements had significant departure from the normal distribution, which could be corrected using logarithmic or reciprocal transformation. Overall, weighted parametric nonlinear models allowed us to compute Z score equations with adequate normal distribution and without residual association with growth. We present Z scores for normalized pulse wave Doppler and tissue Doppler imaging in pediatric echocardiography. Further studies are needed to define the threshold beyond which health becomes a disease by integrating other important factors such as ventricular morphology, loading conditions, and heart rate.

Comparative case series. Ultrahigh-resolution OCT (Copernicus; OPTOPOL Technology S.A., Zawiercie, Poland; 3-μm axial resolution) was used to obtain scans from 13 patients (26 eyes) with achromatopsia and from 20 controls (40 eyes). A 3-dimensional scan program (743×75; A×B scan) sampling a 7×7-mm retinal area centered at the fovea was used to obtain tomograms of the fovea. Individual B-scans at the fovea were exported and analyzed using ImageJ (Wayne Rasband, National Institute of Health) for reflectance profiles and morphologic abnormalities. Gross morphologic changes in OCT were characterized. Specifically, inner segment and outer segment (IS/OS) junction and cone outer segment tip (COST) disruption was noted. Using the reflectance profiles, foveal depth, thickness of the outer nuclear layer (ONL), and retinal thickness (RT) were measured. A characteristic so-called punched out hyporeflective zone (HRZ) was noted in 7 of 13 patients; this was age-dependent (P = 0.001). The area of the HRZ was asymmetric with the nasal area being significantly greater than the temporal area (P = 0.002). In all patients, there was disruption of the IS/OS junction at the foveal or parafoveal regions, or both. Five of 13 patients also had a disrupted COST reflectivity. There was significant (P = 1.1×10(-6)) ONL thinning in the achromats compared with controls, which was age-dependent (P = 0.0002). Foveal maldevelopment was seen in 9 of 13 patients. The achromats also had a significantly reduced foveal depth (P = 7.7×10(-6)) and RT (P = 1.46×10(-9)) compared with controls. A range of signs in achromatopsia are described that can be detected using UHR OCT. The IS/OS junction and COST reflectivity disruption and presence of HRZ and ONL thinning are signs of cone photoreceptor degeneration. The latter 2 are age-dependent, which suggests that achromatopsia is a progressive disorder. In addition, foveal maldevelopment is described; this represents a fetal developmental defect linked to cone photoreceptor degeneration.

Twenty participants (10 control adults, 10 parents of affected children) assessed 40 colored images of children's faces while their eye movements were tracked. Twenty-four control images and 16 repaired cleft lip images were displayed to observers. Nine bilateral facial aesthetic zones were considered as regions of interest. Percentage of time visually fixating within each region, and statistical differences in fixation duration percentage between the two participant groups and across the bilateral regions of interest were analyzed.

972,972,36308243,"Evaluation of circumcision bleeding cannot depend on the visual change in the diaper. Diapers have different product features and absorbency capacities. The apparent changes in the diapers may vary according to their absorbent capacity and may not be in parallel with the amount of bleeding. Before significant visual difference occurs, the patient's hemodynamics may be impaired. Aim of the study is to evaluate better circumcision bleeding. Patients were divided into groups according to 12 different brand diapers of the same size, containing super-absorbent material. The study started by 15/01/2022, and finished by end of 01/03/2022. Diapers with concealed brands were soaked with blood with equal hematocrit value in 100 ml with increments of 5 ml. 252 images were obtained by taking 21 images of each diaper with the same method. The diapers were evaluated colorimetrically, and numerical values were obtained showing the color differences in red, green, and blue and saturation and lightness. Working groups were formed according to 12 different brands of diapers of the same size, containing super-absorbent material. Standard statistical tests were performed using obtained values. : Dry diapers had different weights, volumes, and specific gravities; the diapers with the lowest unit weight were ranked ninth in terms of volume; the diapers with the highest specific gravity were ranked third in terms of thinness. There were significant differences in the blood on the diaper, and significant differences between some groups (p < 0.005); on the other hand, there was not any difference between some other groups (p > 0.05). There was a significant relationship in terms of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). Visual graphic examination showed that linear but non-parallel color changes occurred. As the blood load increased, the visual and statistical differences between the diapers became more pronounced, and the curves diverged. Visual evaluation of the color change of the diapers may not give accurate results for bleeding follow-up. If necessary to use diapers after circumcision, it is more appropriate to prefer those with low absorbency capacity. Using fabric or cotton products in cases with bleeding risk may be recommended. If bleeding is suspected, hemogram control is the most appropriate option. Diaper manufacturers should warn consumers of the risk. In conclusion, we should be on the safe side for mortality and morbidity.

Considering the physiological and psychological consequences that could result from these procedures, management of pain and distress through pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods is essential. Therefore, it is important to have interventions that are rapid, easy-to-use and likely to be translated into clinical practice for routine use. The aim of this study will be to determine whether a device combining cold and vibration (Buzzy) is non-inferior to a topical anaesthetic (liposomal lidocaine 4% cream) for pain management of children undergoing needle-related procedures in the emergency department. This study will be a randomised controlled non-inferiority trial comparing the Buzzy device to liposomal lidocaine 4% cream for needle-related pain management. A total of 346 participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two study groups. The primary outcome will be the mean difference in pain intensity between groups during needle-related procedures. A non-inferiority margin of 0.70 on the Color Analogue Scale will be considered. A Non-inferiority margin of 0.70 on the Color Analogue Scale will be considered. The secondary outcomes will be the level of distress during the procedure, the success of the procedure at first attempt, the occurrence of adverse events, the satisfaction of both interventions and the memory of pain 24 hours after the procedure. The primary outcome will be assessed for non-inferiority and the secondary outcomes for superiority.

Outcomes of interest were median and maximum cell event count (MEDCC, MAXCC) per B-scan from each eye and the total cell event count (TCC) per volume scan. At least one cell event was detected in volume scans of 76% of eyes (329/434) and 87% of children (189/217). The maximum number (MAXCC) per scan ranged from 0 to 6 (median, 2).

Echocardiography was performed at baseline and 1-year follow-up, and all baseline measurements were repeated during a passive leg-lifting maneuver with legs elevated to approximately 45° from the horizontal position. TMSP of the posterior wall was evaluated from the mid-LV short-axis view. On the basis of our previous findings, TMSP with a notch was adopted as a predictor for evaluation of subclinical LV dysfunction in DMD patients whose LVEF remains preserved. At baseline, normal TMSP comprised 35 patients (37%), and the remaining 60 (63%) were classified as TMSP with a notch. Twenty-nine patients (48%) had developed LV wall motion abnormality at the 1-year follow-up, but this was observed only in the group of patients with TMSP with a notch at rest and also during passive leg-lifting. Furthermore, this group showed significantly more frequent development of LV wall motion abnormality at 1-year follow-up, with better sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for prediction of this abnormality than for other sub-groups. Most DMD patients suffer from progressive skeletal muscle weakness, so that combining TMSP with passive leg-lifting may make TMSP even more effective as a simple and non-invasive predictor of LV subclinical dysfunction.

There were statistically significant differences between lip forces in the following three groups: p=0.01 (LVP), p=0.01 (MVP), and p=0.008 (SVP). The cutoff values of lip forces in the study group were as follows: 7.08 N (LVP), 4.89 N (MVP), and 4.24 N (SVP). There were no statistically significant differences between the masticatory efficiency in the two groups (p=0.25). Lip forces were dependent on the degree of peripheral facial paralysis and age, but not on gender. In peripheral facial paralysis in children, a significant decrease of lip forces, but not masticatory efficiency, occurs.

Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted from 2019 to 2020 at a tertiary eye care center in Western Maharashtra, India. In this study, 152 cases of VKC were identified. The presence, type, color, and extent of PLP were recorded. The incidence of presence of PLP was calculated. Its correlations with severity and duration of VKC were analyzed using Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test and Chi square test. Of 152 cases, 79.61% were males. Mean age at presentation was 11.4 ± 5.6 years. The characteristic PLP was present in 81 cases (53.29%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 45.03%-61.42%; P < 0.001), of which 15 cases (18.5%) had this pigmentation in all the four quadrants.

990,990,19841399,"To better categorize the epidemiologic profile, clinical features, and disease associations of loose anagen hair syndrome (LAHS) compared with other forms of childhood alopecia. Retrospective survey. Academic pediatric dermatology practice. Patients Three hundred seventy-four patients with alopecia referred from July 1, 1997, to June 31, 2007. Epidemiologic data for all forms of alopecia were ascertained, such as sex, age at onset, age at the time of evaluation, and clinical diagnosis. Patients with LAHS were further studied by the recording of family history, disease associations, hair-pull test or biopsy results, hair color, laboratory test result abnormalities, initial treatment, and involvement of eyelashes, eyebrows, and nails. Approximately 10% of all children with alopecia had LAHS. The mean age (95% confidence interval) at onset differed between patients with LAHS (2.8 [1.2-4.3] years) vs patients without LAHS (7.1 [6.6-7.7] years) (P < .001), with 3 years being the most common age at onset for patients with LAHS. All but 1 of 37 patients with LAHS were female. The most common symptom reported was thin, sparse hair. Family histories were significant for LAHS (n = 1) and for alopecia areata (n = 3). In 32 of 33 patients, trichograms showed typical loose anagen hairs. Two children had underlying genetic syndromes. No associated laboratory test result abnormalities were noted among patients who underwent testing. Loose anagen hair syndrome is a common nonscarring alopecia in young girls with a history of sparse or fine hair. Before ordering extensive blood testing in young girls with diffusely thin hair, it is important to perform a hair-pull test, as a trichogram can be instrumental in the confirmation of a diagnosis of LAHS.

We therefore studied the associations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), androstenedione (A4), testosterone, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and adrenarche with cognition among prepubertal children. These cross-sectional analyses are based on baseline data of the Physical Activity and Nutrition in Children Study. A total of 387 children (183 girls, 204 boys) were included in the analyses. Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (CPM) score was used to assess nonverbal reasoning. Serum adrenal androgens and IGF-1 concentrations were measured and clinical signs of androgen action were evaluated. Higher IGF-1 among boys (β = 0.149, p =0.033) was related to a better Raven's CPM score after adjustment for age and parental education. Adrenal androgens in girls or boys or IGF-1 in girls were not associated with the score. There were no differences in Raven's CPM score between children with biochemical adrenarche (DHEAS ≥1.08 µmol/L; ≥40 µg/dL) or with clinical signs of androgen action and children without them. The results suggest that higher serum IGF-1 among boys is related to better cognition in prepubertal children.

Early diagnosis and surgical treatment are particularly important to decrease risk of mortality. The purpose of this study was to explore the echocardiographic characteristics and outcome of P-MAIVF and to evaluate the potential application of three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography in the evaluation of P-MAIVF. Clinical and echocardiographic characteristics were retrospectively evaluated in 9 patients with P-MAIVF, 5 of them assessed by 3D echocardiography. P-MAIVF was identified on echocardiography and located in the posterior aspect of the aortic root, expanding in systole and collapsing in diastole. Of the 9 cases examined, 8 were associated with endocarditis and 1 was caused by radio frequency catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation. Five cases were associated with bicuspid aortic valve, and rupture of P-MAIVF was identified in 3 patients. The morphology of P-MAIVF was clearly demonstrated on 3D echocardiography in 5 cases. In conclusion, echocardiography provides a useful tool in the diagnosis of P-MAIVF. Color Doppler flow imaging can ease identification of the ostium in cases of ruptured pseudoaneurysms.

994,994,20193776,"Idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (VT) in children with a structurally normal heart can cause significant morbidity, and although rare, mortality. Conventional activation and pace mapping may be limited by nonsustained tachycardia or unstable hemodynamics. The aim of this study was to assess feasibility of catheter ablation of idiopathic VT in the pediatric population guided by noncontact mapping. Twenty consecutive pediatric patients with idiopathic VT underwent electrophysiologic study with the intention to use the noncontact mapping system EnSite 3000 (EnSite Array, St. Jude Medical Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota). The multielectrode balloon array was introduced into the left or right ventricle, respectively, and tachycardia was analyzed using color-coded isopotential maps as well as reconstructed unipolar electrograms on the virtual geometry. The region of origin was identified in all of them, and the site of earliest activation with a QS pattern of the unipolar electrograms was guided for sites of ablation. Idiopathic VT originated from the right ventricular outflow tract in 6 patients, from the left ventricle in 8, and from the aortic sinus cusp in 6 in this cohort with a median age of 14.4 (range: 4.8 to 20.9) years. Ablation was attempted in 18 of 20 children, and was acutely successful in 17 of these 18 (94%). During a mean follow-up of 2.3 +/- 1.7 years, VT recurred in 3, 2 of them have been treated with a second procedure, resulting in an overall intermediate-term success in 16 of 18 (89%) children with idiopathic VT.

996,996,24924479,"It has been hypothesised that light skin pigmentation has arisen to ensure adequate levels of vitamin D as human populations moved out of Africa and into higher latitudes. Vitamin D, which is primarily obtained through exposure to sunlight (specifically ultraviolet radiation B (UVR-B)), has been inversely associated with several complex diseases. Greater sun exposure, on the other hand, is a well-known cause of skin cancer. The potential of UVR to be beneficial for some health outcomes but detrimental for others has prompted a public health debate on how to balance the positive and negative consequences of sun exposure. In this study we aimed to determine the validity of the evolutionary hypothesis linking lighter skin with higher vitamin D concentrations in a European population. Additionally, we aimed to examine the influence of pigmentation on personal behaviour towards sunlight exposure and the effects of this behaviour on vitamin D. We combined genetic variants strongly associated with skin colour, tanning or freckling to create genetic scores for each of these phenotypes. We examined the association of the scores with pigmentary traits, sun exposure and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels among children of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N = 661 to 5649). We found that fairer-skinned children, i.e. those with higher pigmentation score values, had higher levels of 25(OH)D (0.6 nmol/l; 95% CI 0.2, 1.0; per unit increase in skin colour score; N = 5649). These children also used more protection against the damaging effects of UVR. In this population taking protective measures against sunburn and skin cancer does not seem to remove the positive effect that having a less pigmented skin has on vitamin D production. Our findings require further replication as skin pigmentation showed only a small effect on circulating 25(OH)D.

In all cases, the cyst was situated behind (four cases) or lateral to (one case) the pancreas: behind or lateral to the pancreatic head in two cases, behind the pancreatic body in one case, and behind the pancreatic tail in two cases. Four cases showed a round mass (three cases) or multiple round mass (one case). Internal echoes were present in those cases and showed a ""pseudo-solid"" pattern. In those cases, M-mode US confirmed the movement of those internal echoes. In the remaining case, the lesion was imaged as an irregularly shaped multilocular mass. No case showed posterior echo enhancement, and no case showed lateral shadowing. No blood flow signals from the lesion were seen. Unlike ordinary cysts, RC usually is imaged as a round mass behind the pancreas, with dense internal echoes without lateral shadowing or posterior echo enhancement, which presents a ""pseudo-solid"" pattern.
