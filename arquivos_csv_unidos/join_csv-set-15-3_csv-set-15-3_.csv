1,1,10813588,"Insulin secretion rates are greater after oral glucose than after parenteral administration of an equivalent glucose load. This augmented beta-cell secretory response to an oral glucose load results from the release of mainly two gut hormones: gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1, which potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion. Because of their insulinotropic action, their abnormal secretion may be involved in the pathogenesis of the hyperinsulinemia of childhood obesity. In this study, we used the hyperglycemic clamp with a small oral glucose load to assess the effect of childhood obesity on GIP response in seven prepubertal lean and 11 prepubertal obese children and in 14 lean adolescents and 10 obese adolescents. Plasma glucose was acutely raised to 11 mM by infusing i.v. glucose and kept at this concentration for 180 min. Each subject ingested oral glucose (30 g) at 120 min, and the glucose infusion was adjusted to maintain the plasma glucose plateau. Basal insulin and C-peptide concentrations and insulin secretion rates (calculated by the deconvolution method) were significantly greater in obese children compared with lean children (p < 0.001). Similarly, during the first 120 min of the clamp, insulin secretion rates were higher in obese than lean children. After oral glucose, plasma insulin, C-peptide, and insulin secretion rates further increased in all four groups. This incretin effect was 2-fold greater in obese versus lean adolescents (p < 0.001). Circulating plasma GIP concentrations were similar at baseline in all four groups and remained unchanged during the first 120 min of the clamp. After oral glucose, plasma GIP concentrations rose sharply in all groups (p < 0.002). Of note, the rise in GIP was similar in both lean and obese children. In conclusion, under conditions of stable hyperglycemia, the ingestion of a small amount of glucose elicited equivalent GIP responses in both lean and obese children. However, despite similar GIP responses, insulin secretion was markedly augmented in obese adolescents. Thus, in juvenile obesity, excessive alimentary beta-cell stimulation may be independent of the increased release of GIP.

2,2,24007283,"Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) deficiency is an autosomal, recessively inherited disease that progresses with severe hypoglycemia, and metabolic attacks result in a defect in gluconeogenesis. If not appropriately treated, and if fructose is not excluded from the diet, the outcome could be fatal. Two Turkish children with FBPase deficiency were diagnosed based on mutation of the FBP1 gene. The first, a 2-year-old girl, was referred to our clinic because of lactic acidosis, uncorrectable hypoglycemia, and increased transaminases. FBPase deficiency was suspected in the patient, who recovered dramatically after a high-dose glucose infusion and adequate bicarbonate replacement. The second patient, a five-and-a-half-year-old male sibling of the patient, was also hospitalized, twice, because of hypoglycemic attacks and metabolic acidosis. Different from previous analyses, a homozygous c.658delT mutation was detected at exon 5 of the FBP1 gene in the two siblings. As a result of this mutation, there was a TGA (stop codon) at exon 6. There was first-degree consanguinity between the parents. These two cases were the first FBP1 gene mutations reported in our country.

3,3,38346564,"Childhood adversity is associated with poor cardiometabolic health in adulthood; little is known about how this relationship evolves through childbearing years for parous individuals. The goal was to estimate differences in cardiometabolic health indicators before, during and after childbearing years by report of childhood maltreatment in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort study. Including 743 individuals nulliparous at baseline (1985-1986) with one or more pregnancies >20 weeks during follow-up (1986-2022), we fit segmented linear regression models to estimate mean differences between individuals reporting or not reporting childhood maltreatment (physical or emotional) in waist circumference, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, and body mass index (BMI) prior to, during, and following childbearing years using generalized estimating equations, allowing for interaction between maltreatment and time within each segment, and adjusting for total parity, parental education, and race (Black or white, self-reported). Individuals reporting maltreatment (19%; 141) had a greater waist circumference (post-childbearing: +2.9 cm, 95% CI (0.7, 5.0), higher triglycerides [post-childbearing: +8.1 mg/dL, 95% CI (0.7, 15.6)], and lower HDL cholesterol [post-childbearing: -2.1 mg/dL, 95% CI (-4.7, 0.5)] during all stages compared to those not reporting maltreatment. There were not meaningful differences in blood pressure, fasting glucose, or BMI. Individuals who reported maltreatment did not report faster changes over time. Differences in some aspects of cardiometabolic health between individuals reporting versus not reporting childhood maltreatment were sustained across reproductive life stages, suggesting potentially persistent impacts of childhood adversity.

5,5,8580010,"This study was conducted to evaluate longitudinal changes in the peritoneal equilibration test (PET) in children treated with continuous peritoneal dialysis (CPD). The effects of prolonged CPD and episodes of peritonitis on the PET were examined. PET was repeated up to five times in 12 paediatric patients who were subdivided into groups with and without peritonitis. In the peritonitis group (n = 6), the dialysate/plasma (D/P) creatinine ratio at a 4-h dwell time decreased progressively with time on CPD in five of six patients. In a comparison of the initial and final PETs performed at a mean interval of 22.8 +/- 11.6 months, the D/P creatinine ratio in the final PET was significantly lower than in the initial PET (P < 0.01). In contrast, in the non-peritonitis group (n = 6), the D/P creatinine ratio in the final PET was unchanged for 28.2 +/- 12.3 months from the initial PET. The D/Do glucose ratio at a 4-h dwell time was unchanged over time in each group. Thus, repeated PET measurements revealed that membrane permeability for creatinine was not affected by prolonged CPD itself, but decreased with time after episodes of peritonitis. Although the protocol for PET is not standardised in children, PET was useful for determining the sequential changes in peritoneal function in such patients on CPD.

In the last thirty years a more beneficial side of lactate as an alternative 'glucose sparing' fuel has been demonstrated. However, the translation of these growing insights to clinical practice seems to appear with great delay. A review of the literature was performed, focusing on glucose and lactate in relation to cerebral energy metabolism, in the context of four typical clinical situations, namely (transient states of) low glucose availability for the brain due to hypoglycemia, combined with high blood lactate concentrations; permanent neuroglycopenia; lactic acidosis in mitochondrial disorders; and ischemic as well as traumatic brain injury. Lactate is thought to be an alternative fuel in the brain of patients with glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome and glycogen storage disease, and it has been demonstrated that lactate might have a protective role in ischemic and traumatic brain injury.

7,7,10388424,"Craniosynostosis, the premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures, may occur in isolation or in association with a syndromic constellation. Multiple-suture synostosis has consistently been associated with brain compression and increased intracranial pressure, and frequently decreased cognitive development. Single-suture craniosynostosis, however, has been thought by some to be an aesthetic problem with infrequent consequences on brain function and development. Some studies have disputed this concept and have argued a correlation between single-suture craniosynostosis and abnormalities in development. The purpose of this study was to determine, using an objective radiographic tool, positron emission tomography scans, if patients with single-suture craniosynostosis had any abnormalities in cerebral glucose metabolism that would indicate changes in local brain function. A total of 10 children with single-suture craniosynostosis, eight males and two females, ranging in age from 0.1 to 3.2 years, were enrolled in this prospective study approved by the Internal Review Board. Six of the children had sagittal synostosis, three had metopic synostosis, and one had coronal craniosynostosis. Each of the patients had preoperative positron emission tomography scans performed 1 to 5 weeks before cranial reconstructive surgery and postoperative scans at 6 to 12 weeks after surgery. Surgical treatment consisted of cranial vault remodeling in eight of the children and strip craniectomy with cranial expansion in two of the children. After surgery, the two scans were compared qualitatively and quantitatively by a single radiologist. The results demonstrated variable regional increases and decreases in local post-operative cerebral glucose metabolism. However, in the posterior occipital region, the area of visual development and visual spatial coordination, there was a consistent postoperative increase in all 10 patients. Maximum glucose metabolic rate was increased up to 30.2% with a mean of 9.9%, and average glucose metabolic rates demonstrated a maximum increase of up to 18.8%. The results of this study indicate cerebral glucose metabolism consistently increases in the posterior occipital cortex after surgical release of single-suture craniosynostosis.

On four separate mornings and in random order, boys received equally sweetened preloads containing Splenda sucralose or glucose [1.0 g/kg body weight (BW)] in 250 mL of water 2 h after a standard breakfast. Food intake from a pizza meal was measured 30 min later with or without TVV. Both preload treatment (p < 0.01) and TVV (p < 0.001) affected FI (kcal). TVV increased lunchtime FI by an average of 228 kcal. Glucose suppressed FI in the no TVV condition compared with control, but the effect was not statistically significant during TVV. Body composition and subjective appetite scores were positively associated with FI at the test lunch. In conclusion, TVV while eating a meal contributes to increased energy intake by delaying normal mealtime satiation and reducing satiety signals from previously consumed foods.

It achieved a significant effect in lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) in all family adults by 2.3 mmHg and in elderlies (aged > = 60 years) by 9.5 mmHg. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of this salt reduction program. Costs of the intervention were assessed using an ingredients approach to identify resource use. A trial-based incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated based on the observed effectiveness in lowering SBP. A Markov model was used to estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention, and then based on population data, extrapolated to a scenario where the program is scaled up nationwide. Findings were presented in terms of an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The perspective was that of the health sector. The intervention cost Int$19.04 per family and yielded an ICER of Int$2.74 (90% CI: 1.17-12.30) per mmHg reduction of SBP in all participants (combining children and adult participants together) compared with control group.

It resulted in remarkable progress in IDD control, especially in Africa and in South East Asia where the endemic is the most severe. It is estimated that 68% of the populations of affected countries have currently access to iodised salt. However, out of the 130 affected countries, about 30 have no programme. Besides, salt quality control and monitoring of population iodine status are still weak in many countries, thus exposing the population to an excessive iodine intake and subsequently to the risk of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism. In addition, IDD is re-emerging in some countries, especially in Eastern Europe after it had disappeared.

Data were collected from 10-y-old children ( N = 6,316) in 2012 and again in 2014. Children were approximately equally distributed from 138 elementary schools representing the 6 governorates of Kuwait. Calibrated examiners conducted oral examination, self-reported sleep evaluation interviews, anthropomorphic measurements, and unstimulated whole saliva sample collection. Salivary glucose levels were measured by a florescent glucose oxidase method; values of salivary glucose ≥1.13 mg/dL were defined as high glucose levels. A multilevel random intercept and slope analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between sleep duration and gingivitis on 3 levels: within schools, among children, and over time. The outcome was the progression of the extent of gingival inflammation in children over time. The main independent variables were the number of daily sleep hours and salivary glucose levels. Other explanatory variables and confounders assessed were governorate, dental caries and restorations, and obesity by waist circumference (adjusted for snacking and sex). Gingivitis increased over time in children who had shorter sleep duration ( P < 0.05). Salivary glucose levels >1.13 mg/dL predicted gingivitis ( P < 0.05). Children who had more decayed or filled teeth had more gingivitis ( P < 0.05). No significant association was found between gingivitis and obesity. The level of gingivitis was different among the 6 governorates of Kuwait. Additionally, there was a strong clustering effect of the observations within schools and among children across time. Longitudinal analysis of 6,316 Kuwaiti children revealed that shorter sleep duration and higher salivary glucose levels were both associated with increased gingival inflammation.

Despite the equivalent efficacy and better tolerability of these drugs, more than 25% of patients remain refractory to treatment. Moreover, the issues for pediatric patients are different from those for adults, and have not been addressed in the development and application of the new AEDs. Recently published evidence-based treatment guidelines have helped physicians to choose the most reasonable AED, although they cannot fully endorse new AEDs because of the lack of well-designed, randomized controlled trials.

20,20,36589801,"One of the most important complications of obesity is insulin resistance, which leads to carbohydrate metabolism disorders such as type 2 diabetes. However, obesity is also associated with development of an autoimmune response against various organs, including pancreatic beta cells. The prevalence of such autoimmune processes in children and their possible contribution to the increased incidence of type 1 diabetes is currently unclear. Therefore, the present study assessed the prevalence of autoantibodies against pancreatic islet beta cell's antigens in children and adolescents with simple obesity. This prospective observational study included pediatric patients (up to 18 years of age) with simple obesity hospitalized between 2011 and 2016 at the Department of Pediatrics, Diabetology, Endocrinology and Nephrology of the Medical University of Lodz. Children with acute or chronic conditions that might additionally affect insulin resistance or glucose metabolism were excluded. Collected clinical data included sex, age, sexual maturity ratings (Tanner`s scale), body height and weight, waist and hip circumference, amount of body fat and lean body mass. Each participant underwent a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test with simultaneous measurements of glycaemia and insulinemia at 0`, 60` and 120`. In addition, glycated hemoglobin HbA1c, fasting and stimulated c-peptide, total cholesterol, as well as high- and low-density cholesterol and triglycerides were measured. Insulin resistance was assessed by calculating HOMA-IR index. The following autoantibodies against pancreatic islet beta cells were determined in each child: ICA - antibodies against cytoplasmic antigens of pancreatic islets, GAD - antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase, ZnT8 - antibodies against zinc transporter, IA2 - antibodies against tyrosine phosphatase, IAA - antibodies against insulin. The study group included 161 children (57.4% boys, mean age 13.1 ± 2.9 years) with simple obesity (mean BMI z-score +2.2 ± 1.6). Among them, 28 (17.4%) were diagnosed with impaired glucose metabolism during OGTT [23 (82.2%) - isolated impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), 3 (10.7%) - isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG), 2 (7.1%) - IFG and IGT]. Of the children tested, 28 (17.4%) were tested positive for at least one islet-specific autoantibody [with similar percentages in boys (15, 17.4%) and girls (13, 17.3%), p=0.9855], with ICA being the most common (positive in 18, 11.2%), followed by IAA (7, 4.3%), ZnT8 (5, 3.1%), GADA (3, 1.9%) and IA2 (1, 0.6%). There was no association between the presence of the tested antibodies and age, sex, stage of puberty, parameters assessing the degree of obesity, HbA1c, lipid levels and basal metabolic rate. However, autoantibody-positive subjects were more likely to present IFG or IGT in OGTT compared to those who tested completely negative (9, 32.1% vs 19, 14.3%, p=0.0280). Their HOMA-IR was also significantly higher (HOMA-IR: 4.3 ± 1.9 vs 3.4 ± 1.9, p=0.0203) and this difference remained statistically significant after adjusting for sex and age (p=0.0340). Children and adolescents with simple obesity presented a higher prevalence of markers of autoimmune response against pancreatic beta cells than the general population. Most often, they had only one type of antibody - ICA. The presence of autoimmune response indicators against pancreatic islet antigens is more common in obese patients with impaired carbohydrate metabolism and is associated with lower insulin sensitivity.

This family study analyses the phenotypes in 2 kindreds segregating SLC2A1 mutations identified through probands with early-onset absence epilepsy. One comprised 9 individuals with mutations over 3 generations; the other had 6 individuals over 2 generations. Of 15 subjects with SLC2A1 mutations, epilepsy occurred in 12. Absence seizures were the most prevalent seizure type (10/12), with onset from 3 to 34 years of age.

An assessment of SM levels and plaque indices was done on all children at baseline, 15 days, and at 1, 3, and 6 months. SM levels were determined by the spatula method. Although the reduction in SM counts in all groups was statistically significant, differences among groups were not observed, and the CHX and F groups seemed to show the greatest effect. Plaque reduction was observed in all groups, whereas statistically significant decreases among groups were not observed.

33,33,30844580,"To examine the prospective associations between exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and longitudinal measurements of glucose metabolism in high-risk overweight and obese Hispanic children. Forty overweight and obese Hispanic children (8-14 years) from urban Los Angeles underwent clinical measures and 2-hour oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) at baseline and a follow-up visit (range: 1-3 years after enrollment). Baseline plasma perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), and the plasma metabolome were measured by liquid-chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Multiple linear regression models were used to assess the association between baseline PFASs and changes in glucose homeostasis over follow-up. A metabolome-wide association study coupled with pathway enrichment analysis was performed to evaluate metabolic dysregulation associated with plasma PFASs concentrations. We performed a structural integrated analysis aiming to characterize the joint impact of all factors and to identify latent clusters of children with alterations in glucose homeostasis, based on their exposure and metabolomics profile. Each ln (ng/ml) increase in PFOA and PFHxS concentrations was associated with a 30.6 mg/dL (95% CI: 8.8-52.4) and 10.2 mg/dL (95% CI: 2.7-17.7) increase in 2-hour glucose levels, respectively. A ln (ng/ml) increase in PFHxS concentrations was also associated with 17.8 mg/dL increase in the glucose area under the curve (95% CI: 1.5-34.1). Pathway enrichment analysis showed significant alterations of lipids (e.g., glycosphingolipids, linoleic acid, and de novo lipogenesis), and amino acids (e.g., aspartate and asparagine, tyrosine, arginine and proline) in association to PFASs exposure. The integrated analysis identified a cluster of children with increased 2-h glucose levels over follow up, characterized by increased PFAS levels and altered metabolite patterns. This proof-of-concept analysis shows that higher PFAS exposure was associated with dysregulation of several lipid and amino acid pathways and longitudinal alterations in glucose homeostasis in Hispanic youth. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings and fully elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms.

34,34,27166229,"Cross-sectional studies report a correlation between slow wave sleep (SWS) duration and insulin sensitivity (SI) in children and adults. Suppression of SWS causes insulin resistance in adults but effects in children are unknown. This study was designed to determine the effect of SWS fragmentation on SI in children. Fourteen pubertal children (11.3-14.1 y, body mass index 29(th) to 97(th) percentile) were randomized to sleep studies and mixed meal (MM) tolerance tests with and without SWS disruption. Beta-cell responsiveness (Φ) and SI were determined using oral minimal modeling. During the disruption night, auditory stimuli (68.1 ± 10.7/night; mean ± standard error) decreased SWS by 40.0 ± 8.0%. SWS fragmentation did not affect fasting glucose (non-disrupted 76.9 ± 2.3 versus disrupted 80.6 ± 2.1 mg/dL), insulin (9.2 ± 1.6 versus 10.4 ± 2.0 μIU/mL), or C-peptide (1.9 ± 0.2 versus 1.9 ± 0.1 ng/mL) levels and did not impair SI (12.9 ± 2.3 versus 10.1 ± 1.6 10(-4) dL/kg/min per μIU/mL) or Φ (73.4 ± 7.8 versus 74.4 ± 8.4 10(-9) min(-1)) to a MM challenge. Only the subjects in the most insulin-sensitive tertile demonstrated a consistent decrease in SI after SWS disruption. Pubertal children across a range of body mass indices may be resistant to the adverse metabolic effects of acute SWS disruption. Only those subjects with high SI (i.e., having the greatest ""metabolic reserve"") demonstrated a consistent decrease in SI. These results suggest that adolescents may have a unique ability to adapt to metabolic stressors, such as acute SWS disruption, to maintain euglycemia. Additional studies are necessary to confirm that this resiliency is maintained in settings of chronic SWS disruption.

This study aimed to determine the iodine status of New Zealand children when the fortification of bread was well established. A cross-sectional survey of children aged 8-10 years was conducted in the cities of Auckland and Christchurch, New Zealand, from March to May 2015. Children provided a spot urine sample for the determination of urinary iodine concentration (UIC), a fingerpick blood sample for Thyroglobulin (Tg) concentration, and completed a questionnaire ascertaining socio-demographic information that also included an iodine-specific food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The FFQ was used to estimate iodine intake from all main food sources including bread and iodised salt. The median UIC for all children (n = 415) was 116 μg/L (females 106 μg/L, males 131 μg/L) indicative of adequate iodine status according to the World Health Organisation (WHO, i.e., median UIC of 100-199 μg/L). The median Tg concentration was 8.7 μg/L, which was <10 μg/L confirming adequate iodine status. There was a significant difference in UIC by sex (p = 0.001) and ethnicity (p = 0.006). The mean iodine intake from the food-only model was 65 μg/day. Bread contributed 51% of total iodine intake in the food-only model, providing a mean iodine intake of 35 μg/day.

Severe obesity along with continued weight gain, specifically in obese youth belonging to ethnic minorities, have been shown to be associated with deterioration of glucose tolerance over short periods of time. As obesity-related insulin resistance in the pediatric age-group is associated with the development of altered glucose metabolism and other elements of the metabolic syndrome, severely obese youth are a high-risk group for the development of type 2 diabetes and may benefit most from preventive interventions such as environmental changes that promote increased physical activity.

Frequencies were converted into aggregate past month awareness across marketing activities and grouped into three categories (low/medium/high).

Evidence from human and animal studies indicates that glutamate is the major oxidative fuel for the gut and that dietary glutamate is extensively metabolized in first-pass by the intestinal enterocytes. Glutamate also is an important precursor for bioactive molecules, including glutathione, and functions as a key neurotransmitter. The central importance of glutamate as an oxidative fuel may have therapeutic potential for improving function of the infant gut, which exhibits a high rate of epithelial cell turnover. Our recent studies in infant pigs show that when MSG is fed at higher (4-fold) than normal dietary quantities, the majority (approximately 70%) of glutamate molecule is either oxidized as energy or metabolized by the mucosa into other nonessential amino acids. Our results also showed that at high dietary intakes the rate of MSG absorption is higher when given via the intragastric compared to intraduodenal route.

47,47,9279207,"1. Living-related liver transplantation has some advantages in the evaluation of novel clinical protocols, since many complicated factors affecting initial graft function are almost uniform in grafts obtained from healthy donors. 2. To compare histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) and University of Wisconsin (UW) solution in terms of tissue oxygenation in living-related liver transplantation, oxygen saturation of haemoglobin (SO2) in hepatic tissue and its heterogeneity (CV, coefficient of variation) were measured by near-infrared spectroscopy. The HTK and UW groups consisted of 15 and 49 successful transplants respectively, in which no statistical differences in background were observed. 3. In the HTK group, hepatic SO2 after portal vein reflow was higher (P < 0.01) than that in the UW group, as was that after hepatic artery reflow (P < 0.05). In the UW group, hepatic SO2 remained at the lower level at the end of the operation. 4. Furthermore, the increase in CV after portal vein reflow was normalized after hepatic artery reflow in the HTK group. However, the CV remained at a high level at the end of the operation in the UW group. 5. Postoperative peak aspartate aminotransferase level in the HTK group was lower than that in the UW group (P < 0.05). 6. In cadaveric liver transplantation, higher hepatic SO2 and lower CV of hepatic SO2 in the early phase after reperfusion compared with the UW group (n = 18) were also observed in the HTK group (n = 30) (P < 0.05). 7. In conclusion, recovery of tissue oxygenation and its heterogeneity after reperfusion in HTK-preserved livers were more rapid and homogeneous than in UW-preserved livers in living-related liver transplantation.

48,48,35041752,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) traditionally refers to abnormal glucose tolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. GDM has long been associated with obstetric and neonatal complications primarily relating to higher infant birthweight and is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for future maternal and offspring cardiometabolic disease. The prevalence of GDM continues to rise internationally due to epidemiological factors including the increase in background rates of obesity in women of reproductive age and rising maternal age and the implementation of the revised International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups' criteria and diagnostic procedures for GDM. The current lack of international consensus for the diagnosis of GDM reflects its complex historical evolution and pragmatic antenatal resource considerations given GDM is now 1 of the most common complications of pregnancy. Regardless, the contemporary clinical approach to GDM should be informed not only by its short-term complications but also by its longer term prognosis. Recent data demonstrate the effect of early in utero exposure to maternal hyperglycemia, with evidence for fetal overgrowth present prior to the traditional diagnosis of GDM from 24 weeks' gestation, as well as the durable adverse impact of maternal hyperglycemia on child and adolescent metabolism. The major contribution of GDM to the global epidemic of intergenerational cardiometabolic disease highlights the importance of identifying GDM as an early risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, broadening the prevailing clinical approach to address longer term maternal and offspring complications following a diagnosis of GDM.

In humans, the 6Lys-81Ile haplotype of melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R) gene has been associated with childhood obesity, higher body fat percentage, and reduced fat oxidation compared to non-carriers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between MC3R 6Lys-81Ile haplotype with body composition and substrate oxidation in response to moderate exercise in obese children. Eight Chilean obese children (aged 8-12) carriers of MC3R 6Lys-81Ile haplotype were compared with eight age-gender-matched obese non-carriers. Children were identified through a previous cross-sectional study on genetic determinants of childhood obesity (n = 229). Genotypes for MC3R Thr6Lys and Val81Ile were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Body composition was assessed by the four-compartment model (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, total body water by the deuterium dilution technique, and total fat mass by air-displacement plethysmography). Substrate oxidation was assessed by indirect calorimetry in response to moderate exercise (60% VO(2 max)). Wilcoxon matched-pairs test was used to compare quantitative variables. No significant differences among carriers and non-carriers were found in anthropometrical and body composition measurements. The Carriers of the 6Lys-81Ile haplotype showed higher respiratory quotient (p = 0.06) and a significantly higher glucose oxidation (p = 0.01) compared with non-carriers after standardization for fat-free mass.

Cryptococcosis in 53 patients with ICL had features in common with cryptococcosis in previously normal patients. ICL patients had a slight male predominance (1.2:1) and a median age of presentation of 41 years (range, 4.5-85 yr). Initial cerebrospinal fluid findings showed glucose below 40 mg/dL in 60% of the patients, a median pleocytosis of 59 white blood cells/mm (range, 0-884), and protein of 156 mg/dL (range, 25-402 mg/dL).

Unlike previously normal patients with cryptococcosis, those with ICL had an excess incidence of dermatomal zoster (7 episodes in 46 ICL cases). Pneumocystis pneumonia was rare (1 case), casting doubt on the need for prophylaxis in patients with ICL. A favorable outcome (cured or improved) may be more common in ICL patients than in previously normal patients with cryptococcal meningitis and no predisposing factors. Identification of ICL in patients who were apparently normal before the onset of cryptococcosis appears to be useful because it predicts a favorable outcome.

62,62,36686477,"Until recently, glucagon was considered a mere antagonist to insulin, protecting the body from hypoglycemia. This notion changed with the discovery of the liver-alpha cell axis (LACA) as a feedback loop. The LACA describes how glucagon secretion and pancreatic alpha cell proliferation are stimulated by circulating amino acids. Glucagon in turn leads to an upregulation of amino acid metabolism and ureagenesis in the liver. Several increasingly common diseases (e.g., non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity) disrupt this feedback loop. It is important for clinicians and researchers alike to understand the liver-alpha cell axis and the metabolic sequelae of these diseases. While most of previous studies have focused on fasting concentrations of glucagon and amino acids, there is limited knowledge of their dynamics after glucose administration.

64,64,12423519,"ACD-A solution containing sodium citrate and citric acid is used as an anticoagulant agent during peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) harvesting, and in rare cases can cause fatal citrate intoxication. The aim of this study was to establish effective methods for stabilizing ionized calcium (ICa) levels during PBPC harvesting. ICa was measured during 46 apheresis procedures conducted in 26 patients. Four patients in four procedures were infused with calcium gluconate solution before PBPC harvesting; three patients in six procedures were infused with calcium gluconate when symptoms of citrate intoxication appeared; and four patients in five procedures received a continuous infusion. Five patients in five procedures took an isotonic sports drink containing calcium when hypocalcemic symptoms appeared. The ICa level, blood pressure, and pulse rate were measured. ICa declined rapidly from the preapheresis level of 1.081(+/-0.092) mM to 0.937(+/-0.081) mM (13.3%, p < 0.0001) 10 minutes after the start of apheresis and continued to decline until the completion of the procedure. When patients received a continuous infusion of calcium during apheresis, ICa was relatively stabilized. ICa significantly rose (6.1 +/- 3.6%, p < 0.02) within 2 to 5 minutes after oral intake of an isotonic sports drink containing calcium and was maintained within normal range for 31 to 55 minutes. An isotonic sports drink containing calcium has a quick stabilizing and a longer maintenance effect on ICa. Thus, we recommend the intake of an isotonic sports drink containing calcium as the easiest and best method for preventing hypocalcemia during apheresis.

Excess sugar consumption during pregnancy is associated with several perinatal complications. As sugar-sweetened beverage taxes become increasingly common public health measures to reduce sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, evidence of the downstream effects of sugar-sweetened beverage taxes on perinatal health remains limited. This longitudinal retrospective study examines whether sugar-sweetened beverage taxes in 5 U.S. cities were associated with decreased risk of perinatal complications, leveraging 2013-2019 U.S. national birth certificate data and a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences approach to estimate changes in perinatal outcomes. Analysis occurred from April 2021 through January 2023. The sample included 5,324,548 pregnant individuals and their live singleton births in the U.S. from 2013 through 2019. Sugar-sweetened beverage taxes were associated with a 41.4% decreased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (-2.2 percentage points; 95% CI= -4.2, -0.2), a -7.9% reduction in weight-gain-for-gestational-age z-score (-0.2 standard deviations; 95% CI= -0.3, -0.01), and decreased risk of infants born small for gestational age (-4.3 percentage points; 95% CI= -6.5, -2.1). There were heterogeneous effects across subgroups, particularly for weight-gain-for-gestational-age z-score.

Nine children with NAFLD and 10 matched controls without NAFLD completed the study. We assessed plasma lipid levels over two nonconsecutive, randomly assigned, 24-h periods under isocaloric, isonitrogenous conditions with three macronutrient-balanced, consecutive meals and either: 1) a fructose-sweetened beverage (FB); or 2) a glucose beverage (GB) being consumed with each meal. Differences in plasma glucose, insulin, triglyceride, apolipoprotein B, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and nonesterified free fatty acid levels were assessed using mixed models and 24-h incremental areas under the time-concentration curve. After FB, triglyceride incremental area under the curve was higher vs. after GB both in children with NAFLD (P = 0.011) and those without NAFLD (P = 0.027); however, incremental response to FB was greater in children with NAFLD than those without NAFLD (P = 0.019). For all subjects, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol declined in the postprandial and overnight hours with FB, but not with GB (P = 0.0006).

We measured the absorption of sucrose, mannitol, and lactulose in 20 controls and 18 alcoholics within 3 days after their last drink. We evaluated the reversibility of the abnormalities in alcoholics by repeat testing after 7 to 14 days of sobriety. The acute effects of ethanol in normal controls and abstinent alcoholics were also studied after the administration of ethanol by both the oral and IV routes. The absorptions of lactulose and sucrose in chronic alcoholics were normal. However, the alcoholics demonstrated a significant decrease in mannitol absorption and a corresponding increase in the lactulose/mannitol ratio. Both parameters returned to normal after a period of sobriety. Acute ethanol did not significantly affect mannitol or lactulose absorption, whereas oral ethanol significantly increased sucrose absorption. Chronic ethanol reversibly affects the integrity of small intestinal villi without significantly affecting gastrointestinal permeability. In contrast, a single oral dose of ethanol increases gastroduodenal permeability but has no effect on the lactulose or mannitol permeability of the small intestine. These regional changes in gut permeabilities may contribute to alcohol-induced GI symptoms.

74,74,12919392,"To characterize the epileptogenic condition of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, the interictal patterns of glucose metabolism, perfusion, and magnetic field in the temporal lobe were evaluated by using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography, [99mTc]-ethylcysteinate dimer-single photon emission computed tomography, and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Twenty-one patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy related to hippocampal sclerosis were studied. The ictal-onset area was located by continuous video-EEG monitoring. Quantitative analysis of glucose metabolism and perfusion in the temporal lobe was performed, and the cerebral magnetic field was evaluated to measure the equivalent current dipole (MEG-ECD). Although hypometabolism and hypoperfusion in the temporal lobe were lateralized with the ictal-onset area in 16 (76.2%) and in 11 (52.4%) respectively, they were localized in diverse ways without any coupling. MEG-ECD was distributed in diverse ways unrelated to the ictal-onset area: ipsilateral medial temporal origin in five (23.8%), ipsilateral lateral temporal origin in two (9.5%), ipsilateral mixed (medial and lateral) temporal origin in six (28.6%), bilateral temporal origin in four (19.0%), and contralateral temporal origin in two (9.5%). MEG-ECD was distributed in varied ways with the disorder and uncoupling of glucose metabolism and perfusion in the temporal lobe. These results may help resolve the clinical controversy over the possibility that the cortical irritative area generating the interictal epileptic discharge is distinct from the ictal-onset area, and also may have some functional implications in identifying different brain compartments in the generation of metabolic signals.

75,75,8615352,"Uridine diphosphate (UDP) galactose, a pivotal compound in the metabolism of galactose, is the obligate donor of galactose in the formation of complex glycoconjugates. The cellular UDPgalactose concentration has been thought to be maintained by the interconversion of UDPglucose and UDPgalactose by UDPgalactose-4-epimerase. However, recent findings of lower average red blood cell (RBC) UDPgalactose concentrations in galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase-deficient patients suggest that other factors play a role in determining its concentration. To test the hypothesis that the amount of galactose traversing the Leloir pathway contributes to the cellular UDPgalactose pool, we determined RBC UDPgalactose in patients with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), phenylketonuria (PKU), and other metabolic diseases who were treated with a low-protein, and consequently, low-lactose diet. Six patients with MSUD were also supplemented with 19 g galactose/d and their UDPhexose concentrations were measured at intervals. We show that young patients with MSUD or PKU have decreased average RBC UDPgalactose concentrations when compared with similarly aged healthy subjects. Galactose supplementation of MSUD patients significantly increased their UDPgalactose concentrations in both RBCs and white blood cells (WBCs) from 29.5 +/- 1.5 to 42.3 +/- 5.8 nmol/g hemoglobin and from 69.0 +/- 7.5 to 193.0 +/- 49.0 nmol/g protein, respectively. Discontinuation of supplementation was associated with a return to basal values in RBCs and a reattainment of the pretreatment ratio of UDPglucose to UDPgalactose in WBCs. These observations demonstrate that dietary galactose is a factor in establishing the steady state concentrations of the uridine sugar nucleotides and imply that galactose metabolism modulates the achievement of an epimerase-mediated equilibrium.

Milk removal, which is essential for adequate infant intake and continued milk synthesis through multiple hormonal and autocrine/paracrine mechanisms, should be effective, efficient, and comfortable for both the lactating parent and the infant. All 3 components should be included in the evaluation of milk removal. Breastmilk ""bridges"" flavor experiences in utero with postweaning foods, and the flavors become familiar and preferred. Infants can detect flavor changes in human milk resulting from parental lifestyle choices, including recreational drug use, and early experiences with the sensory properties of these recreational drugs impact subsequent behavioral responses. Interactions between the infant's own developing microbiome, that of the milk, and the multiple environmental factors that are drivers-both modifiable and nonmodifiable-in the microbial ecology of human milk are explored. Disruptions in gestation, especially preterm birth and fetal growth restriction or excess, impact the milk composition and lactation processes such as the timing of secretory activation, adequacy of milk volume and milk removal, and duration of lactation.

80,80,30537237,"In adults, hypothalamic gliosis has been documented using quantitative T2 neuroimaging, whereas functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown a defective hypothalamic response to nutrients. No studies have yet evaluated these hypothalamic abnormalities in children with obesity. Children with obesity and lean controls underwent quantitative MRI measuring T2 relaxation time, along with continuous hypothalamic fMRI acquisition to evaluate early response to glucose ingestion. Children with obesity (N = 11) had longer T2 relaxation times, consistent with gliosis, in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) compared to controls (N = 9; P = 0.004). Moreover, there was a highly significant group*region interaction (P = 0.002), demonstrating that signs of gliosis were specific to MBH and not to reference regions. Longer T2 relaxation times correlated with measures of higher adiposity, including visceral fat percentage (P = 0.01). Mean glucose-induced hypothalamic blood oxygen-level dependent signal change did not differ between groups (P = 0.11). However, mean left MBH T2 relaxation time negatively correlated with glucose-induced hypothalamic signal change (P < 0.05). Imaging signs of hypothalamic gliosis were present in children with obesity and positively associated with more severe adiposity. Children with the strongest evidence for gliosis showed the least activation after glucose ingestion.

In a randomised double-blind controlled, parallel, multicountry intervention study, 767 healthy children, ages 11 to 29 months, received GUM with scGOS/lcFOS/LCPUFAs (the active group, n = 388), GUM without scGOS/lcFOS/LCPUFAs (the control group, n = 379), or cow's milk (n = 37) for 52 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the number of episodes of upper respiratory tract infections or gastrointestinal infections based on a combination of subject's illness symptoms reported by the parents during the intervention period. Children in the active group compared with the control group had a decreased risk of developing at least 1 infection (299/388 [77%] vs 313/379 [83%], respectively, relative risk 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87-1.00; logistic regression P = 0.03).

Although it is subject to functionally relevant modification by common polymorphisms and unregulated inflammation, the functional status of SP-D in cystic fibrosis (CF) remains unclear. Given the importance of infection and inflammation in CF lung pathology we have undertaken the first systematic analysis of SP-D lectin activity in this population. By ELISA, we found that airway lavage fluid SP-D expression was greater in CF compared to control patients but was reduced in CF patients with infection and correlated negatively with markers of neutrophilic inflammation. In a functional assay, the percentage of SP-D capable of binding zymosan rarely exceeded 60% in CF or control patients and similarly restricted binding activity was observed towards maltose-agarose. SP-D lectin activity also correlated negatively with infection and neutrophilic inflammation but there was little evidence of major proteolytic degradation amongst the non-bound material. SP-D which failed to bind zymosan exhibited features of lower oligomeric form compared to bound material when tested by native gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, when separated by gel chromatography, high and low oligomeric populations of SP-D were observed in CF lavage fluid but only high oligomeric forms exhibited substantial lectin activity towards yeast derived mannan. Our data demonstrate that oligomeric heterogeneity underlies functional diversity amongst SP-D in health and disease and that dynamic regulation of oligomerisation is an important feature of SP-D biology.

Ultrasonography is a simple bedside screening tool used for the assessment of ectopic visceral fat including fatty pancreas. This study investigates the association between insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and fatty pancreas detected by ultrasound in children with obesity. Methods This case-control study included 50 prepubertal obese (body mass index [BMI] ≥95th age- and sex-specific percentiles) and 30 lean children (BMI 5th-85th age- and sex-specific percentiles) as the control group. Clinical and laboratory parameters of metabolic syndrome including anthropometric indices of central obesity, blood pressure, fasting glucose and lipid profile were measured. Homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was used to assess insulin resistance. Ultrasonographic assessment for pancreatic fat was done for all children. Results Fifty-eight percent of obese children had fatty pancreas. Obese children with fatty pancreas had a higher rate of metabolic syndrome (p=0.013) and insulin resistance than those with non-fatty pancreas (p=0.012). Regression analysis revealed that fatty pancreas is an independent predictor of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. Fatty pancreas increases the risk for metabolic syndrome (odds ratio [OR] 11.40; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.69-48.22) and insulin resistance (OR 7.85; 95% CI: 2.20-28.05) in children with obesity.

Statistical analysis was performed during 2022 to 2023. Lipid, apolipoprotein, and carbohydrate biomarkers measured in blood. The associations between biomarker levels and the risk of developing depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders through the end of 2020 were examined using Cox proportional hazards regression models. In addition, nested case-control analyses were conducted within the cohort, including all incident cases of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders, and up to 10 control individuals per case who were individually matched to the case by year of birth, sex, and year of enrollment to the AMORIS cohort, using incidence density sampling. Population trajectories were used to illustrate the temporal trends in biomarker levels for cases and controls.

96,96,35944931,"Elevated blood pressure, or hypertension, is the leading cause of preventable deaths globally. Diets high in sodium (predominantly sodium chloride) and low in potassium contribute to elevated blood pressure. The WHO recommends decreasing mean population sodium intake through effective and safe strategies to reduce hypertension and its associated disease burden. Incorporating low-sodium salt substitutes (LSSS) into population strategies has increasingly been recognised as a possible sodium reduction strategy, particularly in populations where a substantial proportion of overall sodium intake comes from discretionary salt. The LSSS contain lower concentrations of sodium through its displacement with potassium predominantly, or other minerals. Potassium-containing LSSS can potentially simultaneously decrease sodium intake and increase potassium intake.  Benefits of LSSS include their potential blood pressure-lowering effect and relatively low cost. However, there are concerns about potential adverse effects of LSSS, such as hyperkalaemia, particularly in people at risk, for example, those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or taking medications that impair potassium excretion.

We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate Analytics), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL, EBSCOhost), ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 18 August 2021, and screened reference lists of included trials and relevant systematic reviews. No language or publication restrictions were applied. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective analytical cohort studies in participants of any age in the general population, from any setting in any country. This included participants with non-communicable diseases and those taking medications that impair potassium excretion. Studies had to compare any type and method of implementation of LSSS with the use of regular salt, or no active intervention, at an individual, household or community level, for any duration. Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full-text articles to determine eligibility; and extracted data, assessed risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB tool, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We stratified analyses by adults, children (≤ 18 years) and pregnant women. Primary effectiveness outcomes were change in diastolic and systolic blood pressure (DBP and SBP), hypertension and blood pressure control; cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality were additionally assessed as primary effectiveness outcomes in adults. Primary safety outcomes were change in blood potassium, hyperkalaemia and hypokalaemia. We included 26 RCTs, 16 randomising individual participants and 10 randomising clusters (families, households or villages). A total of 34,961 adult participants and 92 children were randomised to either LSSS or regular salt, with the smallest trial including 10 and the largest including 20,995 participants. No studies in pregnant women were identified. Studies included only participants with hypertension (11/26), normal blood pressure (1/26), pre-hypertension (1/26), or participants with and without hypertension (11/26). This was unknown in the remaining studies. The largest study included only participants with an elevated risk of stroke at baseline. Seven studies included adult participants possibly at risk of hyperkalaemia. All 26 trials specifically excluded participants in whom an increased potassium intake is known to be potentially harmful. The majority of trials were conducted in rural or suburban settings, with more than half (14/26) conducted in low- and middle-income countries. The proportion of sodium chloride replacement in the LSSS interventions varied from approximately 3% to 77%. The majority of trials (23/26) investigated LSSS where potassium-containing salts were used to substitute sodium. In most trials, LSSS implementation was discretionary (22/26). Trial duration ranged from two months to nearly five years.  We assessed the overall risk of bias as high in six trials and unclear in 12 trials. LSSS compared to regular salt in adults: LSSS compared to regular salt probably reduce DBP on average (mean difference (MD) -2.43 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.50 to -1.36; 20,830 participants, 19 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence) and SBP (MD -4.76 mmHg, 95% CI -6.01 to -3.50; 21,414 participants, 20 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence) slightly.  On average, LSSS probably reduce non-fatal stroke (absolute effect (AE) 20 fewer/100,000 person-years, 95% CI -40 to 2; 21,250 participants, 3 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence), non-fatal acute coronary syndrome (AE 150 fewer/100,000 person-years, 95% CI -250 to -30; 20,995 participants, 1 RCT, moderate-certainty evidence) and cardiovascular mortality (AE 180 fewer/100,000 person-years, 95% CI -310 to 0; 23,200 participants, 3 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence) slightly, and probably increase blood potassium slightly (MD 0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.18; 784 participants, 6 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence), compared to regular salt.  LSSS may result in little to no difference, on average, in hypertension (AE 17 fewer/1000, 95% CI -58 to 17; 2566 participants, 1 RCT, low-certainty evidence) and hyperkalaemia (AE 4 more/100,000, 95% CI -47 to 121; 22,849 participants, 5 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence) compared to regular salt. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of LSSS on blood pressure control, various cardiovascular events, stroke mortality, hypokalaemia, and other adverse events (very-low certainty evidence). LSSS compared to regular salt in children: The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of LSSS on DBP and SBP in children. We found no evidence about the effects of LSSS on hypertension, blood pressure control, blood potassium, hyperkalaemia and hypokalaemia in children. When compared to regular salt, LSSS probably reduce blood pressure, non-fatal cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality slightly in adults. However, LSSS also probably increase blood potassium slightly in adults. These small effects may be important when LSSS interventions are implemented at the population level. Evidence is limited for adults without elevated blood pressure, and there is a lack of evidence in pregnant women and people in whom an increased potassium intake is known to be potentially harmful, limiting conclusions on the safety of LSSS in the general population. We also cannot draw firm conclusions about effects of non-discretionary LSSS implementations. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of LSSS on blood pressure in children.

98,98,36117446,"Dietary fructose and salt are associated with hypertension and renal disease. Dietary input during critical postnatal periods may impact pathophysiology in maturity. The highest consumption of fructose occurs during adolescence. We hypothesized that a diet high in fructose with or without high salt in young male Sprague Dawley rats will lead to salt-sensitive hypertension, albuminuria, and decreased renal function in maturity. Four groups were studied from age 5 weeks: 20% glucose + 0.4% salt (GCS-GCS) or 20% fructose + 4% salt throughout (FHS-FHS). Two groups received 20% fructose + 0.4% salt or 20% fructose + 4% salt for 3 weeks (Phase I) followed by 20% glucose + 0.4% salt (Phase II). In Phase III (age 13-15 weeks), these two groups were challenged with 20% glucose + 4% salt, (FCS-GHS) and (FHS-GHS), respectively. Each group fed fructose in Phase I exhibited significantly higher MAP than GCS-GCS in Phase III. Net sodium balance, unadjusted, or adjusted for caloric intake and urine flow rate, and cumulative sodium balance were positive in FHS during Phase I and were significantly higher in FCS-GHS, FHS-GHS, and FHS-FHS vs GCS-GCS during Phase III. All three groups fed fructose during Phase I displayed significantly elevated albuminuria. GFR was significantly lower in FHS-FHS vs GCS-GCS at maturity. Qualitative histology showed mesangial expansion and hypercellularity in FHS-FHS rats. Thus, fructose ingestion during a critical period in rats, analogous to human preadolescence and adolescence, results in salt-sensitive hypertension and albuminuria in maturity. Prolonged dietary fructose and salt ingestion lead to a decline in renal function with evidence suggestive of mesangial hypercellularity.

We evaluated the specific clinical and pleural fluid features of pleuropulmonary paragonimiasis masquerading as pleural tuberculosis. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and radiologic characteristics of 20 patients diagnosed with pleuropulmonary paragonimiasis between 2001 and 2011. In total, 17 patients presented with respiratory symptoms, including dyspnea (30%), hemoptysis (20%), cough (20%), and pleuritic chest pain (15%). Chest radiographs revealed intrapulmonary parenchymal lesions, including air-space consolidation (30%), nodular opacities (20%), cystic lesions (15%), ground-glass opacities (10%), and pneumothorax (5%). A pleural fluid examination revealed eosinophilia, low glucose levels, and high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in 87%, 76%, and 88% of the patients, respectively. These traits helped to distinguish pleuropulmonary paragonimiasis from other pleural diseases such as parapneumonic effusion, malignancy, and pleural tuberculosis. Pleuropulmonary paragonimiasis is often initially misdiagnosed as other pleural diseases. Therefore, it is important to establish the correct diagnosis. In patients with unexplained pleural effusion living in paragonimiasis-endemic areas, pleural fluid obtained by thoracentesis should be examined to distinguish pleuropulmonary paragonimiasis.

Through an observational, case-control study and by means of satisfied sampling, 6520 primary school children were examined for goiter, and then 193 goiterous children (case) and 151 healthy (control) children were assessed as representative samples for thyroid function tests, antiperoxidase antibody, and urinary iodine excretion. Normal values of anti-TPO Ab were <40 U/ml and high values >75 U/ml. Normal values of urinary iodine concentration were > or =10.0 microg/dl, and severe iodine deficiency were <2 microg/dl. The data were analyzed and compared by the Chi- Square tests and Mann-Whitney U in SPSS software; p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Total mean prevalence of goiter was 5.2%, ranging from 3.6 to 6.4% in different schools. The prevalence of goiter increased with age; it was 3% in children aged 6-7 yr and 6.3% in children aged 11 yr (p<0.001). Mean iodine urinary concentration was 16.36 microg/dl (+/-1.58). No difference was seen between the mean urinary iodine in girls (17.30+/-3.80 micorg/dl) and boys (15.72+/-2.72 microg/dl).

Bariatric surgery is an important treatment option for people with severe obesity. The number of surgeries performed is increasing worldwide, even in women of reproductive age, because improving fertility is a motivating factor. Nutritional intake after bariatric surgery is dependent on type of surgery, presence of symptoms, such as pain and nausea, and complications. There is also a risk of malnutrition after bariatric surgery. In particular, during pregnancy following bariatric surgery, there is a risk of protein and calorie malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies due to increased maternal and fetal demand and possibly due to reduction of food intake (nausea, vomiting).

Because of changes that occur in maternal thyroid hormone economy during pregnancy and the potential unfavorable effects of iodine deficiency on the offspring, an adequate dietary iodine intake throughout the pregnancy is highly important. Therefore, the World Health Organization, United Nations Children's Fund and International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders have proposed that dietary intake of iodine during pregnancy should be 200-300 microg/day to compensate for the augmented T4 requirements in pregnant women. It has been shown that in countries with a longstanding and well-established universal salt iodination program where iodine sufficiency has been reached, there is a fraction of pregnant women that still have low median urinary iodine concentration, which indicates insufficient dietary iodine. Studies performed in such countries emphasize that pregnant women should use multivitamin and/ or mineral tablets specifically prepared for the needs of pregnancy and containing iodine supplements.

Insulin responses in the children were directly correlated with fasting plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor I (r = 0.60 to 0.70, p less than 0.01). We conclude that glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is normally increased during puberty, a response that may compensate for puberty-induced defects in insulin sensitivity.

113,113,28975774,"The pH strip method has been proposed for use in a clinical setting for the evaluation of dental plaque pH. The aim of this in-vivo study was to compare the reliability of the pH-indicator strip method to the microelectrode technique in plaque pH measurement. 136 subjects (7-9 years) were enrolled and, for each subject, measurements of plaque pH were made at two interproximal sites; a total of 272 sites were analyzed. Plaque pH was assessed in triplicate using pH-indicator strips (pH range: 4.0-7.0) and an iridium microelectrode with a diameter of 0.1 mm. The caries status of 544 proximal surfaces between two primary molars, in proximity at the plaque pH sites, was assessed. All measurements were performed before and 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes after a mouth rinse with water solution of sucrose (10%). One-way ANOVA was performed to analyze statistically significant differences between the two techniques. Instrument reliability was measured by assessing the intraclass correlation coefficient. Comparable, not statistically significant pH values (P values range from 0.98 to 1.00) were obtained by the two methods for AUC5.7, AUC6.2, maximum pH fall and minimum pH. High intraclass coefficients were recorded (Pearson's r=0.96, Yule's Q=0.99), implying an almost perfect association when the measurements were grouped as a carious lesion being present or not on the surface near the site of measurement. The use of the pH strip method has high validity and may replace the traditional microtouch electrode technique for clinical use.

114,114,11520320,"Idiopathic epilepsies comprise a wide variety of partial and generalized syndromes that have in common a known or presumed genetic etiology and the lack of overt abnormalities other than the epilepsy itself. Most of these epilepsies have a benign natural history and/or show a favorable response to antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy, but pharmacoresistance does occur in some patients. In general, therapeutic algorithms in idiopathic partial epilepsies (IPEs) are similar to those used for symptomatic partial epilepsies, but aggressive pharmacologic therapy is rarely indicated in these patients. In self-limited conditions such as benign epilepsy of childhood with centrotemporal spikes or some forms of benign epilepsy with occipital paroxysms, AED treatment may not even be indicated unless seizures interfere significantly with quality of life. Valproate (VPA) is usually regarded as the drug of choice in idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGEs). Most patients become rapidly seizure free, and poor compliance or prescription of an inappropriate AED because of misdiagnosis are the most common causes of treatment failure in IGEs. In those patients who did not respond well to VPA (or in whom VPA is considered contraindicated), the choice of alternative AEDs is guided by syndromic diagnosis and associated possible coexistence of multiple seizure types. Lamotrigine is establishing itself as a useful agent for many refractory IGEs, and might be considered for first-line use in selected patients. Topiramate (TPM) is another promising new agent in the management of refractory tonic-clonic seizures of nonfocal onset, but its potential efficacy against other primarily generalized seizure types has not been clearly established. Some of the older drugs, particularly ethosuximide (ESM), barbiturates, and benzodiazepines (BZDs), still have an important role in the management of refractory IGEs, especially in combination with VPA. Because carbamazepine (CBZ), phenytoin (PHT), tiagabine (TGB), vigabatrin (VGB), and gabapentin (GBP) may precipitate or aggravate absence and/or myoclonic jerks, their role in IGE syndromes associated with multiple seizure types is limited mostly to adjunctive use in patients unresponsive to first-line therapy.

This was a cross-sectional study of dietary patterns and adipose tissue distribution in 74 overweight adolescents (aged: 15.4 ± 1.8 y; body mass index z score: 2.2 ± 0.4). Main outcome measures were hepatic steatosis (≥5.5% fat:water) measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and visceral obesity (visceral-to-subcutaneous adipose tissue ratio ≥0.25) measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Main exposure variables were dietary intake and habits assessed by the Harvard Youth Adolescent Food Frequency Questionnaire. Hepatic steatosis and visceral obesity were evident in 43% and 44% of the sample, respectively. Fried food consumption was more common in adolescents with hepatic steatosis than in adolescents without hepatic steatosis (41% compared with 18%; P = 0.04).

121,121,25572671,"Combustible tobacco use remains the number-one preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in the United States. Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), which include electronic cigarettes, are devices capable of delivering nicotine in an aerosolized form. ENDS use by both adults and youth has increased rapidly, and some have advocated these products could serve as harm-reduction devices and smoking cessation aids. ENDS may be beneficial if they reduce smoking rates or prevent or reduce the known adverse health effects of smoking. However, ENDS may also be harmful, particularly to youth, if they increase the likelihood that nonsmokers or former smokers will use combustible tobacco products or if they discourage smokers from quitting. The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recognize the potential ENDS have to alter patterns of tobacco use and affect the health of the public; however, definitive data are lacking. The AACR and ASCO recommend additional research on these devices, including assessing the health impacts of ENDS, understanding patterns of ENDS use, and determining what role ENDS have in cessation. Key policy recommendations include supporting federal, state, and local regulation of ENDS; requiring manufacturers to register with the US Food and Drug Administration and report all product ingredients, requiring childproof caps on ENDS liquids, and including warning labels on products and their advertisements; prohibiting youth-oriented marketing and sales; prohibiting child-friendly ENDS flavors; and prohibiting ENDS use in places where cigarette smoking is prohibited.

A recent pediatric trial suggests better preservation of ultrafiltration with bicarbonate versus lactate buffered fluid; underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Angiogenic cytokine profile, tube formation capacity and Receptor Tyrosine Kinase translocation were assessed in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells following incubation with bicarbonate (BPDF) and lactate buffered (LPDF), pH neutral PD fluid with low glucose degradation product content and lactate buffered, acidic PD fluid with high glucose degradation product content (CPDF). Peritoneal biopsies from age-, PD-vintage- and dialytic glucose exposure matched, peritonitis-free children on chronic PD underwent automated histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry. In endothelial cells angiopoietin-1 mRNA and protein abundance increased 200% upon incubation with BPDF, but decreased by 70% with LPDF as compared to medium control; angiopoietin-2 remained unchanged. Angiopoietin-1/Angiopoietin-2 protein ratio was 15 and 3-fold increased with BPDF compared to LPDF and medium. Time-lapse microscopy with automated network analysis demonstrated less endothelial cell tube formation with BPDF compared to LPDF and CPDF incubation. Receptor Tyrosine Kinase translocated to the cell membrane in BPDF but not in LPDF or CPDF incubated endothelial cells. In children dialyzed with BPDF peritoneal vessels were larger and angiopoietin-1 abundance in CD31 positive endothelium higher compared to children treated with LPDF.

The ratio of GA to HbA1c (GA/A1c ratio) was calculated, and the homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-β) was determined. Median values of C-peptide, insulin, and HOMA-β levels were significantly higher in patients with an increased eAG/fPG ratio than in those with a decreased eAG/fPG ratio.

139,139,35552989,"Several complications associated with active Cushing's disease may persist even years after complete and successful therapeutic remission of hypercortisolism. Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) shares many clinical features seen in patients with Cushing's disease, and its presence after disease remission (GHD-CR) might negatively influence and potentially worsen the systemic complications caused by previous hypercortisolism. GHD-CR is more prevalent in women, and compared to other causes of GHD, patients are younger at the onset of the pituitary disease, at diagnosis of GHD-CR and at start of GH therapy; prevalence of pituitary macroadenomas and visual abnormalities are lower, while prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, low bone mass, fractures, and worst quality of life, are higher. Serum IGF-1 levels are not useful for the diagnosis of GHD-CR and the application of GH stimulating tests requires some special attention in addition to the general recommendations for detecting GHD from other etiologies. In patients with active hypercortisolism, GH secretion is completely suppressed, but it may spontaneously and progressively recover over the years following successful therapy, meaning that GH testing may be performed at an appropriate time after remission for the correct diagnosis. Moreover, if the patient presents concomitant adrenal insufficiency, GH testing should only be carried out under adequate cortisol replacement therapy.

Recent evidence suggests sleep deprivation/fragmentation, fructose-exceedingly rich diets, and exposure to endocrine disruptors (eg, bisphenol A, BPA) as emerging additional factors involved in pathomechanisms and in the treatment resistance of obesity and its complications. Our study focuses on these factors for further preventive/therapeutic approaches in paediatric obesity. Fifty-four Italian children (cases: n = 31 overweight/obese; controls: n = 23 normal weight) were clinically/anthropometrically characterised. Parents completed questionnaires on the relation between obesogenic factors and childhood obesity. BPA was measured by gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry on early morning urine samples. Correlations between the continuous variables were analysed using Spearman rank correlation. Sleep deprivation/fragmentation, nocturnal breathing problems, and daytime sleepiness increased with increasing body mass index, correlating with the presence of clinical markers of metabolic syndrome (eg, acanthosis nigricans). Frequency of sugar-enriched drink consumption and the amount of fructose per portion and/or per week increased, paralleling the ponderal excess and all the other anthropometric parameters. In the entire sample population, free and total BPA levels increased paralleling the body mass index increase (r > 0.8), whereas the conjugate demonstrated the opposite trend.

145,145,36096405,"Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease afflicting more than 1 billion people worldwide and is increasingly being identified in younger age groups and in socioeconomically disadvantaged settings in the global south. Enteropathogen exposure and environmental enteropathy in infancy may contribute to metabolic syndrome by disrupting the metabolic profile in a way that is detectable in cardiometabolic markers later in childhood. A total of 217 subjects previously enrolled in a birth cohort in Amazonian Peru were monitored annually from ages 2 to 5 years. A total of 197 blood samples collected in later childhood were analyzed for 37 cardiometabolic biomarkers, including adipokines, apolipoproteins, cytokines, which were matched to extant early-life markers of enteropathy ascertained between birth and 2 years. Multivariate and multivariable regression models were fitted to test for associations, adjusting for confounders. Fecal and urinary markers of intestinal permeability and inflammation (myeloperoxidase, lactulose, and mannitol) measured in infancy were associated with later serum concentrations of soluble CD40-ligand, a proinflammatory cytokine correlated with adverse metabolic outcomes. Fecal myeloperoxidase was also associated with later levels of omentin-1. Enteric protozoa exposure showed stronger associations with later cardiometabolic markers than viruses, bacteria, and overall diarrheal episodes. Early-life enteropathy markers were associated with altered adipokine, apolipoprotein, and cytokine profiles later in childhood consistent with an adverse cardiometabolic disease risk profile in this cohort. Markers of intestinal permeability and inflammation measured in urine (lactulose, mannitol) and stool (myeloperoxidase, protozoal infections) during infancy may predict metabolic syndrome in adulthood.

A total of 110 children without known diabetes were analyzed. They were checked with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with other laboratory tests and their clinical data were collected. A total of 707,238 schoolchildren from a school population of 1,064,999 were screened for glucosuria. In total, over a 4-year period, 545 schoolchildren (0.077%) were positive for glucosuria on the second urine test. The prevalence of glucosuria was more common among middle and high schoolchildren than among elementary schoolchildren. Among 110 students who completed the OGTT to confirm diabetes, 40 were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM); 39 children, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and 1 child, slowly progressive insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (SPIDDM). The mean annual incidence of diabetes was 5.6 per 100,000 schoolchildren and adolescents. The subjects with diabetes diagnosed through the urine screening test showed minimal or no symptoms of diabetes. The students with diabetes were more likely to be woman and obese, and they have a higher body mass index, higher cholesterol, triglyceride, insulin, C-peptide, and fasting glucosuria values than the students with normal glucose tolerance. We identified 40 new cases of diabetes in the Korean schoolchildren with asymptomatic glucosuria on urine glucose screening.

148,148,27749021,"Obesity is a major risk factor for several conditions including atherosclerotic disease, metabolic syndrome, and upper airway dysfunction. However, the purported link between obesity and asthma has remained more difficult to define, in part due to limitations in past epidemiologic studies and the inherent challenge in accurately defining asthma in children. It is possible that obesity leads to asthma only in the presence of a mediating variable such as an obesity-related conditions such as esophageal reflux or insulin resistance. The article by Karampatakis and colleagues in this week's edition of the journal is important because it addresses the hypothesis that altered glucose metabolism/insulin resistance associates with bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), a central and objectively measured marker of asthma. They studied pre-pubertal children with and without asthma with a range of body mass indices and found for the first time in pre-pubertal asthmatic children that both insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance were more closely related to BHR than was obesity. Their work opens the way for directed mechanistic study of the effects of impaired glucose metabolism on airway development during childhood and airway responsiveness, and for the study of insulin sensitizing therapies in children to prevent lower airway disease.

Within 3 months of Dnmt1 and Arx loss, lineage tracing and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed extensive α cell conversion into progeny resembling native β cells. Physiological studies demonstrated that converted α cells acquire hallmark β cell electrophysiology and show glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In T1D patients, subsets of glucagon-expressing cells show loss of DNMT1 and ARX and produce insulin and other β cell factors, suggesting that DNMT1 and ARX maintain α cell identity in humans.

151,151,27451002,"Dietary fructose may play a role in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome (MetS). In a recently published study of obese children with MetS, we showed that isocaloric fructose restriction reduced fasting triglyceride (TG) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C). In these ancillary analyses, we tested the hypothesis that these effects were also accompanied by improved quantitative and qualitative changes in LDL and HDL subclasses and their apolipoproteins; as well as change in VLDL, particularly apoC-III. Obese children with MetS (n = 37) consumed a diet that matched self-reported macronutrient composition for nine days, with the exception that dietary fructose was reduced from 11.7 ± 4.0% to 3.8 ± 0.5% of daily calories and substituted with glucose (in starch).

Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in two patients, and impaired glucose tolerance was found in four patients, giving a prevalence of impaired glucose metabolism of 12.5% in our patient population. The significant clinical characteristics associated with the diagnosis of impaired glucose metabolism were wasting (-2.15/-0.86 SDS, p = 0.025), stunting (-2.69/-1.22 SDS, p = 0.03), higher ferritin levels (8679/4710 microg/L, p = 0.005), splenectomy (50/9.5%, p = 0.012), and lower area under curve (AUC) of insulin secretion after OGTT (40.0/77.7, p = 0.002).

155,155,35640037,"Is the cardiometabolic health of adolescents conceived through ART worse than that of their counterparts conceived without ART? The majority of cardiometabolic and vascular health parameters of adolescents conceived through ART are similar or more favourable, than those of their counterparts of similar age and conceived without ART. It has been proposed that the cardiometabolic health of offspring conceived with ART may be unfavourable compared to that of their counterparts conceived without ART. The literature pertaining to cardiometabolic health of offspring conceived after ART is contradictory, but generally suggests unfavourable cardiometabolic health parameters, such as an increase in blood pressure (BP), vascular dysfunction and adiposity, as well as unfavourable glucose and lipid profiles. With over 8 million children and adults born through ART worldwide, it is important to investigate whether these early signs of adverse cardiometabolic differences persist into adolescence and beyond. The Growing Up Healthy Study (GUHS) is a prospective cohort study that recruited 303 adolescents and young adults conceived after ART (aged 13-21 years) and born between 1991 and 2001 in Western Australia. Their health parameters, including cardiometabolic factors, were assessed and compared with counterparts from the Raine Study Generation 2 (Gen2). The 2868 Gen2 participants were born 1989-1992 and are representative of the Western Australian adolescent population. At ∼17 years of age (2013-2017), 163 GUHS participants replicated assessments previously completed by Gen2 at a similar age. Cardiometabolic parameters were compared between a total of 163 GUHS and 1457 Gen2 adolescents. Separate male (GUHS n = 81, Gen2 n = 735) and female (GUHS n = 82, Gen2 n = 722) analyses were conducted. Assessments consisted of a detailed questionnaire including health, lifestyle and demographic parameters, anthropometric assessments (height, weight, BMI, waist circumference and skinfold thickness), fasting serum biochemistry, arterial stiffness and BP (assessed using applanation tonometry). Abdominal ultrasonography was used to assess the presence and severity of hepatic steatosis, and thickness of abdominal fat compartments. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was diagnosed if there was sonographic fatty liver in the absence of significant alcohol consumption. Chi2, Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U tests, performed in SPSS V25, examined cohort differences and generalized estimating equations adjusted for the following covariates: singleton vs non-singleton pregnancy, birthweight (z-score), gestational age, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption in the past 6 months and parent cardiovascular status. Arterial stiffness measures and waist circumference were additionally adjusted for height, and female analyses were additionally adjusted for use of oral contraceptives in the preceding 6 months. In adjusted analyses, GUHS females had a lower BMI (22.1 vs 23.3 kg/m2, P = 0.014), and thinner skinfolds (triceps, subscapular, mid-abdominal; 16.9 vs 18.7 mm, P = 0.021, 13.4 vs 15.0 mm, P = 0.027, 19.7 vs 23.2 mm, P < 0.001, respectively), whereas males were not significantly different. Waist circumference was lower in GUHS adolescents (males: 78.1 vs 81.3 cm, P = 0.008, females: 76.7 vs 83.3 cm, P = 0.007). There were no significant differences between the two groups in glucose, insulin, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), alanine aminotransferase and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in both sexes. In females, serum triglycerides were lower in GUHS adolescents (1.0 vs 1.2 mmol/l, P = 0.029). GUHS males had higher serum HDL-C (1.1 vs 1.0 mmol/l, P = 0.004) and a lower TC/HDL-C ratio (3.2 vs 3.6, P = 0.036). There were no significant differences in the prevalence of NAFLD or steatosis severity scores between the cohorts in males and females. GUHS females had less subcutaneous adipose tissue (9.4 vs 17.9 mm, P < 0.001), whereas GUHS males had greater visceral adipose thickness (44.7 vs 36.3 mm, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in pre-peritoneal adipose thickness. Pulse wave velocity was lower in GUHS males (5.8 vs 6.3 m/s, P < 0.001) and heart rate corrected augmentation index was lower in GUHS females (-8.4 vs -2.7%, P = 0.048). There were no significant differences in BP or heart rate in males or females between the two groups. Despite the substantial study size and the unique study design of the ART cohort, we were unable to differentiate between different types of ART, due to the low number of ICSI cycles (e.g. IVF vs ICSI), draw definite conclusions, or relate the outcomes to the cause of infertility. Considering the differences in time points when both cohorts were studied, external factors could have changed, which could not be accounted for. Given the observational nature of this study, causation cannot be proven. Contrary to our hypothesis and previous findings focussing mainly on childhood, this study reports mostly similar or favourable cardiometabolic markers in adolescents conceived with ART compared to those conceived without ART. The greater visceral adipose thickness, particularly present in males, requires further investigation. While these findings are generally reassuring, future well-designed and appropriately powered studies are required to definitively address the issue of cardiometabolic health in ART adults.

We aimed to determine whether concurrent plasma PCB concentration was associated with markers of glucose metabolism in healthy children. Cross-sectional study of 771 healthy Danish third grade school children ages 8-10 years in the municipality of Odense were recruited in 1997 through a two-stage cluster sampling from 25 schools stratified according to location and socioeconomic character; 509 (9.7 ± 0.8 y, 53% girls) had adequate amounts available for PCB analyses. Fasting serum glucose and insulin were measured and a homeostasis assessment model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and β-cell function (HOMA-B) calculated. Plasma PCB congeners and other persistent compounds were measured and ΣPCB calculated. PCBs were present in plasma at low concentrations, median, 0.19 μg/g lipid (interquartile range, 0.12-0.31). After adjustment for putative confounding factors, the second, third, fourth, and fifth quintiles of total PCB were significantly inversely associated with serum insulin (-14.6%, -21.7%, -18.9%, -23.1%, P trend < .01), compared with the first quintile, but not with serum glucose (P = .45). HOMA-IR and HOMA-B were affected in the same direction due to the declining insulin levels with increasing PCB exposure. Similar results were found for individual PCB congeners, for βHCB (hexachlorobenzen) and pp-DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene). A strong inverse association between serum insulin and PCB exposure was found while fasting glucose remained within the expected narrow range. Our findings suggest that PCB may not exert effect through decreased peripheral insulin sensitivity, as seen in obese and low-fit children, but rather through a toxicity to β-cells. It remains to be demonstrated whether lower HOMA-B is caused by destruction of β-cell-reducing peripheral insulin resistance and thereby increase fasting glucose as previously found.

Twenty-eight patients with Dravet syndrome (age range, 1-35 years) undergoing combination therapy with VPA and STP were included in this study. We evaluated VPA and clobazam (CLB) serum concentrations before and after add-on STP. We also investigated potential factors impacting VPA metabolism during add-on STP therapy, including add-on TPM and CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms. The effect of STP on the metabolism of concomitantly administered CLB was also investigated. Add-on STP was significantly associated with the serum concentration-to-dose (CD) ratio of VPA. Two patients, who were concomitantly treated with TPM, developed severe anorexia and thrombocytopenia because of marked increases in serum VPA concentrations. Further analysis revealed that the rate of increase in the VPA CD ratio was positively correlated with TPM dose. In patients not receiving TPM, STP enhanced the rate of increase in the VPA CD ratio to a significantly greater extent in CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers than in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. Add-on STP was also associated with significant increases in CLB and N-desmethyl-CLB serum concentrations.

158,158,9892239,"A total of 85 islet cell antibody (ICA)+ or insulin autoantibody (IAA)+ relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes have been followed as part of the Seattle Family Study for a mean of 2.8 years. Of the subjects followed, 10 developed diabetes during this time period. The presence of GAD antibodies was strongly associated with the development of diabetes. In contrast, the presence of IAAs did not influence the risk of diabetes among ICA+ GAD+ subjects. When either the initial absolute acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg) or the AIR percentile, which accounts for the individual's insulin sensitivity, was below the 10th percentile of normal subjects, the risk of diabetes approached 50% at 5 years. However, impaired beta-cell function did not influence the risk of diabetes among those who were GAD+. There were 13 subjects with low AIRg and 13 subjects with two or more antibodies who had not progressed to diabetes during the course of the study. Other measurements of beta-cell function or demographic characteristics were not different in this group of nonprogressors compared with those with low AIRg who did not progress to diabetes. We conclude that ICA+ relatives with GAD antibodies or low AIRg have a high risk for development of diabetes, but among ICA+ GAD+ relatives, the addition of IAA or a single determination of AIRg does not enhance the prediction of diabetes. We suggest that prediction of diabetes risk depends on both the type and the number of antibodies present. In addition, there are a group of ICA+ relatives with low AIRg and/or multiple antibodies who have not progressed to diabetes over the course of the study.

PDGFRβ belongs to the type III receptor tyrosine kinase family and is known to be involved in tumor metastasis and angiogenesis. Here, we studied the effect and underlying mechanism of PDGFRβ on WT G401 cells. Transwell assay and wound-healing assay were used to detect the effect of PDGFRβ on G401 cells invasion and migration. Western blot and immunofluorescence were used to detect the expression of EMT-related genes. The expression of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway proteins was detected by Western blot. The relationship between PDGFRβ and aerobic glycolysis was studied by assessing the expression of glycolysis-related enzymes detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot. The activity of HK, PK, and LDH was detected by corresponding enzyme activity kits. The concentration of lactic acid and glucose was detected by Lactic Acid Assay Kit and Glucose Assay Kit-glucose oxidase method separately. To investigate the mechanism of PDGFRβ in the development of WT, the changes of glucose and lactic acid were analyzed after blocking PI3K pathway, aerobic glycolysis, or PDGFRβ. The key enzyme was screened by Western blot and glucose metabolism experiment after HK2, PKM2, and PDK1 were inhibited. The results showed that PDGFRβ promoted the EMT process by modulating aerobic glycolysis through PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in which PKM2 plays a key role. Therefore, our study of the mechanism of PDGFRβ in G401 cells provides a new target for the treatment of WT.

Glucokinase-maturity onset diabetes in young (GCK-MODY also known as MODY2) is caused by autosomal dominant gene mutation of the GCK gene; it is characterized by mild fasting hyperglycemia and small 2-h glucose increment during 75 g-oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as well as near-normal postprandial glucose variabilities. A 10-year-old girl with family history of diabetes visited her physician after being found positive for urinary glucose by school medical checkup. She received a diagnosis of diabetes based on the laboratory data: 75 g-OGTT (mild fasting hyperglycemia and small 2-h glucose increment) and factory-calibrated glucose monitoring (mild elevation of average glucose level and near-normal glycemic variability), which raised suspicion of GCK-MODY. She was then referred to our institution for genetic examination, which revealed a GCK heterozygous mutation (NM_000162: exon10: c.1324G>T: p.E442X) in the proband as well as in her mother and maternal grandmother, who had been receiving anti-diabetes medications without knowing that they had GCK-MODY specifically. GCK-MODY cases show incidence of microvascular and macrovascular diseases similar to that of normal subjects, and their glucose levels are adequately controlled without anti-diabetes drug use.

A wide range of cardiac outputs (CO) was simultaneously measured. Accuracy and trending abilities were critically evaluated. Three cats were studied under isoflurane anesthesia and 160 CO measurements were performed with 3 mL ice-cold 5 % dextrose with PATD and TPTD. The results were compared with the PCCO measurement before the bolus measurement. Cardiac output was manipulated from 32 to 224 mL/kg/min by dobutamine, dopamine, phenylephrine, medetomidine and increased concentrations of isoflurane. Bland-Altman analysis, concordance and polar plot analysis were performed to assess accuracy and trending ability. TPTD was measuring constantly higher than PATD with a mean bias of 73 mL/kg/min and limits of agreement of 34-112 mL/kg/min, a concordance rate of 94 % and a mean polar angle of -5° with radial limits of agreement (RLOA) of 33°. Concordance rate of the PCCO versus PATD was 82 % with a mean polar angle of -10° and RLOA of 46° and versus TPTD 90 % with a mean polar angle of -6° and RLOA of 46°. Both tested methods constantly overestimated simultaneous PATD measurements. The small size, low flows and the relative short catheter not reaching the abdominal aorta may explain that.

The CD groups did not vary by age, sex, disease location, or activity. Neither systemic (serum LBP) nor mucosal (fecal S100A12) inflammation differed between the CD groups. Intestinal permeability as measured by the urine L:M ratio and endotoxin exposure as measured by serum EndoCAb were increased in the GM-CSF Ab Hi group compared to the GM-CSF Ab Lo group and controls. Patients with CD with elevated GM-CSF Ab exhibit an increase in bowel permeability relative to patients with CD with lower levels of GM-CSF Ab in the absence of differences in systemic or intestinal inflammation.

We conducted case-control studies in 764 adults (from two independent samples of 289 nonobese and 485 obese individuals) and 240 overweight/obese children undergoing oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT). Early-phase insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity (the insulinogenic index and the insulin sensitivity index) and their interplay (the disposition index) were calculated. In adult subjects, glucose profiles during OGTT were significantly (P = 2 x 10(-2)) different across K121Q genotype groups and higher in QQ than KK individuals (P = 5 x 10(-2)). The insulinogenic index was significantly reduced in QQ (18.5 +/- 3.4) compared with both KK (31.6 +/- 1.0; P = 2.2 x 10(-7)) and KQ (30.5 +/- 1.5; P = 3.2 x 10(-6)) individuals.

167,167,9337443,"To review proposed mechanisms of action, clinical pharmacology, efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the antiepileptic drug (AED) topiramate. All available data from the clinical development program--published and unpublished data (provided by investigators or the RW Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute)--were analyzed, with emphasis on the results of double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Data from open-label studies provided information about long-term efficacy and tolerability. Topiramate is highly effective in the control of previously therapy-resistant partial seizures, with or without secondary generalization. In the refractory adult patient population enrolled in controlled clinical trials, seizures were reduced by 50% or more in 27-47% of patients compared with 0-18% in placebo-treated patients and by 75% or more in 9-36% of the patients compared with 0-9% of those receiving placebo. The most common adverse effects involve the central nervous system and are mild to moderate in nature. Adverse effects include somnolence, fatigue, psychomotor slowing, and concentration problems. The currently recommended dosing is lower and titration slower than schedules used in the clinical trials; this may improve the tolerability of topiramate. Topiramate has few interactions with currently available AEDs, but phenytoin concentrations increased in some patients. Topiramate can be used initially as adjunctive therapy. Plasma topiramate concentrations are reduced substantially when used with enzyme-inducing AEDs. Open-label data and a single double-blind trial suggest that topiramate monotherapy may be effective. Open-label data also indicate that topiramate may be effective in generalized seizures of nonfocal origin, including those associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The robust clinical effects of topiramate expand the therapeutic options for patients with epilepsy. Controlled clinical trials are needed to verify initial observations that topiramate may be effective against a broad spectrum of seizure types and to directly compare efficacy and tolerability with other new and standard AEDs.

Means of 2-year decayed/missing/filled surface (DMFS) increments were similar in diabetics and their controls. Over the study period, both unstimulated and stimulated salivary flow rates remained significantly lower in diabetic children compared to controls. No differences were observed in the counts of lactobacilli, mutans streptococci or yeast growth during follow-up, whereas salivary IgA, protein and glucose concentrations were higher in diabetics than in controls throughout the 2-year period. Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that children with higher 2-year DMFS increments were older at baseline and had higher salivary glucose concentrations than children with lower 2-year DMFS increments. Likewise, higher 2-year DMFS increments in diabetics versus controls were associated with greater increments in salivary glucose concentrations in diabetics. Higher increments in active caries lesions in diabetics versus controls were associated with greater increments of dental plaque and greater increments of salivary albumin.

The Restoring Insulin Secretion (RISE) Consortium implemented a hyperglycemic clamp protocol across seven centers using a combination of technical and management approaches to achieve standardization. Two-stage hyperglycemic clamps with glucose targets of 200 mg/dL and >450 mg/dL were performed utilizing a centralized spreadsheet-based algorithm that guided dextrose infusion rates using bedside plasma glucose measurements. Clamp operators received initial and repeated training with ongoing feedback based on surveillance of clamp performance. The precision and accuracy of the achieved stage-specific glucose targets were evaluated, including differences by study center. We also evaluated robustness of the method to baseline physiologic differences and on-study treatment effects. The RISE approach produced high overall precision (3%-9% variance in achieved plasma glucose from target at various times across the procedure) and accuracy (SD < 10% overall). Statistically significant but numerically small differences in achieved target glucose concentrations were observed across study centers, within the magnitude of the observed technical variability. Variation of the achieved target glucose over time in placebo-treated individuals was low (<3% variation), and the method was robust to differences in baseline physiology (youth vs. adult, IGT vs. diabetes status) and differences in physiology induced by study treatments. The RISE approach to standardization of the hyperglycemic clamp methodology across multiple study centers produced technically excellent standardization of achieved glucose concentrations.

178,178,17085944,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder characterized by dysmorphic features, obesity, hypogonadism, hypotonia and mental retardation. Obesity has been linked to insulin resistance and the latter has also been associated with premature adrenarche. Since up to date a controlled study to investigate adrenarche and its hormonal regulation was lacking in PWS, our aim was to assess whether prepubertal PWS patients develop premature adrenarche and its relationship with markers of insulin sensitivity. Fourteen prepubertal children with PWS (6 M, 8 F) and 10 non-syndromal simple obese matched controls (5 M, 5 F) participated (mean age: 7.62 +/- 1.84 years). A fasting blood sample was obtained for adrenal and ovarian androgens, sex hormone binding globulin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1, leptin, adiponectin and a lipid profile. Thereafter an oral glucose tolerance test was performed. PWS patients were smaller at birth and a higher proportion displayed premature pubarche. No differences were found in testosterone, androstenedione, sex hormone binding globulin, free androgen index, homeostatic model assessment-IR, 2-hour insulin, leptin or adiponectin levels. 17-hydroxyprogesterone and DHEAS levels however, were significantly higher in PWS. IGF-I levels were significantly lower in PWS and correlated significantly with height SDS (p < 0.05).

Purpose To compare orally administered psyllium or locust bean gum / mannitol (LBM) with tylose administered through a duodenal catheter for bowel distension in patients undergoing MRI examination of the small bowel. Material and Methods Three different methods of bowel distension prior to MRI were compared: tylose applied through a duodenal catheter and orally administered psyllium and LBM in three groups with 15 patients each. Datasets were blinded and reviewed independently by two experienced radiologists, who assessed the diagnostic value and the maximum luminal diameter. Results Tylose was superior to psyllium and LBM in the examination of the duodenum and proximal jejunum. LBM was superior to the other methods for distension of the ileum and terminal ileum. The greatest luminal diameter of the duodenum was achieved after tylose and distension of the terminal ileum was the best in patients receiving LBM. The psyllium group was inferior to the other two groups in all segments. Conclusion By using LBM as an oral method of bowel distension, many patients can avoid the unpleasant placement of a duodenal catheter without compromising the diagnostic value of the examination.

To compare the characteristics of methadone poisoning between syrup and tablet formulation as well as to discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of poisoning from the perspective of toxicity. In a retrospective cross-sectional study from 2000 to 2010, sampled data of all hospitalized methadone-overdosed patients were collected through chart review of hospital records. Concurrently, the total number of methadone sales was gathered. A total of 1426 patients with methadone poisoning had been hospitalized, including 1072 cases who consumed syrup or tablet solely. Mean ± SD milligram ingested dose of syrup and tablet were 153 ± 339 and 88 ± 274, respectively (p < 0.001). The mean time elapsed since ingestion was 9 ± 9 and 7 ± 7 h, respectively. Most of the accidental poisoning cases occurred as a result of syrup formulation, particularly by children under 12 years old after being mistaken for cough mixture or water. Conversely, exposure to methadone tablets was more common in patients with suicidal intent. There was no statistically significant difference between the rates of intubation and death between the two groups. Higher doses of methadone in the syrup form appear to exert a similar severity of poisoning and outcomes compared to lesser doses of that in the tablet form. Similarities in outcomes, despite differences in exposure history, may reflect relatively prompt transfer to hospital and adequate provision of clinical care, including supportive care and naloxone. In order to reduce the rate of poisoning, we recommend the use of child-resistant containers for dispensing syrup, reduction in methadone concentration, adding a coloring agent, special flavor, and education of patients on the safe storage of methadone in their home in order to reduce the occurrence of accidental poisonings.

Seven patients underwent unilateral anterior temporal lobectomy, one patient underwent selective amygdalohippocampectomy, and one patient underwent parieto-occipital cortical resection and anterior temporal lobectomy. PET scans were obtained at least 6 months after surgery. Eight patients became seizure-free, and one patient had fewer than three seizures per year. Four patients showed improved glucose metabolism in the formerly hypometabolic zones, which were remote to the surgical site and ipsilateral to the epileptogenic foci. Five patients, who showed bilateral temporal hypometabolism preoperatively, had contralateral temporal hypometabolism after surgery. The relative glucose uptake in four of these patients showed increased metabolism of the adjacent lobes ipsilateral to the surgical site. The lobes that showed increased glucose metabolism after surgery were mostly frontal. Hypometabolism is reversible in the ipsilateral remote area, and may be caused by inhibition via the intercortical pathway. Contralateral temporal hypometabolic zones that persist after surgery may be caused by a different mechanism, and neither indicate the presence of seizure foci nor affect the seizure outcome.

182,182,2008213,"Glucose/galactose malabsorption (GGM) is an autosomal recessive disease manifesting within the first weeks of life and characterized by a selective failure to absorb dietary glucose and galactose from the intestine. The consequent severe diarrhoea and dehydration are usually fatal unless these sugars are eliminated from the diet. Intestinal biopsies of GGM patients have revealed a specific defect in Na(+)-dependent absorption of glucose in the brush border. Normal glucose absorption is mediated by the Na+/glucose cotransporter in the brush border membrane of the intestinal epithelium. Cellular influx is driven by the transmembrane Na+ electrochemical potential gradient; thereafter the sugar moves to the blood across the basolateral membrane via the facilitated glucose carrier. We have previously cloned and sequenced a Na+/glucose cotransporter from normal human ileum and shown that this gene, SGLT1, resides on the distal q arm of chromosome 22. We have now amplified SGLT1 complementary DNA and genomic DNA from members of a family affected with GGM by the polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analysis of the amplified products has revealed a single missense mutation in SGLT1 which cosegregates with the GGM phenotype and results in a complete loss of Na(+)-dependent glucose transport in Xenopus oocytes injected with this complementary RNA.

Participants were late preterm or term at-risk infants; those randomized in 9 New Zealand centers (n = 1359) were included and followed up between January 2017 and July 2021. Infants were randomized to prophylactic 40% dextrose (n = 681) or placebo (n = 678) gel, 0.5 mL/kg, massaged into the buccal mucosa 1 hour after birth. The primary outcome of this follow-up study was neurosensory impairment at 2 years' corrected age. There were 44 secondary outcomes, including cognitive, language, and motor composite Bayley-III scores (mean [SD], 100 [15]; higher scores indicate better performance). Of eligible infants, 1197 (91%) were assessed (581 females [49%]). Neurosensory impairment was not significantly different between the dextrose and placebo gel groups (20.8% vs 18.7%; unadjusted risk difference [RD], 2.09% [95% CI, -2.43% to 6.60%]; adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 1.13 [95% CI, 0.90 to 1.41]).

The Belgian health authorities adopted a selective strategy to optimize iodine intake through the fortification of bread with iodized salt. A progressive, step-by-step increase of the iodine content of salt was chosen in order to minimize the incidence of hyperthyroidism. MOH monitors this strategy by assessing periodically the urinary iodine concentration in school-aged children and pregnant women, as well as by a yearly follow-up of TSH concentrations in all Belgian newborns. Although the implementation of this strategy was an important step, the main drawback of the current situation is the absence of a legal framework to support the strategy. The utilization of iodized salt in bread on a voluntary basis was endorsed by the bakery industry and MOH.

We found that SLC2A5, which encodes solute carrier family 2 member 5 (SLC2A5, previously termed GLUT5) that facilitates cell fructose uptake, was up-regulated in Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL (Ph+ALL). Microarray-based analyses also suggested that SLC2A5 expression was significantly down-regulated in childhood B-ALL with t(1;19) or 11q23 mutation. High SLC2A5 expression was found in patients who had disease recurrence within 3 years, early relapse, shortened complete remission duration and positive minimal residue disease (MRD) status after treatment. SLC2A5 overexpression at both the mRNA and protein level in Ph+ALL was confirmed in a validation cohort of childhood B-ALL. We also validated the correlation of SLC2A5 expression and MRD status. A mechanistic study using a human Ph+ALL cell line showed that BCR-ABL1 kinase might regulate SLC2A5 expression via MYC. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) imatinib and dasatinib repressed SLC2A5 expression and the cell uptake of fructose. Fructose protected the tumour cells from nutrition deficiency and drug-induced cell death. Overall, our findings showed that SLC2A5 was up-regulated in childhood Ph+ALL. SLC2A5 expression correlated with childhood B-ALL clinical factors, such as MRD status. Given that TKIs could inhibit SLC2A5 expression, repression of fructose utility after TKI treatment contributes to TKI-induced Ph+ALL cytotoxicity.

In study 4, plasma insulin concentration was raised to 14 +/- 2, 23 +/- 2, 38 +/- 2, 72 +/- 5, and 215 +/- 10 microU/ml. A dose-dependent insulin suppression of plasma FFA turnover/oxidation was observed. Plasma FFA concentration correlated positively with plasma FFA turnover/oxidation in basal and insulinized states. Total lipid oxidation (indirect calorimetry) was significantly higher than plasma FFA oxidation in the basal state, suggesting that intracellular lipid stores contributed to whole body lipid oxidation. Hepatic glucose production and total glucose disposal showed the expected dose-dependent suppression and stimulation, respectively, by insulin. In conclusion, insulin regulation of plasma FFA turnover/oxidation is maximally manifest at low physiological plasma insulin concentrations, and in the basal state a significant contribution to whole body lipid oxidation originates from lipid pool(s) that are different from plasma FFA.

194,194,2495730,"The oxygen consumption of human adipose tissue (AT) was determined in 53 adults, lean and obese, and in nine lean boys. The oxygen consumption was positively related to fat cell weight and negatively to age and degree of obesity. Men and women did not differ with respect to oxygen consumption of AT. The positive relationship between oxygen consumption per cell and fat cell size was also demonstrated in size-separated cells from the same donors. Expressed per cell the oxygen consumption was higher in fat cells from obese than in cells from lean subjects, but expressed per gram of tissue the opposite result was found. The oxygen consumption of the total AT organ was higher in obese than in lean subjects. The energy expenditure of AT constituted approximately 4% of the estimated 24-h energy expenditure in both groups. It is concluded that obese subjects do not maintain their obesity because of a reduced energy expenditure of the total AT (or of the total body). After a partial weight reduction in five subjects, the energy metabolism tended to change in direction toward the conditions seen in lean subjects. However, it is still an open question whether the observed energy metabolic aberrations of obese human AT are only secondary to the obese state or partly primary and thus of etiological importance.

This pilot study investigated momentary stress as a moderator in the acute associations of MVPA and ST with subsequent glucose in healthy adolescents. Participants (N=15, Mage=13.1±1.0 years, 10 girls, 5 with overweight/obesity) simultaneously wore a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), thigh-mounted accelerometer, and reported momentary stress via random ecological momentary assessments (EMA; Time T) for 7-14 days. MVPA and ST (min) were calculated for 60- and 120-minute time windows before each EMA prompt (Time T-1). Mean CGM-measured interstitial glucose (mg/dL) was calculated after each prompt (Mmin=120.0±25.4; Time T+1). Multilevel models assessed whether within-subject MVPA and ST (Time T-1) predicted mean glucose (Time T+1), with momentary stress as a moderator (Time T). There were 513 time-matched EMA reports of stress, accelerometer, and CGM data. Momentary stress moderated the effects of MVPA 60 (β=-0.22, p=.001) and 120 min (β=-0.08, p=.02) before the prompt on subsequent glucose levels. When youth spent more time in MVPA than their average and when momentary stress was higher than their average, subsequent glucose was lower. Stress did not moderate associations of ST with glucose (p>.05). Higher momentary stress may interact with higher MVPA to lower subsequent glucose in youth. Accelerometers, EMA, and CGMs can be integrated in future studies to further understand these associations in free-living environments.

197,197,30179874,"Fructose malabsorption is commonly diagnosed by the hydrogen fructose (H2) breath test. However, the mechanisms behind fructose malabsorption in humans are not well understood and the clinical relevance of this test is considered controversial. Hence, the main aim of this study is to evaluate the predictive value of the H2 breath test. Regarding exclusion criteria, the study enrolled 562 consecutive patients, enlisted to a gastroenterology clinic between 2009 and 2011 for testing malabsorption. In the final data analysis, 246 patients were included. Ecotrophologists used 3 categories to rate dietary success: complete response, partial response and no response to the diet. They also rated the occurrence of abdominal pain, diarrhoea and bloating during the H2 breath test. Ordinal regression analysis using SPSS was performed to evaluate whether H2 breath test results - measured as the maximum H2 level, the maximum increase in H2, and the area under the curve (AUC) - predicted dietary success or failure. Correlation analyses were applied to test whether symptoms of fructose malabsorption correlated with the H2 breath test measures. Finally, we evaluated whether cut-off-values of 40 or 60 parts per million (ppm) serve better than the test measure of 20 ppm to diagnose fructose malabsorption. When a fructose-free diet was administered it was found that 103 patients (41.9%) were complete responders, 116 (47.2%) were partial responders and 27 (11%) were non-responders. The H2 breath test with the 20 ppm cut-off-value, that is, the maximum H2 level, the maximum increase in H2, and the AUC did not predict dietary response (all 95% CI ns). This was also the case when using 40 or 60 ppm as cut-off-values (all 95% CI ns). Abdominal pain during the test correlated significantly with the AUC. Diarrhoea and bloating correlated significantly with the AUC, the maximum H2 level and the maximum increase in H2 (p < 0.05). The H2 breath test produced no predictive value for the fructose-free diet outcomes; its value as a predictive test is therefore questionable. However, the symptoms of fructose malabsorption correlated significantly with the H2 breath test measures, and this is an indication that there is at least a degree of validity of the H2 breath test beyond the simple detection or exclusion of fructose malabsorption.

198,198,12919152,"Although endemic goiter had been recognized in most parts of the country, there are few available data on iodine-deficiency disorders (IDDs) in Mongolia. This study aimed to characterize the current status of iodine deficiency in Ulaan Baatar, Mongolia's capital city. Cross-sectional, observational study designed and performed according to the surveillance methods for IDD prevalence recommended by WHO/UNICEF/ICCIDD. A total of 505 schoolchildren aged 9-14 years (237 girls and 268 boys) and 138 mothers and their neonatal infants were selected to clinical and biochemical examination of the thyroid in 1996 and 1999. The anthropometric measurements, thyroid volume determined by ultrasound, blood TSH and FT4 concentrations, urinary iodine concentration and iodine content of salt consumed in households. Median thyroid volumes based on age were generally higher than those in iodine-sufficient areas and comparative to those reported in mild iodine-deficiency areas. Application of the updated WHO/ICCIDD reference values in iodine-replete European schoolchildren to the Mongolian children aged 10-12 years resulted in a goiter prevalence of 43.3%. The median value of urinary iodine concentration was 152.5 micro g/l (1.20 micro mol/l) and 40.3% of children excreted iodine below 100 micro g/l. Iodized salt (> 40 ppm) was consumed in 63.1% of households and in the children using noniodized salt their urinary iodine concentration was lower than those using ionized salt. In postpartum women, median thyroid volume and urinary iodine concentration were 11.3 ml and 107 micro g/l (0.84 micro mol/l), respectively, and 46% of women excreted less than 100 micro g/l (0.79 micro mol/l) of iodine. Of their neonates, 17.8% had elevated blood TSH levels (> 5 mU/l). In a 1999 survey, the goiter prevalence and ratio of low iodine excretion in schoolchildren decreased to 29.8% and 31.3%, respectively, while median urinary iodine concentration remain unchanged (160 micro g/l; 1.26 micro mol/l). The present study clearly indicates the presence of mild iodine deficiency in Mongolia. Enlarged thyroid gland and normal iodine excretion observed in schoolchildren living in Ulaan Baatar may result from the residual effects of iodine deficiency previously and presumably still exist in the city. Slight reduction in the rate of children with enlarged thyroid and low urinary iodine excretion after the onset of national iodinization programme suggests incomplete normalization of thyroid volume in children and that the correction of iodine deficiency is now in progress in Ulaan Baatar. Further nationwide surveys together with monitoring the progress of the national programme eliminating IDD are required in suburban areas surrounding the city and also in rural areas.

On the other hand, age-associated increases in the prevalence of glucose intolerance and hypertension are also well established. The aim of this study is to clarify the influence of aging on insulin sensitivity in glucose metabolism and on renal sodium handling under hyperinsulinemia, which may relate to high blood pressure in insulin-resistant subjects. Fifty-two normotensive subjects and 61 patients with essential hypertension were evaluated in this study. The subjects of these groups were divided into young (<40 years old) and middle-elderly (> or = 40 years old): young normotensives (Y-NT, n = 22); middle-elderly normotensives (ME- NT, n = 30); young hypertensives (Y-HT, n = 9); and middle-elderly hypertensives (ME-HT, n = 52). Using the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp, insulin sensitivity was assessed as M value. Just before the start and the termination of the glucose clamp, creatinine clearance (Ccr) and urinary excretion of sodium (UNaV) were measured. In addition, renal plasma flow assessed as para-aminohippuric acid clearance was also measured at the same time in several subjects; 8 Y-NT, 8 ME-NT, 3 Y-HT, and 10 ME-HT. The M value was significantly lower in ME-NT, Y-HT, and ME-HT, compared to Y-NT, although blood sugar and immunoreactive insulin levels were similar in all four groups. In normotensive subjects, there was a significant, negative correlation between age and M value. However, this correlation was not observed in hypertensive patients. UNaV decreased in ME-NT, Y-HT, and ME-HT, but not in Y-NT under hyperinsulinemia by the glucose clamp, whereas Ccr showed no significant change in any group. In all subjects, the change of UNaV (deltaUNaV) correlated significantly and positively with the M value. Renal plasma flow significantly increased under hyperinsulinemia by the glucose clamp in only Y-HT, but not in the other groups. There was a significant, positive correlation between deltaUNaV and the change of renal plasma flow under hyperinsulinemia by the glucose clamp. These results suggested that both the impairments of the insulin sensitivity and insulin-induced vasodilation at the renal artery with aging may partially contribute to age-related elevation of blood pressure through renal sodium retention by compensating hyperinsulinemia. On the other hand, it seems reasonable to assume that these abnormalities, which can contribute to high blood pressure in essential hypertension, already may exist at lower ages in essential hypertensive patients.

201,201,37010236,"Hyperglycaemia in pregnancy (HIP) is a pregnancy complication characterized by mild to moderate hyperglycaemia that negatively impacts short- and long-term health of mother and child. However, relationships between severity and timing of pregnancy hyperglycaemia and postpartum outcomes have not been systemically investigated. We investigated the impact of hyperglycaemia developing during pregnancy (gestational diabetes mellitus, GDM) or already present pre-mating (pre-gestational diabetes mellitus, PDM) on maternal health and pregnancy outcomes. GDM and PDM were induced in C57BL/6NTac mice by combined 60% high fat diet (HF) and low dose streptozotocin (STZ). Animals were screened for PDM prior to mating, and all underwent an oral glucose tolerance test on gestational day (GD)15. Tissues were collected at GD18 or at postnatal day (PN)15. Among HFSTZ-treated dams, 34% developed PDM and 66% developed GDM, characterized by impaired glucose-induced insulin release and inadequate suppression of endogenous glucose production. No increased adiposity or overt insulin resistance was observed. Furthermore, markers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) were significantly increased in PDM at GD18 and were positively correlated with basal glucose levels at GD18 in GDM dams. By PN15, NAFLD markers were also increased in GDM dams. Only PDM affected pregnancy outcomes such as litter size. Our findings indicate that GDM and PDM, resulting in disturbances of maternal glucose homeostasis, increase the risk of postpartum NAFLD development, related to the onset and severity of pregnancy hyperglycaemia. These findings signal a need for earlier monitoring of maternal glycaemia and more rigorous follow-up of maternal health after GDM and PDM pregnancy in humans. KEY POINTS: We studied the impact of high-fat diet/streptozotocin induced hyperglycaemia in pregnancy in mice and found that this impaired glucose tolerance and insulin release. Litter size and embryo survival were compromised by pre-gestational, but not by gestational, diabetes. Despite postpartum recovery from hyperglycaemia in a majority of dams, liver disease markers were further elevated by postnatal day 15. Maternal liver disease markers were associated with the severity of hyperglycaemia at gestational day 18. The association between hyperglycaemic exposure and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease signals a need for more rigorous monitoring and follow-up of maternal glycaemia and health in diabetic pregnancy in humans.

In a subgroup of 10 cystic fibrosis patients with non-diabetic glucose tolerance both oral glucose tolerance test and clamp were performed again 48-52 months later. Following oral glucose, glycemic responses were higher in cystic fibrosis patients than in controls, whereas insulin responses were reduced significantly only in the patients with diabetic glucose tolerance. Insulin sensitivity did not differ significantly in the patient subgroups with different degrees of glucose tolerance and in controls. In the 10 patients who underwent a 4-year follow-up, insulin responses to oral glucose decreased significantly, whilst insulin sensitivity did not change substantially. Insulin sensitivity persisted unmodified even in the patients with deteriorating glucose tolerance. No correlation were observed between metabolic data and clinical status of patients. In conclusion, in cystic fibrosis subjects with fasting euglycemia and different degrees of glucose tolerance: (i) insulin sensitivity is not impaired; (ii) eventually changes of glucose tolerance over time are not associated with modifications of insulin sensitivity; (iii) insulin secretion deteriorates over time even in the patients with stable glucose tolerance; (iv) eventual deterioration of both glucose tolerance and insulin secretion is not linked to a worsening of either nutritional or clinical parameters.

204,204,30878599,"The heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein eIF2 forms a ternary complex with initiator methionyl-tRNA and recruits it to the 40S ribosomal subunit for start codon selection and thereby initiates protein synthesis. Mutations in EIF2S3, encoding the eIF2γ subunit, are associated with severe intellectual disability and microcephaly, usually as part of MEHMO syndrome. Exome sequencing of the X chromosome was performed on three related males with normal head circumferences and mild learning difficulties, hypopituitarism (GH and TSH deficiencies), and an unusual form of glucose dysregulation. In situ hybridisation on human embryonic tissue, EIF2S3-knockdown studies in a human pancreatic cell line, and yeast assays on the mutated corresponding eIF2γ protein, were performed in this study. We report a novel hemizygous EIF2S3 variant, p.Pro432Ser, in the three boys (heterozygous in their mothers). EIF2S3 expression was detectable in the developing pituitary gland and pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Cells lacking EIF2S3 had increased caspase activity/cell death. Impaired protein synthesis and relaxed start codon selection stringency was observed in mutated yeast. Our data suggest that the p.Pro432Ser mutation impairs eIF2γ function leading to a relatively mild novel phenotype compared with previous EIF2S3 mutations. Our studies support a critical role for EIF2S3 in human hypothalamo-pituitary development and function, and glucose regulation, expanding the range of phenotypes associated with EIF2S3 mutations beyond classical MEHMO syndrome. Untreated hypoglycaemia in previous cases may have contributed to their more severe neurological impairment and seizures in association with impaired EIF2S3.

In the present study we re-evaluated goitre prevalence and iodine intake 10 years after the introduction of iodised salt in an area of goitre endemia in north-eastern Sicily (Italy), and we compared these results with those obtained in previous surveys. Three centres with known moderate goitre endemia (Bronte, Nicosia, and Gagliano) and three other smaller ones with severe goitre endemia (Sperlinga, Villadoro, and Maniace) were studied. We surveyed 697 schoolchildren. Goitre prevalence was assessed by thyroid palpation and by a thyroid ultrasound scan. Iodine urinary excretion was also measured. Iodised salt consumption was 44% of total salt consumption. Goitre prevalence assessed by thyroid palpation was significantly decreased in all towns studied compared to previous surveys. However, the persistence of a mild goitre endemia was observed in some small rural centres (5.8% in Sperlinga/Villadoro, and 11.4% in Maniace). Goitre prevalence evaluated by thyroid ultrasound scan was greater than 5% in all centres of the endemic area and was always greater than that assessed by thyroid palpation. Iodine urinary excretion was above 100 microg/l in all localities studied. In conclusion, our studies indicate a progressive reduction in goitre prevalence over a period of about 30 years in schoolchildren in a well-characterised endemic area in northeastern Sicily. The decrease in goitre prevalence was associated with a significant increase in urinary iodine excretion.

This study included 40 children and adolescents with stable SCA as well as 25 healthy children; aged 6-18 years. All study subjects were evaluated for endothelial function using Doppler ultrasonography. In addition, a number of laboratory assays were performed, including reticulocyte and leukocyte counts as well as measurement of circulating levels of total bilirubin, C-reactive protein (CRP), glucose, lipoproteins and peripheral oxyhemoglobin saturation. These parameters were also compared between SCA patients who were undertaking hydroxyurea (HU) and those who were not. Flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) values were found to be reduced in SCA patients compared with those detected in healthy controls. SCA individuals with lower FMD values exhibited higher number of hospital admissions due to vaso-occlusive events. Additional analyses revealed that patients who had decreased FMD values exhibited higher odds of acute chest syndrome (ACS) episodes. A preliminary analysis with limited number of individuals failed to demonstrate significant differences in FMD values between SCA individuals who were treated with HU and those who were not. Children and adolescents with SCA exhibit impaired endothelial function. Reductions in FMD values are associated with ACS. These findings underline the potential use of FMD as screening strategy of SCA patients with severe prognosis at early stages.

However, these solid particles require an adequate medium to ease swallowing. The aim of the research was to design a universal semisolid dispersing medium for administration of minitablets and pellets. High viscosity sodium carmellose and carbomer were considered as gelling agents. The hydrogels were prepared with sucrose, glycerol, and potassium sorbate or parabens. Preliminary studies were undertaken to estimate the application properties of the gels under conditions where a medicine is administered to a child. Besides standard tests (viscosity, sedimentation) the following measurements were conducted: gel ductility, mass of the gel removed from a spoon under shaking, ability of the gels to disperse solid particles, and disintegration of minitablets in the gels. The oral hydrogels prepared either with 1.0% and 1.5% carmellose or 0.25% and 0.5% (w/w) carbomer were suitable for dispersing and delivery of minitablets or pellets. Not only viscosity but also ductility was an essential criterion in selecting the best vehicle.

Inclusion criteria were the assessment of the validity of the mannitol test. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool (QUADAS-2). Data were extracted according to a prespecified list and analysed qualitatively. A total of 27 studies (4589 individuals, age 6&ndash;85 years, cross-sectional [n = 18] and case-controlled [n = 9] study design) were included. Overall sensitivity and specificity ranged from 8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1&ndash;27) to 100% (95% CI 93&ndash;100) and 75% (95% CI 67&ndash;82) to 100% (95% CI 85&ndash;100).

Heterogeneity was high owing to differences in the populations examined and the methods used. Studies on the accuracy of the mannitol test were heterogeneous. Overall specificity was higher than sensitivity and therefore the mannitol test seems to be a suitable diagnostic tool to confirm asthma. However, the high level of heterogeneity among the included studies makes a conclusive statement on the accuracy of the mannitol test difficult and further research is needed. As bronchial provocation tests can be especially useful in patients with an intermediate probability of asthma diagnosis, further studies are needed that include subjects with asthma symptoms but intermediate probability of asthma diagnosis.

The purpose of this study is to compare the velocity of acid production between C. albicans and several Lactobacillus species at different pH levels and concentrations of glucose. Washed, pure resting-cell suspensions were obtained by culturing a total of 28 oral isolates comprising the species C. albicans, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus paracasei paracasei, Lactobacillus paracasei tolerans and Lactobacillus delbrueckii lactis. Acid production from glucose was determined at a constant pH of 7.0, 5.5, 5.0 and 4.0 by repeated titrations with NaOH in an automated pH-stat system. Acid formation rates of yeast and lactobacilli proved to be similar at both neutral and low pH, while in a moderately acidic environment C. albicans produced less acid than the lactobacilli. Ion chromatographic analysis of the cell-free medium after titration revealed pyruvate to be the predominant organic acid anion secreted by C. albicans. The proportion of organic acids to overall acid production by the yeast was below 10% at neutral conditions, in contrast to 42-66% at pH 4.0. Compared to lactobacilli, yeast required a concentration of glucose that was about 50 times higher to allow acid production at half the maximum speed. Considering the clinical data in the literature about the frequency and proportions of microorganisms present in early childhood caries lesions, the contribution of oral lactobacilli as well as C. albicans to overall microbial acid formation appears to be important.

Testicular volume rapidly increases during puberty and peaks at age 30 years. Subsequently, the volume of the testes stabilizes in a plateau-like manner until age 60 years. After age 60 years, this study shows that testicular volume decreases significantly. Testicular glucose metabolism increases until age 40 years, after which it declines gradually over time at a constant rate. Testicular volume and metabolism appear to be significantly affected by advancing age at different rates during the different stages of lifespan. The rapid increase in testicular volume and metabolism parallel the onset and progression of puberty and positively correlate with increasing age up to ages 30-40 years.

Potential studies were screened independently and in duplicate and study characteristics and outcomes extracted. When possible we conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the effect of lower sodium intake using the inverse variance method and a random effects model. We present results as mean differences or risk ratios, with 95% confidence intervals. We included 14 cohort studies and five randomised controlled trials reporting all cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, stroke, or coronary heart disease; and 37 randomised controlled trials measuring blood pressure, renal function, blood lipids, and catecholamine levels in adults. Nine controlled trials and one cohort study in children reporting on blood pressure were also included. In adults a reduction in sodium intake significantly reduced resting systolic blood pressure by 3.39 mm Hg (95% confidence interval 2.46 to 4.31) and resting diastolic blood pressure by 1.54 mm Hg (0.98 to 2.11). When sodium intake was <2 g/day versus ≥ 2 g/day, systolic blood pressure was reduced by 3.47 mm Hg (0.76 to 6.18) and diastolic blood pressure by 1.81 mm Hg (0.54 to 3.08). Decreased sodium intake had no significant adverse effect on blood lipids, catecholamine levels, or renal function in adults (P>0.05). There were insufficient randomised controlled trials to assess the effects of reduced sodium intake on mortality and morbidity. The associations in cohort studies between sodium intake and all cause mortality, incident fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease, and coronary heart disease were non-significant (P>0.05). Increased sodium intake was associated with an increased risk of stroke (risk ratio 1.24, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.43), stroke mortality (1.63, 1.27 to 2.10), and coronary heart disease mortality (1.32, 1.13 to 1.53). In children, a reduction in sodium intake significantly reduced systolic blood pressure by 0.84 mm Hg (0.25 to 1.43) and diastolic blood pressure by 0.87 mm Hg (0.14 to 1.60). High quality evidence in non-acutely ill adults shows that reduced sodium intake reduces blood pressure and has no adverse effect on blood lipids, catecholamine levels, or renal function, and moderate quality evidence in children shows that a reduction in sodium intake reduces blood pressure. Lower sodium intake is also associated with a reduced risk of stroke and fatal coronary heart disease in adults.

Materials and Methods In this noninferiority study, 66 pediatric patients undergoing clinical computed tomographic (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) enterography were randomized to receive either a flavored beverage for neutral abdominal and pelvic imaging (Breeza; Beekley Medical, Bristol, Conn) or a low-density barium sulfate suspension. Patients were blinded to the oral contrast material administered and were asked to rate taste, texture, and their perceived health state (where 0 was very bad and 10 was very good). Ingested volume of the prescribed weight-based oral contrast material preparation was recorded. Maximum small bowel diameter was measured in all four abdominal quadrants. Mean bowel diameter as well as taste, texture, and health state scores were compared between cohorts by using t tests; proportions were compared by using Fisher exact tests. Results Thirty-three patients each received Breeza and barium sulfate suspension, respectively. No difference was found in age (Breeza, 13.5 years ± 2.6 [standard deviation]; barium sulfate suspension, 13.9 years ± 2.8; P = .49), sex distribution (15 girls each; P > .99), or health state (P = .21) between cohorts. Twenty-eight of 33 (84.8%) and 17 of 33 (51.5%) patients completed the Breeza and barium sulfate suspension preparations, respectively (P = .007).

We aimed to assess and improve ID status in childbearing age women (all lactating women) and their toddlers in northern Ghana, a geographically and socioeconomically vulnerable region. We provided weekly supply of household iodized salt and community-based feeding of native Hibiscus Sabdariffaa leaves meal (HSM) prepared with iodized salt to women and their toddlers in intervention (n = 60) vs. control group (n = 60). At baseline, ID was prevalent in women (36%) and their toddlers (29%). For women, both median UIC values for intervention (57.4 ug/l) and control group (65.1 ug/l) were below the recommended UIC value of 100 ug/l with no significant differences between the two groups (p = 0.2778). At the endpoint, median UIC for the intervention group (123.6 ug/l) was significantly higher (p = 0.008) than the control group (59.7 ug/l). Our results suggest that weekly supply of iodized salt along with the feeding HSM is an effective channel for improving iodine status of economically disadvantaged groups in communities remote from coastal lands. Furthermore, our results suggest that decreased median UIC among lactating mothers does not necessarily imply lower iodine status for their breastfed toddlers. And finally, the observed median UIC<100 ug/l may point to a non-improvement in iodine status for the past decade for Ghana. There is a need to revisit, assess, and ascertain the challenges in preventing populations from attaining the intended benefits of the USI policy in Ghana.

One thousand three hundred seventy-five consecutive 12-13 year-old completed questionnaires collecting demographic data and information about the use of iodized salt and food frequency habits. Iodine concentration in urine samples (UIC) and in commercially available milk samples has been measured. The median UIC was found to be 81 μg/l (95% confidence interval (CI) 74-87); 40% of the subjects had an UIC of ≥ 100 μg/l. Iodine deficiency was prevalent in subjects living in hilly areas. Median iodine concentration in milk was 264 μg/l. Only the combined use of iodized salt plus daily milk normalized UIC, resulting into a median value of 108 μg/l. A logistic regression model confirmed independent associations between low UIC and low intake of milk, use of non-iodized salt and geographical location (P<0.0001). Only 45% of the subjects were aware of the importance of iodine. Northeast Italy is still characterized by mild iodine deficiency. An adequate iodine status was achieved only when iodized salt was combined with daily milk intake. The national iodine prophylaxis program has led to greater consumption of iodized salt and, it is now used in 60-70% of the Italian households.

Baseline and longitudinal liver and abdominal MRI were performed with an oral glucose tolerance test in 76 obese youth followed for an average of 1.9 years. Cytokeratin-18 (CK-18) was measured at baseline and follow-up as a biomarker of hepatic apoptosis. The relationship between baseline HFF and metabolic parameters and circulating levels of CK-18 at follow-up were assessed using a bivariate correlation. At baseline, 38% had hepatic steatosis based on %HFF ≥5.5% with alterations in indices of insulin sensitivity and secretion. At follow-up, BMI increased in both groups and baseline %HFF correlated strongly with the follow-up %HFF (r = 0.81, P < 0.001). Over time, markers of insulin sensitivity and 2-h glucose improved significantly in the group without fatty liver, in contrast with the persistence of the insulin resistance and associated correlates in the fatty liver group. Baseline HFF correlated with 2-h glucose (r = 0.38, P = 0.001), whole-body insulin sensitivity (r = -0.405, P = 0.001), adiponectin (r = -0.44, P < 0.001), CK-18 levels, (r = 0.63, P < 0.001), and disposition index (r = -0.272, P = 0.021) at follow-up.

'Protecting youth' was seen as a fundamental regulatory requirement which should be achieved through childproofing, age limits, no advertising aimed at children and health warnings about addictiveness of nicotine, but not the restriction of flavours. There was little support for regulating e-cigarettes as medicines or limiting the strength of nicotine liquids. In terms of public use, participants argued against a blanket ban on public vaping given perceptions of a lack of scientific evidence of harm. However, they supported the principle of autonomy, that individuals and organizations have the right to restrict vaping. Some participants suggested banning vaping in places such as schools, hospitals or around food, in line with current smoking norms. Vapers' regulatory positions were accompanied by political concerns about the use (and misuse) of scientific evidence. With regard to regulation of e-cigarettes, issues that are salient to UK vapers may include the need for youth protection, regulation as medicines, strength of e-liquids, bans on public vaping and concerns about the misuse of scientific evidence.

This may reflect an overestimation of the dose-response relation between sodium reduction (SR) and blood pressure (BP) used in mortality modeling studies. The present meta-regression analysis sought to estimate the dose-response relations between SR and BP in study groups with mean BP above or below the 75th percentile of the general population. Based on a literature search from 1 January 1946 to 11 April 2018, we identified 133 randomized controlled trials allocating healthy or hypertensive individuals to SR or usual sodium intake. Multivariable regression analyses of the mean SR versus the mean blood pressure effect adjusted for effect modifiers were performed. In study groups with mean BP above the 75th percentile [131/78 mm Hg systolic BP (SBP)/diastolic BP (DBP)], there was strong evidence of a linear dose-response relation between SR and BP. For SBP, the dose-response relation was -7.7 mm Hg/100 mmol SR (95% CI: -10.4, -5.0), and for DBP it was -3.0 mm Hg/100 mmol SR (95% CI: -4.6, -1.4).

235,235,19650789,"1. It has been argued that all major risk factors for cardiovascular disease have been identified. Yet, epidemiological studies undertaken to identify risk factors have largely focused on populations in developed nations or on the urban or relatively affluent rural populations of developing countries. Poor rural populations are seldom studied. 2. Somewhat different risk factors may operate in poor rural populations. Evidence for this is provided by the finding that, in disadvantaged rural India, the prevalence of hypertension is greater than would be expected based on established risk factors in these populations. One risk factor to be considered is a poor intrauterine environment. 3. In animals, maternal macro- and micronutrient malnutrition can lead to reduced nephron endowment. Nephron deficiency, in turn, can render blood pressure salt sensitive. The combination of nephron deficiency and excessive salt intake will predispose to hypertension. 4. Human malnutrition may have similar effects, particularly in regions of the world where malnutrition is endemic and where women are disadvantaged by existing social practices. 5. Moreover, high salt intake is endemic in many parts of Asia, including India. Therefore, we propose that maternal malnutrition (leading to reduced nephron endowment), when combined with excessive salt intake postnatally, will account, at least in part, for the unexpectedly high prevalence of hypertension in disadvantaged rural communities in India and elsewhere.

236,236,31373012,"There is a growing concern for shortage in future blood supply, caused by a predicted decrease in eligible blood donors and simultaneous increase in recipients. Cryopreservation of split red blood cell units could increase stock supply by reducing waste of rare blood. This would be particularly useful in paediatric care where very small volumes often are transfused. The aim of this study was to develop a cryopreservation protocol for split units using the closed-system automated cell processor ACP215, as such protocols are currently missing. Using a pool-and-split design, red blood cell units (N = 8) were glycerolized and frozen, either as standard volume reference units, or further divided into three smaller split units each. After thawing/deglycerolization, the supernatant of the smaller splits was reduced by additional centrifugation, and new SAGM was added to 60% haematocrit. The units were analysed for storage lesion effects up to ten days post-thawing. Haemolysis and extracellular potassium ion levels were lower in the split units than in the whole units from day three onwards. The metabolic parameters pH, ATP, glucose and lactate were also lower, though likely caused by lower additive solution pH rather than storage. Split units of red blood cells can be successfully cryopreserved using the ACP215. In addition to favourably low haemolysis and potassium, they also have higher haematocrit than corresponding whole units and enable involvement of fewer donors at repeated transfusions.

Inhaled mannitol improves mucus clearance and, when administered over 2 weeks, it improves lung function in CF (Jaques et al. Chest. 2008;133(6):1388-1396). The changes in the physical properties of sputum after a 2-week treatment with mannitol were investigated in the same subjects with CF. Sputum was collected before and at the end of the 2-week treatment period from 28 subjects with CF who participated in the double-blind crossover study. Mannitol or placebo 420 mg bid was inhaled over 2 weeks. The solids content, surface tension, contact angle, and viscoelasticity were measured. Two-week treatment with mannitol reduced the solids from 7.3% +/- 3.0% to 5.7% +/- 3.0% (P = .012), surface tension from 83.1 +/- 7.2 to 78.6 +/- 8.0 mN/m (P < .039), and contact angle from 52.4 +/- 7.7 to 47.9 +/- 7.3 degrees. There was no significant change in the viscoelastic properties of sputum (P > .1). Placebo treatment had no significant effect on the sputum properties. The change in solids content correlated with the change in both FEV(1) (r = -0.78, P = .004) and forced expiratory flow in the middle half of the FVC (r = -0.80, P = .003), and the percentage change in surface tension and contact angle correlated with the percentage change in the FEV(1) (r = -0.73, P = .012 and r = -0.63, P = .03, respectively) in these subjects. Treatment with inhaled mannitol over 2 weeks improved the hydration and surface properties of sputum in patients with CF.

Statistical model evaluation and optimization were done using D-optimal mixture design expert software. Sensory evaluation was conducted using 53 untrained panelists on two selected formulations and the control (local formulation). The study shows that with an increasing ratio of blanched soybean and boiled karkade seeds flour in the blend, a significant (p < 0.05) increase in protein, fat, energy and mineral contents, and a decrease in tannin and phytic acid contents of high mineral bioavailability except for oxalate: calcium ratio in the formulations were observed. The optimal blending ratio was 45.0% malted sorghum, 26.0% blanched soybean, and 19.0% boiled karkade seeds flour plus 10.0% premix. The gruel made from the new formula was significantly (p < 0.05) liked in terms of aroma, flavor, mouthfeel and overall acceptability than the control sample.

We leveraged a subsample of 103 mother-child pairs from Healthy Start, an ethnically diverse Colorado-based cohort. Twelve cannabinoids/metabolites of cannabis (including Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol) were measured in maternal urine collected at ~27 weeks' gestation. Fetal exposure to cannabis was dichotomized as exposed (any cannabinoid > limit of detection [LOD]) and not exposed (all cannabinoids < LOD). Fat mass and fat-free mass were measured via air displacement plethysmography at follow-up (mean age: 4.7 years). Glucose and insulin were obtained after an overnight fast. Generalized linear models estimated the associations between fetal exposure to cannabis with adiposity measures (fat mass [kg], fat-free mass [kg], adiposity [fat mass percentage], body mass index [BMI], and BMI z-scores) and metabolic measures (glucose [mg/dL], insulin [uIU/mL], and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]). Approximately 15% of the women had detectable levels of any cannabinoid, indicating fetal exposure to cannabis. Exposed offspring had higher fat mass (1.0 kg; 95% CI, 0.3-1.7), fat-free mass (1.2 kg; 95% CI, 0.4-2.0), adiposity (2.6%; 95% CI, 0.1-5.2), and fasting glucose (5.6 mg/dL; 95% CI, 0.8-10.3) compared with nonexposed offspring. No associations were found with fasting insulin (in the fully adjusted model), HOMA-IR, BMI, or BMI z-scores. We provide novel evidence to suggest an association between fetal exposure to cannabis with increased adiposity and fasting glucose in childhood, a finding that should be validated in other cohorts.

All major UK retailers operating at that moment in time (approximately ten). The salt and sugars content was collected from product packaging and the nutrition information panels. Cereals consistently surveyed across all five years (n22) showed a significant reduction in salt content of 47 % (P<0·001). Sugars content of breakfast cereals (n 15), however, did not show a significant change; 25·65 g/100 g in 1992 and 22·45 g/100 g in 2015 (P=0·170).

In the absence of L-gulono-1,4-lactone oxidoreductase, an essential enzyme for the last step of VC synthesis, VC deprivation resulted in persistent hypoglycemia and subsequent impairment of cognitive functions in female but not male mouse pups. The cognitive disorders caused by VC deprivation were largely reversed when these female pups were given glucose. VC deprivation-induced S-nitrosylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) at Cys14, which activated GSK3β and inactivated glycogen synthase to decrease glycogen synthesis and storage under the feeding condition, while VC deprivation inactivated glycogen phosphorylase to decrease glycogenolysis under the fasting condition, ultimately leading to hypoglycemia and cognitive disorders. Treatment with Nω-Nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), a specific inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, on the other hand, effectively prevented S-nitrosylation and activation of GSK3β in female pups in response to the VC deprivation and reversed hypoglycemia and cognitive disorders. Overall, this research identifies S-nitrosylation of GSK3β and subsequent GSK3β activation as a previously unknown mechanism controlling glucose homeostasis in female pups in response to VC deprivation, implying that VC supplementation in the prevention of hypoglycemia and cognitive disorders should be considered in the certain groups of people, particularly young females.

Targeted BA analysis was performed in five anatomical sites including the liver, ileum contents, portal serum, cecum contents, and feces. Metagenomic sequencing was performed to explore gut dysbiosis. Within 12 weeks, the 4% fructose diet could initially stimulate gut dysbiosis and BA upregulation in the ileum, portal serum, and cecum when the intestinal and hepatic transport system remained stable without hepatic lipid accumulation. However, the chronic consumption of fructose promoted HF-induced NAFLD, with significantly increased body weight, impaired glucose tolerance, and advanced liver steatosis. BA transporters were inhibited in HFF, causing the block of internal BA circulation and increased BA secretion via cecum contents and feces. Notably, lithocholic acid (LCA) and its taurine conjugates were elevated within the enterohepatic circulation. Meanwhile, the Clostridium species were significantly altered in both Fru and HFF groups and were closely associated with fructose and BA metabolism. In summary, excessive fructose caused gut dysbiosis and BA alterations, promoting HF-induced NAFLD.

Participants were grouped into early (<30 minutes) and late (≥30 minutes) glucose peakers. A delayed glucose peak was featured by a decline in φstatic (P < .001) in the absence of a difference in φdynamic. The prevalence of T-risk allele for TCF7L2 rs7903146 variant significantly increased in the late peak group. A lower DI was correlated with higher glucose concentration at 1 and 2 hours, whereas SI was inversely associated with 1-hour glucose. Glucose peak <30 minutes was protective toward worsening of glucose tolerance overtime (odds ratio 0.35 [0.15-0.82]; P = .015), with no subjects progressing to NGT or persisting IGT, in contrast to the 40% of progressor in those with late glucose peak. The prevalence of T-risk allele for the TCF7L2 rs7903146 prevailed in the late time-to-glucose peak group, which in turn is associated with impaired β-cell responsiveness to glucose (φ), thereby predisposing to prediabetes and diabetes in obese youths.

255,255,38474874,"Meat is commonly consumed in India; however, in comparison to Western settings, it is eaten in relatively lower quantities and with minimal processing. The association between meat intake and cardio-metabolic diseases (CMDs) and their risk factors in India is currently uncertain. We examined whether meat intake is associated with risk factors for CMDs and the measures of subclinical atherosclerosis in urbanising villages in southern India. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 6012 adults (52.3% male) participating in the Andhra Pradesh Children and Parents' Study (APCAPS), which is a large prospective, intergenerational cohort study in Southern India that began with the long-term follow-up of the Hyderabad Nutrition Trial (1987-1990). We used cross-sectional data from the third wave of data collection conducted in 2010-2012, where total meat intake was assessed using 100-item, semi-quantitative validated food frequency questionnaires (FFQ). The FFQs were validated using multiple weighed 24 h dietary recalls. The main predictor, 'total meat intake', was calculated as the sum of chicken, red meat, and fish consumption. The risk factors for CMDs [systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), fasting glucose, total cholesterol, homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and C-reactive protein] and measures of subclinical atherosclerosis [Carotid Intima-Media Thickness, Pulse Wave Velocity, and Augmentation Index] were assessed using standardised clinical procedures. Stratified by gender, the association of meat intake with the risk factors of CMDs and measures of subclinical atherosclerosis was examined using linear multilevel models with random intercept at the household level.

256,256,29198070,"Obesity in young people is one of the most serious public health problems worldwide. Moreover, the mechanisms preventing obese adolescents from losing and maintaining weight loss have been elusive. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is successful at achieving long-term weight loss in patients across all age groups, including children and adolescents. Anecdotal clinical observation as well as evidence in rodents suggests that LSG induces a shift in preference of sugary foods. However, it is not known whether this shift is due to a change in the threshold for gustatory detection of sucrose, or whether LSG induces behavioral change without affecting the gustatory threshold for sugar. The objective of this study was to determine whether adolescents who undergo LSG experience a change in their threshold for detecting sweet taste. We studied the sucrose detection threshold of 14 obese adolescents (age 15.3 ± 0.5 years, range 12-18) who underwent LSG 2 weeks before surgery and at 12 and 52 weeks after surgery. Matched non-surgical subjects were tested on two occasions 12 weeks apart to control for potential learning of the test that may have confounded the results. Seven sucrose concentrations were used and were tested in eight blocks with each block consisting of a random seven sucrose and seven water stimuli. The subjects were asked to report whether the sample contained water or not after they tasted 15 ml of the fluid for 10 s. The bodyweight of the LSG group decreased from 136.7 ± 5.4 to 109.6 ± 5.1 and 86.5 ± 4.0 kg after 12 and 52 weeks, respectively (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference after surgery in taste detection threshold of patients after LSG (p = 0.60), and no difference was observed comparing the taste detection threshold of the LSG group with the non-surgical controls (p = 0.38). LSG did not affect the taste detection threshold for sucrose, suggesting that the shift in preference for sugary foods may be due to factors other than fundamental changes in taste sensitivity.

259,259,28780627,"The rising prevalence of primary pediatric hypertension and its tracking into adult hypertension point to the importance of determining its pathogenesis to gain insights into its current and emerging management. Considering that the intricate control of BP is governed by a myriad of anatomical, molecular biological, biochemical, and physiological systems, multiple genes are likely to influence an individual's BP and susceptibility to develop hypertension. The long-term regulation of BP rests on renal and non-renal mechanisms. One renal mechanism relates to sodium transport. The impaired renal sodium handling in primary hypertension and salt sensitivity may be caused by aberrant counter-regulatory natriuretic and anti-natriuretic pathways. The sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems are examples of antinatriuretic pathways. An important counter-regulatory natriuretic pathway is afforded by the renal autocrine/paracrine dopamine system, aberrations of which are involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension, including that associated with obesity. We present updates on the complex interactions of these two systems with dietary salt intake in relation to obesity, insulin resistance, inflammation, and oxidative stress. We review how insults during pregnancy such as maternal and paternal malnutrition, glucocorticoid exposure, infection, placental insufficiency, and treatments during the neonatal period have long-lasting effects in the regulation of renal function and BP. Moreover, these effects have sex differences. There is a need for early diagnosis, frequent monitoring, and timely management due to increasing evidence of premature target organ damage. Large controlled studies are needed to evaluate the long-term consequences of the treatment of elevated BP during childhood, especially to establish the validity of the current definition and treatment of pediatric hypertension.

A probabilistic patient-level simulation Markov model estimated life-time costs and outcomes of mannitol when added to best supportive care, compared with best supportive care alone in patients aged 6 years and older. We estimated treatment-related inputs (initial change in percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume, relative reduction in severe pulmonary exacerbations, and treatment discontinuations) from two phase III trials. Longer term natural history rates of predicted forced expiratory volume decline over time and severe pulmonary exacerbation rates for best supportive care were taken from Australian CF registries. The utility value for the cystic fibrosis health state was as measured in the trials using the Health Utility Index, whereas the impact of pulmonary exacerbations and lung transplantation on utility was ascertained from the published literature. The underlying cost of managing cystic fibrosis, and the cost associated with pulmonary exacerbations and transplantations was taken from published Australian sources. The addition of inhaled mannitol to best supportive care resulted in a discounted cost per quality-adjusted life-year of AU$39,165. The result was robust with 77% of probabilistic sensitivity analysis samples below a willingness-to-pay threshold of AU$45,000/quality-adjusted life-year.

To determine 1) the time course of the decrease in insulin sensitivity in relationship to Tanner stage of genital development, and 2) how this change relates to changes in GH secretion, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), IGF-binding protein-3, and gonadal steroid secretion, we studied 58 healthy children and adolescents (34 males and 24 females; age 7-15 yr) using overnight GH sampling and frequently sampled iv glucose tolerance tests. The insulin sensitivity index (ISI) was calculated using the program MINMOD. ISI differed significantly by Tanner stage (P < 0.05, by analysis of variance) with a decrease from Tanner stage 1 to 2 (P < 0.05). IGF-I and IGF-binding protein-3 followed opposite patterns to ISI, with lower levels in Tanner stage 1 than in stages 2-5 (P < 0.05). Mean GH levels did not increase until Tanner stage 4 (P < 0.05) and then fell during Tanner stage 5. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed negative relationships among ISI, IGF-I, and body mass index. No relationship was found with GH. We conclude that the pubertal change in ISI is not necessarily associated with increased GH secretion, but is associated with increased GH peripheral effect, as indicated by the relationship between ISI and IGF-I.

This paper describes the strategies and lessons learned from a 1-year randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial among pre-adolescent children on the effects of soluble corn fiber (SCF) on bone indices (PREBONE-Kids). Participants (9-11 years old) were recruited and randomized into 4 treatment groups (600 mg calcium, 12 g SCF, 12 g SCF plus 600 mg calcium and placebo). Interventions were consumed as a fruit-flavored powdered drink for 1-year. School-based recruitment was effective due to support on study benefits from parents and teachers, peer influence and a 2-weeks study run-in for participants to assess their readiness to commit to the study protocol. Retention strategies focused on building rapport through school-based fun activities, WhatsApp messaging, providing health screening and travel reimbursements for study measurements. Compliance was enhanced by providing direct on-site school feeding and monthly non-cash rewards. Choice of 2 flavors for the intervention drinks were provided to overcome taste fatigue. Satisfaction level on the manner in which the study was conducted was obtained from a voluntary sub-set of participants. The study successfully enrolled 243 participants within 6 months and retained 82.7% of the participants at the end of 1 year, yielding a drop-out rate of 17.3%. Compliance to the intervention drink was 85% at the start and remained at 78.7% at the end of 1 year. More than 95% of the participants provided good feedback on intervention drinks, rapport building activities, communication and overall study conduct.

273,273,30714351,"Glucose Transporter Type I Deficiency Syndrome (GLUT1DS) classical symptoms are seizures, involuntary movements, and cognitive impairment but so far the literature has not devoted much attention to the last. In our retrospective study involving 25 patients with established GLUT1DS diagnosis, we describe the cognitive impairment of these patients in detail and their response to the ketogenic diet in terms of cognitive improvement. We outlined a specific cognitive profile where performance skills were more affected than verbal ones, with prominent deficiencies in visuospatial and visuomotor abilities. We demonstrated the efficacy of ketogenic diet (KD) on cognitive outcome, with particular improvement tin total and verbal IQ; we found that timing of KD introduction was inversely related to IQ outcome: the later the starting of KD, the lower the IQ, more notable nonverbal scale (verbal IQ correlation coefficient -0.634, p-value = 0.015). We found a significant direct correlation between cognition and CSF/blood glucose ratio values: the higher the ratio, the better the cognitive improvement in response to diet (from T0-baseline evaluation to T1 on average 18 months after introduction of KD-: TIQ correlation coefficient 0.592, p-value = 0.26; VIQ correlation coefficient 0.555, p-value = 0.039). Finally, we demonstrated that a longer duration of treatment is necessary to find an improvement in patients with ""severely low ratio.""

274,274,3116451,"Sixteen patients each received infusions of 1 g of mannitol per kg over 5 to 10 minutes, and serial determinations of intracranial pressure (ICP), systemic arterial blood pressure (SABP), central venous pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), hematocrit, hemoglobin, serum Na+, K+, osmolarity, and fluid balance were carried out for 4 hours. Urine output was replaced volume for volume with 5% dextrose in 0.45% NaCl solution. We tested the hypothesis that patients with high (greater than or equal to 70 torr) CPP would respond less well to mannitol by either ICP or CPP criteria than patients with low (less than 70 torr) CPP. The rationale for this hypothesis was based upon the association of low CPP with autoregulatory vasodilatation, whereas high CPP is associated with vasoconstriction. If mannitol should work by a vasoconstriction mechanism, the ICP effects should be most apparent under conditions of low CPP. Those patients with CPP greater than or equal to 70 torr responded relatively poorly to mannitol, with ICP decreasing from 25 +/- 4 to 17 +/- 5 (SE) mm Hg at 45 minutes postinfusion. Patients with CPP less than 70 responded with ICP declining from 35 +/- 5 to 13 +/- 4 mm Hg. The initial SABP was 81 +/- 5 mm Hg in the CPP less than 70 group and immediately rose to 90 +/- 7 at 15 minutes postmannitol. The SABP increase correlated with ICP (r = -0.40, P less than 0.01), but not when CPP greater than or equal to 70. SABP was significantly higher in the latter group (105 +/- 6) and increased to 107 +/- 8 postmannitol. The ICP decrease began immediately with the SABP increase. No mannitol ""rebound"" occurred in these patients. Measures of acute volume expansion all correlated with ICP (Na+, r = -0.67, P less than 0.001; hematocrit, r = -0.27, P less than 0.01; serum osmolarity, r = 0.32, P less than 0.05) when CPP less than 70 torr. None correlated with ICP when CPP greater than or equal to 70. These data suggest that mannitol infusion is at least partly dependent upon hemodynamic mechanisms that allow vasoconstriction to occur with reduction in cerebral blood volume and that little may be gained by using mannitol when CPP greater than or equal to 70 either by SABP, ICP, or CPP criteria because vasoconstriction is already nearly maximal. This mechanism is not exclusive of other potential mechanisms of action. Mannitol ""rebound"" may be a function of net dehydration, hemoconcentration, and SABP decline.

The gradual development of glucose tolerance abnormalities means that 30 to 40% of adults will be diabetic. Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes is a major challenge in the care of these patients because it is a morbidity and mortality factor at all stages of the disease. Early glucose tolerance abnormalities observed from childhood, before the stage of diabetes, are also associated with a poor pulmonary and nutritional outcome. The long asymptomatic period justifies systematic screening with an annual oral glucose tolerance test from the age of 10 years. However, this strategy does not take into account the new clinical profiles of patients with cystic fibrosis, recent pathophysiological knowledge of glucose tolerance abnormalities, and the emergence of new diagnostic tools in diabetology.

Hypoglycemia can develop if there are disorders of glucoregulatory organs resulting in imbalance of normal glucose homeostasis. Hypoglycemia presents with autonomic symptoms--hunger, palpitations, tremor, sweating--and with neuroglycopenic symptoms--confusion, drowsiness, odd behavior, speech difficulties, incoordination.

The study aim was to compare the short-term treatment response to budesonide and montelukast on airway hyperresponsiveness to mannitol challenge test and to exercise challenge test in children and adolescents with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. Patients were recruited from a paediatric asthma rehabilitation clinic located in the Swiss Alps. Individuals with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and a positive result in the exercise challenge test underwent mannitol challenge test on day 0. All subjects then received a treatment with 400 μg budesonide and bronchodilators as needed for 7 days, after which exercise- and mannitol-challenge tests were repeated (day 7). Montelukast was then added to the previous treatment and both tests were repeated again after 7 days (day 14). Of 26 children and adolescents with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, 14 had a positive exercise challenge test at baseline and were included in the intervention study. Seven of 14 (50%) also had a positive mannitol challenge test. There was a strong correlation between airway responsiveness to exercise and to mannitol at baseline (r = 0.560, p = 0.037). Treatment with budesonide and montelukast decreased airway hyperresponsiveness to exercise challenge test and to a lesser degree to mannitol challenge test.

A case-control study was conducted involving 82 pre-school aged children that were age and sex matched. Urine samples were collected for 3 consecutive days and were evaluated using urine filtration gold techniques as the gold standard method. The samples were simultaneously measured for metabolite biomarkers specifically haematuria, proteins, ketones, nitrites, glucose, bilirubin and urobilinogen using chemical reagent strips. Pearson correlation test was used to measure the relationship between S. haematobium infection and the urine metabolite biomarkers.

As in numerous other European countries, natural iodine supply is insufficient in Austria. Therefore, to reduce goiter incidence, iodization of common salt with 10 mg potassium iodide (KI) per kilogram of NaCl was made mandatory in Austria in 1963 by federal law. In 1990, the amount of iodine addition was increased to 20 mg KI per kilogram of NaCl. Our results show that mean urinary iodide excretion in the persons investigated was altogether satisfactory (males: 163.7 microg of iodine per gram of creatinine; females: 183.3 microg of iodine per gram of creatinine). Goiter prevalence was 34.3% in women and 21.3% in men. An increase in goiter occurrence with age was noted in both genders. The increase in goiter prevalence was particularly obvious in the age group older than 40, i.e., among those participants who had spent at least a certain span of their lives in an area of iodine deficiency.

Weighted analyses, conducted in 2018-2019, estimated the prevalence of e-hookah versus e-cigarette and examined comparisons among users and sociodemographics, patterns of use, and co-use of tobacco products and substances. Overall, 4.6% of adults reported ever e-hookah use; of these, more than a quarter (26.8%) reported current use. For e-cigarettes, 22.5% reported ever use with 24.8% reporting current use. Among youth, 7.7% reported ever e-hookah use versus 14.3% for e-cigarette use. Comparing e-hookah versus e-cigarette only users, the majority were young adults aged 18-24 years versus ≥25 years (60.5% vs 17.3%, p<0.0001) with the majority being female (58.8% vs 46.0%, p<0.0001).

We aim to evaluate the metabolic features and the dynamic changes of GLP-1 levels during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in children with hypothalamic obesity (HO) compared with simple obesity controls. Methods Subjects included eight patients (six females, aged 9-16 years) with hypothalamo-pituitary tumors who later developed obesity and eight controls with simple obesity matched for age, body mass index (BMI), gender and puberty. We assessed the metabolic syndrome features, fat mass, severity of hyperphagia using a standardized questionnaire, and measured glucose, insulin and GLP-1 levels during a standard 75 g OGTT. Results Age, gender distribution, pubertal status and BMI-Z scores were not significantly different. Subjects with HO had higher fasting triglycerides (TG) than controls (128 vs. 94 mg/dL; p=0.05). Four HO subjects and three controls met the criteria for the metabolic syndrome. Fasting and 120 min post-glucose load GLP-1 levels were significantly higher in HO patients than in controls (21.9 vs. 19.7 pg/mL; p=0.025, 22.1 vs. 17.7 pg/mL; p=0.012). Patients with HO had significantly higher hyperphagia scores than in simple obese controls (13 vs. 2.5; p=0.012). Conclusions Patients with HO appear to have more metabolic complications and hyperphagia than controls with simple obesity. Impaired satiety may play an important role in HO. Fasting and glucose-induced serum GLP-1 concentrations seem to be altered in HO patients and could be a part of the pathogenesis of HO.

291,291,22374642,"Mixing rapid acting insulin analogs with detemir insulin to minimize daily injections has been adopted as a common regimen, especially for some children with type 1 diabetes, despite the manufacturing company's caution against mixing these analogs in the same syringe. The effect of this practice on the pharmacodynamics (PD) of rapid-acting insulin has not been widely studied. This crossover, randomized study was undertaken to determine whether mixing aspart with detemir insulin has an adverse effect on the early glucodynamic action of rapid-acting insulin analog in humans. Eight adolescents with type 1 diabetes (age 17.3 ± 0.6 years and A1C 7.3 ± 0.3%) had two euglycemic glucose clamps during which 0.2 units/kg aspart and 0.4 units/kg detemir insulin were injected either as a separate or single mixed injection in random order. Mixing the two insulins diminished the peak and overall early aspart insulin action with significantly lower maximum glucose infusion rate (GIR(max) separate 6.1 ± 0.7 mg/kg/min vs. mix 4.5 ± 0.5 mg/kg/min; P = 0.03) values and the area under curve for GIR during the first 3 h of the insulin action study (separate 757 ± 105 mg/kg vs. mix 491 ± 66 mg/kg; P = 0.04). These data demonstrate that mixing aspart with detemir insulin markedly lowers the early PD action of aspart and prolongs its time-action profile as compared with the separate injection of these analogs. These changes in insulin PD should be weighed against the added convenience of mixing when considering such unlicensed use of these insulins in youth with type 1 diabetes.

292,292,11286505,"The persistent, dietary-independent elevation of galactose metabolites in patients with galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) deficiency is probably secondary to de novo synthesis of galactose. Relatively constant steady-state levels of galactose metabolites in patients also suggest that non-GALT metabolic pathways must function to dispose of the galactose synthesized each day. The discovery of a patient with a rare deletion of the GALT gene provided a unique opportunity to examine the availability of any alternate galactose oxidative capacity both in vivo and in vitro. Utilizing genomic DNA from the patient, Southern blot data demonstrated that 10 of the 11 GALT exons were homozygously deleted. By measurement of 13CO2 in expired air for up to 24 h after an oral bolus of [1-13C]galactose, it was demonstrated that 17% of the galactose was metabolized, a value comparable to the 3-h elimination rate in a control subject. Furthermore, lymphoblasts prepared from the patient could also convert [1-14C]galactose to 14CO2. This unique study provides the first unambiguous evidence that another pathway exists in man that can be responsible for galactose disposal. Further knowledge of this alternate galactose oxidative route and its regulation may aid in formulating new strategies for the treatment of galactosemia.

295,295,9373447,"Our previous studies demonstrated autonomic nervous system disorders and cerebral blood hypoperfusion in school refusal students with underlying emotional distress due to fear or anxiety associated with school attendance. Because severe stress is known to affect glucoregulatory metabolism, this study used the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to measure glucose metabolism in school refusal students. A three-hour OGTT was performed. In preparation for the test, students fasted overnight. After a fasting blood sample was drawn, students were given solutions containing a predetermined amount of glucose based on their body weight (1.75 g/kg to a maximum 75 g). After glucose ingestion, blood samples were drawn at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 mm to measure blood glucose (BG), immunoreactive insulin (IRI), pancreatic glucagon (IRG) and growth hormone (GH) levels. BG levels, IRI response, cumulative BG (sigma BG), cumulative IRI (sigma IRI), insulin/glucose ratio (delta IRI/delta BG), and insulinogenic index (sigma IRI/sigma BG) were then compared to previously reported normal control data. As an index of emotional difficulties, the self-rating depressive scale (SDS) was carried out. Eighty-one school refusal students (40 males and 41 females), 11-19 years of age (14.8 +/- 2.1), were studied. Their school refusal periods ranged from one month to eight years. All students were within -15 to +20% (-0.04 +/- 8.6) of ideal body weight. BG levels were determined using a glucose oxidase reaction method. Serum hormones were measured by radioimmunoassay. BG levels at all OGTT time intervals and sigma BG were significantly higher in school refusal students than the normal control data (sigma BG: 39.5 +/- 4.4 vs 33.3 +/- 3.4 mmol/l P < 0.001). Although the insulin response was abnormally low relative to the prevailing hyperglycaemia (sigma IRI/ sigma BG: subjects vs control = 232 +/- 129 vs 375 +/- 271, P < 0.01), normal beta cell secretory ability was speculated (sigma IRI: subjects vs controls = 2805 +/- 1274 vs 2523 +/- 1219 pmol/l). This suggests a relative suppression of insulin secretion. A paradoxical increase of GH was observed in 19 students after glucose ingestion. Glucoregulatory disorders observed in school refusal students may be caused by emotional distress. Multiple factors including autonomic nervous system disorders, derangement of neuropeptides in the hypothalamus, and hormonal imbalances may also affect glucoregulatory metabolism, predisposing these students to hyperglycaemia. We speculate that the glucoregulatory system compensates for decreased blood flow to the brain by increasing blood glucose concentrations, thereby providing sufficient glucose as the primary energy source used during normal brain metabolism.

297,297,8735013,"A population of 328 12-yr-old English schoolchildren, consuming their normal diets, was investigated in a cross-sectional study to determine the interactions between caries experience, oral hygiene status as gingival index (GI), dietary intake (as number of eating events per day and the number of eating events per day at which sugar-containing foodstuffs, confectionery or starch-containing foods were consumed) and salivary levels of caries-associated micro-organisms (mutants streptococci, lactobacilli and yeasts). The mean (+/- SD) decayed, missing and filled surfaces (DMFS) (excluding precavitation lesions) score was 3.05 +/- 3.85 and 5.72 +/- 5.00 (including precavitation lesions). The DMFS scores were significantly related to the salivary levels of caries-associated micro-organisms and to the number of eating events per day for total number of eating events and the number of eating events at which sugar-containing foods or confectionery were consumed. These associations were apparent in both bivariate and partial correlation coefficients with the caries-associated micro-organisms and GI controlled. The total daily intakes of food types, except for starch, were not associated with caries experience. No significant correlations were found between intake of food types and salivary levels of caries-associated micro-organisms except that the mean number of confectionery-eating events was correlated with lactobacillus levels (r = 0.136, p < 0.01). The salivary levels of mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and yeasts were significantly correlated with GI scores. These data do not indicate simple associations between dietary intake, caries and levels of caries-associated micro-organisms. Poor oral hygiene, in children consuming unrestricted diets, may influence the salivary levels of mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and yeasts irrespective of the frequency or amount of sugar consumed. Multiple regression analyses revealed that three variables--GI (probably an indicator of toothbrushing behaviour with a fluoride-containing toothpaste), salivary concentration of lactobacilli and frequency of ingestion of confectionery/sugary foods--were independently and positively related to caries experience.

298,298,23543568,"Every day children and adults throughout the world die from acute community-acquired bacterial meningitis, particularly in low-income countries. Survivors are at risk of deafness, epilepsy and neurological disabilities. Osmotic therapies have been proposed as an adjunct to improve mortality and morbidity from bacterial meningitis. The theory is that they will attract extra-vascular fluid by osmosis and thus reduce cerebral oedema by moving excess water from the brain into the blood. The intention is to thus reduce death and improve neurological outcomes. To evaluate the effects on mortality, deafness and neurological disability of osmotic therapies added to antibiotics for acute bacterial meningitis in children and adults. We searched CENTRAL 2012, Issue 11, MEDLINE (1950 to November week 3, 2012), EMBASE (1974 to November 2012), CINAHL (1981 to November 2012), LILACS (1982 to November 2012) and registers of ongoing clinical trials (April 2012). We also searched conference abstracts and contacted researchers in the field. Randomised controlled trials testing any osmotic therapy in adults or children with acute bacterial meningitis. Two review authors independently screened the search results and selected trials for inclusion. We collected data from each study for mortality, deafness, seizures and neurological disabilities. Results are presented using risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) and grouped according to whether the participants received steroids or not. Four trials were included comprising 1091 participants. All compared glycerol (a water-soluble sugar alcohol) with a control; in three trials this was a placebo, and in one a small amount of 50% dextrose. Three trials included comparators of dexamethasone alone or in combination with glycerol. As dexamethasone appeared to have no modifying effect, we aggregated results across arms where both treatment and control groups received corticosteroids and where both treatment and control groups did not.Compared to placebo, glycerol may have little or no effect on death in people with bacterial meningitis (RR 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.33, 1091 participants, four trials, low-quality evidence); or on death and neurological disability combined (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.25).Glycerol may have little or no effect on seizures during treatment for meningitis (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.30, 909 participants, three trials, low-quality evidence).Glycerol may reduce the risk of subsequent deafness (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.93, 741 participants, four trials, low-quality evidence). The only osmotic diuretic to have undergone randomised evaluation is glycerol. Data from trials to date have not demonstrated benefit on death, but it may reduce deafness.

An insulin infusion protocol (either 4 or 8 mU/min.kg from 20-25 min) was compared to the standard tolbutamide-modified (300 mg at 20 min) FSIGT in normal control subjects. SI and SG were not different for the insulin infusion- and tolbutamide-modified protocols [SI, 2.8 +/- 0.4, 3.6 +/- 0.6, and 2.5 +/- 0.5 X 10(4) min1/(microU/mL), respectively]. SI and SG were quantified in insulin-requiring newly diagnosed IDDM and in noninsulin-requiring IDDM in clinical remission with the exogenous insulin administration protocol. Both SI and SG were reduced in newly diagnosed IDDM compared to normal controls (by 64% and 40%, respectively). SI was normalized in IDDM in clinical remission despite a continued poor insulin secretory response to both glucose and tolbutamide. Although SI was normal in patients in clinical remission, SG remained reduced (by 65%) compared to that in normal controls. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that modification of the FSIGT with the exogenous administration of insulin allows for estimation of insulin sensitivity and glucose effectiveness in IDDM patients. Comparison to the standard protocol in normal subjects suggests that this results in valid measurements of insulin sensitivity and glucose effectiveness. Results of the application of this protocol in IDDM were consistent with previous observations that insulin sensitivity is reduced in poorly controlled IDDM and normalized in well controlled patients.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Adhesion G Protein-Coupled Receptor L3 (ADGRL3) gene are associated with increased susceptibility to developing ADHD worldwide. However, the effect of ADGRL3 non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) on the ADGRL3 protein function is vastly unknown. Using several bioinformatics tools to evaluate the impact of mutations, we found that nsSNPs rs35106420, rs61747658, and rs734644, previously reported to be associated and in linkage with ADHD in disparate populations from the world over, are predicted as pathogenic variants. Docking analysis of rs35106420, harbored in the ADGLR3-hormone receptor domain (HRM, a common extracellular domain of the secretin-like GPCRs family), showed that HRM interacts with the Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), part of the incretin hormones family. GIP has been linked to the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus, and our analyses suggest a potential link to ADHD. Overall, the comprehensive application of bioinformatics tools showed that functional mutations in the ADGLR3 gene disrupt the standard and wild ADGRL3 structure, most likely affecting its metabolic regulation.

303,303,10388010,"COMMENTS FOR PROFESSOR BARRIE R. CASSILETH: I have enjoyed reading the two issues of The Oncologist I've received so far. I would like to make some comments on Dr. Cassileth's article. I'm a pediatric oncologist at the National University Hospital in Singapore. Singapore is an interesting place to study people, as ours is a multi-racial country, with 75% Chinese, 16% Malays and 7% Indians, plus a significant expatriate population (Americans, British, Australians, etc.). I've been very interested in the influence of different ethnic and social backgrounds on how our patients cope with their diseases, especially families of children with cancer. We did a survey of 20 patients and found that nine of the children are given bird's nest, nine are given ginseng, and five had been given Chinese medicinal herbs. I've been doing a bit of literature search, and found that there's some evidence that Chinese medicine may help to ""boost the immune system,"" enhancing the ability of the patients to undergo conventional cancer therapy. However, most traditional Chinese medicine practitioners would recommend that these patients continue with their ""Western treatment."" I have no objection to patients availing themselves of these complementary approaches, though we do not encourage it either. We are in the unenviable situation of trying to help and give advice to our patients about things about which we know little, as there is so little hard evidence. Of all the literature I've gone through so far, I find the recent Choices in Healing by Michael Lerner (MIT Press) the most helpful. PROFESSOR CASSILETH'S RESPONSE: Dr. Quah raises a number of important issues. I share his interest in the influence of culture and ethnicity on how patients and families cope with cancer. The cultural meaning of malignant disease, in fact, has long shaped not only individual reactions, but also how societies have approached research, treatment, and communication. In the United States, for example, the word ""cancer"" literally was banned from public print until the mid-1920s [1], and only now are physicians beginning to discuss cancer with their patients in Russia [2]. The survey of 20 patients conducted by Dr. Quah represents a substantial portion of the literature on the subject of alternative therapy use for children with cancer. During the decade of laetrile popularity in the United States, a study at a major pediatric oncology center found that 17 of 106 patients (16%) received alternative therapy, although eight different types of alternative therapies were known by 50% of parents. That study was conducted in 1977-1978 [3]. An Australian study published in 1994 [4] found that approximately 46% of children had been given alternative treatments; like Dr. Quah's patients and those in the Australian study, they remained simultaneously under mainstream care. One suspects that by now, close to 100% of parents as well as adult patients could name at least eight different types of alternative cancer therapies. I concur with Dr. Quah's assessment of Choices in Healing. It differs strikingly from other publications about alternative cancer medicine, almost all of which are proponent books that extoll unproven or discredited methods and decry a government/pharmaceutical industry conspiracy to withhold cancer cures (read ""alternative, unproven methods"") from the public. A visit to the health and medicine section of any large bookstore provides an eye-opening display of books on dozens of methods promoted as cancer cures. Can Chinese medicine ""boost the immune system?"" Claims for the mechanisms by which alternatives of the past were said to work typically reflected mainstream science of the day. The most common claim across the variety of today's popular alternative cancer therapies is that they enhance immune function. Many herbal remedies, including those from China, are sold for this purpose in America. Several Chinese medicines, such as polysaccharide from a root used in traditional Chinese medicine, Six Flavor Tea and Golden Book Tea used in conjunction with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and Mylabris - dried Chinese beetle - have been studied for their utility against cancer in recent years. Because studies such as these are reported almost exclusively in Chinese journals, and because they tend to be preliminary, they are not well known in other countries. Dr. Quah's own professional home, the National University of Singapore (NUS), is one of the first medical schools in Asia to use the World Wide Web to distribute health information. NUS has the major cancer databases from the United States and many other important international databases. It intends to become a global health information hub on the Internet. Hopefully this resource will help fill in some of the information gaps. But most oncologists, like Dr. Quah, indeed are faced with trying to advise patients about therapies for which there is little hard evidence. The best guiding principles at this point are to discourage remedies that promise cancer cure or are promoted for use instead of mainstream treatment, encourage non-invasive, comforting, complementary (adjunctive) therapies such as massage, green tea and qi gong, and check medical journals and newspapers for warnings such as those issued recently for Ma Huang (ephedrine), a still-common ingredient in herbal remedies widely available through catalogs and in health food stores.

There are many recently published epidemiological studies that provide evidence that sugar consumption is associated with metabolic disease. Three recent clinical studies, which investigated the effects of consuming relevant doses of sucrose or high-fructose corn syrup along with ad libitum diets, provide evidence that consumption of these sugars increase the risk factors for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. Mechanistic studies suggest that these effects result from the rapid hepatic metabolism of fructose catalyzed by fructokinase C, which generates substrate for de novo lipogenesis and leads to increased uric acid levels. Recent clinical studies investigating the effects of consuming less sugar, via educational interventions or by substitution of sugar-sweetened beverages for noncalorically sweetened beverages, provide evidence that such strategies have beneficial effects on risk factors for metabolic disease or on BMI in children.

The global transcription regulator MgaSpn of Streptococcus pneumoniae regulates virulence genes expression by directly binding to the promoter regions, but its role in response to different environments remains unclear. In this study, we found that glucose levels could affect phosphocholine content, which was mediated by MgaSpn. MgaSpn can also alter its anti-phagocytosis ability, depending on the availability of glucose. In addition, transcriptome analysis of wild-type D39s in low and high glucose concentrations revealed that MgaSpn was also involved in the regulation of carbon metabolism inhibition (carbon catabolite repression; CCR) and translation processes, which made S. pneumoniae highly competitive in fluctuating environments.

However, development of leptin resistance has been a big obstacle, mitigating a leptin-centric treatment of obesity. Here, by using in silico drug-screening methods, we discovered that Celastrol, a pentacyclic triterpene extracted from the roots of Tripterygium Wilfordi (thunder god vine) plant, is a powerful anti-obesity agent. Celastrol suppresses food intake, blocks reduction of energy expenditure, and leads to up to 45% weight loss in hyperleptinemic diet-induced obese (DIO) mice by increasing leptin sensitivity, but it is ineffective in leptin-deficient (ob/ob) and leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) mouse models.

Plasma from most of these patients showed very high 7B2 immunoreactivity (IR-7B2) though there is a lack of knowledge concerning physiological and pathological changes in plasma IR-7B2 levels in other conditions. To assess whether or not there is any alteration in circulating IR-7B2 levels due to age, sex or any specific condition, plasma levels of IR-7B2 were measured in the fasting state in 106 healthy subjects aged 3 months to 91 years, 101 diabetics, 28 patients with hyperthyroidism. 7 patients with primary hypothyroidism, 13 patients with liver cirrhosis, 43 patients with chronic renal failure, 35 patients with cerebral vascular accident, and 26 pregnant subjects. Twenty-four cord bloods were also included. The responses of circulating IR-7B2 to oral glucose, intravenous arginine infusion, volus thyrotropin (TRH) or volus luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) injection were also evaluated. Particularly high IR-7B2 levels were found to exist in cord blood. Postnatally the concentrations decreased gradually with age to adult values (15.6 +/- 2.9pmol/liter (mean +/- SE) in 20's-60's), though plasma IR-7B2 levels again increased significantly in over 70's (37.1 +/- 3.2pmol/liter; P less than 0.01). There was no significant difference in plasma 7B2 levels in either sex. Among the pathological conditions studied, significantly high IR-7B2 levels were observed in patients with chronic renal failure (175.1 +/- 35.9pmol/liter). Some of the pregnant patients in their third trimester also showed high plasma IR-7B2 levels. A small but significant rise in plasma IR-7B2 was observed after a glucose load in control subjects and diabetics. Intravenous LH-RH exerted a rise in plasma 7B2 concentrations though arginine and TRH showed no significant effect on plasma IR-7B2 concentrations. Compared with the plasma concentrations, ten to fifty-fold high levels of IR-7B2 were observed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with cerebrovascular accidents or multiple sclerosis. These results suggested that the kidney plays a major role in 7B2 degradation and that LH-RH simulates IR-7B2 release from the pituitary gland. Whether reduced clearance or increased production was responsible for the IR-7B2 elevation in subjects under 10 years or over 70 years requires investigation. Furthermore, high levels of IR-7B2 in CSF might indicate its specific role for the central nervous system.

The present study was designed to clarify the mechanism by which ACE inhibitors affect glucose metabolism in fructose (FRU)-fed Wistar rats with hypertension, glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia. Eight-week-old male rats (n = 51) were divided into six groups. Controls were given a normal chow, while fructose-rich (55%) chow was administered to the remainder for eight weeks.

After measuring the body weight and systolic blood pressure (BP), steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) levels were determined. FRU significantly increased BP from 141 mmHg in controls to 156 mmHg. ALA with or without Hoe 140 decreased BP to 124 mmHg or 117 mmHg, respectively, but Hoe 140 alone did not affect BP. TCV-116 also decreased BP to 116 mmHg. The SSPG levels increased from 7.58 mM in controls to 8.98 mM in FRU-fed rats. This was lowered with both ALA and TCV-116. Hoe 140 alone, however, did not affect SSPG levels. Hoe 140 did not show any effects on ALA-induced improvement of SSPG. These results suggest that the improvement in glucose tolerance observed with ACE inhibitors is not due to the kinins, and angiotensin II receptor antagonists also improve insulin sensitivity.

Along with a new law, a new program for monitoring of iodine prophylaxis was implemented. Investigations of goiter and iodine intake performed in 2002, demonstrated sufficient iodine intake in Croatia with overall median of urinary iodine concentration (UIC) for schoolchildren in Croatia of 140 microg/L. In 2002, thyroid volumes (TV) measured by ultrasound in schoolchildren from all four geographic regions of Croatia were for the first time within the normal range according to ICCIDD reference values. Nowadays, Croatia is internationally recognized as iodine sufficient country. The aim of the present study was to assess current status of iodine intake in Croatia. The investigation was carried out in 2009. A total of 386 schoolchildren aged 7-10 years from all four major geographic regions of Croatia, 103 euthyroid pregnant women and 36 women of child-bearing age from Zagreb, the capital, were included in the survey.

Thyroid volumes were measured by ultrasound in schoolchildren from the capital of Zagreb (N = 101) and the village of Rude (N = 56). In the time period 2002-2009, the content of KI was analyzed in 384 salt samples from Croatian salt plants and samples of imported salt. An overall median UIC for schoolchildren in Croatia was 248 microg/L. Median UIC in pregnant women was 159 microg/L, with 50% of samples below and under 150 microg/L. Median UIC in women of child-bearing age was 136 microg/L. Thyroid volumes in schoolchildren were within the normal range according to the new reference values. Mean value of KI/kg of salt in samples from Croatian salt plants was 25.5 mg/kg and 24.9 mg/kg in samples of imported salt. A total of 72/384 (18.8%) of salt samples didn't corresponded to the Croatian law on obligatory salt iodination. Presented data indicate sufficient iodine intake of the Croatian population.

The aim was to investigate the association between FENO and AHR to mannitol in unselected individuals with possible asthma. A real-life study on patients with possible asthma referred to a specialized asthma clinic. Data on asthma history, FEV(1), FENO, atopy, smoking, treatment and AHR to mannitol were collected. In 217 unselected patients with symptoms suggestive of asthma, FENO and response to mannitol were tested. Of the 141 who underwent both tests, 32 (23%) had FENO > 25 ppb, and 58 (41%) had AHR to mannitol. A significant association between high FENO and AHR was found (p < 0.001); 26% responded to mannitol despite a normal NO, and 8% had a high FENO but no AHR. Additionally, a weak association was found between log FENO and log response to mannitol (r = 0.32, p < 0.01). The area under the ROC curve for FENO as a predictor of AHR was 0.66 (95% CI 0.6-0.8) and for mannitol for having high FENO was 0.73 (95%CI 0.6-0.9). In a large sample of patients referred to an asthma clinic, an association was found between FENO and AHR to mannitol. However, a significant proportion of asthma patients had a normal FENO despite having AHR, suggesting that in some patients, AHR to mannitol is not driven by eosinophilic airway inflammation.

322,322,25308907,"Delayed puberty and lower levels of testosterone (T) have been observed in adult obese males and some adolescent males. In adult men, enteral glucose ingestion results in acute lowering of serum testosterone levels; however, this has not been studied in adolescents. We aimed to examine the acute effect of a glucose/protein beverage on serum T concentration changes in obese peripubertal males. A second objective was to determine whether change in T concentration was related to appetite hormone levels. Twenty-three overweight and obese males aged 8-17 in pre-early (Tanner stage 1-2) and mid-late (Tanner stage 3-5) puberty were included in this cross-sectional study at the Clinical investigative unit at the Hospital for Sick Children. Participants consumed a beverage containing glucose and protein, and blood samples measuring pubertal hormones, ghrelin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) were taken over 60 min. Across pubertal stages, there was a significant decrease in T levels in adolescent boys (-18·6 ± 3·1%, P < 0·01) with no proportional differences between pre-early and mid-late puberty (P = 0·09). Decrease in T was associated with a decrease in LH (r = 0·52, P = 0·02), and fasting T was inversely correlated with fasting ghrelin (r = -0·51, P = 0·03) with no correlation with GLP-1. Intake of a mixed glucose/protein beverage acutely decreases T levels in overweight and obese peripubertal boys. A potential mechanism for this decrease may be secondary to an acute decrease in LH, but this requires further evaluation.

The investigation had a randomized cross-over design, and 10 healthy adolescents with natural fluoride content (1.06 ppm) in their drinking water participated after informed consent. After a run-in week, the subjects were served a standardized dinner of spaghetti with minced meat sauce prepared with either fluoridated salt (test arm) or non-fluoridated salt (control arm). The fluoride concentration of the test salt was 250 ppm. Samples of stimulated whole saliva was collected at baseline, directly after eating (0 min) and then after 10, 30 and 180 min. After a 1-week wash-out period, the experimental procedure was repeated with the opposite salt. Fluoride concentration in saliva was measured with a fluoride-specific electrode and the post-ingestion levels were compared with baseline using repeated-measures ANOVA. The mean baseline concentrations were 10.9 and 8.0 microg/l in the test and control arms, respectively. Immediately after the intake, the mean fluoride values increased significantly to 81.6 microg/l in the test arm and to 31.5 microg/l in the control arm (p<0.05).

The study was conducted in harmony with the published 1988 American Dental Association guidelines for studies geared toward this purpose. The study employed a double-blind, parallel-groups, multi-center two-treatment design, and involved third, fourth, and fifth grade schoolchildren from Newark, New Jersey, and from the Cidra and Lares areas of Puerto Rico. Qualifying subjects were stratified according to age and sex, and were randomly assigned to the two treatment groups, with multiple subjects in the same household all assigned to the dentifrice randomly allocated to the first among them. Caries examinations were conducted in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines for the clinical evaluation of drugs to prevent dental caries. After treatment assignment, study participants were instructed to brush their teeth at home with their assigned dentifrice at least twice daily. Brushing instructions were reinforced by the presentation of educational films and lectures at school, by semi-annual mailings to parents, and through the periodic distribution of small novelty gifts along with the dentifrice deliveries, in order to enhance the interest and enthusiasm of study participants. Post-baseline examinations were performed after 1 and after 2 yrs of product use. Two thousand four hundred seventy-nine (2,479) subjects completed this 2-yr study. For these subjects, the mean (S.D.) DFS scores at baseline were 2.77 (3.35) for the Crest group, and 2.66 (3.18) for the Colgate group. For caries increment after 1 yr, the respective means were 1.68 (2.53) and 1.70 (2.57). After 2 yrs, the mean caries increments were 3.56 (4.11) for the Crest group, and 3.56 (4.05) for the Colgate group. The analysis of the 2-yr caries increment scores support the conclusion that the anticaries efficacy associated with Colgate Great Regular Flavor Fluoride Toothpaste is equivalent to that associated with Crest Cavity Fighting Toothpaste with Fluoristat, in accordance with the procedures and standards provided by the published guidelines of the American Dental Association.

Because we previously demonstrated that intraislet somatostatin is an inhibitory regulator of basal insulin secretion in the isolated perfused human pancreas, this study was designed to determine the relative influence on the regulation of IAPP versus insulin secretion. Single-pass perfusion was performed in pancreata obtained from cadaveric organ donors with continuous perfusion of a modified Krebs media with the glucose level maintained at constant 3.9 mM. Intraislet somatostatin was immunoneutralized by the infusion of either a highly sensitive monoclonal somatostatin antibody (SAb) or its FAb fragment (SFAb). Sequential test periods separated by basal periods were performed by infusion of either of the following: glucose, SAb, SFAb, or appropriate controls. IAPP/insulin molar secretory ratio decreased by 33% in response to infusion of either SAb or the SFAb, respectively (p < 0.01), and decreased by 67% in response to glucose infusion (p < 0.01).

329,329,25740381,"The use of cardiac and hepatic T2* MRI measurements to predict the amount of iron accumulation in these organs has been studied extensively and was suggested to be used reliably. However, it may not be practical to screen other organs with MRI related to economical issues and also the prolonged imaging durations. Herein, we aimed to test the use of fasting glucose, fasting, and postprandial insulin, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (calculated as insulin (μIU/ml) × glucose (mg/dl)/22.5), and homeostasis model assessment B score (HOMA-B) (calculated as insulin (μIU/ml) × 20/glucose (mg/dl) - 3.5) to estimate the tissue iron measured with MRI. A total of 37 patients with β-thalassemia major (BTM), age 20.8 ± 6.3 years (7.1-36.8), were enrolled. MRI measurements were done concomitantly to the biochemical tests for glucose metabolism. A positive correlation between HOMA-IR and hepatic iron loading and a negative correlation between pancreatic T2* and fasting blood glucose were found. A positive correlation was found between fasting insulin levels and pancreatic R2* measures. Additionally, a correlation was detected between cardiac and pancreatic iron accumulations. In centers where T2*/R2* MRI facilities are unavailable, fasting insulin, fasting glucose, and HOMA-IR measurements may be used to predict iron overload and may urge the physician for MRI assessment in case of a deterioration in these biochemical tests. Since hepatic iron loading correlated with insulin resistance development, the insulin resistance among patients with BTM may partially be explained with decreased hepatic insulin clearance from heavily iron-loaded liver.

Data were collected through structured questionnaires, covering sociodemographic information, E-cigarette usage patterns, reasons for use, sources of acquisition, awareness of nicotine content, and perceptions of harm. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY), with significance set at p < 0.05. The study revealed a prevalence of 17.4% E-cigarette use among participants, with 12.6% using E-cigarettes exclusively and 4.8% concurrently with traditional tobacco cigarettes. Key findings included initiation as early as age eight, sustained and frequent use, and motivations including peer influence (61.4%), curiosity (31.3%), and flavored options (26.5%). Online platforms (34.9%) and shopping malls (28.9%) were the primary sources of E-cigarette acquisition. Most participants were aware of the nicotine content (84.3%) and believed E-cigarettes were harmful (86.7%). Importantly, 69.9% expressed intentions to quit, with 44.6% planning to do so within 30 days.

331,331,37949105,"Are impaired glucose tolerance (as measured by fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and fasting insulin) and cardiovascular disease risk (as measured by low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure) causally related to infertility? Genetic instruments suggest that higher fasting insulin may increase infertility in women. Observational evidence suggests a shared etiology between impaired glucose tolerance, cardiovascular risk, and fertility problems. This study included two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses, in which we used genome-wide association summary data that were publicly available for the biomarkers of impaired glucose tolerance and cardiovascular disease, and sex-specific genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of infertility conducted in the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study. There were 68 882 women (average age 30, involved in 81 682 pregnancies) and 47 474 of their male partners (average age 33, 55 744 pregnancies) who had available genotype data and who provided self-reported information on time-to-pregnancy and use of ARTs. Of couples, 12% were infertile (having tried to conceive for ≥12 months or used ARTs to conceive). We applied the inverse variance weighted method with random effects to pool data across variants and a series of sensitivity analyses to explore genetic instrument validity. (We checked the robustness of genetic instruments and the lack of unbalanced horizontal pleiotropy, and we used methods that are robust to population stratification.) Findings were corrected for multiple comparisons by the Bonferroni method (eight exposures: P-value < 0.00625). In women, increases in genetically determined fasting insulin levels were associated with greater odds of infertility (+1 log(pmol/l): odds ratio 1.60, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.18, P-value = 0.003). The results were robust in the sensitivity analyses exploring the validity of MR assumptions and the role of pleiotropy of other cardiometabolic risk factors. There was also evidence of higher glucose and glycated hemoglobin causing infertility in women, but the findings were imprecise and did not pass our P-value threshold for multiple testing. The results for lipids and blood pressure were close to the null, suggesting that these did not cause infertility. We did not know if underlying causes of infertility were in the woman, man, or both. Our analyses only involved couples who had conceived. We did not have data on circulating levels of cardiometabolic risk factors, and we opted to conduct an MR analysis using GWAS summary statistics. No sex-specific genetic instruments on cardiometabolic risk factors were available. Our results may be affected by selection and misclassification bias. Finally, the characteristics of our study sample limit the generalizability of our results to populations of non-European ancestry.

Isolated rat islets were incubated in the presence of immunoglobulin preparations from patients with insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM, NIDDM) and healthy subjects, and stimulated with D-glucose, L-arginine or tolbutamide. After incubation, the amount of insulin release from the rat islets was determined. The immunoglobulin preparations from 5 newly diagnosed IDDM patients who were positive for ICSA, and from 5 age-matched healthy subjects were examined. Even in the absence of complement or lymphocytes, immunoglobulin fractions positive for ICSA significantly inhibited low and high concentrations of glucose-stimulated insulin release compared with normal control (P less than 0.02), but had little influence on insulin release after stimulation with tolbutamide. Arginine-stimulated insulin release was almost the same in ICSA-positive immunoglobulin fractions and the control. Immunoglobulin fractions negative for ICSA either from four patients with recently diagnosed IDDM or from four newly diagnosed NIDDM patients had only negligible effect on insulin release after stimulation with glucose.

We investigated the sensitivity and specificity of mannitol to identify exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) as a manifestation of BHR; compared this with methacholine; and compared the sensitivity and specificity of mannitol and methacholine for a clinician diagnosis of asthma. 509 people (6-50 yr) were enrolled, 78% were atopic, median FEV1 92.5% predicted, and a low NAEPPII asthma score of 1.2. Subjects with symptoms of seasonal allergy were excluded. BHR to exercise was defined as a > or = 10% fall in FEV1 on at least one of two tests, to methacholine a PC20 < or = 16 mg/ml and to mannitol a 15% fall in FEV1 at < or = 635 mg or a 10% fall between doses. The clinician diagnosis of asthma was made on examination, history, skin tests, questionnaire and response to exercise but they were blind to the mannitol and methacholine results. Mannitol and methacholine were therapeutically equivalent to identify EIB, a clinician diagnosis of asthma, and prevalence of BHR. The sensitivity/specificity of mannitol to identify EIB was 59%/65% and for methacholine it was 56%/69%. The BHR was mild. Mean EIB % fall in FEV1 in subjects positive to exercise was 19%, (SD 9.2), mannitol PD15 158 (CI:129,193) mg, and methacholine PC20 2.1(CI:1.7, 2.6) mg/ml. The prevalence of BHR was the same: for exercise (43.5%), mannitol (44.8%), and methacholine (41.6%) with a test agreement between 62 & 69%. The sensitivity and specificity for a clinician diagnosis of asthma was 56%/73% for mannitol and 51%/75% for methacholine. The sensitivity increased to 73% and 72% for mannitol and methacholine when two exercise tests were positive. In this group with normal FEV1, mild symptoms, and mild BHR, the sensitivity and specificity for both mannitol and methacholine to identify EIB and a clinician diagnosis of asthma were equivalent, but lower than previously documented in well-defined populations.

The aim of this study was to measure the effects of chronic excess iodine intake on thyroid function in 6-24-month-old infants. In this cross-sectional study, infants (n=696) in eastern Nepal were studied. Spot urine samples, venous blood samples, and household salt samples were collected, and urinary iodine concentration (UIC), serum free thyroxine (fT4), thyrotropin (TSH), thyroglobulin (Tg), and titrated household salt iodine concentration (SIC) were measured. Daily iodine intake was calculated from UIC based on estimates of urine volume at this age. Median (25th-75th percentile) household SIC was 89 (70-149) ppm, while national legislation stipulates a fortification level of 50 ppm. Median UIC was 407 (312-491) μg/L; 76% of infants had a UIC >300 μg/L, suggesting iodine excess. Calculated mean iodine intake in 12-24-month-old infants was 220 μg/day, exceeding the recommended safe upper limit for iodine at this age (200 μg/day). Among the infants, 15.8% had an elevated Tg, 7.4% had subclinical hypothyroidism, but <1% had overt hypothyroidism. UIC was not a significant predictor of thyroid function, thyroid hormones, or Tg. In 6-24-month-old infants exposed to excessive iodine intake, ∼7% have subclinical hypothyroidism but <1% have overt hypothyroidism. These findings suggest the thyroid in late infancy is already able to adapt to high iodine intakes and, in most cases, maintain euthyroidism.

An SGLT1 missense mutation underlies hereditary glucose/galactose malabsorption, characterized by potentially fatal diarrhea; conversely, oral rehydration therapy exploits normal transport to alleviate life-threatening diarrhea of infectious origin. We have mapped the entire human SGLT1 Na+/glucose cotransporter gene from cosmid and lambda phage clones representing a genomic region of 112 kilobases. Transcription initiation occurred from a site 27 base pairs 3' of a TATAA sequence. All exon-flanking regions were sequenced, and the entire 112-kilobase region mapped with four restriction enzymes. SGLT1 is comprised of 15 exons (spanning 72 kilobases); a possible evolutionary origin from a six-membrane-span ancestral precursor via a gene duplication event is suggested from comparison of exons against protein secondary structure and from sequence considerations. A new missense mutation in exon 1 causing glucose/galactose malabsorption is also described. This is the first Na(+)-dependent cotransporter gene structure reported. These data facilitate the search for new glucose/galactose malabsorption-related mutations in this important gene and provide a basis for future evolutionary comparisons with other Na(+)-dependent cotransporters.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the association of circulating FFA under varying conditions with prediabetes in Latino adolescents and to determine the relative relationships of FFA and visceral adiposity to insulin sensitivity, secretion, and β-cell function. Overweight or obese, but otherwise healthy Latino adolescent males and females (n = 164, 14.2 ± 2.5 years), were recruited for assessment of prediabetes, abdominal fat, and FFA levels taken at a fasting state (FFAF), during an OGTT (FFAOGTT), and overnight (FFANOCTURNAL). Prediabetic adolescents had a higher FFAF than those with normal glucose tolerance when controlling for age, sex, pubertal status, total percent body fat, and visceral fat. FFAOGTT and FFANOCTURNAL did not differ between participants with prediabetes and those with normal glucose tolerance after adjusting for covariates. Visceral fat was independently related to insulin sensitivity and secretion in pubertal adolescents; however, in post-pubertal adolescents, FFAF and visceral fat were both independent and negatively related to β-cell function. These results support a plausible progression of the lipotoxicity theory of diabetes development during the pubertal transition.

However, potential predictors of good functional outcome post-SICH have been less studied. Patient data registered in the Safe Implementation of Treatment in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register (SITS-ISTR) from 2005 to 2021 were used. Acute ischaemic stroke patients who developed post intravenous thrombolysis SICH according to the SITS Monitoring Study definition were analyzed to identify predictors of functional outcomes. A total of 1679 patients with reported SICH were included, out of which only 2.8% achieved good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale scores of 0-2), whilst 80.9% died at 3 months. Higher baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and 24-h ΔNIHSS score were independently associated with a lower likelihood of achieving both good and excellent functional outcomes at 3 months. Baseline NIHSS and hematoma location (presence of both SICHs, defined as remote and local SICH concurrently; n = 478) were predictors of early mortality within 24 h. Independent predictors of 3-month mortality were age, baseline NIHSS, 24-h ΔNIHSS, admission serum glucose values and hematoma location (both SICHs).

341,341,8960831,"To determine the time course of changes in insulin action and secretion that occur early during the development of obesity, we studied children before the onset of puberty. The reason for choosing the prepubertal stage of development is that it is metabolically characterized by both a high sensitivity to insulin and low glucose stimulated insulin responses. Fifteen obese preadolescents (8 male/7 female, age 10 +/- 0.4 years, body mass index (BMI) 31 +/- 1.2 kg/m2 Tanner Stage I) with a duration of obesity of less than 5 years and 10 non-obese preadolescents (6 male/4 female, age 10 +/- 0.4 years, BMI 18 +/- 0.9 kg/m2) matched for gender were studied. In a cross-sectional analysis, we compared responses in obese preadolescents, with those in obese adolescents and obese adults with a longer duration of obesity. The euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp with 1-13C-glucose (Hot Ginf) and indirect calorimetry were used to quantitate insulin action and the hyperglycaemic clamp used to assess beta-cell function. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake measured at two physiological levels of hyperinsulinaemia (approximately 180 and 480 pmol) was reduced by 20 and 45% in all three groups of obese compared to non-obese subjects (p < 0.01). Defects in oxidative and non-oxidative glucose metabolism were observed in all three groups of obese subjects at the higher insulin infusion rate. The ability of insulin to inhibit lipid oxidation was impaired in all three obese groups at both levels of hyperinsulinaemia. Increases in basal and glucose-stimulated insulin levels during the hyperglycaemic clamp mirrored the reductions in glucose uptake during the insulin clamp in all obese groups. These results indicate that insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia co-exist in preadolescent children with moderate to severe obesity.

In addition, PET may be key in identifying the physiological consequences of gene mutations associated with mental retardation. The development of high spatial resolution microPET scanners for imaging of rodents provides a means for longitudinal study of transgenic mouse models of genetic disorders associated with mental retardation. In this review, we describe PET methodology, illustrate how PET can be used to delineate biochemical changes during brain development, and provide examples of how PET has been applied to study brain glucose metabolism in Rett syndrome, serotonin synthesis in autism, and GABAA receptors in Angelman's syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome. Future application of PET scanning in the study of mental retardation might include measurements of brain protein synthesis in fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis complex, two common conditions associated with mental retardation in which cellular mechanisms involve dysregulation of protein synthesis.

344,344,10036618,"Leprechaunism is the most severe form of insulin resistant diabetes and accompanied with growth retardation. Previously, we identified two mutations of insulin receptor (IR) gene in a patient with leprechaunism. In the present study, we assessed the biological actions of IGF-1 in the patient's fibroblasts and investigated short and long term effects of recombinant human IGF-1 (rhIGF-1) treatment on glucose metabolism and growth in the patient. The patient's fibroblasts had normal binding of IGF-1, normal phosphorylation of the beta-subunit of IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and normal incorporation of thymidine in response to IGF-1. The subcutaneous administration of rhIGF-1 at the single dose of 0.4 mg/kg revealed a half life of IGF-1 as short as 90 minutes, and her serum IGFBP-3 level was extremely low. She was treated with rhIGF-1 for about 6 years by both subcutaneous injection (SI) before each meal and continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSI). The administration of rhIGF-1 at the total daily dose of 1.6 mg/kg sustained serum total IGF-1 level within normal range and maintained her growth rate and HbA1c level within nearly normal ranges. Therefore, the treatment with rhIGF-1 was thought to be effective in lowering plasma glucose levels in the patient because these mutant IRs had no dominant negative effects on endogenous IGF-1 Rs. The results suggested that the treatment with a high dose of rhIGF-1 by both SI and CSI is effective for preventing the postnatal growth retardation and normalizing glucose metabolism in patients with genetic form of extremely severe insulin resistant diabetes and that IGF-1 deficient state and partial GH resistance such as the impairment of the production of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 may contribute to the growth retardation.

Insulin action was assessed by a sequential two-step (8 and 40 mU,m-2.min-1) euglycemic insulin clamp in combination with [1-13C]glucose and indirect calorimetry. Insulin secretion was determined by the hyperglycemic clamp technique (6.9 mmol/l). Magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantify visceral and subcutaneous abdominal fat depots.

New therapies for diabetic wounds are urgently needed and in-vitro or ex-vivo test systems are essential for the initial identification of new active molecules. The aim of this study is to compare in-vitro and ex-vivo test systems for their usability for early drug screening and to investigate the efficacy of a birch bark triterpene extract (TE) that has been proven ex-vivo and clinically to accelerate non-diabetic wound healing (WH), in a diabetic context. We investigated in-vitro models for diabetic WH, i.e. scratch assays with human keratinocytes from diabetic donors or cultured under hyperglycaemic conditions and a newly developed porcine ex-vivo hyperglycaemic WH model for their potential to mimic delayed diabetic WH and for the influence of TE in these test systems. We show that keratinocytes from diabetic donors often fail to exhibit significantly delayed WH. For cells under hyperglycaemic conditions significant decrease is observed but is influenced by choice of medium and presence of supplements. Also, donor age plays a role. Interestingly, hyperglycaemic effects are mainly hyperosmolaric effects in scratch assays. Ex-vivo models under hyperglycaemic conditions show a clear and substantial decrease of WH, and here both glucose and hyperosmolarity effects are involved. Finally, we provide evidence that TE is also beneficial for ex-vivo hyperglycaemic WH, resulting in significantly increased length of regenerated epidermis to 188±16% and 183±11% (SEM; p<0.05) compared to controls when using two different TE formulations. In conclusion, our results suggest that microenvironmental influences are important in WH test systems and that therefore the more complex hyperglycaemic ex-vivo model is more suitable for early drug screening.

354,354,18414066,"The black American population has a higher prevalence of salt sensitivity compared with the white American population. Dahl salt-sensitive rats, models of salt-induced hypertension, excrete protein-bound vitamin D metabolites into urine, a process that is accelerated during high salt intake. We tested the hypothesis that urinary vitamin D metabolite content and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) binding activity of black female adolescents would be greater than that of white female adolescents. Female adolescents (11-15 years old, 11 black and 10 white) were fed low (1.3 g, 56 mmol/24 hours sodium) and high salt (3.86 g, 168 mmol/24 hours sodium) diets for 3 weeks in a randomized order cross-over study design. White and black adolescents had similar mean urinary vitamin D metabolite content (low salt, black versus white: 50 +/- 10 versus 58 +/- 17 pmol/24 hours; high salt, black versus white: 47 +/- 7 versus 79 +/- 16 pmol/24 hours). Mean urinary 25-OHD binding activities of the black and white adolescents did not significantly differ. Urinary 25-OHD binding activity of 10/11 black adolescents and 7/10 white adolescents was greater at week 3 of high salt intake than at week 3 of low salt intake (r = 0.50, P = 0.002, n = 17). Plasma 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations of the white female adolescents were significantly higher than that of the black female adolescents (P < 0.001).

355,355,28736177,"Painful procedures are unavoidable in the medical care of preterm babies. The unpleasant experience during the neonatal period may contribute to hyperalgesia and poor neurodevelopment outcome later. Seeking effective interventions to reduce pain are strongly indicated for these very small premature babies. The aim of this study is to investigate if instilling breast milk (BM) or dextrose water into oral cavity can reduce the procedural pain of heel stick for preterm babies. This is a prospective study; 20 premature neonates are enrolled. Each study case received heel stick 4 times. BM, 10% dextrose water (D10W), distilled water (placebo) and nothing (control group) were given one after the other in random order to the same patient before heel stick. Premature infant pain profile (PIPP) was used to assess the pain scores. The whole process consisted of 4 sections: a baseline period for 1 min, intervention period for 1 min, heel stick period for 20 s, and recovery period for 5 min. The primary outcome is to compare the PIPP scores in the 4 groups. Totally 20 babies completed this study. Median gestational age was 32 weeks 2 days (26 weeks 4 days-35 weeks 6 days) and median birth body weight was 1596 g (766-2435 g). The median PIPP scores and interquartile range at each time period were listed in the context. There are significant differences between BM/control group at all time periods, between BM/placebo group at 30-60 s, 1-2 min, and 2-3 min, and between D10W/control group at 0-30 s, 30-60 s, 3-4 min, and 4-5 min. There are no significant differences between BM/D10W, D10W/placebo, and placebo/control groups at any time periods.

357,357,30362116,"Biocompatible peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions, including neutral pH, low glucose degradation product (GDP) solutions and icodextrin, have previously been shown to favourably influence some patient-level outcomes, albeit based on generally sub-optimal quality studies. Several additional randomised controlled trials (RCT) evaluating biocompatible solutions in PD patients have been published recently. This is an update of a review first published in 2014. This review aimed to look at the benefits and harms of biocompatible PD solutions in comparison to standard PD solutions in patients receiving PD. The Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register was searched up to 12 February 2018 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Specialised Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. All RCTs and quasi-RCTs in adults and children comparing the effects of biocompatible PD solutions (neutral pH, lactate-buffered, low GDP; neutral pH, bicarbonate(± lactate)-buffered, low GDP; glucose polymer (icodextrin)) in PD were included. Studies of amino acid-based solutions were excluded. Two authors extracted data on study quality and outcomes. Summary effect estimates were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for categorical variables, and mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% CI for continuous variables. This review update included 42 eligible studies (3262 participants), including six new studies (543 participants). Overall, 29 studies (1971 participants) compared neutral pH, low GDP PD solution with conventional PD solution, and 13 studies (1291 participants) compared icodextrin with conventional PD solution. Risk of bias was assessed as high for sequence generation in three studies, allocation concealment in three studies, attrition bias in 21 studies, and selective outcome reporting bias in 16 studies.Neutral pH, low GDP versus conventional glucose PD solutionUse of neutral pH, low GDP PD solutions improved residual renal function (RRF) preservation (15 studies, 835 participants: SMD 0.19, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.33; high certainty evidence). This approximated to a mean difference in glomerular filtration rate of 0.54 mL/min/1.73 m This updated review strengthens evidence that neutral pH, low GDP PD solution improves RRF and urine volume preservation with high certainty. These effects may be related to increased peritoneal solute transport and reduced peritoneal ultrafiltration, although the evidence for these outcomes is of low certainty due to significant heterogeneity and suboptimal methodological quality. Icodextrin prescription increased peritoneal ultrafiltration and mitigated uncontrolled fluid overload with moderate certainty. The effects of either neutral pH, low GDP solution or icodextrin on peritonitis, technique survival and patient survival remain uncertain and require further high quality, adequately powered RCTs.

Twenty-one patients with malignant brain tumors were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 16 patients treated by operation, irradiation, and two or more courses of intracarotid infusion of ACNU 100 mg/body (1.7-2.2 mg/kg) following 20% mannitol 200 ml (1.3-1.6 ml/sec) (7 grade 4 astrocytomas, 5 grade 3 astrocytomas, and 4 others). Group 2 consisted of five patients treated by operation, irradiation, and repeated intracarotid infusion of ACNU 100 mg/body alone (grade 4 astrocytoma). The 2-year survival rate in Group 1 was 79% (11 of 14 cases followed up for longer than 2 years) and the 3-year survival rate was 67%. Five of seven grade 4 astrocytoma patients (71%) in Group 1 survived for more than 1 year 6 months, whereas four of five grade 4 astrocytoma in Group 2 died within 1 year 6 months. The measurement of the ACNU concentration in tumor tissues and blood in 11 brain tumors, after intracarotid infusion of ACNU with blood-brain barrier disruption, showed peak values in the tumor tissues of 3.02-32.53 micrograms/gm (mean, 9.67 micrograms/gm), about three to five times as high as that in blood in most cases.

The aim was to describe daily snack food intake (frequency and total energy) and the associations with overconsumed nutrients (added sugars, sodium, and saturated fats) and child weight-for-length z scores. A cross-sectional, secondary analysis of baseline data from an ongoing longitudinal intervention was conducted. A sample of 141 caregivers with infants (aged 9 to 11 months) and toddlers (aged 12 to 15 months) was recruited in Buffalo, NY, between 2017 and 2019. Three 24-hour dietary recalls were used to categorize 'sweet and salty snack foods' or 'commercial baby snack foods' based on the US Department of Agriculture What We Eat in America food group classifications and estimate nutrient intakes. Child recumbent length and weight were measured by trained researchers. Daily frequency (times/day), energy (kcal/day), and overconsumed nutrients from snack food intake were calculated. Multivariable regression models examined associations between the frequency of and energy from snack food intake with overconsumed nutrients and child weight-for-length z scores. Infants consumed snack foods on average 1.2 times/day contributing 5.6% of total daily energy, 19.6% of added sugars, and 6.8% of sodium. Toddlers consumed snack foods on average 1.4 times/day contributing 8.9% of total daily energy, 40.0% of added sugars, and 7.2% of sodium. In adjusted models including all children, greater frequency of sweet and salty snack food intake, but not commercial baby snack foods, was associated with higher weight-for-length z scores. Snack foods are frequently consumed by infants and toddlers and contribute to the intake of overconsumed nutrients such as added sugars and sodium. Given the current guidelines to avoid added sugars and higher sodium before age 2 years, additional recommendations related to nutrient-dense snack intake may be beneficial.

361,361,25621504,"The objective of this study was to develop a new method named the ""one-week salt estimation method"" that could estimate an individual's salt intake and the sources of salt in the diet, and to evaluate this new method with a 24-h urine collection. The new method estimates salt intake from: (1) household cooking by weighing the family salt container and other high-salt condiments or sauces at the beginning and end of a week; (2) processed food according to established China food composition figures; and (3) cafeteria or restaurant meals using the results of previous studies. Consumption of salt additives and major salt contained foods and salt intake related eating habits were collected using a structured simple seven-day questionnaire. In order to validate the method, we studied 37 individuals from 11 families using the new method and 26 of these participants collected seven concurrent 24-h urine samples. The average salt intake for the 26 participants was 15.6±5.5 g/person/day (mean±standard deviation) by the 24-h urine collection and 13.7±6.5 g/person/day by the new method. The difference was 1.8±4.2 g/day/person (p=0.037). The Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.762 (p<0.001) and the partial correlation coefficient was 0.771 (p<0.001) when adjusted for family code. Bland-Altman Plot showed the average of the difference between the two methods was -1.83, with 95% limits of -10.1 to 6.5 g/person/day. The new method showed that 43.7% of salt intake came from household cooking (33.5% from cooking salt, 10.2% from other condiments and sauces), 12.9% from processed food, and 43.4% from eating out. In conclusion, despite its limitations of underestimating salt intake, the ""one-week salt estimation method"" is easier for people to implement and is likely to provide useful information that highlights the excessively high intake of salt and its sources, and in turn is helpful in guiding dietary salt reduction.

366,366,25446695,"Screening for gestational diabetes mellitus commonly uses an oral glucose challenge test with a 50-g glucola beverage and subsequent venous puncture. However, up to 30% of pregnant women report significant side-effects, and the beverage is costly. We hypothesized that equivalent glucose loads could be achieved from a popular candy twist (Twizzlers; The Hershey Company, Hershey, PA) and tested it as cost-effective, tolerable alternative with a test of equivalency. The glucose equivalent of the 50-g glucola was calculated as 10 candy twists. We initially used a triple crossover design in nonpregnant patients whereby each subject served as her own control; this ensured the safety and equivalency of this load before using it among pregnant subjects. We then recruited pregnant women with an abnormal screening at 1 hour (glucose challenge test) in a double crossover design study. Subjects consumed 10 candy twists with a 1-hour venous blood glucose assessment. All subjects subsequently completed the confirmatory 3-hour glucose tolerance test. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, negative predictive values, false-referral rates, and detection rates were calculated. At ≥130 mg/dL, the sensitivity (100%) was the same for candy twists and glucola. However, the false-referral rate (82% vs 90%), positive predictive value (18% vs 10%), and detection rate (18% vs 10%) were improved for candy twists when compared with the 50-g glucola beverage.

A secondary analysis from a cross-sectional study of 11-15-year-old students from 31 junior high schools across Ho Chi Minh City was used. We measured the students' anthropometric status and assessed beverage consumption using a validated Food Frequency Questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify the association between the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, obesity and other factors. The sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) ranged widely from modern soft drinks and powdered drinks to traditional sugar-added fruit and leaf juices, and milk-based drinks. These beverages were very popular among 2,660 participants with 36% consuming at least one variety daily. Factors positively associated with sugar-sweetened beverage consumption included a higher level of physical activity, higher consumption of fast foods, and daily fruit and vegetable consumption. We found a negative association between milk-based SSBs and the overweight and obesity status of the students, i.e. every kcal more of fresh milk with sugar and condensed milk can reduce an obesity odd of 0.005 (95% CI [0.002-0.008], p < 0.001) and 0.004 (95% CI [0.002-0.010], p = 0.044) consecutively. None of the other SSBs was significantly related to adolescent overweight and obesity. Milk-based drinks potentially protect adolescents against overweight and obesity. Further research to assess this protection is needed.

It causes maternal hypothyroxinemia, which affects pregnant women even in apparently iodine-sufficient areas, and often goes unnoticed because L-thyroxine (T4) levels remain within the normal range, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is not increased. Even a mild hypothyroxinemia during pregnancy increases the risk of neurodevelopmental abnormalities, and experimental data clearly demonstrate that it damages the cortical cytoarchitecture of the fetal brain.

374,374,23647784,"The International Lipid-Based Nutrient Supplements (iLiNS) Project began in 2009 with the goal of contributing to the evidence base regarding the potential of lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) to prevent undernutrition in vulnerable populations. The first project objective was the development of acceptable LNS products for infants 6-24 months and for pregnant and lactating women, for use in studies in three countries (Burkina Faso, Ghana and Malawi). This paper shares the rationale for a series of decisions in supplement formulation and design, including those related to ration size, ingredients, nutrient content, safety and quality, and packaging. Most iLiNS supplements have a daily ration size of 20 g and are intended for home fortification of local diets. For infants, this ration size is designed to avoid displacement of breast milk and to allow for dietary diversity including any locally available and accessible nutrient-dense foods. Selection of ingredients depends on acceptability of flavour, micronutrient, anti-nutrient and essential fatty acid contents. The nutrient content of LNS designed to prevent undernutrition reflects the likelihood that in many resource-poor settings, diets of the most nutritionally vulnerable individuals (infants, young children, and pregnant and lactating women) are likely to be deficient in multiple micronutrients and, possibly, in essential fatty acids. During ingredient procurement and LNS production, safety and quality control procedures are required to prevent contamination with toxins or pathogens and to ensure that the product remains stable and palatable over time. Packaging design decisions must include consideration of product protection, stability, convenience and portion control.

A literature search was conducted in PubMed for articles on diabetes mellitus after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and effects of immunosuppressants on glucose metabolism. Within 2 years after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, up to 30% of patients may have diabetes. Although some of these cases resolve, the rates of diabetes and metabolic syndrome remain elevated in comparison with those in the nontransplant patient population during long-term follow-up. Traditional risk factors for diabetes as well as features related to the transplantation process, including immunosuppressive medications, are associated with posttransplant diabetes. Cardiovascular risk also appears to be increased in this population. Limited data are available on hypoglycemic agents for posttransplant diabetes; thus, treatment decisions must be based on safety, efficacy, and tolerability, with consideration of each patient's transplant-related medications and comorbidities. Treatment of diabetes mellitus in patients who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation necessitates attention to the posttransplant medication regimen and clinical course. Although no guidelines specific to treatment of posttransplant diabetes in this patient population currently exist, treatment to goals similar to those for nontransplant patients with diabetes should be considered in an attempt to help reduce long-term morbidity and mortality.

There were 435 livers (62%) categorized as ECD for severe physiologic stress and 70 (10%) because of old age. Recipient outcomes included perioperative death or graft loss and overall survival. Liver enzymes were analyzed for the first month post-transplant. Biliary complications were assessed through chart review. Overall, 371 donor livers were preserved in HTK (53%), and 327 were preserved in UW (47%). There were no statistically significant differences in any of the primary outcome measures comparing HTK and UW. The HTK group overall had a higher day 1 median aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, but the two groups were similar in function thereafter. HTK was superior to UW in protection against biliary complications. Kaplan-Meier graft survival curves failed to demonstrate a significant difference in SCD or ECD livers. In conclusion, HTK and UW are not clinically distinguishable in this large sample of liver transplants, although HTK may be protective against biliary complications when compared to UW.

379,379,16804103,"The transition from day to night is associated with a pronounced decline in diuresis with reductions in the amount of excreted water, electrolytes, and other end products of our metabolism. Failure to do so leads to a large urine output at night, a condition known as nocturnal polyuria, encountered in a large proportion of children with nocturnal enuresis. The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanisms responsible for the nocturnal polyuria seen in enuretics with inadequate response to desmopressin (dDAVP). Forty-six enuretics (7-14 yr of age) and fifteen age-matched controls were admitted for a 24-h protocol with standardized fluid and sodium intake, comprising urine collections, blood sampling, and blood pressure monitoring. We included patients with severe enuresis (5 +/- 1 wet nights/wk) showing <50% reduction in wet nights on dDAVP. We characterized the patients on the basis of their nocturnal urine production. The children with nocturnal polyuria excreted larger amounts of sodium and urea at night than nonpolyurics and controls. Solute-free water reabsorption as well as urinary arginine vasopressin and aquaporin-2 excretion were normal in polyurics, and no differences were found in atrial natriuretic peptide, angiotensin II, aldosterone, and renin levels. Urinary prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) excretion was significantly higher in polyurics. The nocturnal polyuria in children with dDAVP-resistant nocturnal enuresis seems to be the result of augmented sodium and urea excretion. The high urinary PGE2 levels found in these children point toward a role for increased prostaglandin synthesis in the pathogenesis of enuresis-related polyuria.

Data were provided by current programmes of neonatal screening of congenital hypothyroidism in Bangkok and rural areas of Thailand. A total of 5144 cord serum samples were collected in 2003 and measured for TSH concentrations. Paired samples of blood and urine were collected in 2000 from 203 infants and their mothers and from 1182 infant-mother pairs in 2002-03 in six rural provinces. Iodine was measured in the urine and TSH was measured in cord serum. The urinary iodine concentration of mothers in rural Thailand is adequate, with a median of 103 microg l-1. However, in 2000, the median urinary iodine concentration of mothers in Bangkok was only 85 microg l-1. The concentration of TSH in whole blood collected on filter paper from neonates was not sensitive enough to be used as a monitoring tool for iodine nutrition in the neonates, as there was no relationship with the concentration of iodine in the urine of the children's mothers. This was in contrast to the concentration of TSH in serum collected from cord blood. Several conclusions were drawn from this data: 1) Neonatal TSH screening using whole blood collected from a heel prick at 3 days of age is not sensitive enough to assess the iodine nutrition of neonates; 2) Neonatal TSH screening using cord sera can be used to assess iodine nutrition in neonates; 3) The optimum median maternal urinary iodine concentration in Thailand appears to be 103 microg l-1; 4) The criteria proposed by WHO, UNICEF, and ICCIDD to assess iodine nutrition using data on neonatal TSH concentrations should be reassessed; and 5) Neonatal TSH screening can be effectively performed by collecting cord serum in district hospitals in Thailand.

In addition, senescent cells are heterogeneous, in that not all of them express the same genes and present the same phenotype. To further clarify the classification of senescent cells, hints may be derived by the study of cellular metabolism, autophagy and proteasome activity. In this scenario, we decided to study these biological features in senescence of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC). These cells contain a subpopulation of stem cells that are able to differentiate in mesodermal derivatives (adipocytes, chondrocytes, osteocytes). In addition, they can also contribute to the homeostatic maintenance of many organs, hence, their senescence could be very deleterious for human body functions. We induced MSC senescence by oxidative stress, doxorubicin treatment, X-ray irradiation and replicative exhaustion. The first three are considered inducers of acute senescence while extensive proliferation triggers replicative senescence also named as chronic senescence. In all conditions, but replicative and high IR dose senescence, we detected a reduction of the autophagic flux, while proteasome activity was impaired in peroxide-treated and irradiated cells. Differences were observed also in metabolic status. In general, all senescent cells evidenced metabolic inflexibility and prefer to use glucose as energy fuel. Irradiated cells with low dose of X-ray and replicative senescent cells show a residual capacity to use fatty acids and glutamine as alternative fuels, respectively.

Non-provoked seizures intercritical EEG showed isolated spikes and spike-and-waves in the left parietal region. Brain MRI detected a left parietal focal cortical dysplasia. This is the second patient with HWE in whom a cortical malformation has been observed. The observation present here and data reported in the literature seem to indicate that the sensory cortex might also be involved in triggering seizures precipitated by a bath in hot water. Moreover, the authors believe that MRI examination should be considered for this group of patients.

To study intrapancreatic cellular interactions and pancreatic hormonal secretion. Randomized, sequential 10-minute test intervals of single-pass perfusion with each antibody were performed at 3.9 mM or 11.5 mM steady-state glucose concentrations. Somatostatin, insulin, and glucagon levels were measured in the effluent during basal and immunoneutralization intervals. At 3.9 mM glucose concentration, somatostatin antibody (SS-Ab) stimulated insulin and glucagon secretion, insulin antibody (IN-Ab) inhibited glucagon secretion, and glucagon antibody (GN-Ab) stimulated insulin secretion. At 11.5 mM glucose concentration, SS-Ab stimulated insulin secretion, IN-Ab stimulated glucagon and inhibited somatostatin secretion, and GN-Ab stimulated insulin secretion. The variation in hormonal responses to immunoneutralization during stimulated and nonstimulated glucose conditions suggests that a dynamic association exists between the pancreatic cells.

390,390,32358807,"Several agents are used to clear secretions from the airways of people with cystic fibrosis. Mannitol increases mucociliary clearance, but its exact mechanism of action is unknown. The dry powder formulation of mannitol may be more convenient and easier to use compared with established agents which require delivery via a nebuliser. Phase III trials of inhaled dry powder mannitol for the treatment of cystic fibrosis have been completed and it is now available in Australia and some countries in Europe. This is an update of a previous review. To assess whether inhaled dry powder mannitol is well tolerated, whether it improves the quality of life and respiratory function in people with cystic fibrosis and which adverse events are associated with the treatment. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic databases, handsearching relevant journals and abstracts from conferences. Date of last search: 12 December 2019. All randomised controlled studies comparing mannitol with placebo, active inhaled comparators (for example, hypertonic saline or dornase alfa) or with no treatment. Authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, carried out data extraction and assessed the risk of bias in included studies. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Six studies (reported in 36 unique publications) were included with a total of 784 participants. Duration of treatment in the included studies ranged from 12 days to six months, with open-label treatment for an additional six months in two of the studies. Five studies compared mannitol with control (a very low dose of mannitol or non-respirable mannitol) and the final study compared mannitol to dornase alfa alone and to mannitol plus dornase alfa. Two large studies had a similar parallel design and provided data for 600 participants, which could be pooled where data for a particular outcome and time point were available. The remaining studies had much smaller sample sizes (ranging from 22 to 95) and data could not be pooled due to differences in design, interventions and population. Pooled evidence from the two large parallel studies was judged to be of low to moderate quality and from the smaller studies was judged to be of low to very low quality. In all studies, there was an initial test to see if participants tolerated mannitol, with only those who could tolerate the drug being randomised; therefore, the study results are not applicable to the cystic fibrosis population as a whole. While the published papers did not provide all the data required for our analysis, additional unpublished data were provided by the drug's manufacturer and the author of one of the studies. Pooling the large parallel studies comparing mannitol to control, up to and including six months, lung function (forced expiratory volume at one second) measured in both mL and % predicted was significantly improved in the mannitol group compared to the control group (moderate-quality evidence). Beneficial results were observed in these studies in adults and in both concomitant dornase alfa users and non-users in these studies. In the smaller studies, statistically significant improvements in lung function were also observed in the mannitol groups compared to the non-respirable mannitol groups; however, we judged this evidence to be of low to very low quality. For the comparisons of mannitol and control, we found no consistent differences in health-related quality of life in any of the domains except for burden of treatment, which was less for mannitol up to four months in the two pooled studies of a similar design; this difference was not maintained at six months. It should be noted that the tool used to measure health-related quality of life was not designed to assess mucolytics and pooling of the age-appropriate tools (as done in some of the included studies) may not be valid so results were judged to be low to very low quality and should be interpreted with caution. Cough, haemoptysis, bronchospasm, pharyngolaryngeal pain and post-tussive vomiting were the most commonly reported side effects in both treatment groups. Where rates of adverse events could be compared, statistically no significant differences were found between mannitol and control groups; although some of these events may have clinical relevance for people with CF. For the comparisons of mannitol to dornase alfa alone and to mannitol plus dornase alfa, very low-quality evidence from a 12-week cross-over study of 28 participants showed no statistically significant differences in the recorded domains of health-related quality of life or measures of lung function. Cough was the most common side effect in the mannitol alone arm but there was no occurrence of cough in the dornase alfa alone arm and the most commonly reported reason of withdrawal from the mannitol plus dornase alfa arm was pulmonary exacerbations. In terms of secondary outcomes of the review (pulmonary exacerbations, hospitalisations, symptoms, sputum microbiology), evidence provided by the included studies was more limited. For all comparisons, no consistent statistically significant and clinically meaningful differences were observed between mannitol and control treatments (including dornase alfa). There is moderate-quality evidence to show that treatment with mannitol over a six-month period is associated with an improvement in some measures of lung function in people with cystic fibrosis compared to control. There is low to very low-quality evidence suggesting no difference in quality of life for participants taking mannitol compared to control. This review provides very low-quality evidence suggesting no difference in lung function or quality of life comparing mannitol to dornase alfa alone and to mannitol plus dornase alfa. The clinical implications from this review suggest that mannitol could be considered as a treatment in cystic fibrosis; but further research is required in order to establish who may benefit most and whether this benefit is sustained in the longer term. Furthermore, studies comparing its efficacy against other (established) mucolytic therapies need to be undertaken before it can be considered for mainstream practice. پیشینه: عوامل دارویی متعددی برای پاک کردن ترشحات از مجاری هوایی مبتلایان به فیبروز سیستیک استفاده می‌شوند. مانیتول پاکسازی موکوسیلیاری را افزایش می‌دهد، اما مکانیسم دقیق عملکرد آن ناشناخته است. فرمولاسیون پودر خشک مانیتول در مقایسه با عوامل تائید شده شده که توسط نبولایزر تجویز می‌شوند، ممکن است برای استفاده، راحت‌تر و آسان‌تر باشد. کارآزمایی‌های فاز III پودر خشک استنشاقی مانیتول برای درمان فیبروز سیستیک به پایان رسیده و هم اکنون در استرالیا و برخی از کشورهای اروپایی در دسترس قرار دارد. این یک به‌روزرسانی از یک مرور کاکرین است که قبلا منتشر شده است. اهداف: ارزیابی اینکه آیا پودر خشک استنشاقی مانیتول به خوبی تحمل می‌شود، آیا کیفیت زندگی و عملکرد تنفسی را در افراد مبتلا به فیبروز سیستیک بهبود می‌بخشد یا اینکه چه عوارض جانبی با درمان همراه است. روش‌های جست‌وجو: ما پایگاه ثبت کارآزمایی‌های گروه فیبروز کیستیک و اختلالات ژنتیکی در کاکرین را جست‌وجو کردیم که شامل منابع شناسایی‌شده از طریق جست‌وجوهای جامع در پایگاه‌های اطلاعاتی الکترونیکی، جست‌وجوهای دستی در مجلات مربوطه، کتاب‌های چکیده و مجموعه مقالات کنفرانس‌ها است. تاریخ آخرین جست‌وجو: 12 دسامبر 2019. معیارهای انتخاب: تمام مطالعات تصادفی‌سازی و کنترل شده که به مقایسه مانیتول با دارونما (placebo)، مقایسه کننده‌های استنشاقی فعال (به عنوان مثال، سالین هیپرتونیک یا دورناز آلفا) یا عدم درمان پرداختند. گردآوری و تجزیه‌وتحلیل داده‌ها: نویسندگان به‌طور مستقل از هم مطالعات را برای ورود ارزیابی کردند، داده‌‌ها را استخراج کرده و خطر سوگیری (bias) را در مطالعات وارد شده ارزیابی کردند. کیفیت شواهد با استفاده از GRADE ارزیابی شد. نتایج اصلی: شش مطالعه (گزارش شده در 36 مقاله تکی) با 784 شرکت‌کننده وارد شدند. مدت زمان درمان در مطالعات وارد شده، از 12 روز تا شش ماه متغیر بود، با درمان برچسب باز به مدت شش ماه بیشتر در دو مطالعه. پنج مطالعه مانیتول را با کنترل (دوز بسیار کمی از مانیتول یا مانیتول غیرقابل تنفس) مقایسه کرده و مطالعه نهایی به مقایسه مانیتول با دورناز آلفا به تنهایی و مانیتول به اضافه دورناز آلفا پرداخت. دو مطالعه بزرگ از یک طراحی موازی مشابه برخوردار بوده و داده‌ها را برای 600 شرکت‌کننده ارائه کردند، که می‌توانست در جایی که داده‌ها برای یک پیامد و نقطه زمانی خاص در دسترس بودند، تجمیع شوند. مطالعات باقیمانده حجم نمونه‌های بسیار کمتری داشتند (از 22 تا 95) و به دلیل تفاوت‌ها در طراحی مطالعه، مداخلات و جمعیت، داده‌ها قابل تجمیع نبودند. شواهد تجمعی از دو مطالعه موازی بزرگ، كیفیت پایین تا متوسطی داشته و شواهد به دست آمده از مطالعات كوچكتر به نظر می‌رسید كه از كیفیت پائین تا بسیار پائینی برخوردار بودند. در تمام مطالعات، آزمایش اولیه‌ای وجود داشت تا مشخص شود که شرکت‌کنندگان قادر به تحمل مانیتول بودند یا خیر، فقط کسانی که می‌توانستند دارو را تحمل کنند، تصادفی‌سازی شدند؛بنابراین، نتایج مطالعه برای کل جمعیت مبتلا به فیبروز سیستیک کاربرد ندارند. در حالی که مقالات منتشر شده تمام داده‌های مورد نیاز را برای تجزیه‌و‌تحلیل ما ارائه نمی‌دهند، داده‌های منتشر نشده اضافی توسط سازنده دارو و نویسنده یکی از مطالعات ارائه شد. تجمیع مطالعات موازی بزرگ که به مقایسه مانیتول با کنترل، تا شش ماه و شامل 6 ماه پرداختند، نشان دادند که عملکرد ریه (حجم اجباری بازدمی در یک ثانیه)، اندازه‌گیری شده به هر دو صورت میلی‌لیتر و درصد پیش‌بینی شده، در گروه مانیتول نسبت به گروه کنترل به‌طور قابل توجهی بهبود یافت (شواهد با کیفیت متوسط). در این مطالعات نتایج مفیدی در بزرگسالان و در هر دو گروه مصرف کننده همزمان دورناز آلفا و کسانی که از آن استفاده نکردند، مشاهده شد. در مطالعات کوچکتر نیز پیشرفت‌های معنی‌داری از نظر آماری در عملکرد ریه در گروه مانیتول در مقایسه با گروه‌های مانیتول غیرقابل تنفس مشاهده شد. با این حال، این شواهد از کیفیت پایین تا بسیار پایینی برخوردار بودند. برای مقایسه‌های مانیتول و کنترل، ما تفاوت‌های پایداری را در کیفیت زندگی مرتبط با سلامت در هیچ یک از حوزه‌ها به جز بار (burden) درمان پیدا نکردیم، که برای مانیتول تا چهار ماه، در دو مطالعه تجمیع شده با طراحی مشابه، کمتر بود؛ این اختلاف در شش ماه باقی نماند. لازم به ذکر است که ابزار مورد استفاده برای سنجش کیفیت زندگی مرتبط با سلامت، که برای ارزیابی موکولیتیک‌ها و ادغام ابزارهای مناسب سن (همانطور که در برخی از مطالعات وارد شده انجام شد) طراحی نشده بود، ممکن است معتبر نباشد، بنابراین نتایج با کیفیت پایین تا بسیار پایین داوری شدند و باید با احتیاط تفسیر شوند. سرفه، هموپتیزی، برونکواسپاسم، درد فارنگولارنژیال و استفراغ پس از سرفه، شایع‌ترین عوارض جانبی در هر دو گروه درمانی بودند. در جایی که میزان عوارض جانبی با هم قابل مقایسه بودند، از نظر آماری تفاوت معنی‌داری بین مانیتول و گروه کنترل مشاهده نشد؛ اگرچه برخی از این حوادث ممکن است ارتباط بالینی برای افراد مبتلا به CF داشته باشند. برای مقایسه‌های مانیتول با دورناز آلفا به تنهایی و مانیتول به علاوه دورناز آلفا، شواهدی با کیفیت بسیار پایین از یک مطالعه متقاطع 12 هفته‌ای با 28 شرکت‌کننده به دست آمد که هیچ تفاوت آماری معنی‌داری را در حوزه‌های ثبت شده کیفیت زندگی مرتبط با سلامت یا معیارهای عملکرد ریه نشان ندادند. سرفه شایع‌ترین عارضه جانبی در بازوی مانیتول به تنهایی بود اما هیچ موردی از وقوع سرفه در بازوی دورناز آلفا به تنهایی وجود نداشت و شایع‌ترین دلیل خروج از بازوی مانیتول به علاوه دورناز آلفا، تشدید حملات ریوی گزارش شد. از نظر پیامدهای ثانویه مرور (تشدید حملات ریوی، بستری در بیمارستان، علائم، میکروبیولوژی خلط)، شواهد ارائه شده توسط مطالعات وارد شده، محدودتر بودند. برای همه مقایسه‌ها، هیچ تفاوتی معنی‌دار آماری پایداری و تفاوت بالینی قابل‌توجهی بین درمان‌های مانیتول و کنترل (از جمله دورناز آلفا) مشاهده نشد. نتیجه‌گیری‌های نویسندگان: شواهدی با کیفیت متوسط وجود دارد که نشان می‌دهد درمان با مانیتول در طول یک دوره شش ماهه، با بهبود برخی معیارهای عملکرد ریه در افراد مبتلا به فیبروز سیستیک در مقایسه با کنترل همراه است. شواهدی با کیفیت پایین تا بسیار پایین وجود دارد که نشان می‌دهد هیچ تفاوتی در کیفیت زندگی شرکت‌کنندگان تحت درمان با مانیتول در مقایسه با کنترل، وجود ندارد. این مرور شواهدی را با کیفیت بسیار پائین نشان می‌دهد که هیچ تفاوتی در عملکرد ریه یا کیفیت زندگی در مقایسه مانیتول با دورناز آلفا به تنهایی و با مانیتول به همراه دورناز آلفا وجود ندارد. کاربردهای بالینی این مرور پیشنهاد می‌کند که مانیتول می‌تواند به عنوان درمانی در فیبروز سیستیک در نظر گرفته شود؛ اما تحقیقات بیشتری لازم است تا مشخص شود چه کسی بیشترین نفع را از آن می‌برد و اینکه این سود در طولانی‌مدت پایدار است یا خیر. علاوه بر این، پیش از آنکه مانیتول در طبابت بالینی به کار گرفته شود، مطالعات مربوط به مقایسه اثربخشی آن در برابر سایر روش‌های درمانی موکولیتیک (اثبات شده) باید انجام شوند.

Here, we show that BRD7 is a component of the unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling through its ability to regulate X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) nuclear translocation. BRD7 interacts with the regulatory subunits of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and increases the nuclear translocation of both p85α and p85β and the spliced form of XBP1 (XBP1s). Deficiency of BRD7 blocks the nuclear translocation of XBP1s. Furthermore, our in vivo studies have shown that BRD7 protein levels are reduced in the liver of obese mice, and reinstating BRD7 levels in the liver restores XBP1s nuclear translocation, improves glucose homeostasis, and ultimately reduces the blood glucose levels in the obese and diabetic mouse models.

In addition, all TyG and modified TyG indices significantly predicted NAFLD through ROC curves. All modified TyG indices were superior to the TyG index for predicting NAFLD in all subjects and in males. Among females, the TyG-waist-to-height ratio was superior to the TyG index, TyG-body mass index (BMI), and TyG-waist circumference (WC), and the TyG-BMI SDS and TyG-WC were superior to the TyG index.

393,393,36341822,"Organophosphate esters (OPEs) are developmental toxicants in experimental studies of animals, but limited evidence is available in humans. We included 340 mother-infant pairs in the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study (Cincinnati, Ohio, USA) for the analysis. We evaluated gestational exposure to OPEs with gestation age at birth and newborn anthropometric measures. We quantified four OPE urinary metabolites at 16 weeks and 26 weeks of gestation. We extracted gestational age at birth, newborn weight, length, and head circumference from the chart review. We calculated z-scores for these anthropometric measures and the ponderal index. We used multiple informant models to examine the associations between repeated OPE measurements and the outcomes. We used modified Poisson regression to estimate the association of gestational exposure to OPEs with preterm birth. We also explored effect modification by infant sex and the potential mediation effect by the highest maternal blood pressure and glucose levels. We found that bis(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (BCEP) at 16 weeks and diphenyl phosphate at 26 weeks of pregnancy were positively associated with gestational age and inversely associated with preterm birth. In female newborns, BCEP at 16 weeks was inversely related to birth weight and length z-scores. In male newborns, we observed negative associations of 26-week di-n-butyl phosphate with the ponderal index at birth. No mediation by the highest maternal blood pressure or glucose levels during pregnancy was identified.

395,395,35246859,"Obesity is a health and medical problem and is known as the accumulation of fat that increases the risk of cardiovascular, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and infertility. Cinnamon is a spice that is used mainly as a flavoring additive and folk remedies to treat diabetes. Molecular mechanisms of its effects on hepatic lipogenesis and beta-oxidation, inflammation, and oxidative damage are not fully understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the protective and therapeutic effect of different doses of cinnamon in obese male rats. Forty-eight adult male Wister rats were randomly assigned into eight controlled and treated groups. Serum levels of lipid, glucose, and insulin profiles were measured along with liver levels of antioxidant enzymes, MDA and TNF-α. Hepatic expression of genes involved in beta-oxidation, lipogenesis, oxidative stress, and inflammation was also evaluated. Hepatic levels of oxidative and inflammatory biomarkers and serum levels of glucose, liver enzymes, insulin, and lipid profiles increased significantly in obese rats. Moreover, hepatic expression of SREBP-1c and NF-κB increased, and PPAR-alpha, CD36, FAS, CPT-1, and Nrf-2 decreased in obese rats. However, pretreatment and treatment with different doses of cinnamon in obese rats could significantly ameliorate them in obese rats. It can be concluded that cinnamon could improve hepatic steatosis caused by a high-fat diet via enhancing hepatic beta-oxidation and inhibiting hepatic lipogenesis, oxidative damage, and inflammation in male rats. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Obesity as a medical and psychiatric problem is seen in more than a third of the world's population. Obesity leads to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and in some cases even death. Cinnamon as a spice and folk remedy has long been used as a treatment for obesity and liver disease. Cinnamon has received a great of attention from the past to the present due to its pharmacological properties and in addition to its availability, cheapness and low side effects. Cinnamon can prevent dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, oxidative damage, and inflammation by modulating multiple signaling pathways. Our results showed that cinnamon could improve hepatic steatosis caused by HFD via enhancing hepatic beta-oxidation and inhibiting hepatic lipogenesis, oxidative damage, and inflammation. Therefore, it can be recommended that cinnamon and its products can be used as a very suitable option for the production of pharmaceutical supplements for the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases.

396,396,29490090,"Chronic malnutrition, as manifested by linear growth faltering, is pervasive among rural African children. Improvements in complementary feeding may decrease the burden of environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) and thus improve growth in children during the critical first 1000 d of development. We tested the hypothesis that systematically including common bean or cowpea into complementary feeding would reduce EED and growth faltering among children in rural Malawi. This was a double-blind clinical trial in which children 12-23 mo of age were randomly assigned to receive complementary feeding with 1 of 3 foods: roasted cowpea or common bean flour, or an isoenergetic amount of corn-soy blend as a control food for 48 wk. Children aged 12-23 mo received 155 kcal/d and thereafter until 35 mo received 200 kcal/d. The primary outcomes were change in length-for-age z score (LAZ) and improvements in a biomarker of EED, the percentage of lactulose (%L) excreted as part of the lactulose:mannitol dual-sugar absorption test. Anthropometric measurements and urinary %L excretion were compared between the 2 intervention groups and the control group separately with the use of linear mixed model analyses for repeated measures. A total of 331 children completed the clinical trial. Compliance with the study interventions was excellent, with >90% of the intervention flour consumed as intended. No significant effects on LAZ, change in LAZ, or weight-for-length z score were observed due to either intervention legume, compared to the control. %L was reduced with common bean consumption (effect estimate was -0.07 percentage points of lactulose, P = 0.0007). The lactulose:mannitol test was not affected by the legume intervention. The addition of common bean to complementary feeding of rural Malawian children during the second year of life led to an improvement in a biomarker of gut health, although this did not directly translate into improved linear growth.

399,399,34200310,"Aspartame is a sweetener introduced to replace the commonly used sucrose. It was discovered by James M. Schlatter in 1965. Being 180-200 times sweeter than sucrose, its intake was expected to reduce obesity rates in developing countries and help those struggling with diabetes. It is mainly used as a sweetener for soft drinks, confectionery, and medicines. Despite its widespread use, its safety remains controversial. This narrative review investigates the existing literature on the use of aspartame and its possible effects on the human body to refine current knowledge. Taking to account that aspartame is a widely used artificial sweetener, it seems appropriate to continue research on safety. Studies mentioned in this article have produced very interesting results overall, the current review highlights the social problem of providing visible and detailed information about the presence of aspartame in products. The studies involving the impact of aspartame on obesity, diabetes mellitus, children and fetus, autism, neurodegeneration, phenylketonuria, allergies and skin problems, its cancer properties and its genotoxicity were analyzed. Further research should be conducted to ensure clear information about the impact of aspartame on health. ",2399,Aspartame-True or False?

400,400,17497074,"Poland has one of the highest death rates for stomach cancer in Europe. Moderate iodine deficiency and in consequence high goitre prevalence led to the implementation in 1996 of a very efficient mandatory model of iodine prophylaxis, based on household salt iodisation (30 +/- 10 mg KI/1 kg of salt). The aim of the study was evaluation of incidence rate of stomach cancer and its possible relation to increased iodine consumption in the years 1992-2004. Iodine supply and effectiveness of iodine prophylaxis were evaluated on the basis of comparative analysis of goitre prevalence and ioduria in schoolchildren. To allow comparison between time periods with varying population age structures, the incidence rates of stomach cancer were standardized for age, using the ""world standard population"". The direct standardization method has been applied. For each sex, the time-trend of incidence rates was shown in graphs over the years 1991-2004. Evident increase in iodine consumption in this period of time was proved by rise in percentage of schoolchildren (6-8 years old) with ioduria above 100 microg/l from 11.4% in 1992-1993 to 52.9.1% in 2003. It was correlated with the decrease in goitre prevalence from 18.8% to 3.2% respectively. The 24-h thyroid uptake of (131)I in investigated population fell from 45.5% in 1986 to 26.8% in 1998. In Krakow the standardized incidence ratio of stomach cancer for men decreased from 19.1 per 100,000 to 15.7 per 100,000, and for women from 8.3 per 100,000 to 5.9 per 100,000 in the years 1992-2004. A significant decline of average rate of decrease was observed in men and women (2.3% and 4.0% per year respectively). Observed association between improved iodine supply and decrease of incidence of stomach cancer could indicate the protective role against stomach cancer of iodine prophylaxis in iodine deficient areas--further studies are necessary.

401,401,38334474,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an internal tandem duplication in the fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor 3 gene (FLT3-ITD) is associated with poor survival, and few studies have examined the impact of modifiable behaviors, such as nutrient quality and timing, in this subset of acute leukemia. The influence of diet composition (low-sucrose and/or low-fat diets) and timing of diet were tested in tandem with anthracycline treatment in orthotopic xenograft mouse models. A pilot clinical study to test receptivity of pediatric leukemia patients to macronutrient matched foods was conducted. A role for the circadian protein, BMAL1 (brain and muscle ARNT-like 1), in effects of diet timing was studied by overexpression in FLT3-ITD-bearing AML cells. Reduced tumor burden in FLT3-ITD AML-bearing mice was observed with interventions utilizing low-sucrose and/or low-fat diets, or time-restricted feeding (TRF) compared to mice fed normal chow ad libitum. In a tasting study, macronutrient matched low-sucrose and low-fat meals were offered to pediatric acute leukemia patients who largely reported liking the meals. Expression of the circadian protein, BMAL1, was heightened with TRF and the low-sucrose diet. BMAL1 overexpression and treatment with a pharmacological inducer of BMAL1 was cytotoxic to FLT3-ITD AML cells. Mouse models for FLT3-ITD AML show that diet composition and timing slows progression of FLT3-ITD AML growth in vivo, potentially mediated by BMAL1. These interventions to enhance therapy efficacy show preliminary feasibility, as pediatric leukemia patients responded favorable to preparation of macronutrient matched meals.

403,403,23442215,"African Americans are disproportionately exposed to cigarette advertisements, particularly for menthol brands. Tobacco industry documents outline strategic efforts to promote menthol cigarettes to African Americans at the point of sale, and studies have observed more outdoor and retail menthol advertisements in neighborhoods with more African-American residents. Little research has been conducted to examine the effect of this target marketing on adolescents' recognition of cigarette brand advertising and on smoking uptake. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine racial differences in brand recognition and to assess the prospective relationship between brand recognition and smoking uptake. School-based surveys assessing tobacco use and environmental and social influences to smoke were administered to 6th through 9th graders (ages 11 to 15) in an urban and racially diverse California school district. The primary outcome for the cross-sectional analysis (n = 2,589) was brand recognition, measured by students' identification of masked tobacco advertisements from the point of sale. The primary outcome for the longitudinal analysis (n = 1,179) was progression from never to ever smoking within 12 months. At baseline, 52% of students recognized the Camel brand, 36% Marlboro, and 32% Newport. African-American students were three times more likely than others to recognize Newport (OR = 3.03, CI = 2.45, 3.74, p < 0.01) and less likely than others to recognize Marlboro (OR = 0.60, CI = 0.48, 0.73, p < 0.01). At follow-up, 17% of never smokers reported trying smoking. In this racially diverse sample, brand recognition of Camel and Marlboro did not predict smoking initiation. Regardless of race, students who recognized the Newport brand at baseline were more likely to initiate smoking at follow-up (OR = 1.49, CI = 1.04, 2.15, p < 0.05) after adjusting for shopping frequency and other risk factors. The study findings illustrate that African-American youth are better able to recognize Newport cigarette advertisements, even after adjustment for exposure to smoking by parents and peers. In addition, recognition of Newport cigarette advertising predicted smoking initiation, regardless of race. This longitudinal study contributes to a growing body of evidence that supports a ban on menthol flavored cigarettes in the US as well as stronger regulation of tobacco advertising at the point of sale.

404,404,34596662,"Food allergy (FA) affects the quality of life of millions of people worldwide and presents a significant psychological and financial burden for both national and international public health. In the past few decades, the prevalence of allergic disease has been on the rise worldwide. Identified risk factors for FA include family history, mode of delivery, variations in infant feeding practices, prior diagnosis of other atopic diseases such as eczema, and social economic status. Identifying reliable biomarkers that predict the risk of developing FA in early life would be valuable in both preventing morbidity and mortality and by making current interventions available at the earliest opportunity. There is also the potential to identify new therapeutic targets. This narrative review provides details on the genetic, epigenetic, dietary, and microbiome influences upon the development of FA and synthesizes the currently available data indicating potential biomarkers. Whereas there is a large body of research evidence available within each field of potential risk factors, there is a very limited number of studies that span multiple methodological fields, for example, including immunology, microbiome, genetic/epigenetic factors, and dietary assessment. We recommend that further collaborative research with detailed cohort phenotyping is required to identify biomarkers, and whether these vary between at-risk populations and the wider population. The low incidence of oral food challenge-confirmed FA in the general population, and the complexities of designing nutritional intervention studies will provide challenges for researchers to address in generating high-quality, reliable, and reproducible research findings.

408,408,31582762,"Modulation of energy metabolism to a highly glycolytic phenotype, i.e. Warburg effect, is a common phenotype of cancer and activated immune cells allowing increased biomass-production for proliferation and cell division. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized ADP-dependent glucokinase (ADPGK) has been shown to play a critical role in T cell receptor activation-induced remodeling of energy metabolism, however the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, we established and characterized in vitro and in vivo models for ADPGK-deficiency using Jurkat T cells and zebrafish. Upon activation, ADPGK knockout Jurkat T cells displayed increased cell death and ER stress. The increase in cell death resulted from a metabolic catastrophe and knockout cells displayed severely disturbed energy metabolism hindering induction of Warburg phenotype. ADPGK knockdown in zebrafish embryos led to short, dorsalized body axis induced by elevated apoptosis. ADPGK hypomorphic zebrafish further displayed dysfunctional glucose metabolism. In both model systems loss of ADPGK function led to defective N- and O-glycosylation. Overall, our data illustrate that ADPGK is part of a glucose sensing system in the ER modulating metabolism via regulation of N- and O-glycosylation.

We used positron emission tomography (PET) to determine local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (1CMRG1c) in 44 infants with spasms, in an attempt to define the neuroanatomical substrates that mediate these seizures. All infants were studied in the awake state during continuous electroencephalographic monitoring. The most consistent abnormality on PET, seen in 32 infants, was the symmetrical increase in 1CMRG1c in the lenticular nuclei, compared to age-matched normal infants (p less than 0.05). In 21 infants, even though the brain stem appeared to be visually more prominent compared to normal infants, statistically significant differences could not be demonstrated. Relative hypermetabolism of the lenticular nuclei (1) occurred irrespective of whether the spasms were cryptogenic or symptomatic, (2) was associated with focal cortical hypometabolism in 22 and focal cortical hypermetabolism in 5 of the 44 infants, and (3) was not characterized by any specific electroencephalographic abnormality during PET. These findings suggest that the lenticular nuclei may contribute to the pathophysiological state that predisposes to infantile spasms, and is consistent with the observation that spasms are clinically symmetrical even when focal cortical lesions are present.

Pre-exposure to high glucose rendered monocytes more sensitive to IFN-α stimulation with heightened signaling, whereas, instantaneous addition of high glucose did not exhibit such effect. Consistent with this finding, the mRNA levels of IFN-α-induced IRF-7 in PBMCs were positively correlated with HbA1c levels of diabetes patients.

FDG-PET and the Wada test were performed in 18 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The asymmetry indices of FDG-PET (PET-AI) were calculated in mesial, polar, anterolateral, midlateral, and posterolateral regions of the temporal lobe, and those of Wada memory test (Wada-AI) were obtained as well. The Wada-AI was significantly correlated with PET-AI in mesial (r = 0.67, p = 0.003), polar (r = 0.55, p = 0.019), anterolateral (r = 0.55, p = 0.019), and midlateral (r = 0.51, p = 0.031) regions of the temporal lobe. However, after a linear regression analysis, PET-AI of only the mesial temporal region was significantly correlated with Wada-AI (p = 0.008). Wada-AI could correctly lateralize the seizure focus in 90% of the left TLE and 75% of the right TLE patients. The PET-AI of the mesial temporal region showed the highest sensitivity of seizure lateralization (80% of left TLE and 87.5% of right TLE). PET-AI of other temporal regions had lower sensitivities (50-80% of left TLE, 20-75% of right TLE). One or two patients showed false seizure lateralization by PET-AI on each temporal region. Although FDG-PET hypometabolism is observed at both mesial and lateral regions of the temporal lobe in mesial TLE, mesial temporal region appeared to be a dominant and leading area for lateralizing Wada memory dominance and epileptic focus.

Thirty-six patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy were studied. Asymmetry index of tCMRgluc (PET-AI) and the equivalent current dipole intensity of first response of SEF (SEF-AI) were determined preoperatively using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), respectively. Seizure outcomes were evaluated according to the classification proposed by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) at least 24 months after resection of epileptic focuses. Twelve healthy volunteers were included in this study to determine the normal value. Quantitative analysis revealed mean PET-AI in the patients was 5.4+/-5.2% (significantly different from normal controls); mean SEF-AI was 25.2+/-20.6% (not significantly different). PET-AI was positive (indicative of epileptic focus) in 29 of 36 patients (80.6%), while SEF-AI was positive in 17 of 36 patients (47.2%). Although no significant correlation between PET-AI and SEF-AI was noted (r=0.43), concordant asymmetry in both PET-AI and SEF-AI was significantly associated with better seizure outcome than discordant or paradoxical asymmetry of both factors (p<0.01). The results suggest that quantitative analysis of tCMRgluc with SEF may be helpful in characterizing the preoperative epileptogenic condition and predicting postoperative seizure outcome in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, although a constellation of developmental brain abnormalities and environmental factors that together produce epilepsy need to be further explored.

We hypothesize that airway epithelial barrier function is impaired in CF and is further exacerbated under hyperglycemia, worsening pulmonary outcomes. Using 16HBE cells, we studied the effects of hyperglycemia in airway epithelial barrier function. Results show increased paracellular dye flux in CF cells in response to insulin under hyperglycemia. Gene expression experiments identified claudin-4 (CLDN4) as a key tight junction protein dysregulated in CF cells. CLDN4 protein localization by confocal microscopy showed that CLDN4 was tightly localized at tight junctions in WT cells, which did not change under hyperglycemia. ln contrast, CLDN4 was less well-localized in CF cells at normal glucose and localization was worsened under hyperglycemia. Treatment with highly effective modulator compounds (ETI) reversed this trend, and CFTR rescue was not affected by insulin or hyperglycemia. Bulk RNA sequencing showed differences in transcriptional responses in CF compared to WT cells under normal or high glucose, highlighting promising targets for future investigation. One of these targets is protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type G (PTPRG), which has been previously found to play a role in defective Akt signaling and insulin resistance.

One component of an effective population-based prenatal calcium intervention will be the selection of a widely accepted calcium vehicle to promote consistent, long-term consumption of the supplement. We aimed to evaluate preference and acceptability of 4 different options for delivering prenatal calcium (conventional tablets, chewable tablets, unflavored powder, and flavored powder) to pregnant women in urban Bangladesh. In a modified discrete-choice trial, pregnant women (n = 132) completed a 4-d ""run-in period"" in which each delivery vehicle was sampled once, followed by a 21-d ""selection period"" during which participants were instructed to freely select a single delivery vehicle of their choice each day. Preference was empirically defined as the probability that each delivery vehicle was selected on a given day, and measured from participants' daily delivery vehicle selections; acceptability was assessed by using mid- and post-trial questionnaires. Conventional tablets demonstrated the highest probability of selection (62%); the probability of selection of chewable tablets (19%), flavored powder (12%), and unflavored powder (5%) were all significantly lower than for conventional tablets (P < 0.001). The palatability and product characteristics of the conventional tablets were more acceptable than for the other 3 delivery vehicles. Our rigorous methodologic approach used both quantitative and self-reported measures that consistently identified the most preferred and accepted prenatal calcium delivery form. Through observation of pregnant women's actual supplement use, and perceptions of acceptability (i.e., ease of use, palatability), we demonstrated that conventional tablets are likely to be the most accepted and successful calcium delivery vehicle in future field studies and scale-up of the WHO recommendation in Bangladesh.

As part of our studies of the structure and genetics of LPS in nontypeable H. influenzae, we show here that there are allelic polymorphisms in the lex2B sequence that correlate with addition of either a glucose or a galactose to the same position in the LPS molecule across strains. Through exchange of lex2 alleles between strains we show that alteration of a single amino acid at position 157 in Lex2B appears to be sufficient to direct the alternative glucosyl- or galactosyltransferase activities. Allelic exchange strains express LPS with altered structure and biological properties compared to the wild-type LPS.

427,427,26714848,"Advancing diabetes care requires accurate physiological assessments. Hyperinsulinemic clamps with stable isotope tracers can simultaneously measure insulin's ability to suppress lipolysis and hepatic glucose release. Traditionally, these methods require an assessment of basal glucose and glycerol rate of appearance (Ra). Basal Ra is challenging to measure in insulin-dependent diabetes, where exogenous insulin required to maintain normoglycemia can raise peripheral insulin concentrations sufficiently to suppress basal Ra. Thus we identified two alternative statistical approaches to describe changes in glucose and glycerol Ra that are less reliant on basal assessments. Sixteen youths (4 type 1 diabetic, 4 type 2 diabetic, 4 lean controls, and 4 obese nondiabetic) underwent a four-phase (""basal"" and 10, 16, and 80 mU·m(2)·min(-1)) hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp with glucose and glycerol tracers. Glucose and glycerol Ra were calculated per phase. A statistical method, the standard two-stage (STS) algorithm, was applied to the individual log insulin vs. Ra curves to calculate a single predicted Ra value. A population-based mixed-effects model (MEM) compared the group average Ra with log insulin curves and described individual deviations from group means and was used to calculate individual predicted Ra. Both models were applied to the participant data, and predicted Ras at the mean insulin concentration per phase (10 for glycerol, 16 for glucose) were calculated, with good agreement between observed and predicted values. In our data set, the MEM was better able to detect group differences. Both STS and MEM can model lipolysis and endogenous glucose release in insulin-dependent states when basal Ra cannot be accurately measured.

However, results for adult intakes of salted fish and preserved foods are inconsistent. The aim of this study was to ascertain the relations of Chinese-style hard and soft salted fish and preserved food intakes with NPC risk. We conducted a population-based case-control study in southern China with 2554 NPC cases identified through a rapid case ascertainment system and 2648 healthy controls, frequency-matched on age, sex, and area. Subjects (aged 20-74 y) were interviewed via a food-frequency questionnaire, including information on portion size. Data were also collected on alcohol consumption and potential confounders. Food intake was grouped into 3-5 energy-adjusted intake levels during adulthood (10 y prior) and adolescence (16-18 y). For childhood (at age 10 y), intake frequency of selected food items was collected. Multivariate-adjusted ORs with 95% CIs were estimated via logistic regression. We found no association between NPC and intake of hard Chinese-style salted fish during adulthood, and an increased risk at the highest level of intake during adolescence (OR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.39). In contrast, we found a decreased risk for the middle intake level of soft salted fish during adulthood (OR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.81) and adolescence (OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.85).

Here, we describe the identification of hemizygous variants in PPP1R3F associated with a novel X-linked recessive neurodevelopmental disorder in 13 unrelated individuals. This disorder is characterized by developmental delay, mild intellectual disability, neurobehavioral issues such as autism spectrum disorder, seizures and other neurological findings including tone, gait and cerebellar abnormalities. PPP1R3F variants segregated with disease in affected hemizygous males that inherited the variants from their heterozygous carrier mothers. We show that PPP1R3F is predominantly expressed in brain astrocytes and localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum in cells. Glycogen content in PPP1R3F knockout astrocytoma cells appears to be more sensitive to fluxes in extracellular glucose levels than in wild-type cells, suggesting that PPP1R3F functions in maintaining steady brain glycogen levels under changing glucose conditions. We performed functional studies on nine of the identified variants and observed defects in PP1 binding, protein stability, subcellular localization and regulation of glycogen metabolism in most of them. Collectively, the genetic and molecular data indicate that deleterious variants in PPP1R3F are associated with a new X-linked disorder of glycogen metabolism, highlighting the critical role of GTSs in neurological development.

Measures included body mass index z-score (BMIz) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) by fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and insulin. Statistics compared OB with D and further examined OB by latent class analysis (LCA). Normal FPG was found in 91.5% of all obese youth (OBt n = 94) Comparison of OB with normal FPG (OBng; n = 86) and D (n = 44) was significant for family history of T2D (p = 0.008) without other associations.

Human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) are favorable macromolecules which are, interestingly, indigestible by the infant but serve as substrates for bacteria. Hypothesizing that the maternal diet itself might influence HMO composition, we sought to directly determine the effect maternal diet on HMO and the milk bacteria. Employing a human cross-over study design, we demonstrate that distinct maternal dietary carbohydrate and energy sources preferentially alter milk concentrations of HMO, including fucosylated species. We find significant associations between the concentration of HMO-bound fucose and the abundance of fucosidase (a bacterial gene that digests fucose moieties) harbored by milk bacteria. These studies reveal a successive mechanism by which the maternal diet during lactation alters milk HMO composition, which in turn shapes the functional milk microbiome prior to infant ingestion.

Girls aged 9 to 15 and boys aged 10 to 17 were randomly assigned to either therapist-supervised usual care or double-blind injection of 1% lidocaine solution with or without 12.5% dextrose. Injections were administered monthly for 3 months. All subjects were then offered dextrose injections monthly as needed. Unaltered sport (Nirschl Pain Phase Scale < 4) and asymptomatic sport (Nirschl Pain Phase Scale = 0) were the threshold goals. Sixty-five knees in 54 athletes were treated. Compared with usual care at 3 months, unaltered sport was more common in both dextrose-treated (21 of 21 vs 13 of 22; P = .001) and lidocaine-treated (20 of 22 vs 13 of 22; P = .034) knees, and asymptomatic sport was more frequent in dextrose-treated knees than either lidocaine-treated (14 of 21 vs 5 of 22; P = .006) or usual-care-treated (14 of 21 vs 3 of 22; P < .001) knees.

446,446,31967084,"The burden of diarrheal diseases is very high, accounting for 1.7 to 5 billion cases per year worldwide. Typhoid fever (TF) and cholera are potentially life-threatening infectious diseases, and are mainly transmitted through the consumption of food, drink or water that have been contaminated by the feces or urine of subjects excreting the pathogen. TF is mainly caused by Salmonella typhi, whereas cholera is caused by intestinal infection by the toxin-producing bacterium Vibrio cholerae. These diseases typically affect low- and middle-income countries where housing is overcrowded and water and sanitation are poor, or where conflicts or natural disasters have led to the collapse of the water, sanitation and healthcare systems. Mortality is higher in children under 5 years of age. Regarding their geographical distribution, TF has a high incidence in sub-Saharan Africa, India and south-east Asia, while cholera has a high incidence in a few African countries, particularly in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. In the fight against these diseases, preventive measures are fundamental. With modern air travel, transmissible diseases can spread across continents and oceans in a few days, constituting a threat to global public health. Nowadays, people travel for many reasons, such as tourism and business. Several surveys have shown that a high proportion of travelers lack adequate information on safety issues, such as timely vaccination and prophylactic medications. The main objective of this overview is to provide information to help European travelers to stay healthy while abroad, and thus also to reduce the potential importation of these diseases and their consequent implications for public health and society. The preventive measures to be implemented in the case of travel to countries where these diseases are still endemic are well known: the adoption of safe practices and vaccinations. It is important to stress that an effective preventive strategy should be based both on vaccinations and on hygiene travel guidelines. Furthermore, the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains is becoming a serious problem in the clinical treatment of these diseases. For this reason, vaccination is the main solution.

Using a mouse model of GA-I, we show that pathologic events began in the neuronal compartment while enhanced lysine accumulation in the immature brain allowed increased glutaric acid production resulting in age-dependent injury. Glutamate and GABA depletion correlated with brain glutaric acid accumulation and could be monitored in vivo by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy as a diagnostic marker.

454,454,28416194,"Immune cells function in diverse metabolic environments. Tissues with low glucose and high lactate concentrations, such as the intestinal tract or ischemic tissues, frequently require immune responses to be more pro-tolerant, avoiding unwanted reactions against self-antigens or commensal bacteria. T-regulatory cells (Tregs) maintain peripheral tolerance, but how Tregs function in low-glucose, lactate-rich environments is unknown. We report that the Treg transcription factor Foxp3 reprograms T cell metabolism by suppressing Myc and glycolysis, enhancing oxidative phosphorylation, and increasing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidation. These adaptations allow Tregs a metabolic advantage in low-glucose, lactate-rich environments; they resist lactate-mediated suppression of T cell function and proliferation.

455,455,29448828,"Introduction Myocardial protection is vital to ensure successful open heart surgery. Cardioplegic solution is one method to achieve good myocardial protection. Inevitably, ischemia-reperfusion injury occurs with aortic crossclamping. Histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution is a frequently used cardioplegia for complex congenital heart surgery. We postulated that addition of terminal warm blood cardioplegia before removal of the aortic crossclamp might improve myocardial protection. Method A randomized controlled trial was conducted on 109 cyanotic patients aged, 1 to 5 years who underwent complex biventricular repair. They were divided into a control group of 55 patients who had histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate only and a treatment group of 54 who had histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate with terminal warm blood cardioplegia. Endpoints were clinical parameters, troponin I levels, and caspase-3 as an apoptosis marker. Results The incidence of low cardiac output syndrome was 34%, with no significant difference between groups (35.2% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.84). The incidence of arrhythmias in our treatment group was lower compared to the control group (36% vs. 12%, p = 0.005). Troponin I and caspase-3 results did not show any significant differences between groups. For cases with Aristotle score ≥ 10, weak expression of caspase-3 in the treatment group post-cardiopulmonary bypass was lower compared to the control group. Conclusion For complex congenital cardiac surgery, the addition of terminal warm blood cardioplegia does not significantly improve postoperative clinical or metabolic markers.

Between January 2016 and April 2017, 99 pregnant women were enrolled to evaluate UIC in spot urine samples, serum level of thyrotropin, free thyroxine, antithyroglobulin and antithyroperoxidase autoantibodies, and thyroid volume by ultrasonography. Eighty clinically healthy non-pregnant women were evaluated as controls. The median UIC was of 97.7 µg/L and 110.3 µg/L, respectively, in control and pregnant women.

Among the many specialized cell types, neurons are particularly dependent on mitochondria due to their complex morphology and regional energy needs. Here, we report a molecular mechanism by which nutrient availability in the form of extracellular glucose and the enzyme O-GlcNAc Transferase (OGT), whose activity depends on glucose availability, regulates mitochondrial motility in neurons. Activation of OGT diminishes mitochondrial motility. We establish the mitochondrial motor-adaptor protein Milton as a required substrate for OGT to arrest mitochondrial motility by mapping and mutating the key O-GlcNAcylated serine residues. We find that the GlcNAcylation state of Milton is altered by extracellular glucose and that OGT alters mitochondrial motility in vivo.

While mRNA translation accounts for the majority of cellular energy expenditure, it is unclear if RNA silencing regulates energy homeostasis. Here, we report that hepatic Argonaute 2 (Ago2)-mediated RNA silencing regulates both intrinsic energy production and consumption and disturbs energy metabolism in the pathogenesis of obesity. Ago2 regulates expression of specific miRNAs including miR-802, miR-103/107, and miR-148a/152, causing metabolic disruption, while simultaneously suppressing the expression of genes regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, including Hnf1β, Cav1, and Ampka1. Liver-specific Ago2-deletion enhances mitochondrial oxidation and ATP consumption associated with mRNA translation, which results in AMPK activation, and improves obesity-associated pathophysiology. Notably, hepatic Ago2-deficiency improves glucose metabolism in conditions of insulin receptor antagonist treatment, high-fat diet challenge, and hepatic AMPKα1-deletion. The regulation of energy metabolism by Ago2 provides a novel paradigm in which RNA silencing plays an integral role in determining basal metabolic activity in obesity-associated sequelae.

A role for endogenously released adenosine in this regulatory system was examined. Adding adenosine deaminase or 8-phenyltheophylline, an adenosine receptor antagonist, selectively inhibited the component of (Na+,K+)-ATPase activity maintained by the regulatory system; when inhibited with adenosine deaminase this component was restored by 2-chloroadenosine, 5'-N-ethylcarbox-amidoadenosine, and 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol, but not by forskolin (which also did not inhibit this component). Adenosine deaminase inhibited the rapid basal turnover of the discrete phosphatidylinositol pool, and 2-chloroadenosine then stimulated its turnover. Raising medium glucose from 5 to 10-30 mmol/l inhibits the regulatory system by making myo-inositol transport at a normal plasma level inadequate to maintain the replenishment of the discrete phosphatidylinositol pool. 2-Chloroadenosine stimulation of the ""adenosine-sensitive"" component of (Na+,K+)-ATPase activity was inhibited in tissue incubated with 30 mmol/l glucose and myo-inositol in a normal plasma level, but this effect was demonstrable when the medium myo-inositol was raised seven-fold.

MyrAkt1 signaling increased migratory and invasive cell traits, as detected by wound healing, zymography, and xenograft zebrafish assays, and promoted repair of DNA damage after radiotherapy and doxorubicin treatments, as revealed by nuclear detection of phosphorylated H2A histone family member X (γH2AX) through activation of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). Treatment with synthetic inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt was sufficient to completely revert the aggressive cell phenotype, while the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin failed to block cell dissemination.

Inhibitors of glycolysis decreased the rate of ATP biosynthesis more significantly in KFs suggesting their reliance on glycolysis. In contrast, ATP generation in NFs was derived mainly from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which was more compromised by mitochondrial/respiratory inhibitors. However, when fortified with excess exogenous respiratory substrates, ATP production was increased to a similar maximal level in both types of fibroblasts. In spite of this seemingly equal total capacity, ATP biosynthesis and intracellular ATP concentration were significantly higher in KFs, which further increased their ATP production when exposed to hypoxia and hypoxia-mimetics: desferrioxamine and cobalt chloride. This upregulation was again significantly compromised by glycolytic inhibitors. The rate of generation of reactive oxygen species was lower in KFs possibly due to their switch to aerobic glycolysis from mitochondrial OXPHOS.

This first clinical trial of a sucrose-formulated full-length rFVIII (rFVIII-FS) was conducted in previously treated patients (> or = 100 prior exposure days) with severe (<2% FVIII) hemophilia A in North America (NA) and Europe (EU). Pharmacokinetic profiles for rFVIII-FS were compared with those of currently licensed rFVIII product (Kogenate) in 35 patients. Safety and efficacy during home therapy were evaluated in 71 patients. The new formulation displayed a pharmacokinetic profile similar to that of rFVIII. Patients on home therapy received a cumulative total of 11,867 exposure days, 12,546 infusions, and 22,443,694 IU of rFVIII-FS. Of 2585 bleeds, 93.5% were treated with 1-2 infusions and 80.5% of responses were rated as excellent or good. No evidence of de novo inhibitor formation was observed. Only 0.27% of infusions were associated with any drug-related adverse event. Except for an episode of intermittent chest pain with palpitations which ceased after treatment with analgesics, associated adverse events were mild or moderate. Overall, rFVIII-FS provided excellent hemostatic control, was well-tolerated, and caused no significant adverse effects, thus demonstrating safety and efficacy for treatment of bleeds in patients with hemophilia A.

In order to ascertain the kinetics of glucose absorption in the premature infant and how rate of infusion and concentration affect absorption, jejunal glucose absorption kinetics were measured in 16 preterm infants by infusing 1, 10, and 100 mM glucose solutions in random order. Seventeen infants were perfused with glucose (100 micromol/min) by infusing 67 mM glucose at 1.5 ml/min and 133 mM glucose at 0.75 ml/min to determine the effect of changes in rate of infusion vs. concentration on glucose absorption. Km and Vmax were related to postnatal age. Km was correlated inversely with the percentage of feedings received as human milk. Antenatal administration of glucocorticoids appeared to increase Vmax. The higher infusion rate resulted in greater glucose absorption than the higher concentration glucose solution.

476,476,10802765,"Positron emission tomography (PET) using 18F-radiolabeled deoxyglucose (18F-FDG) is a sensitive procedure for detection of epileptogenic foci. Although alterations in glucose consumption are not restricted to the area of seizure generation itself, the magnitude and extent of cerebral metabolic disturbances induced by epileptic discharges can be detected. Despite two decades of epilepsy research using 18F-FDG-PET, little is known about the metabolic changes during therapy of focal epilepsy. We report on a child with frontal epilepsy with severe glucose hypometabolism that was nearly completely normalized during drug therapy. Interictal 18F-FDG-PET was performed at the onset of epilepsy and after optimized drug therapy in a 5-year-old boy with behavioral abnormalities and repetitive seizures of frontal origin with bifrontal interictal EEG slowing for 8 weeks. Both scans were anatomically matched; initial and intratherapeutic glucose metabolism were compared. In accordance with the epileptogenic focus as identified by EEG and ictal/interictal perfusion single-photon emission tomography (SPECT), bifrontal hypometabolism was depicted by 18F-FDG-PET. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was unremarkable. After dual-drug therapy (valproate, carbamazepine), the boy became seizure free, and his initial behavioral deficits disappeared. A control PET study after 3 months of therapy showed restored glucose consumption; the frontal EEG slowing was normalized. This case demonstrates that reduction of glucose metabolism in epileptogenic foci may be a result of reversible neuronal dysfunction that correlates with the electroclinical follow-up.

477,477,8581775,"Based on the analysis of fat distribution by computed tomography (CT) scans, the classification scheme for obesity should include visceral fat obesity in which fat accumulation is predominant in the intra-abdominal cavity. Obese subjects with visceral fat accumulation more frequently demonstrate impairment of glucose and lipid metabolism than those with subcutaneous fat accumulation. We have shown that visceral fat obesity is present in almost 90% of obese patients with ischemic heart disease. Even in non-obese subjects, visceral fat accumulation is correlated with glucose intolerance, hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Forty percent of non-obese subjects with coronary artery disease (CAD) had increased visceral fat. In non-obese subjects, visceral fat area assessed by abdominal CT at the level of the umbilicus correlates with metabolic risk factors, whereas in obese subjects the visceral fat area to subcutaneous fat area ratio provides a more significant correlation. From clinical and basic investigations, aging, sex hormones, excess intake of sucrose and lack of physical exercise have been suggested to be determinants for visceral fat accumulation. Since intra-abdominal fat (mesenteric and omentum fat) has been shown to have high activities of both lipogenesis and lipolysis, its accumulation can induce high levels of free fatty acids, a product of lipolysis, in portal circulation which go into the liver. Excess free fatty acids may cause the enhancement of lipid synthesis and gluconeogenesis as well as insulin resistance, resulting in hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance and hypertension and finally atherosclerosis. Thus we propose a disease entity, visceral fat syndrome, which may increase susceptibility to atherosclerosis due to multiple risk factors induced by visceral fat accumulation.

478,478,38319732,"Diffuse midline glioma (DMG), including tumors diagnosed in the brainstem (diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma; DIPG), are uniformly fatal brain tumors that lack effective treatment. Analysis of CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function gene deletion screens identified PIK3CA and MTOR as targetable molecular dependencies across patient derived models of DIPG, highlighting the therapeutic potential of the blood-brain barrier-penetrant PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitor, paxalisib. At the human-equivalent maximum tolerated dose, mice treated with paxalisib experienced systemic glucose feedback and increased insulin levels commensurate with patients using PI3K inhibitors. To exploit genetic dependence and overcome resistance while maintaining compliance and therapeutic benefit, we combined paxalisib with the antihyperglycemic drug metformin. Metformin restored glucose homeostasis and decreased phosphorylation of the insulin receptor in vivo, a common mechanism of PI3K-inhibitor resistance, extending survival of orthotopic models. DIPG models treated with paxalisib increased calcium-activated PKC signaling. The brain penetrant PKC inhibitor enzastaurin, in combination with paxalisib, synergistically extended the survival of multiple orthotopic patient-derived and immunocompetent syngeneic allograft models; benefits potentiated in combination with metformin and standard-of-care radiotherapy. Therapeutic adaptation was assessed using spatial transcriptomics and ATAC-Seq, identifying changes in myelination and tumor immune microenvironment crosstalk.

Altered autophagic activity has been implicated in the beta cells of patients with type 2 diabetes, and in the beta cells of obese diabetic rodents. Here, we show that autophagy was induced in beta cells by either a high-fat diet or a combined high-fat and high-glucose diet, but not by high-glucose alone. However, a high-glucose intake alone did increase beta cell mass and insulin secretion moderately. Depletion of Atg7, a necessary component of the autophagy pathway, in beta cells by pancreatic intra-ductal AAV8-shAtg7 infusion in C57BL/6 mice, resulted in decreased beta cell mass, impaired glucose tolerance, defective insulin secretion, and increased apoptosis when a combined high-fat and high-glucose diet was given, seemingly due to suppression of autophagy.

While the pathophysiology of TTTS is understood, the acute metabolic changes that fetuses experience from fetoscopic surgery are not. We sought to evaluate the changes in recipient metabolomic profile secondary to TTTS surgery. Amniotic fluid was collected at the beginning and end of four TTTS surgical cases performed from 12/2022-2/2023. Samples were immediately processed and evaluated via NMR-based Metabolomics Facility protocol. In univariate analysis, 12 metabolites (glucose, lactate, and 10 key amino acids) showed statistically significant changes between the beginning and end of the surgery. Among these, 11 metabolites decreased at the end, while only lactate increased. Supervised oPLS-DA modeling revealed pyruvate and lactate as the two metabolites most impact on the variance between cases, and that 40% of metabolomic changes could be attributed directly to the timing that the sample was taken (i.e., if pre- or postoperatively). These results indicate significant metabolic changes in the recipient twin during fetoscopic surgery for TTTS. These findings of decreased glucose, increased lactate, and decreased amnio acids would indicate increased catabolism during surgery.

483,483,38206362,"All forms of diabetes result from insufficient functional beta cell mass. Due to the relatively limited expression of several antioxidant enzymes, beta cells are highly vulnerable to pathological levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can lead to the reduction of functional beta cell mass. During early postnatal ages, both human and rodent beta cells go through a burst of proliferation that quickly declines with age. The exact mechanisms that account for neonatal beta cell proliferation are understudied but mitochondrial release of moderated ROS levels has been suggested as one of the main drivers. We previously showed that, apart from its conventional role in protecting beta cells from oxidative stress, the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is also essential for beta cell proliferation. We therefore hypothesised that NRF2, which is activated by ROS, plays an essential role in beta cell proliferation at early postnatal ages.

Human islets were obtained from the beta-Cell Transplant Unit (Brussels, Belgium). Exposure to 0.125 mmol/L palmitate or oleate for 48 h during tissue culture (RPMI-1640 and 5.5 mmol/L glucose) inhibited the postculture insulin response to 27 mmol/L glucose by 40% and 42% (P < 0.01 for difference).

Inhibition by D-beta-OHB was partially reversed by etomoxir, whereas exposure to D-beta-OHB failed to affect PDH and PDH kinase activities. We conclude that fatty acids as well as ketone bodies diminish B-cell responsiveness to glucose in human islets by way of a glucose-fatty acid cycle. Increased plasma concentrations of fatty acids and ketones are likely to be important factors behind the negative influences on B-cell function exerted by a diabetic state in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

490,490,38462210,"A maternal low-protein diet during pregnancy can increase children's susceptibility to diabetes mellitus in adulthood. However, whether long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in islets participate in the development of diabetes in adult offspring following maternal protein restriction is not fully understood. Female mice were fed a low-protein (LP) diet or control diet throughout gestation and lactation. The male offspring were then randomly divided into two groups according to maternal diet: offspring from control diet group dams (Ctrl group) and offspring from LP group dams (LP group). We observed the glucose metabolism of adult offspring. A lncRNA microarray was constructed for the islets from the LP group and Ctrl group to explore the differently expressed lncRNAs. Gene ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses were subsequently used to predict the functions of the differently expressed lncRNAs. The body weight from birth to 12 weeks of age was significantly lower in the LP offspring. Adult LP offspring exhibited impaired glucose tolerance and decreased insulin secretion, consistent with the reduction in β-cell proliferation. According to the lncRNA microarray, four lncRNAs, three upregulated lncRNAs, and one downregulated lncRNA were differently expressed in LP offspring islets compared with Ctrl offspring. Gene ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses revealed that these differentially expressed lncRNAs were mostly associated with the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α signaling pathway. Additionally, we validated the expression of these four differentially expressed lncRNAs via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Our findings demonstrated the expression patterns of lncRNAs in islets from adult offspring of mothers who consumed a maternal low-protein diet.

Salt iodination was made compulsory in 1993 but there has been no recent study, using modern techniques, of its benefits or harmful effects. Three hundred and sixty-seven schoolgirls between the ages of 11 and 16 years had ultrasound thyroid volume, free thyroxine (T4), free tri-iodothyronine (T3), thyrotrophin (TSH), anti-thyroglobulin (TgAb) and thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) antibodies, and urine iodine concentrations measured. Median ultrasound thyroid volume ranged from 4.8 ml (11-year-old girls) to 8.6 ml (16-year-old girls) with an age-related increase. Median urine iodine concentrations ranged from 105 to 152 microg/l. Free T4 and free T3 were normal in all, but TSH was elevated in four subjects (5. 53-41.29 mU/l). However, the prevalence of TgAb was markedly raised, ranging between 14.3% (11-year-old girls) and 69.7% (16-year-old girls) (P<0.03). In contrast, the prevalence of TPOAb was 10% or less in all age groups. Normal median thyroid volumes, iodine concentrations and thyroid function would indicate that iodine deficiency is not a major problem in this group. The high prevalence of TgAb, hitherto unreported, most likely reflects excessive iodination of Tg resulting in increased immunogenicity.

This innovative approach enhances the cellular uptake efficiency of 1,8-cineole (CIN) and facilitates targeted therapy for atherosclerosis. Our findings demonstrate the successful modification of the drug carrier with DEAE and MM, as validated by measurements of particle size, zeta potential, microscopic morphology, and western blotting analyses. Notably, cellular uptake experiments unveil a significant enhancement in cellular uptake efficiency due to DEAE modification. However, the introduction of monocyte cell membranes diminishes this effect in normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), although this efficiency is notably restored in HUVECs activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Through in vivo imaging investigations, we observe that the MM coating augments distribution in the spleen, brain, and atherosclerotic plaques, while concurrently diminishing distribution in the heart and kidneys. Animal studies corroborate these findings, illustrating that MM-CIN-BDS treatment curtails lipid parameters, dampens the expression of inflammatory factors and proteins, mitigates vascular tissue damage, and ultimately reduces the extent of atherosclerotic lesion areas.

Recently, there has been a paradigm shift and more attention is attributed to the effects of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) as one of the culprits of the obesity epidemic. In this review, we present the data invoking fructose intake with development of hepatic insulin resistance in human studies and discuss the pathways by which fructose impairs hepatic insulin action in experimental animal models. First, we described well-characterized pathways by which fructose metabolism indirectly leads to hepatic insulin resistance. These include unequivocal effects of fructose to promote de novo lipogenesis (DNL), impair fatty acid oxidation (FAO), induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and trigger hepatic inflammation. Additionally, we entertained the hypothesis that fructose can directly impede insulin signaling in the liver. This appears to be mediated by reduced insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) expression, increased protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1b) activity, whereas knockdown of ketohexokinase (KHK), the rate-limiting enzyme of fructose metabolism, increased insulin sensitivity.

An in vitro coculture system of hUC-MSCs and streptozotocin-induced islets was established to examine the morphology, apoptosis, and insulin secretion of the cocultured islets. Diabetic mouse models were injected with lenti-TIMP-1-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-hUC-MSCs to test the effect of hTIMP-1 on insulin levels and glucose tolerance in vivo. The expression of insulin and glucagon was evaluated by immunofluorescence staining. The results showed that coculture with hUC-MSCs or Lenti-TIMP-1-EGFP-hUC-MSCs improved islet viability rates. Lenti-TIMP-1-EGFP-hUC-MSC coculture increased the insulin and C-peptide secretion function of the cultured islets and increased the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-β1, interleukin-6, IL-10, and hTIMP-1. hUC-MSCs, especially those transfected with Lenti-hTIMP-1-EGFP, showed a strong protective effect in diabetic mice by alleviating weight loss and improving glucose and insulin metabolism.

E. coli C, but not E. coli K-12, contains a complete xylitol operon, and the viridans group streptococcus contains an incomplete xylitol operon used to metabolize the xylitol. Raman spectra from xylitol-exposed viridans group streptococcus exhibited significant changes that persisted even in progeny grown from the xylitol-exposed mother cells in a xylitol-free medium for 24 h. This behavior was not observed in the E. coli K-12. In both viridans group streptococcus and the E. coli C derivative HF4714, the metabolic intermediates are stably formed to create an anomaly in bacterial normal survival.

This could be a contributing factor for the known efficacy of xylitol when taken as a prophylactic measure to prevent or reduce occurrences of persistent infection. Specifically, these bacteria are causative agents for several important diseases of children such as pneumonia, otitis media, meningitis, and dental caries. If properly explored, such an inexpensive and harmless sugar-alcohol, alone or used in conjunction with fluoride, would pave the way to an alternative preventive therapy for these childhood diseases when the causative pathogens have become resistant to modern medicines such as antibiotics and vaccine immunotherapy.

The incidence of AED-related rash was determined in 3793 outpatients, taking at least one of the AEDs-carbamazepine (CBZ), valproic acid (VPA), phenytoin (PHT), phenobarbital (PB), clonazepam (CZP), oxcarbazepine (OXC), lamotrigine (LTG), gabapentin (GBP), topiramate (TPM), levetiracetam (LEV) and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). We have performed telephone interviews among all patients with AEDs-related rash.

In this study, we evaluate the effect of TMP to provide protection against hypoxia aggravated high-glucose associated cellular apoptosis. The cytoprotective effect of TMP against high glucose induced cellular damages was determined on embryo derived H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells that were subjected to 5% hypoxia for 24 h and subjected to different duration of 33 mM high glucose challenge. Further, the involvement of HIF-1α and BNIP3 in cellular damage and the mechanism of protection of TMP were determined by overexpression and silencing HIF-1α and BNIP3 protein expression. The results show that hypoxic effects on cell viability aggravates with high glucose challenge and this augmentative effect is mediated through BNIP3 in H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells. However, TMP administration effectively reversed the augmented HIF-1α levels and BNIP3 elevation. TMP improved the survival of H9c2 cells and effectively suppressed apoptosis in H9c2 cells. Further comparison on the effects of TMP on H9c2 cells challenged with high glucose and those challenged with hypoxia show that TMP precisely regulated the hypoxic intensified apoptotic effects in high-glucose condition. The results clearly show that flavoring agent-TMP attenuates cytotoxicity amplified by hypoxia challenge in high glucose condition by destabilizing HIF-1α.

This synchronization enables organisms to anticipate and adapt to predictable environmental changes, including nutrient availability. However, modern lifestyles characterized by irregular eating and sleeping habits disrupt this synchrony, leading to metabolic disorders such as obesity and metabolic syndrome, evidenced by higher obesity rates among shift workers. Conversely, circadian disturbances are also associated with reduced nutrient absorption and an increased risk of malnutrition in populations such as the critically ill or the elderly. The precise mechanisms of these disturbances in leading to either overnutrition or undernutrition is complex and not yet fully understood. Glucose, a crucial energy source, is closely linked to obesity when consumed excessively and to weight loss when intake is reduced, which suggests that circadian regulation of glucose metabolism is a key factor connecting circadian disturbances with nutritional outcomes. In this review, we describe how the biological clock in various tissues regulates glucose metabolism, with a primary focus on studies utilizing animal models.

Circulating EVs isolated from human plasma were co-cultured with mammalian liver cells to investigate the potential induction of hepatic insulin resistance by GDM-EVs using glucose output assays, Seahorse assays, metabolomics, fluxomics, qRT-PCR, bioinformatics analyses, and luciferase assays. Our findings demonstrated that hepatocytes exposed to GDM-EVs exhibited increased gluconeogenesis, attenuated energy metabolism, and upregulated oxidative stress. Particularly noteworthy was the discovery of miR-1299 as the predominant miRNA in GDM-EVs, which directly targeting the 3'-untranslated regions (UTR) of STAT3. Our experiments involving loss- and gain-of-function revealed that miR-1299 inhibits the insulin signaling pathway by regulating the STAT3/FAM3A axis, resulting in increased insulin resistance through the modulation of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress in hepatocytes. Moreover, experiments conducted in vivo on mice inoculated with GDM-EVs confirmed the development of glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and downregulation of STAT3 and FAM3A. These results provide insights into the role of miR-1299 derived from circulating GDM-EVs in the progression of insulin resistance in hepatic cells via the STAT3/FAM3A axis and downstream metabolic reprogramming.

Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the expression of BASP1 in patients with diabetes mellitus and concomitant coronary heart disease was increased. High glucose induced the upregulation of BASP1 expression in endothelial cells, and showed a time-dependent relationship. Silencing of BASP1 alleviated the damage of high glucose to endothelial cells. BASP1 regulated EGFR positively.

546,546,25670824,"The human mammary gland is capable of de novo synthesis of glucose and galactose (hexoneogenesis); however, the carbon source is incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the role of acetate, glutamine, lactate and glycerol as potential carbon sources for hexoneogenesis. Healthy breastfeeding women were studied following a 24-h fast on two occasions separated by 1-3 wk. Five women were infused with [U-¹³C]lactate or [1,2-¹³C₂]glutamine and five women with [U-¹³C]glycerol or [1,2-¹³C₂]acetate. Enrichments of ¹³C in plasma and milk substrates were analyzed using GC-MS. Infusion of labeled lactate, glycerol, glutamine, and acetate resulted in plasma glucose being 22.0±3.7, 11.2±1.0, 2.5±0.5, and 1.3±0.2% labeled, respectively. Lactate, glutamine, or acetate did not contribute to milk glucose or galactose (0-2%). In milk, ¹³C-free glycerol enrichment was one-fourth that in plasma but free glycerol concentration in milk was fourfold higher than in plasma. Using [U-¹³C]glycerol and by accounting for tracer dilution, glycerol alone contributed to 10±2 and 69±11% of the hexoneogenesis of milk glucose and galactose, respectively. During [U-¹³C]glycerol infusion, the ratio of M₃ enrichment on 4-6 carbons/M₃ on 1-3 carbons of galactose was higher (P<0.05, 1.22±0.05) than those of glucose in plasma (1.05±0.03) and milk (1.07±0.02). Reanalysis of samples from a previous study involving [U-¹³C]glucose infusion alone suggested labeling a portion of galactose consistent with pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity.

Thus, China has been assessed as a country with more than adequate iodine levels. This survey aimed to investigate the current iodine status in China and the effects of an increased iodine intake on the spectrum and prevalence of thyroid disorders. A total of 15,008 adult subjects from 10 cities in eastern and central China were investigated. Serum thyrotropin (TSH), thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb), thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb), and urine iodine concentration (UIC) were measured, and an ultrasonography of the thyroid was performed in all subjects. Free thyroxine (fT4) and free triiodothyronine (fT3) levels were only measured if the serum TSH was outside the normal range. The median UIC values were 197 μg/L in school-age children (SAC) and 205 μg/L in a cohort population. Six cities were classified as regions with adequate iodine intake (AII), and four cities as regions with more than adequate iodine intake (MTAII), according to median SAC UIC. The prevalence of clinical hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, and positive thyroid antibodies was significantly higher in MTAII cities than it was in AII cities. Moreover, the prevalence of clinical hyperthyroidism (1.1% vs. 0.8%, p = 0.033) and Graves' disease (0.8% vs. 0.5%, p = 0.019) also significantly increased in MTAII cities.

553,553,32963229,"The ability to absorb ingested nutrients is an essential function of all metazoans and utilizes a wide array of nutrient transporters found on the absorptive enterocytes of the small intestine. A unique population of patients has previously been identified with severe congenital malabsorptive diarrhea upon ingestion of any enteral nutrition. The intestines of these patients are macroscopically normal, but lack enteroendocrine cells (EECs), suggesting an essential role for this rare population of nutrient-sensing cells in regulating macronutrient absorption. Here, we use human and mouse models of EEC deficiency to identify an unappreciated role for the EEC hormone peptide YY in regulating ion-coupled absorption of glucose and dipeptides. We find that peptide YY is required in the small intestine to maintain normal electrophysiology in the presence of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, a potent stimulator of ion secretion classically produced by enteric neurons. Administration of peptide YY to EEC-deficient mice restores normal electrophysiology, improves glucose and peptide absorption, diminishes diarrhea and rescues postnatal survival. These data suggest that peptide YY is a key regulator of macronutrient absorption in the small intestine and may be a viable therapeutic option to treat patients with electrolyte imbalance and nutrient malabsorption.

554,554,26396287,"Wild apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) commonly known as chulli is a potential fruit widely distributed in North-West Himalayan regions of the world. The fruits are good source of carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals besides having attractive colour and typical flavour. Unlike table purpose varieties of apricots like New Castle, the fruits of wild apricot are unsuitable for fresh consumption because of its high acid and low sugar content. However, the fruits are traditionally utilized for open sun drying, pulping to prepare different products such as jams, chutney and naturally fermented and distilled liquor. But, scientific literature on processing and value addition of wild apricot is scanty. Preparation of jam with 25 % wild apricot +75 % apple showed maximum score for organoleptic characteristics due to better taste and colour. Osmotic dehydration has been found as a suitable method for drying of wild type acidic apricots. A good quality sauce using wild apricot pulp and tomato pulp in the ratio of 1:1 has been prepared, while chutney of good acceptability prepared from wild apricot pulp (100 %) has also been documented. Preparation of apricot-soy protein enriched products like apricot-soya leather, toffee and fruit bars has been reported, which are reported to meet the protein requirements of adult and children as per the recommendations of ICMR. Besides these processed products, preparation of alcoholic beverages like wine, vermouth and brandy from wild apricot fruits has also been reported by various researchers. Further, after utilization of pulp for preparation of value added products, the stones left over have been successfully utilized for oil extraction which has medicinal and cosmetic value. The traditional method of oil extraction has been reported to be unhygienic and result in low oil yield with poor quality, whereas improved mechanical method of oil extraction has been found to produce good quality oil. The apricot kernel oil and press cake have successfully been utilized for preparation of various value added products such as facial cream, lip balm, essential oil and protein isolate with good quality attributes and consumer acceptability. However, no scientific information on utilization of shells remained after kernel separation is available, but the shells are traditionally utilized for burning purpose during winters by the farmers.

558,558,26830550,"Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor for the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, alkylglycerol monooxygenase, and nitric oxide synthases (NOS). Inborn errors of BH4 metabolism lead to severe insufficiency of brain monoamine neurotransmitters while augmentation of BH4 by supplementation or stimulation of its biosynthesis is thought to ameliorate endothelial NOS (eNOS) dysfunction, to protect from (cardio-) vascular disease and/or prevent obesity and development of the metabolic syndrome. We have previously reported that homozygous knock-out mice for the 6-pyruvolytetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS; Pts-ko/ko) mice with no BH4 biosynthesis die after birth. Here we generated a Pts-knock-in (Pts-ki) allele expressing the murine PTPS-p.Arg15Cys with low residual activity (15% of wild-type in vitro) and investigated homozygous (Pts-ki/ki) and compound heterozygous (Pts-ki/ko) mutants. All mice showed normal viability and depending on the severity of the Pts alleles exhibited up to 90% reduction of PTPS activity concomitant with neopterin elevation and mild reduction of total biopterin while blood L-phenylalanine and brain monoamine neurotransmitters were unaffected. Yet, adult mutant mice with compromised PTPS activity (i.e., Pts-ki/ko, Pts-ki/ki or Pts-ko/wt) had increased body weight and elevated intra-abdominal fat. Comprehensive phenotyping of Pts-ki/ki mice revealed alterations in energy metabolism with proportionally higher fat content but lower lean mass, and increased blood glucose and cholesterol. Transcriptome analysis indicated changes in glucose and lipid metabolism. Furthermore, differentially expressed genes associated with obesity, weight loss, hepatic steatosis, and insulin sensitivity were consistent with the observed phenotypic alterations. We conclude that reduced PTPS activity concomitant with mildly compromised BH4-biosynthesis leads to abnormal body fat distribution and abdominal obesity at least in mice.

We observed lower HbA1c values in early follow-up 4.5 to 6.0 years before diagnosis in the progressors when compared to the same time in children with a single biochemical autoantibody or low-risk (ICA only and transient) participants, who did not progress to clinical type 1 diabetes. However, no such differences were observed in OGTTs or random plasma glucose. The variation was minimal in glucose values in the low-risk groups. We report the possibility of early alteration in glucose metabolism in future progressors. This could suggest early defects in multiple glucose-regulating hormones.

Recent epidemiological findings have raised concerns about its potential adverse health effects, although the specific toxic mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the metabolic toxicity of gestational PFBS exposure in maternal rats. Pregnant Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned to three groups and administered either 3% starch gel (control), 5, or 50 mg/kg bw·d PFBS. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) and lipid profiles were measured, and integrated omics analysis (transcriptomics and non-targeted metabolomics) was employed to identify changes in genes and metabolites and their relationships with metabolic phenotypes. The results revealed that rats exposed to 50 mg/kg bw·d PFBS exhibited a significant decrease in 1-h glucose levels and the area under the curve (AUC) of OGTT compared with the starch group. Transcriptomics analysis indicated significant alterations in gene expression related to cytochrome P450 exogenous metabolism, glutathione metabolism, bile acid secretion, tumor pathways, and retinol metabolism. Differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) were enriched in pathways such as pyruvate metabolism, the glucagon signaling pathway, central carbon metabolism in cancer, and the citric acid cycle. Co-enrichment analysis and pairwise correlation analysis among genes, metabolites, and outcomes identified several differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including Gstm1, Kit, Adcy1, Gck, Ppp1r3c, Ppp1r3d, and DEMs such as fumaric acid, L-lactic acid, 4-hydroxynonenal, and acetylvalerenolic acid. These DEGs and DEMs may play a role in the modulation of glucolipid metabolic pathways. In conclusion, our results suggest that gestational exposure to PFBS may induce molecular perturbations in glucose homeostasis. These findings provide insights into the potential mechanisms contributing to the heightened risk of abnormal glucose tolerance associated with PFBS exposure.

Our study was planned as a randomized controlled trial in term infants being followed up in the neonatal intensive care unit and maternity ward. To reduce pain during collection of venous blood or heel lance reflexology on the soles of the foot, 24% sucrose solution, kangaroo care, and classical music listening were applied to the infants. The Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) was used to assess newborns during acute pain. A total of 300 patients were enrolled in the study. Higher pain scores and crying times were observed during heel blood collection. All analgesic methods significantly reduced NIPS scores during heel blood collection. Sucrose was the most effective method, followed by reflexology. The best method that significantly shortened the crying time was again sucrose solution followed by reflexology, kangaroo care, and classical music, during heel blood collection. However, none of the nonpharmacologic methods was effective during venous blood collection. Although sucrose was the most effective method, reflexology has significant positive effects, especially on average heartbeat, reducing pain, and shortening crying times during heel blood sampling.

There is significant risk of relapse, largely because effective pharmacologic treatments cannot be continued long term because of concern for significant adverse events. Zonisamide (ZNS) and topiramate (TPM) are commonly used to prevent relapse, and the purpose of this study was to specifically evaluate the efficacy of ZNS and TPM as agents for secondary prevention of infantile spasms. Patients with video-electroencephalography (EEG) confirmed resolution of infantile spasms were retrospectively identified. Relevant clinical data were systematically collected, including lead time from onset of spasms to successful treatment response, etiology of infantile spasms, number of treatment failures prior to response, timing of relapse, and detailed exposure data for ZNS and TPM. We identified 106 patients with response to hormonal therapy (n = 58), vigabatrin (n = 25), or surgery (n = 23). To prevent relapse of infantile spasms, 37 patients received ZNS, 34 received TPM, 3 received both ZNS and TPM, and 38 patients received neither ZNS nor TPM. There were 44 relapses, occurring a median of 6.9 (3.2-10.8) months after initial response. Time to relapse was not affected by treatment with ZNS or TPM. Relapse was less likely among patients who were older (hazard ratio 0.97 [per month], p = 0.036) and those who responded to surgical resection (hazard ratio = 0.28, p = 0.017). Of note, we identified a relatively refractory cohort with multiple treatment failures and long lead time to initial response. In this refractory cohort, neither ZNS nor TPM was successful in preventing relapse of infantile spasms, despite relatively high dosages.

577,577,30522498,"The 'classic' organic acidaemias (OAs) (propionic, methylmalonic and isovaleric) typically present in neonates or infants as acute metabolic decompensation with encephalopathy. This is frequently accompanied by severe hyperammonaemia and constitutes a metabolic emergency, as increased ammonia levels and accumulating toxic metabolites are associated with life-threatening neurological complications. Repeated and frequent episodes of hyperammonaemia (alongside metabolic decompensations) can result in impaired growth and intellectual disability, the severity of which increase with longer duration of hyperammonaemia. Due to the urgency required, diagnostic evaluation and initial management of patients with suspected OAs should proceed simultaneously. Paediatricians, who do not have specialist knowledge of metabolic disorders, have the challenging task of facilitating a timely diagnosis and treatment. This article outlines how the underlying pathophysiology and biochemistry of the organic acidaemias are closely linked to their clinical presentation and management, and provides practical advice for decision-making during early, acute hyperammonaemia and metabolic decompensation in neonates and infants with organic acidaemias. The acute management of hyperammonaemia in organic acidaemias requires administration of intravenous calories as glucose and lipids to promote anabolism, carnitine to promote urinary excretion of urinary organic acid esters, and correction of metabolic acidosis with the substitution of bicarbonate for chloride in intravenous fluids. It may also include the administration of ammonia scavengers such as sodium benzoate or sodium phenylbutyrate. Treatment with N-carbamyl-L-glutamate can rapidly normalise ammonia levels by stimulating the first step of the urea cycle. Our understanding of optimal treatment strategies for organic acidaemias is still evolving. Timely diagnosis is essential and best achieved by the early identification of hyperammonaemia and metabolic acidosis.

Common sensitivities identified, predominantly through patch testing, were to benzoic acid (36%) food additives (33%), perfumes and flavourings (28%), cinnamaldehyde (27%), cinnamon (17%), benzoates (17%) and chocolate (11%). The cinnamon- and benzoate-free diet has been shown to provide benefit in 54-78% of patients with 23% requiring no adjunctive therapies. A negative or positive patch test result to cinnamaldehyde, and benzoates did not predict dietary outcome. The most concentrated source of benzoate exposure is from food preservatives. Use of liquid enteral formulas can offer a further dietary therapy, particularly in children with orofacial granulomatosis.

Across phylogeny, volatile anesthetics selectively inhibit mitochondrial complex I, and they also depress presynaptic excitatory signaling. To explore how these effects are linked, we studied isoflurane effects on presynaptic vesicle cycling and ATP levels in hippocampal cultured neurons from wild-type and complex I mutant (Ndufs4(KO)) mice. To bypass complex I, we measured isoflurane effects on anesthetic sensitivity in mice expressing NADH dehydrogenase (NDi1).

However, it is unclear whether cancer cell lines employ a high level of glycolysis comparable to that of the original cancers from which they were derived, even if their culture conditions are changed to physiologically relevant oxygen concentrations. From three childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients we established three new pairs of cell lines in both atmospheric (20%) and physiologic (bone marrow level, 5%) oxygen concentrations. Cell lines established in 20% oxygen exhibited lower proliferation, survival, expression of glycolysis genes, glucose consumption, and lactate production. Interestingly, the effects of oxygen concentration used during cell line initiation were only partially reversible when established cell cultures were switched from one oxygen concentration to another for eight weeks. These observations indicate that ALL cell lines established at atmospheric oxygen concentration can exhibit relatively low levels of glycolysis and these levels are semi-permanent, suggesting that physiologic oxygen concentrations may be needed from the time of cell line initiation to preserve the high level of glycolysis commonly exhibited by leukemias in vivo.

The objective of this research was to examine the alterations in liver transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles in offspring rats at postnatal day (PND) 30 following gestational and lactational exposure to PFOS (from gestational day 1 to 20 and PND 1 to 21). Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were separated into a control group (3% starch gel solution, oral gavage) and a PFOS exposure group (0.03 mg/kg body weight per day, oral gavage). Histopathological changes in liver sections were observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Biochemical analysis was conducted to evaluate changes in glucose and lipid metabolism. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses were utilized to identify significant genes and metabolites associated with alterations of liver glucose and lipid metabolism through an integrated multi-omics analysis. No significant differences were found in the measured biochemical parameters. In total, 167 significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to processes such as steroid biosynthesis, PPAR signaling pathway, and fat digestion and absorption were identified in offspring rats in the PFOS exposure group.

We describe the widely used neonatal ASDs, namely phenobarbital, phenytoin, midazolam, and levetiracetam, in addition to potential ASDs, including lidocaine, topiramate, and bumetanide.

597,597,8222231,"We have developed an automated enzymatic assay for quantitation of inulin in plasma and urine that can be performed on the Cobas FARA II. In the assay, inulinase hydrolyzes inulin to fructose, and sorbitol dehydrogenase converts fructose to sorbitol with consumption of NADH, which is detected by spectrophotometry. The method incorporates a sample blank (inactivated inulinase) for each specimen to subtract contributions of endogenous fructose. Recovery of fructose or inulin was near 100%, with linearity to 300 mg/L. The enzymatic assay (y) agreed well with an anthrone comparison method (x) for analysis of inulin in both urine specimens (y = 1.00x - 138; Sy/x = 714) and plasma specimens (y = 1.00x - 3.5; Sy/x = 5.5). Glucose at 300 mg/L yielded an apparent inulin value of 1.3 mg/L in the enzymatic assay, but reacted at nearly 10% equivalency in the anthrone assay. Interferences from sorbitol, mannitol, and xylitol were negligible. CVs for day-to-day precision studies were 1-4%.

599,599,33567453,"Argonaute 2 (Ago2) is the main component of the RNA-induced silencing complex. We recently showed that liver-specific Ago2-deficiency in mice (L-Ago2 knockout [KO] mice) enhances mitochondrial oxidation and alleviates obesity-associated pathophysiology. However, the precise mechanisms behind the role of hepatic Ago2 in regulating the mitochondrial oxidation associated with glucose metabolism are still unclear. Here, we show that hepatic Ago2 regulates the function of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) for oxidative metabolism. In both genetically and diet-induced severe obese conditions, L-Ago2 KO mice developed obesity and hepatic steatosis but exhibited improved glucose metabolism accompanied by lowered expression levels of pathologic microRNAs (miRNAs), including miR-802, miR-103/107, and miR-152, and enhanced expression of PPARα and its target genes regulating oxidative metabolism in the liver. We then investigated the role of hepatic Ago2 in the outcomes of vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) in which PPARα plays a crucial role in a drastic transcription reprogram associated with improved glycemia post VSG. Whereas VSG reduced body weight and improved fatty liver in wild-type mice, these effects were not observed in hepatic Ago2-deficient mice. Conversely, glucose metabolism was improved in a hepatic Ago2-dependent manner post VSG. Treating Ago2-deficient primary hepatocytes with WY-14643, a PPARα agonist, showed that Ago2-deficiency enhances sensitivity to WY-14643 and increases expression of PPARα target genes and mitochondrial oxidation. Our findings suggest that hepatic Ago2 function is intrinsically associated with PPARα that links Ago2-mediated RNA silencing with mitochondrial functions for oxidation and obesity-associated pathophysiology.

600,600,25568163,"Glucagon action is transduced by a G protein-coupled receptor located in liver, kidney, intestinal smooth muscle, brain, adipose tissue, heart, pancreatic β-cells, and placenta. Genetically modified animal models have provided important clues about the role of glucagon and its receptor (Gcgr) beyond glucose control. The PubMed database was searched for articles published between 1995 and 2014 using the key terms glucagon, glucagon receptor, signaling, and animal models. Lack of Gcgr signaling has been associated with: i) hypoglycemic pregnancies, altered placentation, poor fetal growth, and increased fetal-neonatal death; ii) pancreatic glucagon cell hyperplasia and hyperglucagonemia; iii) altered body composition, energy state, and protection from diet-induced obesity; iv) impaired hepatocyte survival; v) altered glucose, lipid, and hormonal milieu; vi) altered metabolic response to prolonged fasting and exercise; vii) reduced gastric emptying and increased intestinal length; viii) altered retinal function; and ix) prevention of the development of diabetes in insulin-deficient mice. Similar phenotypic findings were observed in the hepatocyte-specific deletion of Gcgr. Glucagon action has been involved in the modulation of sweet taste responsiveness, inotropic and chronotropic effects in the heart, satiety, glomerular filtration rate, secretion of insulin, cortisol, ghrelin, GH, glucagon, and somatostatin, and hypothalamic signaling to suppress hepatic glucose production. Glucagon (α) cells under certain conditions can transdifferentiate into insulin (β) cells. These findings suggest that glucagon signaling plays an important role in multiple organs. Thus, treatment options designed to block Gcgr activation in diabetics may have implications beyond glucose homeostasis.

Human CFs were transfected with a miR-32-5p inhibitor or mimic and were treated with a normal concentration or a high concentration of glucose. Flow cytometry analysis was performed to identify cardiac fibroblasts by examining vimentin, fibronectin (FN) and α-actin expression in human CFs. qRT-PCR and western blot assays were performed to confirm the expression of miR-32-5p, DUSP1 and cardiac fibrosis relevant proteins. The proliferation of CFs was assessed by using MTT assay. An immunocytofluorescent staining assay was performed to determine the protein level of α-SMA and to investigate the degree of phenotypic changes in human CFs. The specific relationship between miR-32-5p and DUSP1 was investigated by a dual luciferase reporter assay. Cell apoptosis rates were measured with flow cytometry and the annexin V-FITC and propidine iodide (PI) staining method. A luciferase reporter assay indicated that miR-32-5p could directly target DUSP1. High glucose levels resulted in the overexpression of miR-32-5p, which downregulated DUSP1 expression. Both the upregulation of miR-32-5p and the downregulation of DUSP1 promoted cell apoptosis, proliferation and phenotypic changes in human CFs. All findings in this study provide further evidence for the positive effects of miR-32-5p on cell proliferation and the phenotypic changes in CFs by inhibiting DUSP1 expression, and reveal that miR-32-5p could serve as prognostic diagnostic target for cardiac fibrosis.

Recent studies have found that patients with AD generally experience abnormal glucose metabolism. Xylitol is a functional sugar alcohol, which has been reported to regulate glucose metabolism. The present study was designed to determine whether xylitol can alleviate cognitive impairment in AD mice. In the current research, 5% xylitol was supplemented in the diet to treat APP/PS1 transgenic AD mice for 2 months. Cognitive ability was measured by the Morris water maze, and anxiety-like behaviors were examined by open-field experiment. Hippocampal cellular apoptosis and mitochondria pathway related apoptotic proteins were tested by TUNEL staining and immunoblotting, respectively. By LC-MS, plasma levels of glucose metabolism intermediates and related amino acids were evaluated. Results showed that xylitol could significantly ameliorate anxiety-like activity in AD mice by partially regulating expression levels of mitochondrial pathway-related apoptotic proteins. Xylitolregulated glucose metabolism may play an important role in the process. The current study suggests that xylitol may be a potential candidate for improving neuropsychiatric behavior in AD by regulating the levels of TCA cycle intermediates and related amino acids in glucose metabolism.

MM muscle shows tissue-specific induction of the mitochondrial folate cycle, purine metabolism, and imbalanced and increased dNTP pools, consistent with progressive mtDNA mutagenesis. IOSCA-TWINKLE is predicted to hydrolyze dNTPs, consistent with low dNTP pools and mtDNA depletion in the disease. MM muscle also modifies the cytoplasmic one-carbon cycle, transsulfuration, and methylation, as well as increases glucose uptake and its utilization for de novo serine and glutathione biosynthesis.

Having previously demonstrated that gas-1(fc21) complex I subunit ndufs2-/-C. elegans have short lifespan that can be significantly rescued with 17 different metabolic modifiers, signaling modifiers or antioxidants, here we evaluated 11 random combinations of these three treatment classes on gas-1(fc21) lifespan. Synergistic rescue occurred only with glucose, nicotinic acid and N-acetylcysteine (Glu + NA + NAC), yielding improved mitochondrial membrane potential that reflects integrated respiratory chain function, without exacerbating oxidative stress, and while reducing mitochondrial stress (UPRmt) and improving intermediary metabolic disruptions at the levels of the transcriptome, steady-state metabolites and intermediary metabolic flux. Equimolar Glu + NA + NAC dosing in a zebrafish vertebrate model of rotenone-based complex I inhibition synergistically rescued larval activity, brain death, lactate, ATP and glutathione levels. Overall, these data provide objective preclinical evidence in two evolutionary-divergent animal models of mitochondrial complex I disease to demonstrate that combinatorial Glu + NA + NAC therapy significantly improved animal resiliency, even in the face of stressors that cause severe metabolic deficiency, thereby preventing acute neurologic and biochemical decompensation.

Despite a general feeling that it was good, and present in dentifrices or dietary supplements, most participants had little knowledge about fluoride. Concerns were raised about cardio-vascular and other possibly deleterious effects if an increase in salt consumption occurred because fluoridated salt was viewed as having 'extra' benefits. Once informed about fluoride's safety and role in caries prevention, most participants expressed willingness to use fluoridated salt, especially if it benefitted children. Reassurance about its safety and benefits, and demonstration of its taste, were important aspects of acceptance. Taste was paramount. Participants would not consume more fluoridated salt than their current salt as that would result in unpleasant changes in food flavor and taste.

Aim of the study was to define 1HG cutoffs diagnostic of incident impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in youths with obesity, and to evaluate prevalence and association of cutoffs identified in the cohort and from the literature (133 and 155 mg/dl) to cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a population of youths with obesity. This is a longitudinal study of 154 youths to identify 1HG cutoffs, and cross-sectional study of 2295 youths to estimate prevalence of high 1HG and association to CVD. Receiver-operating characteristic curves (ROC) were used to establish 1HG cutoffs, and univariate regression analyses to test association of 1HG to blood pressure, lipids and aminotransferases. ROC analysis identified the 1HG cutoff of 159 mg/dl as having diagnostic accuracy of IGT with area under the ROC 0.82 (95% CI 0.66-0.98), sensitivity 0.86% and specificity 0.79%. In the cross-sectional population, prevalence of high 1HG was 36% and 15% for 133 and 155 mg/dl cutoffs, respectively, and 17% for the 159 mg/dl value. All the examined cutoffs were significantly associated with worse lipid profile, liver function test, reduced insulin sensitivity, secretion and disposition index. High 1HG is marker of persistent IGT and increased risk of metabolic abnormalities in youths. The 155 mg/dl cutoff is a convenient estimate in young people but longitudinal studies with retinopathy and overt diabetes as end points are advised to verify the 1HG cutoff with the best diagnostic accuracy.

To explain the mechanisms, we analyzed the AF composition of recipient sacs from TTTS pregnancies vs. GA-matched healthy singleton controls and found glucose, protein and lactate dehydrogenase activity were all significantly lower in TTTS sacs consistent with over-dilution of recipient's AF (~2-fold). In-vitro exposure of healthy amniochorion to analogous dilutional stress conditions recapitulated the histologic changes and induced apoptosis and autophagy. Alteration in structural integrity of the recipient's amniochorion, possibly in response to dilution stress, along with ineffective repair mechanisms may explain the increased incidence of preterm birth post-FLS.

620,620,29867232,"Unsuppressed hepatic glucose production (HGP) contributes substantially to glucose intolerance and diabetes, which can be modeled by the genetic inactivation of hepatic insulin receptor substrate 1 (Irs1) and Irs2 (LDKO mice). We previously showed that glucose intolerance in LDKO mice is resolved by hepatic inactivation of the transcription factor FoxO1 (that is, LTKO mice)-even though the liver remains insensitive to insulin. Here, we report that insulin sensitivity in the white adipose tissue of LDKO mice is also impaired but is restored in LTKO mice in conjunction with normal suppression of HGP by insulin. To establish the mechanism by which white adipose tissue insulin signaling and HGP was regulated by hepatic FoxO1, we identified putative hepatokines-including excess follistatin (Fst)-that were dysregulated in LDKO mice but normalized in LTKO mice. Knockdown of hepatic Fst in the LDKO mouse liver restored glucose tolerance, white adipose tissue insulin signaling and the suppression of HGP by insulin; however, the expression of Fst in the liver of healthy LTKO mice had the opposite effect. Of potential clinical significance, knockdown of Fst also improved glucose tolerance in high-fat-fed obese mice, and the level of serum Fst was reduced in parallel with glycated hemoglobin in obese individuals with diabetes who underwent therapeutic gastric bypass surgery. We conclude that Fst is a pathological hepatokine that might be targeted for diabetes therapy during hepatic insulin resistance.

621,621,37765288,"It is well established that treatment regime compliance is linked to the acceptability of a pharmaceutical formulation, and hence also to therapeutic outcomes. To that end, acceptability must be assessed during the development of all pharmaceutical products and especially for those intended for paediatric patients. Although acceptability is a multifaceted concept, poor sensory characteristics often contribute to poor patient acceptability. In particular, poor taste is often cited as a major reason for many patients, especially children, to refuse to take their medicine. It is thus important to understand and, as far as possible, optimise the sensory characteristics and, in particular, the taste/flavour/mouthfeel of the formulation throughout the development of the product. Sensory analysis has been widely practiced, providing objective data concerning the sensory aspects of food and cosmetic products. In this paper, we present proposals concerning how the well-established principles of sensory analysis can best be applied to pharmaceutical product development, allowing objective, scientifically valid, sensory data to be obtained safely. We briefly discuss methodologies that may be helpful in reducing the number of samples that may need to be assessed by human volunteers. However, it is only possible to be sure whether or not the sensory characteristics of a pharmaceutical product are non-aversive to potential users by undertaking sensory assessments in human volunteers. Testing is also required during formulation assessment and to ensure that the sensory characteristics remain acceptable throughout the product shelf life. We provide a risk assessment procedure to aid developers to define where studies are low risk, the results of a survey of European regulators on their views concerning such studies, and detailed guidance concerning the types of sensory studies that can be undertaken at each phase of product development, along with guidance about the practicalities of performing such sensory studies. We hope that this guidance will also lead to the development of internationally agreed standards between industry and regulators concerning how these aspects should be measured and assessed throughout the development process and when writing and evaluating regulatory submissions. Finally, we hope that the guidance herein will help formulators as they seek to develop better medicines for all patients and, in particular, paediatric patients.

Both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches are used to reduce the negative impact of pain and agitation in the preterm infant, with concerns emerging over the adverse effects of analgesia and sedatives. Considering benefits and risks of available treatments, units must develop a stepwise algorithm to prevent, assess, and treat pain. Nonpharmacologic interventions should be consistently utilized prior to mild to moderately painful procedures. Sucrose may be utilized judiciously as an adjunctive therapy for minor painful procedures. Rapidly acting opioids (fentanyl or remifentanil) form the backbone of analgesia for moderately painful procedures.

All 2,600 children exposed to antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy were compared to all 771,412 unexposed children born to women without epilepsy. Children of untreated mothers with epilepsy served as an internal control group. The main outcomes were small for gestational age birth weight and head circumference, and major congenital malformations. Children exposed to antiepileptic drugs had a moderate risk of growth restriction.

Genetic ablation of CNS Rap1 protects mice from dietary obesity, glucose imbalance, and insulin resistance in the periphery and from HFD-induced neuropathological changes in the hypothalamus, including diminished cellular leptin sensitivity and increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and inflammation. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of CNS Rap1 signaling normalizes hypothalamic ER stress and inflammation, improves cellular leptin sensitivity, and reduces body weight in mice with dietary obesity. We also demonstrate that Rap1 mediates leptin resistance via interplay with ER stress.

In this study, lumbar cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) was obtained immediately after blood sampling from early-treated adult PKU patients who had fasted overnight. Metabolite and amino acid concentrations in the CSF of PKU patients were compared with those of non-PKU controls. The CSF concentrations and CSF/plasma ratios for glucose and lactate were found to be below normal, similar to what has been reported for glucose transporter1 (GLUT1) deficiency patients who exhibit many of the same clinical symptoms as untreated PKU patients. CSF glucose and lactate levels were negatively correlated with CSF phenylalanine (Phe), while CSF glutamine and glutamate levels were positively correlated with CSF Phe levels. Plasma glucose levels were negatively correlated with plasma Phe concentrations in PKU subjects, which partly explains the reduced CSF glucose concentrations. Although brain glucose concentrations are unlikely to be low enough to impair brain glucose utilization, it is possible that the metabolism of Phe in the brain to produce phenyllactate, which can be transported across the blood-brain barrier to the blood, may consume glucose and/or lactate to generate the carbon backbone for glutamate. This glutamate is then converted to glutamine and carries the Phe-derived ammonia from the brain to the blood. While this mechanism remains to be tested, it may explain the correlations of CSF glutamine, glucose, and lactate concentrations with CSF Phe.

Different studies have indicated that miRNAs are key regulators of cardiomyocyte proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis and play a protective role in a variety of cardiovascular diseases. However, the biological function of miRNA-23a in hyperglycemia-related cardiomyocyte injury is not fully understood. The present study investigated the effect of miRNA-23a-3p on cell proliferation and apoptosis in a myocardial injury model induced by high glucose. H9c2 cardiomyocytes were exposed to high glucose to establish an in vitro myocardial injury model and then transfected with miRNA-23a-3p mimics. After miRNA-23a-3p transfection, lens-free microscopy was used to dynamically monitor cell numbers and confluence and calculate the cell cycle duration. CCK-8 and EdU incorporation assays were performed to detect cell proliferation. Flow cytometry was used to measured cell apoptosis. Upregulation of miRNA-23a-3p significantly alleviated high glucose-induced cell apoptosis and cell proliferation inhibition (p < 0.01 and p < 0.0001, respectively). The cell cycle of the miRNA-23a-3p mimics group was significantly shorter than that of the negative control group (p < 0.01). The expression of cell cycle-activating and apoptosis inhibition-associated factors Ccna2, Ccne1, and Bcl-2 was downregulated by high glucose and upregulated by miRNA-23a-3p overexpression in high glucose-injured H9c2 cells. miRNA-23a-3p mimics transfection before high glucose treatment had a significantly greater benefit than transfection after high glucose treatment (p < 0.0001), and the rescue effect of miRNA-23a-3p increased as the concentration increased.

636,636,29554499,"Insulin resistance serves as ""common soil"" for promoting the development of metabolic diseases; however, the precise pathological factors leading to insulin resistance are not well clarified. Resveratrol (Res) is a natural polyphenolic compound with anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects. However, effects and mechanisms of Res on glucose metabolism in adipocytes remain largely unknown. In this study, we show Res treatment significantly increases glucose uptake in insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 adipocytes in vitro. Mechanistically, Res up-regulates the protein level of Sirt1 that improves insulin signaling pathway and promotes cellular membrane Glut4 accumulation. Meanwhile, Sirt1 enhances phosphorylation level of AMPK which elevates p-AKT level. Consequently, the transcription factor FOXO1 translocalizes from nucleus to cytoplasm where protein degradation occurs. Therefore, the gene expression of resistin, a direct transcriptional target of FOXO1, is reduced and insulin sensitivity is improved. Importantly, we recapitulate the similar pattern of related protein changes in epididymal adipose tissues of insulin-resistant mice after Res intervention in vivo, reinforcing the hypothesis of Res being involved in regulation of glucose uptake via Sirt1-AMPK axis. Our findings clarify the beneficial effects of Res on glucose transportation in insulin-resistant adipocytes and involved pathway including Sirt1-AMPK, suggesting its potential therapeutic application in the treatment or prevention of insulin-resistance-related metabolic symptoms.

Although its clinical effects were originally attributed to osmotic dehydration of brain cells, other mechanisms have also been proposed. Osmotic dehydration of astroglial cells is opposed by powerful volume-regulating mechanisms that involve inward transport of electrolytes. These mechanisms have been studied previously by exposing cells to hypertonic saline gradients. Because of its potential clinical relevance, the volume response of astroglial cells exposed to hypertonic mannitol was investigated. Rat C6 glioma cells were cultured to confluence, and their volume behavior was observed by laser light scattering. After equilibration at physiologic temperature and pH, cells were abruptly exposed to hypertonic mannitol solutions. In separate experiments, C6 cells were exposed to hypertonic solutions containing radiolabeled mannitol, and its cellular uptake was determined. Hypertonic mannitol exposure produced initial cell shrinkage followed by rapid volume recovery and rebound swelling. The rebound swelling was similar in magnitude to the initial maximal shrinkage. For +40 mOsm and +70 mOsm mannitol challenges, mean volume recovery was 184+/-31% and 227+/-62%, respectively (where full recovery to baseline volume = 100%). Rebound swelling was substantially inhibited by furosemide. When exposed to mannitol in varying concentrations, uptake was linear, ranging from 82+/-7 nmol/mg to 406+/-26 nmol/mg protein. After 5 min, estimated intracellular concentrations of mannitol were similar to extracellular concentrations. Unlike hypertonic saline, hypertonic mannitol exposure produces rebound cell swelling. Cellular penetration of mannitol appears to account for much of this phenomenon. The clinical implications of these observations remain to be determined.

639,639,36480552,"Oncogenic kinase inhibitors show short-lived responses in the clinic due to high rate of acquired resistance. We previously showed that pharmacologically exploiting oncogene-induced proteotoxic stress can be a viable alternative to oncogene-targeted therapy. Here, we performed extensive analyses of the transcriptomic, metabolomic and proteostatic perturbations during the course of treatment of Her2+ breast cancer cells with a Her2 inhibitor covering the drug response, resistance, relapse and drug withdrawal phases. We found that acute Her2 inhibition, in addition to blocking mitogenic signaling, leads to significant decline in the glucose uptake, and shutdown of glycolysis and of global protein synthesis. During prolonged therapy, compensatory overexpression of Her3 allows for the reactivation of mitogenic signaling pathways, but fails to re-engage the glucose uptake and glycolysis, resulting in proteotoxic ER stress, which maintains the protein synthesis block and growth inhibition. Her3-mediated cell proliferation under ER stress during prolonged Her2 inhibition is enabled due to the overexpression of the eIF2 phosphatase GADD34, which uncouples protein synthesis block from the ER stress response to allow for active cell growth. We show that this imbalance in the mitogenic and proteostatic signaling created during the acquired resistance to anti-Her2 therapy imposes a specific vulnerability to the inhibition of the endoplasmic reticulum quality control machinery. The latter is more pronounced in the drug withdrawal phase, where the de-inhibition of Her2 creates an acute surge in the downstream signaling pathways and exacerbates the proteostatic imbalance. Therefore, the acquired resistance mechanisms to oncogenic kinase inhibitors may create secondary vulnerabilities that could be exploited in the clinic.

641,641,24583248,"The cause of hepatic failure in the terminal stages of chronic injury is unknown. Cellular metabolic adaptations in response to the microenvironment have been implicated in cellular breakdown. To address the role of energy metabolism in this process we studied mitochondrial number, respiration, and functional reserve, as well as cellular adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) production, glycolytic flux, and expression of glycolysis related genes in isolated hepatocytes from early and terminal stages of cirrhosis using a model that produces hepatic failure from irreversible cirrhosis in rats. To study the clinical relevance of energy metabolism in terminal stages of chronic liver failure, we analyzed glycolysis and energy metabolism related gene expression in liver tissue from patients at different stages of chronic liver failure according to Child-Pugh classification. Additionally, to determine whether the expression of these genes in early-stage cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A) is related to patient outcome, we performed network analysis of publicly available microarray data obtained from biopsies of 216 patients with hepatitis C-related Child-Pugh A cirrhosis who were prospectively followed up for a median of 10years. In the early phase of cirrhosis, mitochondrial function and ATP generation are maintained by increasing energy production from glycolytic flux as production from oxidative phosphorylation falls. At the terminal stage of hepatic injury, mitochondria respiration and ATP production are significantly compromised, as the hepatocytes are unable to sustain the increased demand for high levels of ATP generation from glycolysis. This impairment corresponds to a decrease in glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit and phosphoglucomutase 1. Similar decreased gene expression was observed in liver tissue from patients at different stages of chronic liver injury. Further, unbiased network analysis of microarray data revealed that expression of these genes was down regulated in the group of patients with poor outcome. An adaptive metabolic shift, from generating energy predominantly from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, allows maintenance of energy homeostasis during early stages of liver injury, but leads to hepatocyte dysfunction during terminal stages of chronic liver disease because hepatocytes are unable to sustain high levels of energy production from glycolysis.

Simultaneously, the pharmacological effects of SVS in mice were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (HE), toluidine blue, Safranin O, and immunohistochemical staining. The results show that SVS slows extracellular matrix degradation and chondrocyte apoptosis. In addition, SVS mediates its cellular effect by inhibiting the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways. Meanwhile, molecular docking studies revealed that SVS has excellent binding capabilities to p65, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK).

Using a T1D-like rat model, we found that diabetic rats showed significantly higher TXNIP mRNA and protein levels in peripheral blood, compared to their non-diabetic counterparts. Those changes were accompanied by decreased production of nitric oxide (NO) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), concurrent with increased expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) in the aortic endothelium. In addition, TXNIP overexpression in primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) induced by either high glucose or overexpression of carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP), a major transcriptional activator of TXNIP, promoted early apoptosis and impaired NO bioactivity.

The findings from this review indicated that repeated sucrose was effective in reducing both behavioral pain response and composite pain scores during repeated procedural pain. However, as for physiological pain response, one trial found less variability in physiological pain response for term neonates in the sucrose group than the sterile water group, while two trials demonstrated repeated sucrose was inefficacious for preterm neonates. Regarding the clinical outcomes, no study reported adverse effects related to the repeated sucrose administration. Regarding the neurobehavioral development, two trials reported repeated sucrose for repeated procedural pain would not lead to poor neurologic development, while one trial reported that preterm infants <31 weeks' gestational age who received >10 doses of sucrose per 24h in the first week of life had poorer neurologic development compared with infants who received fewer sucrose doses. What's more, no study reported the long-term neurobehavioral development outcome of neonates who repeatedly received sucrose across repeated procedural pain. Evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of repeated sucrose across repeated procedural pain for neonates is limited. More prospective, multi-centered, large randomized controlled clinical trials with a standardised study design are required before sucrose can be recommended widely as an analgesia for repeated procedural pain in neonates.

We examined whether interference from macroamylase is less in assays that use high-molecular-mass (high-M(r)) substrates rather than oligosaccharide substrates. We hypothesized that high-M(r) substrates would be sterically excluded from macroamylasemic complexes and thus would be hydrolyzed less efficiently. Eighteen macroamylasemic samples were assayed by using red-dyed amylopectin or blue-dyed starch as polysaccharide substrates or by using maltoheptaose or maltotetraose as oligosaccharide substrates. The oligosaccharide substrates gave comparable results (y = 0.81x + 83), but we observed consistently lower activities for amylopectin than for maltotetraose (y = 0.32x + 38). We observed no bias among methods when nonmacroamylasemic specimens were analyzed. The mechanism of this difference was examined by adding antihuman pancreatic amylase antibodies to hyperamylasemic serum samples from patients without macroamylasemia and to purified human pancreatic or salivary isoamylases. In each case, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies lowered amylase activity more in assays with complex polysaccharides than in those with oligosaccharides. The use of high-M(r) substrates diminishes interference, and detection of suspected macroamylasemia may be possible through comparing activities determined from automated methods that use different substrates.

Only insulinoma patients developed sustained hypoglycaemia (less than or equal to 2.3 mmol l-1) within 2-44 h without caloric intake, because of inappropriately elevated immunoreactive insulin (IR-insulin) concentrations. IR-proinsulin values were elevated in most (7 out of 10), but not in all insulinoma patients. The steady-state glucose infusion rate necessary to maintain a stable plasma glucose concentration of 4.4-5.0 mmol l-1 was significantly (P less than or equal to 0.001) higher in insulinoma patients (2.5 +/- 0.6 mg kg-1 min-1) than in pancreas resected patients (0.6 +/- 0.2 mg kg-1 min-1), or in control subjects (0.5 +/- 0.1 mg kg-1 min-1). Due to a considerable degree of overlap, sensitivity (0.44) and specificity (0.95) were too low for such a procedure to qualify as a diagnostic test. There was no correlation of glucose infusion rates to IR-insulin values (r = 0.024, P = 0.461). One reason for this was the development of insulin resistance in some, but not in all insulinoma patients. When, in analogy to insulin/glucose ratios, a diagnostic index was derived by multiplying the steady state glucose infusion rate by the steady state IR-insulin concentration, the diagnostic accuracy was greatly increased (sensitivity and specificity 0.94, respectively), but still lower than that of 'amended' insulin/glucose ratios in fasting plasma or at the time of discontinuation of prolonged fasts (1.00). Somatostatin infusions inhibited insulin secretion (IR-C-peptide plasma concentrations) by 52-88% in subjects without insulinoma and in those insulinoma patients whose tumour cells ultrastructurally contained plenty of normal secretory granules, and to a lesser degree when only abnormal or virtually no secretory granules were present, i.e. in more de-differentiated tumours. In contrast to this significant (P = 0.036) association, malignancy, i.e. the presence of metastases, could not be predicted from whether or not insulin secretion was resistant to the inhibitory action of somatostatin. In conclusion, euglycaemic clamp experiments are less reliable for detecting or excluding a functioning insulinoma than the relation of glucose and insulin values during starvation. The inhibition of insulin secretion by somatostatin depends on the presence of normal beta-granules, and does not distinguish adenomas from carcinomas.

Some patients with CCHD are unoperated for various reasons and remain chronically hypoxic throughout their lives, which heightens the risk of heart failure as they age.

Our previous observation showed that circulating levels of adrenomedullin (ADM) and mRNA and protein for ADM in omental adipose tissue were higher in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and these alterations are accompanied by glucose and lipid metabolic dysregulation, but the impact of ADM on mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration in human adipocyte remain elusive. The present study demonstrated that: (1) Increasing doses of glucose and ADM inhibit human adipocyte mRNA expressions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded subunits of electron transport chain, including nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ND) 1 and 2, cytochrome (CYT) b, as well as ATPase 6; (2) ADM significantly increases human adipocyte mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation and this increase is reversed by ADM antagonist, ADM22-52, but treatment with ADM does not significantly affect mitochondrial contents in the adipocytes; (3) Adipocyte basal and maximal oxygen consumption rate are dose-dependently suppressed by ADM, thus results in impaired mitochondrial respiratory capacity. We conclude that elevated ADM observed in diabetic pregnancy may be involved in glucose and lipid dysregulation through compromising adipocyte mitochondrial function, and blockade of ADM action may improve GDM-related glucose and adipose tissue dysfunction.

This retrospective cohort study enrolled women with twin pregnancies who gave birth at a tertiary hospital between January 2017 and December 2022. GDM was diagnosed by the IADPSG diagnostic criteria. Three subtypes of GDM were defined as only abnormal fasting glucose (OAFG) values, only abnormal post-load glucose (OAPG) values and abnormal combined fasting and post-load glucose (ACFPG) values. Logistic regression or generalized estimation equation models were used to test the correlation of subtypes of GDM and perinatal outcomes. GDM with OAPG had a slightly higher risk for preterm delivery (PTD) at <37 gestational weeks (aOR 1.22, 95 %CI 1.01-1.47) and neonatalintensivecareunit (NICU) admission (aOR 1.31, 95 %CI 1.09-1.57). GDM with ACFPG were associated with PTD at <37 gestational weeks (aOR 1.42, 95 %CI 1.06-1.89) and PTD at <34 gestational weeks (aOR 1.65, 95 % CI 1.14-2.39).

Currently, many of the standard hPSC neural differentiation media, use concentrations of glucose (approximately 17.5-25 mM) and insulin (approximately 3.2 μM) that are much greater than the physiological concentrations found in the human brain. These culture conditions make it difficult to analyse perturbations of glucose or insulin on neuronal development and differentiation. We established a new hPSC neural differentiation medium that incorporated physiological brain concentrations of glucose (2.5 mM) and significantly reduced insulin levels (0.86 μM).

672,672,33919979,"Macrophages are widely distributed in tissues and function in homeostasis. During cancer development, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) dominatingly support disease progression and resistance to therapy by promoting tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and immunosuppression, thereby making TAMs a target for tumor immunotherapy. Here, we started with evidence that TAMs are highly plastic and heterogeneous in phenotype and function in response to microenvironmental cues. We pointed out that efforts to tear off the heterogeneous ""camouflage"" in TAMs conduce to target de facto protumoral TAMs efficiently. In particular, several fate-mapping models suggest that most tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs) are generated from embryonic progenitors, and new paradigms uncover the ontogeny of TAMs. First, TAMs from embryonic modeling of TRMs and circulating monocytes have distinct transcriptional profiling and function, suggesting that the ontogeny of TAMs is responsible for the functional heterogeneity of TAMs, in addition to microenvironmental cues. Second, metabolic remodeling helps determine the mechanism of phenotypic and functional characteristics in TAMs, including metabolic bias from macrophages' ontogeny in macrophages' functional plasticity under physiological and pathological conditions. Both models aim at dissecting the ontogeny-related metabolic regulation in the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity in TAMs. We argue that gleaning from the single-cell transcriptomics on subclonal TAMs' origins may help understand the classification of TAMs' population in subclonal evolution and their distinct roles in tumor development.

673,673,28019006,"Neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) and the delayed injury cascade that follows involve excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and mitochondrial failure. The susceptibility to excitotoxicity of the neonatal brain may be related to the capacity of astrocytes for glutamate uptake. Furthermore, the neonatal brain is vulnerable to oxidative stress, and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) may be of particular importance for limiting this kind of injury. Also, in the neonatal brain, neurons depend upon de novo synthesis of neurotransmitters via pyruvate carboxylase in astrocytes to increase neurotransmitter pools during normal brain development. Several recent publications describing intermediary brain metabolism following neonatal HI have yielded interesting results: (1) Following HI there is a prolonged depression of mitochondrial metabolism in agreement with emerging evidence of mitochondria as vulnerable targets in the delayed injury cascade. (2) Astrocytes, like neurons, are metabolically impaired following HI, and the degree of astrocytic malfunction may be an indicator of the outcome following hypoxic and hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. (3) Glutamate transfer from neurons to astrocytes is not increased following neonatal HI, which may imply that astrocytes fail to upregulate glutamate uptake in response to the massive glutamate release during HI, thus contributing to excitotoxicity. (4) In the neonatal brain, the activity of the PPP is reduced following HI, which may add to the susceptibility of the neonatal brain to oxidative stress.

A member of the vascular endothelial growth factor family, placental growth factor (PlGF), typically plays a role in metabolic disorder and pathological circumstance. The expression and function of PlGF in the endocrine pancreas have not been reported and are addressed in the current study. PlGF levels in beta cells were determined by immunostaining or ELISA in purified beta cells in non-pregnant and pregnant adult mice. An adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 8 carrying a shRNA for PlGF under the control of a rat insulin promoter (AAV-rat insulin promoter (RIP)-short hairpin small interfering RNA for PlGF (shPlGF)) was prepared and infused into mouse pancreas through the pancreatic duct to specifically knock down PlGF in beta cells, and its effects on beta-cell growth were determined by beta-cell proliferation, beta-cell mass and insulin release. A macrophage-depleting reagent, clodronate, was coapplied into AAV-treated mice to study crosstalk between beta cells and macrophages. PlGF is exclusively produced by beta cells in the adult mouse pancreas. Moreover, PlGF expression in beta cells was significantly increased during pregnancy. Intraductal infusion of AAV-RIP-shPlGF specifically knocked down PlGF in beta cells, resulting in compromised beta-cell proliferation, reduced growth in beta-cell mass and impaired glucose tolerance during pregnancy. Mechanistically, PlGF depletion in beta cells reduced islet infiltration of trophic macrophages, which appeared to be essential for gestational beta-cell growth.

675,675,34919942,"Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MI/RI) is a major problem in the clinical treatment of ischemic cardiomyopathy, and its specific underlying mechanisms are complicated and still unclear. A number of studies have indicated that the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxidase-1(HO-1) signaling pathway might serve as an important target for the management of MI/RI. Catalpol is a kind of iridoid glucoside that has been found to exhibit diverse anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This study was aimed at investigating the role of Catalpol in targeting MI/RI and its related mechanisms in an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model in vitro and a preclinical ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) model. This study using both in vitro and in vivo models investigated the possible role and underlying mechanisms used by Catalpol for modulating of MI/RI. The potential effects of Catalpol on the viability of cardiomyocytes were measured by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assays. The phenotypes of myocardial injury, oxidative stress and inflammation markers were measured by western blot, immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) etc. Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway was detected by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis. We found that Catalpol significantly suppressed the process of MI/RI and protected OGD/R-treated cardiomyocytes by inhibiting the various markers of inflammation and suppressing oxidative stress. Additionally, mechanistically it was also demonstrated that Catalpol could effectively activate Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway to suppress the damage caused by inflammation and oxidative stress in MI/RI. In summary, the findings suggest that Catalpol exerted significant cardioprotective effects following myocardial ischemia, possibly through the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.

679,679,30684443,"Diabetic patients are prone to developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), in which microglia play a critical role. However, the direct effect of high glucose (HG) on microglia and the role of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) signaling in this interaction have not been examined before. Here, these questions were addressed in microglia cultured in HG versus normal glucose (NG) conditions. Initially, HG induced microglial differentiation into the M2a phenotype with concomitant ERK5 activation. However, longer exposure to HG further induced differentiation of microglia into the M2b-like phenotype, followed by the M1-like subtype, concomitant with a gradual loss of ERK5 activation. BIX021895, a specific inhibitor of ERK5 activation, prevented M2a- differentiation of microglia, but induced earlier M2b-like polarization followed by M1-like polarization. Transfection of microglia with a sustained activated form of MEK5 (MEK5DD) prolonged the duration of the M2a phenotype, and prevented later differentiation into the M2b/M1 subtype. Conditioned media from the M2a-polarized microglia reduced neuronal cell apoptosis in hypoxic condition, while media from M2b-like or M1-like microglia enhanced apoptosis. Together, our data suggest that chronic hyperglycemia may induce a gradual alteration of microglia polarization into an increasingly proinflammatory subtype, which could be suppressed by sustained activation of ERK5 signaling.

These clinical observations, paralleled by animal models of T1D, suggest that the insulinopenia of T1D has a deleterious effect on bone. To further examine the action of insulin signaling on bone development, we generated mice with an osteoprogenitor-selective (osterix-Cre) ablation of the insulin receptor (IR), designated OIRKO. OIRKO mice exhibited an 80% decrease in IR in osteoblasts. Prenatal elimination of IR did not affect fetal survival or gross morphology. However, loss of IR in mouse osteoblasts resulted in a postnatal growth-constricted phenotype. By 10-12 weeks of age, femurs of OIRKO mice were more slender, with a thinner diaphyseal cortex and, consequently, a decrease in whole bone strength when subjected to bending. In male mice alone, decreased metaphyseal trabecular bone, with thinner and more rodlike trabeculae, was also observed. OIRKO mice did not, however, exhibit abnormal glucose tolerance. The skeletal phenotype of the OIRKO mouse appeared more severe than that of previously reported bone-specific IR knockdown models, and confirms that insulin receptor expression in osteoblasts is critically important for proper bone development and maintenance of structural integrity.

We examined whether 1-hour plasma glucose (1hPG) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) can predict changes in the glucose tolerance status of a multi-ethnic cohort of youths with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). A total of 202 obese youths with NGT (33.7% Caucasian, 31.1% Hispanic, 32.2% African American) underwent a 3-hour OGTT at baseline and after a 2-year follow-up period. Whole-body insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, β-cell function and insulin clearance were estimated by modeling plasma glucose, insulin and C-peptide levels. Obese youths with 1hPG ≥7.4 mmol/L (or 133 mg/dL; n = 83) exhibited higher body mass index (BMI), plasma triglycerides and fasting and post-load glucose concentrations than individuals with 1hPG <7.4 mmol/L. Also, 1hPG ≥7.4 mmol/L was associated with a lower disposition index (DI) (P < 0.0001) and with alterations in whole-body insulin sensitivity, β-cell function and insulin clearance. Adolescents with 1hPG ≥7.4 mmol/L were approximately three times more likely to develop prediabetes (ie, impaired glucose tolerance and/or impaired fasting glucose) over time (OR, 2.92 [1.22-6.98]; P = 0.02), independent of age, sex, race/ethnicity, BMI, insulin sensitivity, DI and plasma glucose concentrations. No differences emerged in the risk of prediabetes related to 1-hour hyperglycaemia among different ethnic groups.

Accumulating evidence demonstrates that copper deficiency (CuD) is implicated in the development of NAFLD, besides, high fructose consumption by promoting inflammation contributes to NAFLD. However, how CuD and/or fructose (Fru) causes NAFLD is not clearly delineated. The present study aims to investigate the role of CuD and/or fructose supplement on hepatic steatosis and hepatic injury. We established a CuD rat model by feeding weaning male Sprague-Dawley rats for 4 weeks with CuD diet. Fructose was supplemented in drinking water. We found the promoting role of CuD or Fructose (Fru) in the progress of NAFLD, which was aggravated by combination of the two. Furthermore, we presented the alteration of hepatic lipid profiles (including content, composition, and saturation), especially ceramide (Cer), cardiolipin (CL), phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) was closely associated with CuD and/or Fru fed induced-NAFLD in rat models.

Because indirect challenge tests trigger airway narrowing through the activation of endogenous pathways that are involved in asthma, indirect challenge tests tend to be specific for asthma and reveal much about the biology of asthma, but may be less sensitive than direct tests for the detection of airway hyperresponsiveness. We provide recommendations for the conduct and interpretation of hyperpnoea challenge tests such as dry air exercise challenge and eucapnic voluntary hyperpnoea that provide a single strong stimulus for airway narrowing. This technical standard expands the recommendations to additional indirect tests such as hypertonic saline, mannitol and adenosine challenge that are incremental tests, but still retain characteristics of other indirect challenges. Assessment of airway hyperresponsiveness, with direct and indirect tests, are valuable tools to understand and to monitor airway function and to characterise the underlying asthma phenotype to guide therapy.

X-box binding protein 1 spliced (XBP1s), a transcription factor, plays a key role in ameliorating insulin resistance and maintaining glucose homeostasis. Unfortunately, the short half-life of the protein dampens its clinical application, and the specific site of lysine residue that could be ubiquitinated and involved in the degradation of XBP1s remains elusive. Here, we identified K60 and K77 on XBP1s as two pivotal ubiquitin sites required for its proteasome-dependent degradation. We also constructed a double mutant form of XBP1s (K60/77R) and found that it showed higher capacity in resisting against ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, increasing nuclear translocation, enhancing transcriptional activity, suppressing ER stress and promoting Foxo1 degradation, compared to that of wild type XBP1s (WT). Consistently, overexpression of the K60/77R XBP1s mutant in DIO mice increased the ability to reduce ER stress and decrease Foxo1 levels, thus contributed to maintaining glucose homeostasis. Our results suggest that delaying the degradation of XBP1s by preventing ubiquitination might provide a strategic approach for reducing ER stress as an anti-diabetes therapy.

Previous studies have reported that the mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β are remarkably up-regulated in injured tendons. To examine how IL-1β impacts tendon repair process, we isolated the injured tendon-derived progenitor cells (inTPCs) from mouse injured Achilles tendons and studied the effects of IL-1β on the inTPCs in vitro. IL-1β treatment strongly reduced expression of tendon cell markers such as scleraxis and tenomodulin, and also down-regulated gene expression of collagen 1, collagen 3, biglycan and fibromodulin in inTPCs. Interestingly, IL-1β stimulated lactate production with increases in hexokinase II and lactate dehydrogenase expression and a decrease in pyruvate dehydrogenase. Inhibition of lactate production restored IL-1β-induced down-regulation of collagen1 and scleraxis expression. Furthermore, IL-1β significantly inhibited adipogenic, chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation of inTPCs. Interestingly, inhibition of tenogenic and adipogenic differentiation was not recovered after removal of IL-1β while chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation abilities were not affected. These findings indicate that IL-1β strongly and irreversibly impairs tenogenic potential and alters glucose metabolism in tendon progenitors appearing in injured tendons.

Our previous studies revealed that inhibiting glucose uptake impairs the survival and tumor-promoting function of hypoxic TAMs, suggesting that glucose reduction by energy restriction (calorie restriction or short-term fasting) may has a significant impact on TAMs. The purpose of this study is to verify the effect of fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) on TAMs, and to determine whether FMD synergizes with anti-angiogenic drug apatinib via TAMs. The effect of FMD on TAMs and its synergistic effects with apatinib were observed using an orthotopic mouse breast cancer model. An in vitro cell model, utilizing M2 macrophages derived from THP-1 cell line, was intended to assess the effects of low glucose on TAMs under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. Bioinformatics was used to screen for potential mechanisms of action, which were then validated both in vivo and in vitro. FMD significantly inhibit the pro-tumor function of TAMs in vivo and in vitro, with the inhibitory effect being more pronounced under hypoxic conditions. Additionally, the combination of FMD-mediated TAMs inhibition with apatinib results in synergistic anti-tumor activity. This effect is partially mediated by the downregulation of CCL8 expression and secretion by the mTOR-HIF-1α signaling pathway.

Crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) is defined as decreased metabolism or blood flow in the cerebellum contralateral to a cortical insult measured by functional neuroimaging, and is typically seen in adults with large frontal or parietal lesions.

The current study investigated whether CCD is associated with alterations in the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A))/BZR complex. Patients with frontal lesions alone or with parietal lesions were compared with patients with temporal lesions, which are typically not associated with CCD. Children with lesion onset before 1 year of age showed significantly higher glucose utilization in contralateral posterior quadrangular and superior semilunar lobules of cerebellar cortex than did adults.

The present study revealed that HG can induce apoptosis and senescence in chondrocytes, in addition to regulating autophagy dynamically. The present study demonstrated that HG can cause oxidative stress in chondrocytes and suppress the AMPK pathway in a dose-dependent manner. Elimination of oxidative stress by Acetylcysteine, also called N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), downregulated autophagy and alleviated HG-stimulated apoptosis and senescence, while activation of the AMPK signaling pathway by AICAR not only upregulated autophagy but also alleviated HG-stimulated apoptosis and senescence. A combined treatment of NAC and AICAR was superior to treatment with either NAC or AICAR. The study has demonstrated that HG can suppress autophagy through the AMPK pathway and induce autophagy via oxidative stress in chondrocytes.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) occurs in mitochondrial diseases, with the m.3243A>G mutation being the most common mutation associated with mitochondrial DM. The pathogenesis of mitochondrial DM remains largely unknown, with previous studies suggesting that impaired insulin secretion is the major factor. In this study we used stable isotope infusion techniques to assess glucose metabolism in vivo and under physiological conditions in 5 diabetic and 11 non-diabetic adults with the m.3243A>G mutation and 10 healthy adult controls. Our results revealed increased glucose production due to increased gluconeogenesis in both diabetic and non-diabetic subjects with the m.3243A>G mutation. In addition, diabetic subjects demonstrated insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency, resulting in an inability to increase glucose oxidation which can explain the development of DM in these subjects. Non-diabetic subjects showed normal insulin sensitivity; and therefore, they were able to increase their glucose oxidation rate. The ability to increase glucose utilization can act as a compensatory mechanism that explains why these subjects do not have DM despite the higher rate of glucose production. These results suggest that increased gluconeogenesis is not enough to cause DM and the occurrence of combined insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency are needed to develop DM in individuals with the m.3243A>G mutation. Therefore, multiple defects in insulin and glucose metabolism are required for DM to occur in individuals with mitochondrial diseases. The results of this study uncover previously undocumented alterations in glucose metabolism in individuals with the m.3243A>G mutation that contribute significantly to our understanding of the pathogenesis of mitochondrial DM and can have significant implications for its management.

The authors performed a retrospective, questionnaire-based data collection in specialized epilepsy units in Germany. Patients with West syndrome and hypsarrhythmia could be included if topiramate treatment had started at an age of < or =3 years. Data of 100 patients were evaluated. Nearly all patients were severely affected and had been treated with multiple antiepileptic drugs with insufficient effect. Topiramate was introduced at a median age of 11.9 months. The median starting dosage was 1.6 mg/kg body weight per day, increased to a median maximum dosage of 12.0 mg/kg. Sixty-one patients received between 1 and 3 antiepileptic drugs in addition to topiramate. The median daily dose considered by the attending physicians to be most effective regarding seizure reduction was 10 mg/kg. A significant reduction in the number of seizures per week was achieved. A total of 17.5% of patients became free of seizures, and in 47%, the seizure frequency decreased by at least 50%. Hypsarrhythmia or status-like electroencephalography patterns remitted in 18 of 83 cases. Side effects were reported in 25% of children and included mostly sedation, loss of appetite, weight loss, and metabolic acidosis. These side effects were statistically related to the number of additional antiepileptic drugs but not to the topiramate dosage. In 17% of patients, topiramate treatment was discontinued because of side effects and in a further 4% because of worsening of seizures. In 44% of patients, treatment was continued for more than 3 months. In conclusion, the data suggest that topiramate is a useful drug in treating West syndrome. However, because of the inherent limitations of the retrospective study design, future prospective controlled studies should be performed.

705,705,36243006,"During mammalian energy homeostasis, the glucagon receptor (Gcgr) plays a key role in regulating both glucose and lipid metabolisms. However, the mechanisms by which these distinct signaling arms are differentially regulated remain poorly understood. Using a Cy5-glucagon agonist, we show that the endosomal protein Vps37a uncouples glucose production from lipid usage downstream of Gcgr signaling by altering intracellular receptor localization. Hepatocyte-specific knockdown of Vps37a causes an accumulation of Gcgr in endosomes, resulting in overactivation of the cAMP/PKA/p-Creb signaling pathway to gluconeogenesis without affecting β-oxidation. Shifting the receptor back to the plasma membrane rescues the differential signaling and highlights the importance of the spatiotemporal localization of Gcgr for its metabolic effects. Importantly, since Vps37a knockdown in animals fed with a high-fat diet leads to hyperglycemia, although its overexpression reduces blood glucose levels, these data reveal a contribution of endosomal signaling to metabolic diseases that could be exploited for treatments of type 2 diabetes.

However, poor aqueous solubility is a major problem in the development of parenteral drug solutions. Given its multiple mechanisms of action, topiramate (TPM) is a promising candidate for the treatment of established or refractory SE, as supported by clinical studies using nasogastric tube TPM administration. However, TPM is not clinically available as a solution for i.v. administration, which hampers its use in the treatment of SE. Here, we describe a novel easy-to-use and easy-to-prepare i.v. TPM formulation using the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved excipient meglumine. During formulation development, we compared the solubility of TPM in bi-distilled water with vs without a range of meglumine concentrations. Furthermore, the solubility of combinations of TPM and levetiracetam and TPM, levetiracetam, and atorvastatin in aqueous meglumine concentrations was determined. Subsequently, the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of meglumine-based solutions of TPM and TPM combinations were evaluated in rats, including animals following fluid percussion injury or pilocarpine-induced SE. The amino sugar meglumine markedly enhances the aqueous solubility of TPM. A comparison with data on dissolving TPM using sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin (Captisol) demonstrates that meglumine is much more effective for dissolving TPM. Furthermore, meglumine can be used to prepare drug cocktails where TPM is co-administered with another ASM for SE treatment. The tolerability studies of the meglumine-based TPM solution and meglumine-based TPM combinations in normal rats and the rat fluid percussion injury and pilocarpine-induced SE models demonstrate excellent tolerability of the novel drug solutions. Preclinical studies on antiseizure efficacy in the SE model are underway. In conclusion, the novel meglumine-based solution of TPM presented here may be well suited for clinical development.

708,708,22241104,"The urea cycle consists of six consecutive enzymatic reactions that convert waste nitrogen into urea. Deficiencies of any of these enzymes of the cycle result in urea cycle disorders (UCDs), a group of inborn errors of hepatic metabolism that often result in life-threatening hyperammonemia. Argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) catalyzes the fourth reaction in this cycle, resulting in the breakdown of argininosuccinic acid to arginine and fumarate. ASL deficiency (ASLD) is the second most common UCD, with a prevalence of ~1 in 70,000 live births. ASLD can manifest as either a severe neonatal-onset form with hyperammonemia within the first few days after birth or as a late-onset form with episodic hyperammonemia and/or long-term complications that include liver dysfunction, neurocognitive deficits, and hypertension. These long-term complications can occur in the absence of hyperammonemic episodes, implying that ASL has functions outside of its role in ureagenesis and the tissue-specific lack of ASL may be responsible for these manifestations. The biochemical diagnosis of ASLD is typically established with elevation of plasma citrulline together with elevated argininosuccinic acid in the plasma or urine. Molecular genetic testing of ASL and assay of ASL enzyme activity are helpful when the biochemical findings are equivocal. However, there is no correlation between the genotype or enzyme activity and clinical outcome. Treatment of acute metabolic decompensations with hyperammonemia involves discontinuing oral protein intake, supplementing oral intake with intravenous lipids and/or glucose, and use of intravenous arginine and nitrogen-scavenging therapy. Dietary restriction of protein and dietary supplementation with arginine are the mainstays in long-term management. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is best considered only in patients with recurrent hyperammonemia or metabolic decompensations resistant to conventional medical therapy.

The carbohydrate source was lactose in one formula and glucose polymers in the other (lactose-free). Infants were studied in a blinded crossover fashion after 2 wk of adaptation to each formula. Isotope absorption studies were conducted with a 4-tracer method in which (70)Zn and (44)Ca were provided orally and (67)Zn and (46)Ca intravenously. Zinc and calcium absorption was measured from the fractional excretion of the oral and intravenous isotopes in urine. Fractional and total calcium absorption was significantly greater from the lactose-containing formula than from the lactose-free formula. For total calcium absorption, the mean difference between formulas was 10.3% (P = 0.002) and 60 mg/d (P = 0.006). For zinc, fractional absorption (32 +/- 11%), total absorption, and intake did not differ significantly between the 2 formulas. The presence of lactose in a formula based on cow-milk protein increases absorption of calcium but not of zinc.

In addition, both schaftoside and TAK242 treatments significantly decreased Drp1 expression, phosphorylation, translocation and mitochondrial fission in OGD-stimulated BV2 cells.

From the results of hematoxylin-eosin staining, echocardiography, heart weight/body weight ratio and the expression of hypertrophic marker ANP, we found high-fructose result in myocardial hypertrophy and the low-concentration alcohol consumption would prevent the cardiomyocyte hypertrophy from happening. In addition, we observed low-concentration alcohol consumption could inhibit mitochondria swollen induced by high-fructose. The elevated levels of glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol in high-fructose group were reduced by low concentration alcohol. Low expression levels of SIRT1 and PPAR-γ induced by high-fructose were significantly elevated when fed with low-concentration alcohol. The histone lysine 9 acetylation (acH3K9) level was decreased in PPAR-γ promoter in high-fructose group but elevated when intake with low concentration alcohol. The binding levels of histone deacetylase SIRT1 were increased in the same region in high-fructose group, while the low concentration alcohol can prevent the increased binding levels. Overall, our study indicates that low-concentration alcohol consumption could inhibit high-fructose related myocardial hypertrophy, cardiac mitochondria damaged and disorders of glucose-lipid metabolism.

An enzyme is called a protein and catalyzes a specific reaction. Every enzyme is intended to initiate a particular reaction with a specific outcome. Moreover, numerous enzymes are present in the human body. Dairy food applications include the use of different enzymes, such as protease, to lessen the allergic properties of bovine milk products and lipase to improve the flavor of the cheese. Caseins, which are acid-soluble, are free from a flavor and can be suitable for addition to beverages and acidy foods by the limitation of proteolysis. The hydrolysates of casein are better to use in foods based on milk proteins for newborn children with allergy to bovine milk. Lipolysis makes a significant role in the flavor of Swiss cheese. The peppery flavor of Blue cheese is produced by short-chain unsaturated fats and methyl ketones. Many minor enzymes with limited application in dairy processes are sulphydryl oxidase, lactoperoxidase, glucose oxidase, catalase, lysozyme, and superoxide dismutase. Both catalase and glucose oxidase are utilized in food preservation processes. The scope minor enzymes in milk products needed for better production of dairy products and for the future of dairy technology.

716,716,24862279,"Hypoxia is a common finding in advanced human tumors and is often associated with metastatic dissemination and poor prognosis. Cancer cells adapt to hypoxia by utilizing physiological adaptation pathways that promote a switch from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism. This promotes the conversion of glucose into lactate while limiting its transformation into acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). The uptake of glucose and the glycolytic flux are increased under hypoxic conditions, mostly owing to the upregulation of genes encoding glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes, a process that depends on hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). The reduced delivery of acetyl-CoA to the tricarboxylic acid cycle leads to a switch from glucose to glutamine as the major substrate for fatty acid synthesis in hypoxic cells. In addition, hypoxia induces (1) the HIF-1-dependent expression of BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) and BNIP3-like (BNIP3L), which trigger mitochondrial autophagy, thereby decreasing the oxidative metabolism of both fatty acids and glucose, and (2) the expression of the sodium-hydrogen exchanger NHE1, which maintains an alkaline intracellular pH.

Term infants ≤7 days old (n=56) undergoing routine heel lance were randomized to pretreatment with 2.0 mL oral 24% sucrose (n=29) or sterile water (n=27) in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. SBF was assessed by LDI scans and NIPS scores at 10 minutes before lance, immediately after lancing, and 5 minutes after blood extraction. Mean SBF and median NIPS scores were compared between groups using General Linear Model or Kruskal-Wallis. Regressions examined the relationship between SBF immediately after heel lance and NIPS score. Mean SBF and median NIPS scores immediately after heel lance were lower in sucrose-treated infants (167.9±15.5 vs. 205.4±16.0 PU, P=0.09; NIPS 1 [interquartile range 0 to 4] vs. NIPS 3 [interquartile range 0 to 6], P=0.02), although no significant difference in mean SBF.

Increased SBF assessed by LDI is a pain response among term neonates after routine heel lance, which was not completely attenuated by oral sucrose administration.

718,718,28213469,"Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes is the most common comorbidity associated with cystic fibrosis (CF) and correlates with increased rates of lung function decline. Because glucose is a nutrient present in the airways of patients with bacterial airway infections and because insulin controls glucose metabolism, the effect of insulin on CF airway epithelia was investigated to determine the role of insulin receptors and glucose transport in regulating glucose availability in the airway. The response to insulin by human airway epithelial cells was characterized by quantitative PCR, immunoblot, immunofluorescence, and glucose uptake assays. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) activity were analyzed by pharmacological and immunoblot assays. We found that normal human primary airway epithelial cells expressed glucose transporter 4 and that application of insulin stimulated cytochalasin B-inhibitable glucose uptake, consistent with a requirement for glucose transporter translocation. Application of insulin to normal primary human airway epithelial cells promoted airway barrier function as demonstrated by increased transepithelial electrical resistance and decreased paracellular flux of small molecules. This provides the first demonstration that airway cells express insulin-regulated glucose transporters that act in concert with tight junctions to form an airway glucose barrier. However, insulin failed to increase glucose uptake or decrease paracellular flux of small molecules in human airway epithelia expressing F508del-CFTR. Insulin stimulation of Akt1 and Akt2 signaling in CF airway cells was diminished compared with that observed in airway cells expressing wild-type CFTR. These results indicate that the airway glucose barrier is regulated by insulin and is dysfunctional in CF.

In this study, shRNA silencing of PDIA6 expression in insulin-producing mouse cells reduced insulin production (5-fold) and, consequently, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (3-4-fold). This inhibition of insulin release was independent of the PDIA6-PERK interaction or PERK activity. Acute inhibition of PERK did not change the short-term response of β cells to glucose. Rather, PDIA6 affected insulin secretion by modulating one of the activities of IRE1. At 11 mM glucose and lower, the regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) of the mRNA activity of IRE1 was activated, but not its X-box binding protein (XBP)-1 splicing activity. In the absence of PDIA6, RIDD activity toward insulin transcripts was enhanced up to 4-fold, as shown by molecular assays in cultured cells and the use of a fluorescent reporter in intact islets. Such physiologic activation of IRE1 by glucose contrasted with IRE1 activation by chemical stress, when both IRE1 activities were induced. Thus, whereas the stimulus determines the quality of IRE1 signaling, PDIA6 attenuates multiple enzymatic activities of IRE1, maintaining its signaling within a physiologically tolerable range.

721,721,8231836,"Recently, only about 50% of the conversion of fructose to glucose was reported to be via fructose-1-P aldolase catalysis in children. This was also suggested to be the case in adults. That possibility has been tested using a method that quantifies the pathways of fructose conversion to glucose via the fate of 14C from specifically labeled fructose. Trace [6-14C] fructose or its immediate precursor [6-14C]sorbitol with unlabeled fructose (0.3 mg/kg body weight/min) was given intravenously or intragastrically with trace [1-14C]lactate to six normal adults fasted overnight. The distributions of 14C in glucose from blood samples were determined. The ratios of 14C in C1 to C6 of the glucose were equal to or only slightly less than the ratios of 14C in C3 to C4. Since incorporation into C3 and C4 of glucose must have arisen via the conversion of [1-14C]lactate to [1-14C]triose phosphates, fructose conversion to glucose must also have arisen predominantly via the triose phosphates. From the ratios, 85.1% to 100%, a mean of 94.9% of the fructose converted to glucose is calculated to have been converted to glucose with cleavage of the carbon skeleton of the fructose. These findings contrast with the report that in children under similar conditions only about 50% of the conversion of fructose to glucose is with cleavage. The findings agree with previous results in which fructose was administered to normal adults as a bolus at a dose of 60 mg/kg body weight. The possible reasons that the findings in children are different from those in adults are considered.

Women who are obese during pregnancy have a greater risk of metabolic complications such as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) as well as type 2 diabetes after pregnancy. Children of obese and/or GDM mothers have an increased susceptibility to congenital abnormalities and a range of cardio-metabolic disorders. The placenta is at the interface of the maternal and fetal environments and, its function per se, plays a major role in dictating the impact of maternal health on fetal development. Here, we review the literature on how placental function is affected in pregnancies complicated by obesity, and pre-gestational and gestational diabetes. The focus is on the availability of three key substrates in these conditions: glucose, lipids, and amino acids, and their impact on placental metabolic activity. Maternal obesity and diabetes are not always associated with fetal compromise and the adaptation of the placenta may partially determine the outcome. Understanding the differences in metabolic adaptation may open avenues for therapeutic development.

An intravenous formulation of topiramate has been developed for administration during conditions such as hypoxia-ischemia when enteral absorption may be unpredictable. The plasma pharmacokinetics, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration and pharmacodynamics of intravenous topiramate were studied in an established piglet model of hypoxia-ischemia. The plasma pharmacokinetics of topiramate were studied in a group of chronically instrumented conscious piglets (n = 8), and in a group of piglets following an episode of hypoxia-ischemia (n = 8). These groups were divided into equal dose cohorts in which two doses of intravenously administered topiramate, 5 and 40 mg/kg, were studied. The animals' heart rate, arterial pressure and EEG were monitored. Plasma for topiramate concentration was sampled for up to 26 h. A single CSF topiramate concentration was determined 1 h following drug administration. Topiramate was quantified using a specific LC/MS assay. The animals tolerated intravenous topiramate well, with no significant changes in physiologic and neurologic parameters. Plasma topiramate concentrations following an intravenous dose were best described by a bi-exponential equation, with a mean clearance of 39+/-18 ml/h/kg, and a terminal half-life of 14.3 (range 7.5-48.1) h. A dose of 5 mg/kg was sufficient to maintain plasma drug concentrations greater than 10 micro M for 24 h. CSF topiramate concentration at 1 h was 12+/-1 micro M and 109+/-26 micro M at the 5 and 40 mg/kg doses, respectively. Topiramate administered intravenously was well tolerated. Slow clearance of the drug allowed for maintenance of potential neuroprotective concentrations following a single dose of drug for 24 h.

727,727,32626722,"The prevalence of obesity among Chilean adults and children is one of the highest worldwide. To fight the constant increase of non-communicable diseases and the growing sales of sugar-sweetened beverages, the Chilean government recently enacted a new Law of Food Labeling and Advertising imposing the application of front-of-package warning labels in foodstuffs whose composition exceeds limits for critical nutrients including sugar. Accordingly, food companies have been reformulating their products, incorporating non-caloric sweeteners (NCSs) in partial or total replacement of sucrose. The number of NCS-containing foods and beverages, therefore, has been increasing in the last years. This study aims to identify the NCS-containing products from different food/beverage categories currently available on the Chilean market. Nineteen supermarkets and 13 food web pages were visited by trained dietitians to carry out a systematic search of ingredient information from the different food categories. Overall, 1,489 products were analyzed, of which 815 (55.5%) contained at least one NCS, being this proportion particularly high, compared to other countries. 67.1% of the dairy products, 31.5% of the cereal products, 49% of the processed fruits, 74.3% of the non-alcoholic beverages, and 46.2% of sweets and other desserts contained NCS. Considering the food categories more specifically oriented to children, NCSs were present in 98.8% of powder juices, 98.3% of the flavored milks, 91.2% of jellies, and 79% of the dairy desserts. Sucralose and steviol glycosides were the most widely used NCSs, these sweeteners being present, alone or mixed with other, in 73.5 and 39.7% of the NCS-containing products, respectively, while the use of saccharin and cyclamate was low. In addition, 80 tabletop NCSs were available in the local market, 91.2% of them being sucralose and steviol glycosides (alone or combined). The high number of food products containing steviol glycosides makes very plausible that the daily consumption of this NCS in the pediatric populations could exceed its acceptable daily intake (ADI).

Results showed that α-amylase amplified the Nt-MGAM glucogenesis, and that the amplifications differed in various substrates. The amount of branches within α-amylase hydrolysate substrates was highly related to the rate of Nt-MGAM glucogenesis. After de-branching, the hydrolysates showed three fractions, Fraction 1, 2, and 3, in size exclusion chromatographs.

734,734,31085717,"Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is one of the most serious complications of diabetes, but its pathogenesis remains largely unclear. In the present study, we aimed to explore the potential role of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) and to investigate the underlying mechanisms in human AC16 cardiomyocytes under high glucose (HG) condition. The results demonstrated that MEG3 was overexpressed in HG-treated AC16 cells, and MEG3 knockdown suppressed the HG-induced apoptosis in AC16 cells. Mechanistically, MEG3 directly binds to miR-145 in AC16 cells, thereby up-regulating the expression of PDCD4. Rescue experiments showed that the role of MEG3 in HG-treated AC16 cells was partly dependent on its suppression on miR-145.

736,736,33984575,"Humans are widely exposed to environmental perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which may affect glucose homeostasis. However, research linking PFAS exposure to glucose homeostasis during pregnancy is limited and the results were inconsistent. We aimed to investigate the association between PFAS exposure and glucose homeostasis in pregnancy in a large prospective cohort. A total of 2747 pregnant women who participated in the Shanghai Birth Cohort, had blood samples in early pregnancy and completed a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 24-28 gestational weeks were included. 10 PFAS were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS-MS) in the plasma samples in early pregnancy. Logistic regression was used to explore the associations between PFAS concentrations and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), while multiple linear regression was used to model the associations between PFAS and OGTT fasting, 1-h and 2-h glucose levels. Potential confounders were adjusted. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) and a quantile-based g-computation approach (qgcomp) were employed to explore the joint and independent effects of PFAS on glucose homeostasis. The incidence of GDM was 11.8%. One log-unit increment in plasma concentrations in early pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of GDM for perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) (adjusted odd ratio (aOR) = 1.23, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.05, 1.44) and perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA) (aOR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.46). Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) and PFHpA were positively correlated with 1-h and 2-h glucose levels. Results of the mixed exposure model showed that the joint effects of PFAS were significantly associated with abnormal glucose homeostasis; In the BKMR model, PFAS mixture exposure was positively associated with the GDM incidence, 1-h and 2-h glucose levels and negatively correlated with FBG level. A similar trend could be observed in qgcomp and the positive correlation between PFAS and 2-h glucose level was significant (β = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.20). PFOS, PFNA and PFHpA may be the main contributors after controlling for other PFAS congeners. PFOS was significantly correlated with GDM incidence and 2-h glucose level, and PFHpA was significantly associated with FBG and 2-h glucose levels. The above associations were more prominent among women with a normal prepregnant BMI. Environmental exposure to PFAS may affect glucose homeostasis in pregnancy and increase the risk of GDM, especially in normal weight women.

Although a sex dimorphism on vascular function has already been noted, the underlying processes remain unclear. The Rho-kinase pathway has a unique role in controlling vascular tone, and in obese male mice, hyperactivation of this system results in worsened vascular constriction. We investigated whether female mice exhibit decreased Rho-kinase activation as a protective mechanism in obesity. We exposed male and female mice to a high-fat diet (HFD) for 14 weeks. At the end, energy expenditure, glucose tolerance, adipose tissue inflammation, and vascular function were investigated. Male mice were more sensitive to HFD-induced body weight gain, glucose tolerance, and inflammation than female mice. After establishing obesity, female mice demonstrated increase in energy expenditure, characterized by an increase in heat, whereas male mice did not. Interestingly, obese female mice, but not male, displayed attenuated vascular contractility to different agonists, such difference was blunted by inhibition of Rho-kinase, which was accompanied by a suppressed Rho-kinase activation, measured by Western blot. Finally, aortae from obese male mice displayed an exacerbated inflammation, whereas obese female demonstrated a mild vascular inflammation. In obesity, female mice demonstrate a vascular protective mechanism-suppression of vascular Rho-kinase-to minimize the cardiovascular risk associated with obesity, whereas male mice do not generate any adaptive response. Future investigations can help to understand how Rho-kinase becomes suppressed in female during obesity.

738,738,36480317,"Current Neurocritical Care Society guidelines on the management of cerebral edema recommend hypertonic saline (HTS) over mannitol in some scenarios, but practical questions remain regarding the appropriate administration method, concentration/dose, monitoring to ensure safe use, and storage. The aim of this article is to address these practical concerns based on the evidence currently available. Many different hypertonic solutions have been studied to define the optimal hyperosmolar substance to relieve acute cerebral edema in patients with conditions such as acute ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and traumatic brain injury. Mannitol and HTS are the main hyperosmolar therapies in use in contemporary neurocritical care practice. Contemporary use of HTS has followed a circuitous path in regards to the practical aspects of dosing and formulation, with evidence mainly consisting of retrospective or observational data. The effectiveness of bolus doses of HTS to lower acutely elevated intracranial pressure is well accepted. Adverse events with use of HTS are often mild and non-clinically significant if appropriate monitoring of serum sodium and chloride concentrations is performed. Available evidence shows that peripheral administration of HTS is likely safe in certain circumstances. Timely utilization of HTS is complicated by regulatory requirements for safe storage, but with appropriate safeguards HTS can be stored in patient care areas. HTS formulations, methods of administration, infusion rate, and storage vary by institution, and no practice standards exist. Central intravenous administration may be preferred for HTS, but peripheral intravenous administration is safe provided measures are undertaken to detect and prevent phlebitis and extravasation. The safe use of HTS is possible with proper protocols, education, and institutional safeguards in place.

Further analysis showed that the increase in CSF protein concentration was evident for SMA types 2 and 3 patients, but not for type 1. This observation was also demonstrated by a significant correlation between the SMN2 gene copy number and the increase in CSF protein concentration (Spearman rank correlation test).

The objective of these studies was to identify Txnip interacting proteins using the proximity-based labeling method, BioID, to understand differential regulation of pleiotropic Txnip cellular functions. The BioID transgene fused to Txnip expressed in HEK293 identified 31 interacting proteins. Many protein interactions were redox-dependent and were disrupted through mutation of a previously described reactive cysteine (C247S). Furthermore, we demonstrate that this model can be used to identify dynamic Txnip interactions due to known physiological regulators such as hyperglycemia.

T3 markedly stimulated D-glucose uptake in brush-border membrane vesicles in the presence of an outside/inside (100/0 mmol/l) Na+ gradient. T3 administration had no detectable influence on the Na+ permeability of the isolated vesicles. The effect of the thyroid hormone on Na+ gradient-driven D-glucose uptake was fully preserved at zero transmembrane potential difference. These findings exclude that T3 stimulates Na+-dependent D-glucose transport in the small intestine through changes of the electrochemical Na+ gradient or through alteration of the transmembrane potential difference. Tracer exchange experiments under equilibrium and voltage-clamp conditions revealed a significantly shorter half-time of D-glucose uptake in brush-border membrane vesicles from T3-treated chicks. Kinetic analysis showed that T3 administration significantly increases the apparent maximal velocity of D-glucose transport in brush-border membrane vesicles, whereas the apparent Km values were virtually unaltered. From these data we conclude that T3 increases the activity of Na+-dependent D-glucose carriers in the brush-border membrane.

751,751,26144888,"There are extensive bidirectional interactions between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system (CNS), and studies demonstrate that stressor exposure significantly alters gut microbiota community structure. We tested whether oligosaccharides naturally found in high levels in human milk, which have been reported to impact brain development and enhance the growth of beneficial commensal microbes, would prevent stressor-induced alterations in gut microbial community composition and attenuate stressor-induced anxiety-like behavior. Mice were fed standard laboratory diet, or laboratory diet containing the human milk oligosaccharides 3'Sialyllactose (3'SL) or 6'Sialyllactose (6'SL) for 2 weeks prior to being exposed to either a social disruption stressor or a non-stressed control condition. Stressor exposure significantly changed the structure of the colonic mucosa-associated microbiota in control mice, as indicated by changes in beta diversity. The stressor resulted in anxiety-like behavior in both the light/dark preference and open field tests in control mice. This effect was associated with a reduction in immature neurons in the dentate gyrus as indicated by doublecortin (DCX) immunostaining. These effects were not evident in mice fed milk oligosaccharides; stressor exposure did not significantly change microbial community structure in mice fed 3'SL or 6'SL.

Here we report that Clec16a is a membrane-associated endosomal protein that interacts with E3 ubiquitin ligase Nrdp1. Loss of Clec16a leads to an increase in the Nrdp1 target Parkin, a master regulator of mitophagy. Islets from mice with pancreas-specific deletion of Clec16a have abnormal mitochondria with reduced oxygen consumption and ATP concentration, both of which are required for normal β cell function. Indeed, pancreatic Clec16a is required for normal glucose-stimulated insulin release. Moreover, patients harboring a diabetogenic SNP in the Clec16a gene have reduced islet Clec16a expression and reduced insulin secretion. Thus, Clec16a controls β cell function and prevents diabetes by controlling mitophagy.

This study explored whether panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) provided neuroprotective effects by inhibiting the expressions of NgR1, RhoA, and ROCK2 following middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) injury in SH-SY5Y cells. 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining was used to determine successful middle cerebral artery occlusion establishment in sham-operated and operated Sprague-Dawley rats 1 day after injury. The rats were randomly separated into sham, model, NEP1-40, PNS, and NEP1-40 plus PNS (N+P) groups. After 7 days of treatment, body mass and neurological deficit scores were analyzed. Tissues were harvested and analyzed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemical analysis, western blotting, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The optimal drug concentration of NEP1-40 and PNS on SH-SY5Y cells exposed to OGD/R injury was determined by CCK8 analysis. qRT-PCR was used to measure mRNA expression profiles of NgR1, RhoA, and ROCK2 in SH-SY5Y cells subjected to OGD/R. The results showed that MCAO surgery successfully produced an infarct, and the PNS, NEP1-40, and N+P groups exhibited increased body mass and ameliorated neurological deficits compared with the model group. NEP1-40 treatment markedly reduced NgR1 and RhoA overexpression when compared to the model group, although there was no significant difference in ROCK2 expression. PNS and N+P treatment significantly decreased NgR1, RhoA, and ROCK2 overexpression compared with the model group.

757,757,37166980,"Fasting is associated with increased susceptibility to hypoglycemia in people with type 1 diabetes, thereby making it a significant health risk. To date, the relationship between fasting and insulin-induced hypoglycemia has not been well characterized, so our objective was to determine whether insulin-independent factors, such as counterregulatory hormone responses, are adversely impacted by fasting in healthy control individuals. Counterregulatory responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia were measured in 12 healthy people during 2 metabolic studies. During one study, participants ate breakfast and lunch, after which they underwent a 2-hour bout of insulin-induced hypoglycemia (FED). During the other study, participants remained fasted prior to hypoglycemia (FAST). As expected, hepatic glycogen concentrations were lower in FAST, and associated with diminished peak glucagon levels and reduced endogenous glucose production (EGP) during hypoglycemia. Accompanying lower EGP in FAST was a reduction in peripheral glucose utilization, and a resultant reduction in the amount of exogenous glucose required to maintain glycemia. These data suggest that whereas a fasting-induced lowering of glucose utilization could potentially delay the onset of insulin-induced hypoglycemia, subsequent reductions in glucagon levels and EGP are likely to encumber recovery from it. As a result of this diminished metabolic flexibility in response to fasting, susceptibility to hypoglycemia could be enhanced in patients with type 1 diabetes under similar conditions.

758,758,32325173,"Recent reports indicate that 7% of pregnant mothers in North America use cannabis. This is concerning given that in utero exposure to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), the main psychoactive component in cannabis, causes fetal growth restriction and may alter replication and survival of pancreatic β-cells in the offspring. Accordingly, we hypothesized that maternal exposure to Δ9-THC during pregnancy would impair postnatal glucometabolic health of offspring. To test this hypothesis, pregnant Wistar rats were treated with daily intraperitoneal injections of either 3 mg/kg Δ9-THC or vehicle from gestational day 6 to birth. Offspring were subsequently challenged with glucose and insulin at 5 months of age to assess glucose tolerance and peripheral muscle insulin sensitivity. Female offspring exposed to Δ9-THC in utero were glucose intolerant, associated with blunted insulin response in muscle and increased serum insulin concentration 15 min after glucose challenge. Additionally, pancreata from male and female offspring were harvested at postnatal day 21 and 5 months of age for assessment of endocrine pancreas morphometry by immunostaining. This analysis revealed that gestational exposure to Δ9-THC reduced the density of islets in female, but not male, offspring at postnatal day 21 and 5 months, culminating in reduced β-cell mass at 5 months. These results demonstrate that fetal exposure to Δ9-THC causes female-specific impairments in glucose homeostasis, raising concern regarding the metabolic health of offspring, particularly females, exposed to cannabis in utero.

The lack of knowledge around this dietary ""double burden"" warrants studies to understand the long-term consequences of children previously exposed to malnutrition. We hypothesized that an early-life nutritional insult of low protein consumption in mice would lead to long-term metabolic disturbances that would exacerbate the development of diet-induced insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We investigated the effects of feeding a low protein diet (4% wt/wt) immediately after weaning for four weeks and subsequent feeding of a high carbohydrate high fat feeding for 16 weeks on metabolic function and development of NAFLD. Mice exposed to early-life protein restriction demonstrated a transient glucose intolerance upon recovery by regular chow diet feeding. However, protein restriction after weaning in mice did not exacerbate an obesogenic diet-induced insulin resistance or progression to NAFLD.

Seventeen β-TM patients with AHH (4 had arrested puberty; Tanners' breast stage 2-3), never treated with sex steroids, and 11 eugonadal β-TM patients with spontaneous menstrual cycles at the time of referral were studied.

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of insulin on the expression of SLC2A1 and glucose uptake in decidualizing human endometrial stromal cells. We induced in vitro decidualization of endometrial stromal cells obtained from regularly menstruating healthy non-obese women. The cells were treated with increasing concentrations of insulin, and the involvement of the transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) was evaluated using a FOXO1 inhibitor. SLC2A1 mRNA levels were measured by Real-Time PCR and protein levels were evaluated by immunocytochemistry. Glucose uptake was estimated by an assay quantifying the cellular uptake of radioactive glucose. One-way ANOVA, Dunnett's multiple comparisons test and paired t-test were used to determine the statistical significance of the results. We found that insulin dose-dependently decreased SLC2A1 mRNA levels and decreased protein levels of SLC2A1 in decidualizing human endometrial stromal cells. Transcriptional inactivation of FOXO1 seems to explain at least partly the down-regulation of SLC2A1 by insulin. Glucose uptake increased upon decidualization, whereas insulin treatment resulted in a slight inhibition of the glucose uptake, although not significant for all insulin concentrations. These results indicate an impairment of decidualization by high concentrations of insulin.

765,765,31948940,"Suppression of gluconeogenesis elevates glycolysis and is commonly observed in tumors derived from gluconeogenic tissues including liver and kidney, yet the definitive regulatory mechanism remains elusive. Here, we screened an array of transcription regulators and identified the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) as a key factor that inhibits gluconeogenesis in cancer cells. Specifically, EZH2 repressed the expression of a rate-limiting gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) and promoted tumor growth primarily through FBP1 suppression. Furthermore, EZH2 was upregulated by genotoxins that commonly induce hepatic and renal tumorigenesis. Genotoxin treatments augmented EZH2 acetylation, leading to reduced association between EZH2 and its E3 ubiquitin ligase SMURF2. Consequently, EZH2 became less ubiquitinated and more stabilized, promoting FBP1 attenuation and tumor formation. Intriguingly, FBP1 physically interacted with EZH2, competed for EZH2 binding, and dissembled the polycomb complex. Therefore, FBP1 suppresses polycomb-initiated transcriptional responses and constitutes a double-negative feedback loop indispensable for EZH2-promoted tumorigenesis. Finally, EZH2 and FBP1 levels were inversely correlated in tumor tissues and accurately predicted patient survival. This work reveals an unexpected cross-talk between epigenetic and metabolic events, and identifies a new feedback circuitry that highlights EZH2 inhibitors as liver and kidney cancer therapeutics.

767,767,33552167,"""Vaping"" refers to the inhalation of aerosols produced in devices that heat liquid solutions. The aerosols may contain various additives, flavours, nicotine and other drugs such as cannabis. Nicotine is the most common psychoactive substance in vaping devices (or e-cigarettes) in Canada. While vaping has been viewed primarily as a cessation method or harm reduction strategy for smokers of combustible tobacco cigarettes, a new pattern is becoming evident in adolescents and youth (age 15-24) in Canada. In this age group, vaping is reported in increasing frequencies among those who have never smoked. This suggests the possible emergence of a de novo pattern of substance use and suggests the emergence of an unmet treatment need, vaping cessation. The mental health implications of vaping are largely unknown but available data suggest that vaping is associated with mental health changes similar to those seen with combustible tobacco cigarettes. Understanding the mental health impact of ""vaping"" will be challenging and research is needed. An important message from the smoking literature is that data from randomized cessation trials may be especially valuable because of complex issues of temporality and confounding connected to observational data. Le « vapotage » désigne l’inhalation d’aérosols produits dans des appareils qui réchauffent des solutions liquides. Les aérosols peuvent contenir divers additifs, saveurs, nicotine et d’autres drogues, le cannabis. La nicotine est la substance psychoactive la plus commune dans les appareils de vapotage (ou cigarettes électroniques) au Canada. Bien que le vapotage ait été vu principalement comme une méthode de cessation ou une stratégie de réduction des méfaits pour les fumeurs de cigarettes de tabac combustible, un nouveau modèle devient évident chez les adolescents et les jeunes (15–24 ans) au Canada. Dans ce groupe d’âge, le vapotage est déclaré en fréquence petite mais croissante chez ceux qui n’ont jamais fumé. Cela suggère une possible émergence d’un nouveau modèle d’utilisation de substance et suggère en outre l’émergence d’un nouveau besoin de traitement inédit, la cessation du vapotage. Les implications du vapotage pour la santé mentale sont largement inconnues mais les données disponibles suggèrent que le vapotage est associé aux changements de santé mentale semblables à ceux observés avec les cigarettes de tabac combustible. Comprendre l’effet du vapotage sur la santé mentale sera difficile et il faut de la recherche. La littérature sur le tabagisme nous livre l’important message que les données des essais randomisés sur la cessation peuvent être spécialement valables en raison des questions complexes de temporalité et de confusion liées aux données observationnelles.

768,768,26596520,"Recent studies show that higher-order appetitive neural circuitry may contribute to restricted eating in anorexia nervosa (AN) and overeating in bulimia nervosa (BN). The purpose of this study was to determine whether sensitization effects might underlie pathologic eating behavior when a taste stimulus is administered repeatedly. Recovered AN (RAN, n=14) and BN (RBN, n=15) subjects were studied in order to avoid the confounding effects of altered nutritional state. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measured higher-order brain response to repeated tastes of sucrose (caloric) and sucralose (non-caloric). To test sensitization, the neuronal response to the first and second administration was compared. RAN patients demonstrated a decreased sensitization to sucrose in contrast to RBN patients who displayed the opposite pattern, increased sensitization to sucrose. However, the latter was not as pronounced as in healthy control women (n=13). While both eating disorder subgroups showed increased sensitization to sucralose, the healthy controls revealed decreased sensitization. These findings could reflect on a neuronal level the high caloric intake of RBN during binges and the low energy intake for RAN. RAN seem to distinguish between high energy and low energy sweet stimuli while RBN do not.

However, the role of other important food sources of fructose-containing sugars in the development of MetS remains unclear. To examine the association of major food sources of fructose-containing sugars with incident MetS. MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched from database inception to March 24, 2020, in addition to manual searches of reference lists from included studies using the following search terms: sugar-sweetened beverages, fruit drink, yogurt, metabolic syndrome, and prospective study. Inclusion criteria included prospective cohort studies of 1 year or longer that investigated the association of important food sources of fructose-containing sugars with incident MetS in participants free of MetS at the start of the study. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Extreme quantile risk estimates for each food source with MetS incidence were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis. Interstudy heterogeneity was assessed (Cochran Q statistic) and quantified (I2 statistic). Dose-response analyses were performed using a 1-stage linear mixed-effects model. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation). Results were reported according to the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. Pooled risk ratio (RR) of incident MetS (pairwise and dose response). Thirteen prospective cohort studies (49 591 participants [median age, 51 years; range, 6-90 years]; 14 205 with MetS) that assessed 8 fructose-containing foods and MetS were included. An adverse linear dose-response association for SSBs (RR for 355 mL/d, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.05-1.23) and an L-shaped protective dose-response association for yogurt (RR for 85 g/d, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.58-0.76) and fruit (RR for 80 g/d, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.78-0.86) was found. Fruit juices (mixed and 100%) had a U-shaped dose-response association with protection at moderate doses (mixed fruit juice: RR for 125 mL/d, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.42-0.79; 100% fruit juice: RR for 125 mL/d, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61-0.97). Honey, ice cream, and confectionary had no association with MetS incidence. The certainty of the evidence was moderate for SSBs, yogurt, fruit, mixed fruit juice, and 100% fruit juice and very low for all other food sources. The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that the adverse association of SSBs with MetS does not extend to other food sources of fructose-containing sugars, with a protective association for yogurt and fruit throughout the dose range and for 100% fruit juice and mixed fruit juices at moderate doses. Therefore, current policies and guidelines on the need to limit sources of free sugars may need to be reexamined.

770,770,1900648,"Red cells preserved in extended-storage media are the standard product dispensed by many regional blood centers. When the red cells are intended for neonatal transfusion, concern exists about the safety of the relatively high quantities of additives present in these media. Definitive studies to address these concerns are not available. Therefore, to estimate the effects of additives and to delineate circumstances in which they might be harmful, the quantities transfused in defined clinical settings were calculated, and the following recommendations are offered for transfusing infants less than 4 months of age. First, red cells preserved in extended-storage media should present no substantive risks when used for small-volume (approximately 10 mL/kg) transfusions of premature infants and can be used without additional processing. Second, the risks of the most premature neonatal patients or those with severe renal and/or hepatic insufficiency cannot be defined clearly, and, because data are not available to ensure safety for these infants, removal of the additive medium and resuspension of the red cells in saline or albumin solution immediately before transfusion are recommended. Third, following a similar rationale, it seems prudent to avoid using entire units of red cells preserved in extended-storage media in massive transfusion settings (e.g., exchange transfusion, cardiac surgery, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). In these settings, the preservative medium should be removed and the red cells resuspended in the fluid that is most appropriate for the procedure that is planned. It must be emphasized that these recommendations are based on calculations and hypothetical settings, not actual data. Accordingly, they are tentative and should be altered as definitive information becomes available.

772,772,36075181,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a highly prevalent chronic metabolic disease. Effective antidiabetic drugs are needed to improve and expand the available treatments. Using the ob/ob diabetic mouse model, we previously demonstrated that the alkaloid-rich extract from Litsea glutinosa bark (CG) has potent antidiabetic effects and that laurolitsine (LL) is the richest alkaloid in CG. We conducted a systematic investigation of the antidiabetic effects and potential mechanisms of LL in vitro and in vivo. The antidiabetic effects of LL and its mechanisms of action were explored in HL-7702 hepatocytes in vitro and in db/db mice in vivo by a series of experiments, including cellular toxicity analysis, glucose consumption analysis, serum/liver biochemical analysis, pathological examinations, Western blots, RNA-seq analysis, and gut microbiota analysis. LL stimulated glucose consumption and activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) without inducing lactic acid production or cytotoxicity in vitro. LL had potent antidiabetic effects with hypoglycemic activity in vivo. It improved insulin resistance, glucose tolerance and lipid metabolism; protected liver, renal and pancreatic functions; and promoted weight loss in db/db mice. Transcriptomic analysis suggested that the antidiabetic effects of LL involved the regulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. We further demonstrated that LL effectively activated the hepatic liver kinase B1 (LKB1)/AMPK pathway by regulating the ADP/ATP ratio. Simultaneously, LL significantly modulated the gut microbial community, specifically decreasing the abundances of Mucispirillum schaedleri and Anaerotruncus_sp_G3_2012, which might also contribute to its antidiabetic effects. These results suggest that LL is a promising antidiabetic drug candidate that may improve glucolipid metabolism via modulation of the hepatic LKB1/AMPK pathway and the gut microbiota.

EECs sense luminal and circulating nutrients and respond by secreting hormones that act on multiple organs and organ systems, such as the brain, gallbladder, and pancreas, to control satiety, digestion, and glucose homeostasis. In addition, EECs act locally, on enteric neurons, endothelial cells, and the gastrointestinal epithelium, to facilitate digestion and absorption of nutrients. Many recent reports raise the possibility that EECs and the enteric nervous system may coordinate to regulate gastrointestinal functions. Loss of all EECs results in chronic malabsorptive diarrhea, placing EECs in a central role regulating nutrient absorption in the gut. Because there is increasing evidence that EECs can directly modulate the efficiency of nutrient absorption, it is possible that EECs are master regulators of a feed-forward loop connecting appetite, digestion, metabolism, and abnormally augmented nutrient absorption that perpetuates metabolic disease. This review focuses on the roles that specific EEC hormones play on glucose, peptide, and lipid absorption within the intestine.

776,776,12595591,"Zinc has been recognized as an antioxidant with potential for chronic and acute effects. Oxidative damage produced by free radicals, including nitric oxide (NO), is responsible for certain types of intestinal malabsorption syndromes and diarrhea. Under physiologic or mildly stimulatory conditions for NO synthesis, the small intestine characteristically is in a proabsorptive state; however, an excessive production of NO triggers formation of cyclic nucleotides, which cause secretion and malabsorption. In this study, we hypothesized that low-molecular-weight, soluble zinc chelates could modulate the effects of induced NO excess on the small intestine. In vitro experiments demonstrated that zinc-citrate or zinc-histidine at > or =0.66 mM, as well as a known NO scavenger, 2-[carboxyphenyl]-4,4,4,4-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide, at 2 microM, were effective at removing chemically generated NO. In vivo jejunal perfusions, conducted in healthy rats under anesthesia, showed that c-PTIO reduced the proabsorptive effects produced by 1 mM L-arginine, the precursor of NO. In a standard oral rehydration solution, 1 mM zinc-citrate partially reversed the antiabsorptive effects on potassium caused by an excess of NO generated from 20 mM L-arginine but did not alter sodium or water absorption. The data are consistent with the view that soluble zinc compounds incorporated into an oral rehydration solution may deserve further attention as a means to scavenge NO with fluids used for the treatment of chronic or acute diarrhea, especially in malnourished children who are often zinc deficient.

Glucose uptake of HepG2 cells, determined by flow cytometry, was significantly decreased in the HG and HGI models with insulin stimulation, suggesting insulin resistance of these cells; however, ePSP reversed this decrease in a dose-dependent manner (one-way ANOVA, p<0.05). In the HG and HGI models, ePSP significantly increased glycogen content, insulin receptor substrate-2 protein and phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), as determined by western blot analysis. In addition, ePSP significantly increased glucokinase in the NG and HG models, increased membrane glucose transporter-1 and decreased glycogen synthase kinase-3β in the HGI model, and increased glucose-6-phosphatase in the NG and HGI models (one-way ANOVA, p<0.05). In summary, TV LH-1 ePSP may elevate cellular glucose uptake to regulate glucose homeostasis via the activation of AMPK and glycogen synthesis in an insulin-independent manner.

Fifty participants were enrolled in the study and 43 had CGM and dietary recall data available (16.4 + 1.3 years, 64% female, 64% Hispanic, 74% public insurance). There was high adherence to daily CGM wear (96.4%) without negative impacts on daily functioning. There was no significant change in the glycemic variability as measured by standard deviation, mean amplitude glycemic excursion, and glucose area under the curve over the study period between groups. CGM use appears to be a feasible and acceptable tool to monitor glycemic profiles in adolescents with obesity and may be a helpful strategy to confirm TRE dosage by capturing glycemic excursions compared to self-reported meal timing. There was no effect of TRE on glucose profiles in this study. Further research is needed to investigate how TRE impacts glycemic variability in this age group and to explore if timing of eating window effects these findings.

In in-vitro experiments, the protective effect of aloin on the anabolism and catabolism of the extracellular matrix (ECM) induced by IL-1 β in chondrocytes by inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory factors, including TNF-α (p = 0.016), IL-6 (p = 0.006), iNOS (p = 0.001) and COX-2 (p = 0.006). Mechanistically, Aloin suppressed the IL-1β-induced activation of the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signalling pathway cascades. Moreover, molecular docking studies demonstrated that Aloin bound strongly to PI3K. In vivo, Aloin ameliorated the OA process in the destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) model.

Nevertheless, the function of Cx32 during cerebral I/R is poorly understood. Autophagy is of vital importance in the pathogenesis of cerebral I/R. In the current study, we found that oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) or I/R insult significantly induced the up-regulation of Cx32 and activation of autophagy. Inhibition of Cx32 alleviated OGD/R or I/R injury, and further activated autophagy. In addition, Nur77 expression was found to be up-regulated after OGD/R or I/R. After inhibiting Cx32, the expression of Nur77 was further increased and Nur77 was translocated from nucleus to mitochondrial. Inhibition of Cx32 also activated mitophagy by promoting autophagosome formation and up-regulating the expression of mitochondrial autophagy marker molecules. Of note, in the siNur77-transfected cells, the number of dysfunctional mitochondrial was increased, and mitophagy was suppressed, which aggravated OGD/R-induced neuronal injury. In conclusion, Cx32 might act as a regulatory factor of Nur77 controlling neuronal autophagy in the brains. Understanding the mechanism of this regulatory pathway will provide new insight into the role Cx32 and Nur77 in cerebral ischemia, offering new opportunities for therapeutics.

In this study, we aimed to identify the intestinal colonization mechanisms and key metabolic pathways implemented by Bifidobacterium dentium. B. dentium displayed acid resistance, with high viability over a pH range from 4 to 7; findings that correlated to the expression of Na+/H+ antiporters within the B. dentium genome. B. dentium was found to adhere to human MUC2+ mucus and harbor mucin-binding proteins. Using microbial phenotyping microarrays and fully-defined media, we demonstrated that in the absence of glucose, B. dentium could metabolize a variety of nutrient sources. Many of these nutrient sources were plant-based, suggesting that B. dentium can consume dietary substances. In contrast to other bifidobacteria, B. dentium was largely unable to grow on compounds found in human mucus; a finding that was supported by its glycosyl hydrolase (GH) profile. Of the proteins identified in B. dentium by proteomic analysis, a large cohort of proteins were associated with diverse metabolic pathways, indicating metabolic plasticity which supports colonization of the dynamic gastrointestinal environment.

Protein expressions of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) , BCL2-Associated X (Bax), cleaved caspase 3, p-Akt and Akt were determined by Western blot. Ulinastatin increased the HG-induced reduction in cell viability and MMP expression. Ulinastatin also inhibited HG-induced apoptosis.

789,789,12576176,"We studied the effects of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) on brain amino acid metabolism in mice. Administration of this convulsant did not change forebrain concentrations of amino acids, but when treated animals also received an injection of [15N]leucine, which served as a tracer of brain nitrogen metabolism, total (14N+15N) forebrain [leucine] exceeded control and [glutamate] and [aspartate] were less than control, as were forebrain concentrations of [15N]glutamate and [2-15N]glutamine. These data suggest greater uptake of [15N]leucine but diminished transamination of leucine to glutamate in experimental mice. In contrast to the [15N]leucine studies, which were associated with increased brain [leucine], the administration of [15N]alanine did not alter levels of alanine, glutamate or glutamine. However, label appeared in [2-15N]glutamine much more readily with [15N]alanine than with [15N]leucine as precursor and the ratio of enrichment in [2-15N]glutamine/[15N]alanine was much higher than that in [2-15N]glutamine/[15N]leucine, a finding that is compatible with preferential metabolism of alanine in astrocytes, which are the primary site of brain glutamine synthetase. We conclude that PTZ treatment favors the uptake of selected amino acids such as leucine but also diminishes transamination of leucine to yield glutamate via branched-chain amino acid transaminase. PTZ treatment may favor the ""reverse"" transamination of 2-keto-isocaproate (KIC), the ketoacid of leucine, to form leucine and to consume glutamate. A net result of these processes may be to enable the brain more readily to dispose of the glutamate that is released from neurons during convulsive activity.

We investigated this in diabetic hypertensive (mREN2)27 rats. Rats were made diabetic with streptozotocin and treated with vehicle, the angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan, the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin, or their combination. Blood pressure (BP) was measured by telemetry. Diabetes resulted in albuminuria, accompanied by glomerulosclerosis, without a change in glomerular filtration rate. Empagliflozin did not lower BP, while valsartan did, and when combined the BP drop was largest. Only dual blockade reduced cardiac hypertrophy and prevented left ventricular dilatation. Valsartan, but not empagliflozin, increased renin, and the largest renin rise occurred during dual blockade, resulting in plasma angiotensin II [but not angiotensin-(1-7)] upregulation. In contrast, in the kidney, valsartan lowered angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7), and empagliflozin did not alter this. Although both valsartan and empagliflozin alone tended to diminish albuminuria, the reduction was significant only when both drugs were combined. This was accompanied by reduced glomerulosclerosis, no change in glomerular filtration rate, and a favorable expression pattern of fibrosis and inflammatory markers (including SGLT2) in the kidney. RAS blockade and SGLT2 inhibition display synergistic beneficial effects on BP, kidney injury and cardiac hypertrophy in a rat with hypertension and diabetes.

However, the molecular mechanism is still elusive, lacking effective therapeutic strategies. Carminic acid (CA), a glucosylated anthraquinone found in scale insects like Dactylopius coccus, exerts anti-tumor and anti-oxidant activities. Nevertheless, its regulatory role in Fru-induced NAFLD is still obscure. Here, the effects of CA on NAFLD in Fru-challenged mice and the underlying molecular mechanisms were explored. We found that Fru intake significantly led to insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in liver of mice, which were considerably attenuated by CA treatment through repressing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Additionally, inflammatory response induced by Fru was also attenuated by CA via the blockage of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and tumor necrosis factor α/TNF-α receptor (TNF-α/TNFRs) signaling pathways. Moreover, Fru-provoked oxidative stress in liver tissues was remarkably attenuated by CA mainly through improving the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2). These anti-dyslipidemias, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities regulated by CA were confirmed in the isolated primary hepatocytes with Fru stimulation. Importantly, the in vitro experiments demonstrated that Fru-induced lipid accumulation was closely associated with inflammatory response and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production regulated by TNF-α and Nrf-2 signaling pathways, respectively. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that CA could be considered as a potential therapeutic strategy to attenuate metabolic disorder and NAFLD in Fru-challenged mice mainly through suppressing inflammatory response and oxidative stress.

The present study investigated the regulation and the role of G6PD in ischemia/reperfusion-induced neuronal injury with in vivo and in vitro models of ischemic stroke. The results showed that the levels of G6PD mRNA and protein were increased after ischemia/reperfusion. In vivo, lentivirus-mediated G6PD overexpression in mice markedly reduced neuronal damage after ischemia/reperfusion insult, while lentivirus-mediated G6PD knockdown exacerbated it. In vitro, overexpression of G6PD in cultured primary neurons decreased neuronal injury under oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) condition, whereas knockdown of G6PD aggravated it. Overexpression of G6PD increased levels of NADPH and reduced form of glutathione (rGSH), and ameliorated ROS-induced macromolecular damage. On the contrary, knockdown of G6PD executed the opposite effects in mice and in primary neurons. Supplementation of exogenous NADPH alleviated the detrimental effects of G6PD knockdown, whereas further enhanced the beneficial effects of G6PD overexpression in ischemic injury.

We review the frequency of metabolic acidosis among children and adults, as well as the mechanism of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and renal tubular acidosis in topiramate users. Finally, we describe the long-term effects of topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis, including nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and bone degradation. Patients who are prescribed topiramate should be carefully monitored for metabolic derangements, and they may benefit from alkali supplementation, or in extreme cases, discontinuation of the drug altogether.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) was found to improve mitochondrial function in DGUOK-deficient hepatocyte-like cells by activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α). NAD treatment also improved ATP production in MTDPS3-null rats and in hepatocyte-like cells that were deficient in ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase subunit M2B (RRM2B), suggesting that it could be broadly effective.

This study analyzed data from a population-based cross-sectional study of healthy children and adolescents from Mexico City. Data of subject's total water intake (TWI) and its' sources were collected using two 24-h recall surveys. Patterns of beverage intake were constructed based on the guidance system of beverage consumption in the US. Maternal factors of interest included age, body mass index (BMI), mother's educational level (MEL), socioeconomic status (SES), and belongingness to the paid workforce (BPW). Data of 1532 subject-mother dyads informed that 47% of subjects did not meet the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations for TWI, and 94.6% showed an unhealthy beverage intake pattern, mainly consisting in a lower intake of water and a higher intake of caloric beverages with some nutrients; and calorically sweetened beverages. The major sources of hydration were caloric beverages with some nutrients (i.e., whole milk, fruit water, and flavored milk).

805,805,35851845,"Glutamine is a conditionally essential nutrient for many cancer cells, but it remains unclear how consuming glutamine in excess of growth requirements confers greater fitness to glutamine-addicted cancers. By contrasting two breast cancer subtypes with distinct glutamine dependencies, we show that glutamine-indispensable triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells rely on a non-canonical glutamine-to-glutamate overflow, with glutamine carbon routed once through the TCA cycle. Importantly, this single-pass glutaminolysis increases TCA cycle fluxes and replenishes TCA cycle intermediates in TNBC cells, a process that achieves net oxidation of glucose but not glutamine. The coupling of glucose and glutamine catabolism appears hard-wired via a distinct TNBC gene expression profile biased to strip and then sequester glutamine nitrogen, but hampers the ability of TNBC cells to oxidise glucose when glutamine is limiting. Our results provide a new understanding of how metabolically rigid TNBC cells are sensitive to glutamine deprivation and a way to select vulnerable TNBC subtypes that may be responsive to metabolic-targeted therapies.

However, the causality between those two is still elusive. Here, we studied whether a significant modification of gut microbial composition by antibiotics can influence the fructose-induced metabolic changes. Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into four groups including controls, controls + antibiotics, high fructose diet (HFrD, 60% fructose), HFrD + antibiotics (n = 7-8 in each group) for a period of 8-weeks. The high fructose diet increased blood pressure (BP), triglyceride (TG), fatty liver and the expression of hepatic genes related to lipogenesis, and fructose transport and metabolism. In addition, fructose changed the microbial composition and increased acetic and butyric acids in fecal samples but not in the blood. Antibiotic treatment significantly reduced microbial diversity and modified the microbial composition in the samples. However, minimal or no effect was seen in the metabolic phenotypes. In conclusion, high fructose consumption (60%) induced metabolic changes and dysbiosis in rats. However, antibiotic treatment did not reverse the metabolic phenotype.

During insulin clamps, hepatic glucose production was suppressed to a similar magnitude by insulin, but glucose infusion rates to maintain euglycemia were higher in mutation carriers, indicating increased peripheral insulin sensitivity. Consistently, a polymorphic CLOF CYP8B1 mutation associated with lower fasting insulin in the AMP-T2D-GENES study. Exposure of primary human muscle cells to mutation-carrier CA/CDCA ratios demonstrated increased FOXO1 activity, and upregulation of both insulin signaling and glucose uptake, which were mediated by increased CDCA. Inhibition of FOXO1 attenuated the CDCA-mediated increase in muscle insulin signaling and glucose uptake. We found that reduced CYP8B1 activity associates with increased insulin sensitivity in humans.CONCLUSIONOur findings suggest that increased circulatory CDCA due to reduced CYP8B1 activity increases skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity, contributing to increased whole-body insulin sensitization.FUNDINGBiomedical Research Council/National Medical Research Council of Singapore.

One year after GH treatment resumption, fasting glucose levels, HDL cholesterol levels, and femoral neck BMD increased significantly. Longer GH interruption (>2 years, 60.4%) resulted in worse lipid profiles at re-evaluation. The duration of interruption was positively correlated with fasting glucose and non-HDL cholesterol levels after adjusting for covariates.

810,810,16612126,"Premature infants of low and extremely low birth weight represent a challenge for neonatal intensive care units and paediatricians. These neonates may be at increased risk of insulin resistance and diabetes perinatally and during childhood. During the first week of postnatal life, infants born prematurely are at risk of abnormalities in glucose homeostasis. Additionally, there are major differences in their glucose/insulin homeostasis compared with infants born at term. Preterm infants are at risk of hypoglycaemia, due to decreases in deposits of glycogen and fat that occur during the third trimester, and also to transient hyperinsulinaemia. Hyperglycaemia may also be observed in preterm infants during the perinatal period. These infants are unable to suppress glucose production within a large range of glucose and insulin concentrations, insulin secretory response is inappropriate, insulin processing is immature and there is an increased ratio of the glucose transporters Glut-1/Glut-2 in fetal tissues, which limits sensitivity and hepatocyte reaction to increments in glucose/insulin concentration during hyperglycaemia. In addition, increased concentrations of tumour necrosis factor alpha present in intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and induce insulin resistance. It has been proposed that the reduced insulin sensitivity may result from adaptation to an adverse in utero environment during a critical period of development. We have investigated postnatal insulin resistance in 60 children born with very low birth weight and either small for gestational age or at an appropriate size for gestational age. This study showed that IUGR, rather than low birth weight itself, was associated with increased fasting insulin levels. As poor fetal growth may be associated with the development of obesity, type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome in later life, it is important that we continue to increase our understanding of the effects of IUGR on postnatal growth and metabolism.

817,817,24309718,"Asthma is typically considered as an immunologic Th2 cell-mediated disease, a notion that is still inspiring many therapeutic strategies. In the past years, however, an innate immune cell type has been discovered in mice that resides in the mucosa and secretes the Th2 cytokines IL-13 and IL-5 in response to IL-33 and IL-25 released by a damaged epithelium. These cells [now named group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s)] are rare, systemically dispersed, long-lived, and exist in humans. Recent work shows that ILC2s are critical for the development of asthma and related phenotypes in mice. Their role in human asthma remains unknown. This article reviews the most recent work that highlights ILC2s and the mechanisms underlying their critical role in experimental asthma. We also review the results of asthma therapeutic trials that targeted IL-13 and IL-5, the products of both Th2 cells and ILC2s. Although the limited success of these trials is often quoted to dismiss the role of Th2 immunity as a whole, we propose that Th2 cytokines released by ILC2s may be critical for human asthma, but are not adequately neutralized because they are not readily accessible in peripheral tissues.

818,818,25222554,"Appropriate in utero growth is essential for offspring development and is a critical contributor to long-term health. Fetal growth is largely dictated by the availability of nutrients in maternal circulation and the ability of these nutrients to be transported into fetal circulation via the placenta. Substrate flux across placental gradients is dependent on the accessibility and activity of nutrient-specific transporters. Changes in the expression and activity of these transporters is implicated in cases of restricted and excessive fetal growth, and may represent a control mechanism by which fetal growth rate attempts to match availability of nutrients in maternal circulation. This review provides an overview of placenta nutrient transport with an emphasis on macro-nutrient transporters. It highlights the changes in expression and activity of these transporters associated with common pregnancy pathologies, including intrauterine growth restriction, macrosomia, diabetes and obesity, as well as the potential impact of maternal diet. Molecular signaling pathways linking maternal nutrient availability and placenta nutrient transport are discussed. How sexual dimorphism affects fetal growth strategies and the placenta's response to an altered intrauterine environment is considered. Further knowledge in this area may be the first step in the development of targeted interventions to help optimize fetal growth.

The outcome measure was proficiency on 4th grade literacy and mathematics achievement tests. Three glucose concentration cutoffs for defining hypoglycemia (<35, <40, and <45 mg/dL) were investigated. Logistic regression models were developed to examine the association between early TNH and achievement test proficiency based on perinatal factors.

This is mediated via three different nodes of regulation, including differential effects on malonyl-CoA levels, effects on mitochondrial size/protein abundance, and acetylation of mitochondrial proteins. HFD- and HFD plus fructose-fed mice have decreased CTP1a activity, the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid oxidation, whereas knockdown of fructose metabolism increases CPT1a and its acylcarnitine products. Furthermore, fructose-supplemented HFD leads to increased acetylation of ACADL and CPT1a, which is associated with decreased fat metabolism. In summary, dietary fructose, but not glucose, supplementation of HFD impairs mitochondrial size, function, and protein acetylation, resulting in decreased fatty acid oxidation and development of metabolic dysregulation.

Nevertheless, the cellular mechanisms by which stressful life experiences and their associated primary neuroendocrine mediators cause biological damage and increase disease risk remain poorly understood. The allostatic load model of chronic stress focuses on glucocorticoid dysregulation. In this Perspectives, we expand upon the metabolic aspects of this model-particularly glucose imbalance-and propose that mitochondrial dysfunction constitutes an early, modifiable target of chronic stress and stress-related health behaviours. Central to this process is mitochondrial regulation of energy metabolism and cellular signalling. Chronically elevated glucose levels damage both mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA, generating toxic products that can promote systemic inflammation, alter gene expression and hasten cell ageing. Consequently, the concept of 'mitochondrial allostatic load' defines the deleterious structural and functional changes that mitochondria undergo in response to elevated glucose levels and stress-related pathophysiology.

Total yield of the brush border marker enzyme alkaline phosphatase in the vesicle fraction as compared to the crude homogenate was approximately 40%, and the specific activity of the enzyme was increased 25-fold on the average. The brush border membrane vesicle fraction was only contaminated with other cellular organelles (basolateral membranes, mitochondria, lysosomes or endoplasmic reticulum) to a minor extent.

In this study, exosomes were extracted from GEC culture supernatants and podocytes were incubated with the GEC-derived exosomes. Here, we demonstrate that HG induces the endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) of GECs and HG-treated cells undergoing the EndoMT secrete more exosomes than normal glucose (NG)-treated GECs. We show that GEC-derived exosomes can be internalized by podocytes and exosomes from HG-treated cells undergoing an EndoMT-like process can trigger the podocyte EMT and barrier dysfunction. Our study reveals that TGF-β1 mRNA is enriched in exosomes from HG-treated GECs and probably mediates the EMT and dysfunction of podocytes. In addition, our experimental results illustrate that canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling is involved in the exosome-induced podocyte EMT. Our findings suggest the importance of paracrine communication via exosomes between cells undergoing the EndoMT and podocytes for renal fibrosis in DN.

PI-CF subjects had lower acute insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon responses compared with PS-CF and normal control subjects, indicating reduced β-cell secretory capacity and α-cell function. Fasting proinsulin-to-C-peptide and proinsulin secretory ratios during glucose potentiation were higher in PI-CF, suggesting impaired proinsulin processing. In the first 30 min of the MMTT, insulin secretion was lower in PI-CF compared with PS-CF and normal control subjects, and glucagon-like peptide 1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide were lower compared with PS-CF, and after 180 min, glucose was higher in PI-CF compared with normal control subjects. These findings indicate that despite ""normal"" glucose tolerance, adolescents and adults with PI-CF have impairments in functional islet mass and associated early-phase insulin secretion, which with decreased incretin responses likely leads to the early development of postprandial hyperglycemia in CF.

Reducing the burden of this RBC ""storage lesion"" is a major challenge in transfusion medicine. Additive solution-7 (AS-7) is a new RBC storage solution designed to improve RBC metabolism by providing phosphate and increasing buffering capacity. Storage quality in AS-7 was measured in a prospective, randomized, three-center trial using units of whole blood from healthy human subjects whose RBCs were stored for up to 56 days in AS-7 (n = 120) or for 42 days in the control solution AS-1 (n = 60). Hemolysis and shedding of protein-containing microvesicles were significantly reduced in RBCs stored in AS-7 for 42 and 56 days compared with RBCs stored in AS-1. Autologous in vivo recoveries of RBCs stored in AS-7 was 88 ± 5% at 42 days (n = 27) and 82 ± 3% at 56 days (n = 27), exceeding recoveries of RBCs stored in currently used solutions. Increasing the phosphate, pH range, and buffer capacity of a RBC storage system allowed RBCs to be stored better and longer than currently approved storage systems.

Cancer cells often rewire their metabolic pathways for adaption to nutrient stress, and the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH1) is a key enzyme in glutaminolysis that converts glutamate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). Here, we show that, under low glucose, GDH1 is phosphorylated at serine (S) 384 and interacts with RelA and IKKβ. GDH1-produced α-KG directly binds to and activates IKKβ and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling, which promotes glucose uptake and tumor cell survival by upregulating GLUT1, thereby accelerating gliomagenesis. In addition, GDH1 S384 phosphorylation correlates with the malignancy and prognosis of human glioblastoma.

To determine the role of corticosterone in the enhancement of fructose uptake by diet, we fed 17-d-old rat pups, previously adrenalectomized or sham-operated at 10 d of age, high (65%) fructose or fructose-free diets for 3 d. Corticosterone levels in 20-d-old sham-operated and unoperated controls were 2.2-3.3-fold higher than those in adrenalectomized littermates and in unoperated 10-d-old pups. Fructose uptake per mg and per cm were each 2.0-2.5-fold higher in adrenalectomized and sham-operated pups fed high fructose diets compared with those in adrenalectomized and sham-operated littermates fed fructose-free diets or to those in unoperated littermates allowed to wean normally with the dam. An increase in levels of GLUT5 mRNA in pups fed high fructose diets paralleled the increase in rates of fructose uptake.

840,840,12386459,"Cystic fibrosis is a disease for which a number of Phase I clinical trials of gene therapy have been initiated. Several factors account for the high level of interest in a gene therapy approach to this disease. CF is the most common lethal inherited disease in Caucasian populations. The lung, the organ that is predominantly responsible for the morbidity and mortality in CF patients, is accessible by a non-invasive method, the inhalation of aerosols. The vectors employed in the Phase I trials have included recombinant adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses and cationic lipids. While there have been some positive results, the success of the vectors until now has been limited by either immunogenicity or low efficiency. A more fundamental obstacle has been the absence of appropriate receptors on the apical surface of airway epithelial cells. Molecular conjugates with carbohydrate substitution to provide targeting offer several potential advantages. Lactosylated polylysine in which 40% of the lysines have been substituted with lactose has been shown to provide a high efficiency of transfection in primary cultures of CF airway epithelial cells. Other important features include a relatively low immunogenicity and cytotoxicity. Most importantly, the lactosylated polylysine was demonstrated to give nuclear localization in CF airway epithelial cells. Until now, most non-viral vectors did not have the capability to provide nuclear localization. These unique qualities provided by the lactosylation of non-viral vectors, such as polylysine may help to advance the development of molecular conjugates sufficiently to warrant their use in future clinical trials for the gene therapy of inherited diseases of the lung.

Prolactin (PRL) can enhance beta-cell proliferation and insulin secretion in vitro, yet whether it is PRL or other pregnancy-related factors that mediate these adaptive changes during pregnancy is unknown.

An ip glucose tolerance test was performed on timed-pregnant Prlr(+/+) and heterozygous null Prlr(+/-) mice on d 0, 15, and 18 of pregnancy. Compared with Prlr(+/+) mice, Prlr(+/-) mice had impaired glucose clearance, decreased glucose-stimulated insulin release, higher nonfasted blood glucose, and lower insulin levels during but not before pregnancy. There was no difference in their insulin tolerance. Prlr(+/+) mice show a significant incremental increase in islet density and beta-cell number and mass throughout pregnancy, which was attenuated in the Prlr(+/-) mice. Prlr(+/+) mice also had a more robust beta-cell proliferation rate during pregnancy, whereas there was no difference in apoptosis rate between the Prlr(+/+) and Prlr(+/-) mice before, during, or after pregnancy. Interestingly, genotype of the mothers had a significant impact on the offspring's phenotype, such that daughters derived from Prlr(+/-) mothers had a more severe phenotype than those derived from Prlr(+/+) mothers.

842,842,37479748,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common liver diseases in the U.S. and worldwide. The roles of early postnatal life stress (EPLS) and the fatty acid translocase (CD36) on the pathogenesis of adult-onset NAFLD remain unknown. We hypothesized that EPLS, in the form of neonatal maternal separation (NMS), would predispose mice towards developing adult NAFLD, increase hepatic CD36 expression, and differentially methylate Cd36 promoter concurrently. NMS was performed on mice from postnatal day 1 to 21 and a high-fat/high-sucrose (HFS) diet was started at 4 weeks of age to generate four experimental groups: Naive-control diet (CD), Naive-HFS, NMS-CD, and NMS-HFS. NMS alone caused NAFLD in adult male mice at 25 weeks of age. The effects of NMS and HFS were generally additive in terms of NAFLD, hepatic Cd36 mRNA levels, and hepatic Cd36 promoter DNA hypomethylation. Cd36 promoter methylation negatively correlated with Cd36 mRNA levels. Two differentially methylated regions (DMRs) within Cd36 promoter regions appeared to be vulnerable to NMS in the mouse. Our findings suggest that NMS increases the risk of an individual, particularly male, towards NAFLD when faced with a HFS diet later in life. The key message of this article is that neonatal maternal separation and a postweaning high-fat/high-sucrose diet increased the risk of an individual, particularly male, towards NAFLD in adult life. What this study adds to the existing literature includes the identification of two vulnerable differentially methylated regions in hepatic Cd36 promoters whose methylation levels very strongly negatively correlated with Cd36 mRNA. The impact of this article is that it provides an early-life environment-responsive gene/promoter methylation model and an animal model for furthering the mechanistic study on how the insults in early-life environment are ""transmitted"" into adulthood and caused NAFLD.

843,843,35032624,"Functional loss of endothelial cells will lead to development and progression of atherosclerosis in diabetic patients. However, dysfunction of endothelial cells in diabetes has yet to be fully understood. We aimed to characterize the potential effects of liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, on preventing high glucose-induced endothelial dysfunction and excessive mitophagic response. Pretreatment with liraglutide prevented downregulation of eNOS phosphorylation and NO secretion, and reduced apoptosis and oxidative stress of the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to high glucose. We further demonstrated that liraglutide likely mediated such protective effects by reducing PINK1/Parkin mediated mitophagy. Liraglutide markedly decreased high glucose-induced mitochondrial ROS, lessened PINK1 expression and mitochondrial accumulation of Parkin, but recovered SIRT1 expression. Seahorse analysis revealed that liraglutide mitigated high glucose-induced reduction of basal and maximum respiration rates as well as spare respiration capacity. Inhibition of Parkin by RNA silencing not only resulted in increased mitochondrial and cytosolic ROS and reduced mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial membrane potential, but also led to increased apoptotic responses in high glucose treated HUVECs which were not preventable by liraglutide. Together, our study reveals that liraglutide acts upstream of the PINK1/Parkin pathway to effectively counteract high glucose induced cell dysfunction by suppression of the PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy. Therefore, its use as an adjunct therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus is warranted to reduce the risk of atherosclerosis. Further research is required to examine the exact molecules, including SIRT1, upstream of the PINK1/parkin pathway that liraglutide targets to maintain the mitochondrial homeostasis.

This was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial and included healthy infants and young children undergoing their 10- to 18-month immunization. Behavioral pain outcome was measured during, and shortly after the last injection. The infant's pain was also measured by a salivary test using substance (P), and videotaping of crying time.

In this prospective, longitudinal observational study (median follow-up 1.8y), the plasma 1-deoxySL profile was analyzed in 15 adult GSDI patients (12 GSDIa, 3 GSDIb), and 31 healthy controls, along with standard parameters for monitoring GSDI. 1-Deoxysphinganine (1-deoxySA) concentrations were elevated in GSDI compared to controls (191 ± 129 vs 35 ± 14 nmol/l, p < 0.0001). Concordant with the mechanism of 1-deoxySL synthesis, plasma alanine was higher (625 ± 182 vs 398 ± 90 μmol/l, p < 0.0001), while serine was lower in GSDI than in controls (88 ± 22 vs 110 ± 18 μmol/l. p < 0.001).

The 1-deoxySL profile in GSDIb was distinct from GSDIa, with a different ratio of saturated to unsaturated 1-deoxySL. In addition to the known abnormalities of lipoproteins, GSDI patients also have a disturbed sphingolipid metabolism with elevated plasma 1-deoxySL concentrations. 1-DeoxySA relates to the occurrence of low blood glucose, and may constitute a potential new biomarker for assessing metabolic control.

Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science) were searched. Outcomes assessed were human-milk energy (kcal/L), fat (g/L), and total protein (g/L) from mothers 1 to 6 mo postpartum. Studies with data on maternal BMI or weight and height that quantified human-milk energy, fat, or protein between 1 and 6 mo postpartum were eligible. Random-effects meta-regression weighted by the inverse of the study-level SE was completed for each of the 3 outcomes. The certainty of evidence for each outcome was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. A total of 11,373 titles and abstracts were identified, and after full-text screening, 69 articles of 66 studies were included. Meta-regression results showed a positive association between maternal BMI and human-milk fat (β: 0.56 g/L; 95% CI: 0.034, 1.1; P = 0.04; I2 = 93.7%, n = 63 datapoints). There was no significant association between maternal BMI and human-milk energy (β: 3.9 kcal/L; 95% CI: -1.6, 9.5; P = 0.16, I2 = 93.3%, n = 40 datapoints) or total protein (β: 0.13 g/L; 95% CI: -0.16, 0.41; P = 0.37, I2 = 99.1%, n = 40 datapoints). The certainty of evidence for human-milk energy was low and the certainty of evidence for fat and total protein was very low. Meta-regression analysis of available literature suggested an association between maternal BMI and human-milk fat between 1 and 6 mo postpartum. Future studies are needed to confirm the relation between maternal BMI; variation in human-milk energy, fat, and protein content; and the implications for child growth and development.

Twenty-five mother-infant dyads attended clinical visits to the Oklahoma Health Sciences Center at 1 and 6 months of infant age. Infants were exclusively breastfed for 6 months and sugars in breast milk (i.e., fructose, glucose, lactose) were measured by Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and glucose oxidase. Infant body composition was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at 1 and 6 months. Multiple linear regression was used to examine associations between breast milk sugars and infant body composition at 6 months of age.

Many of these products are ultraprocessed and contain additives, with concerning implications for the health and nutrition of children. The study objectives were as follows: 1) to assess the levels of processing among different commercially produced complementary food product (CPCF) categories marketed in the Southeast Asia region, 2) to compare the nutrient content of CPCF products across levels of processing, and 3) to assess the types of additives present in different CPCF categories. This cross-sectional study involved secondary analysis of a cross-sectional dataset of product label information from CPCF purchased in 2021 in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Ingredient lists were reviewed to determine the level of processing-based on the Nova classification-and the presence of additives. Nutrient declaration panels were reviewed to determine total sugar, sodium, and total fat. Nearly half of all CPCF were ultraprocessed, with total sugar and sodium content significantly higher among ultraprocessed CPCF than unprocessed/minimally processed products. Almost half of CPCF contained additives, with a median of 6 per product. More than 30% of all CPCF made use of cosmetic additives to enhance the products' appearance, flavor, or texture, with emulsifiers, colors, and thickeners the most prevalent. Almost one-third of products contained additives not permitted in Codex Alimentarius standards and guidelines for CPCF.

856,856,36529278,"Accumulating evidence suggests that de novo lipogenesis is a typical characteristic facilitating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progression. Gallic acid (GA) is a naturally occurring phenolic acid with metabolic disease-related clinical significance and preclinical benefits. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-steatotic potentials of GA in a fructose-induced NAFLD mouse model featuring a hepatic lipogenic phenotype. The results revealed that GA alleviated hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response in fructose-fed mice. Mechanistically, GA treatment restored AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα) phosphorylation, resulting in downregulations of pro-lipogenic factors, including sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), fatty acid synthetase (FASN), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), in hepatocytes of mice and in vitro. Furthermore, computational docking analysis indicated that GA could directly interact with AMPKα/β subunits to stabilize its activation. These results suggest that GA ameliorates fructose-induced hepatosteatosis by restraining hepatic lipogenesis via AMPK-dependent suppression of the SREBP-1/ACC/FASN cascade. Altogether, this study demonstrates that GA supplement may be a promising therapeutic strategy in NAFLD, especially in the subset with enhanced hepatic lipogenesis.

Study participants received the nonmetabolized sugars lactulose/rhamnose enterally on study days 1, 8, and 15 and lactulose/rhamnose were measured in urine by high-performance liquid chromatography. Serum zonulin and fecal alpha-1-anti-trypsin, 2 other IP markers, were measured by semiquantitative Western blot and ELISA, respectively. In a cohort of 43 subjects, the lactulose/rhamnose ratio was increased on day 1 and decreased over 2 weeks, but remained higher in infants born at ≤28 weeks of gestation compared with IP in infants born at >28 weeks of gestation. Exclusive breastmilk feeding was associated with more rapid maturation in intestinal barrier function. A cluster analysis of 35 subjects who had urine samples from all time points revealed 3 IP patterns (cluster 1, normal maturation: n = 20 [57%]); cluster 2, decreased IP during the first week and subsequent substantial increase: n = 5 [14%]); and cluster 3, delayed maturation: n = 10 [29%]). There were trends toward more prolonged antibiotic exposure (P = .092) and delayed initiation of feeding ≥4 days (P = .064) in infants with abnormal IP patterns.

Although the hypertonic saline infusion test led to high diagnostic accuracy, it is a laborious test requiring close monitoring of plasma sodium levels. As such, we leverage machine learning (ML) to facilitate differential diagnosis of cDI. We analyzed data of 59 patients with cDI and 81 patients with PP from a prospective multicenter study evaluating the hypertonic saline test as new test approach to diagnose cDI. Our primary outcome was the diagnostic accuracy of the ML-based algorithm in differentiating cDI from PP patients. The data set used included 56 clinical, biochemical, and radiological covariates. We identified a set of five covariates which were crucial for differentiating cDI from PP patients utilizing standard ML methods. We developed ML-based algorithms on the data and validated them with an unseen test data set. Urine osmolality, plasma sodium and glucose, known transsphenoidal surgery, or anterior pituitary deficiencies were selected as input parameters for the basic ML-based algorithm. Testing it on an unseen test data set resulted in a high area under the curve (AUC) score of 0.87. A further improvement of the ML-based algorithm was reached with the addition of MRI characteristics and the results of the hypertonic saline infusion test (AUC: 0.93 and 0.98, respectively).

864,864,38169625,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Mitochondrial dysfunction in renal tubules, occurring early in the disease, is linked to the development of DKD, although the underlying pathways remain unclear. Here, we examine diabetic human and mouse kidneys, and HK-2 cells exposed to high glucose, to show that high glucose disrupts mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane (MAM) and causes mitochondrial fragmentation. We find that high glucose conditions increase mitogen-activated protein kinase 1(MAPK1), a member of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway, which in turn lowers the level of phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 2 (PACS-2), a key component of MAM that tethers mitochondria to the ER. MAPK1-induced disruption of MAM leads to mitochondrial fragmentation but this can be rescued in HK-2 cells by increasing PACS-2 levels. Functional studies in diabetic mice show that inhibition of MAPK1 increases PACS-2 and protects against the loss of MAM and the mitochondrial fragmentation. Taken together, these results identify the MAPK1-PACS-2 axis as a key pathway to therapeutically target as well as provide new insights into the pathogenesis of DKD.

Whether the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) can enhance pancreatic islet function in cystic fibrosis (CF) is not known. We studied 32 adults with PI-CF and AGT randomized to receive either GLP-1 (n = 16) or GIP (n = 16) during glucose-potentiated arginine (GPA) testing of islet function on two occasions, with either incretin or placebo infused, in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over fashion. Another four adults with PI-CF and normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and four matched control participants without CF underwent similar assessment with GIP. In PI-CF with AGT, GLP-1 substantially augmented second-phase insulin secretion but without effect on the acute insulin response to GPA or the proinsulin secretory ratio (PISR), while GIP infusion did not enhance second-phase or GPA-induced insulin secretion but increased the PISR. GIP also did not enhance second-phase insulin in PI-CF with NGT but did so markedly in control participants without CF controls. These data indicate that GLP-1, but not GIP, augments glucose-dependent insulin secretion in PI-CF, supporting the likelihood that GLP-1 agonists could have therapeutic benefit in this population.

The survey consisted of 10 open-ended and 12 multiple-choice questions that collected information about size of the PKU population in each center, the center's clinical practices and the outcomes observed by the center concerning adherence, clinical and biochemical abnormalities and clinical symptoms (GI and sleep). The questionnaire was sent to 72 experts from metabolic centers in 11 European countries. Thirty-three centers answered. The results of this survey provide information about the clinical practice in different age groups, concentrating on dietary tolerance, treatment adherence, and metabolic control. All the centers prescribed a Phe-restricted diet, with Phe-free/low Phe protein substitutes and low protein foods. Daily doses given of protein substitutes varied from 1 to 5, with adherence to the prescribed amounts decreasing with increasing age. Respondents identified that improvement in the flavor, taste, volume and smell of protein substitutes may improve adherence. Finally, the survey showed that clinical symptoms, such as GI discomfort and sleep problems occur in patients with PKU but are not systematically evaluated.

This was a secondary analysis of a completed prospective pregnancy cohort. Cervicovaginal fluid was obtained between 20 and 24 weeks' gestation. The participants selected for metabolomic profiling were frequency-matched by birth outcome and cervicovaginal microbiota profile. This analysis included 222 participants with cervical length measured. A short cervix was defined as one having length <25 mm, as measured by transvaginal ultrasound. Unpaired t-tests were performed with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. There were 27 participants with a short cervix, and 195 with normal cervical length. Of the 637 metabolites detected, 26 differed between those with a short cervix and those with normal cervical lengths; 22 were decreased, of which 21 belonged to the lipid metabolism pathway (all P<.000079).

This dissociation of whole-body insulin resistance from fasting hyperglycemia may be explained by racial differences in gluconeogenesis, hepatic fat, or tissue-specific insulin sensitivity. Two groups of premenopausal federally employed women, without diabetes were studied. Using stable isotope tracers, [2H2O] and [6,62-H2]glucose, basal glucose production was partitioned into its components (gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis) and basal whole-body lipolysis ([2H5]glycerol) was measured. Indices of insulin sensitivity, whole-body (SI), hepatic (HISIGPR), and adipose tissue, were calculated. Hepatic fat was measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Black women had less hepatic fat and lower fractional and absolute gluconeogenesis. Whole-body SI, HISIGPR, and adipose tissue sensitivity were similar by race, but at any given level of whole-body SI, Black women had higher HISIGPR. Therefore, fasting hyperglycemia may be a less common early pathological feature of prediabetes in Black women compared with White women, because gluconeogenesis remains lower despite similar whole-body SI.

The metabolic effects of fructose on the development of metabolic syndrome and NAFLD are not completely understood. High fructose intake impairs copper status, and copper-fructose interactions have been well documented in rats. Altered copper-fructose metabolism leads to exacerbated experimental metabolic syndrome and NAFLD. A growing body of evidence has demonstrated that copper levels are low in NAFLD patients. Moreover, hepatic and serum copper levels are inversely correlated with the severity of NAFLD. Thus, high fructose consumption and low copper availability are considered two important risk factors in NAFLD. However, the causal effect of copper-fructose interactions as well as the effects of fructose intake on copper status remain to be evaluated in humans. The aim of this review is to summarize the role of copper-fructose interactions in the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome and discuss the potential underlying mechanisms.

The regulatory networks that control stress responses are evolutionarily conserved, and many factors that selectively activate stress responses have been identified. Less well understood are mechanisms that guard against unnecessary induction of cytoprotective factors and that connect stress responses with cellular metabolism to control energy expenditure during stress. The work of Riahi and colleagues represents important progress in this regard because it identifies the histone methyltransferase G9a as a modulator of oxidative stress responses. G9a dampens the expression of antioxidant genes, thus preventing inappropriate energy consumption. Moreover, G9a promotes the well-paced catabolism of storage glycogen and fat during stress. The importance of energy availability during stress is further evidenced by exogenous glucose rescuing the vulnerability of the G9a mutant to oxidative stress. Prior work in multiple model systems has implicated G9a in several other adaptive responses. Therefore, its role in pacing energy consumption and in restraining excessive stress response gene expression under stress may extend to other adaptive responses across species.

In the recent past, DCs have gained significant interest to manipulate them for the treatment of cancer and immune-mediated disorders. This can be achieved by differentiating them into either immunogenic or tolerogenic DCs (TolDCs), by modulating their metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid metabolism, to orchestrate their desired function. For immunogenic DCs, this maturation shifts the metabolic profile to a glycolytic metabolic state and leads to the use of glucose as a carbon source, whereas TolDCs prefer oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and fatty acid oxidation for their energy resource.Understanding the metabolic regulation of DC subsets and functions at large not only will improve our understanding of DC biology and immune regulation, but can also open up opportunities for treating immune-mediated ailments and cancers by tweaking endogenous T-cell responses through DC-based immunotherapies. Here we describe a method to analyze this dichotomous metabolic reprogramming of the DCs for generating reliable and effective DC cell therapy products. We, hereby, report how to measure the OXPHOS and glycolysis level of DCs.

Three subjects received a primed constant intravenous infusion of [6,6-(2)H(2)]glucose for 3 hours followed by oral bolus ingestion of galactose labeled to 2% with [U-(13)C]galactose (0.72 g/kg); the other 3 subjects received a primed constant intravenous infusion of [6,6-(2)H(2)]glucose followed by either a bolus ingestion of fructose alone (0.72 g/kg) (labeled to 2% with [U-(13)C]fructose) or coingestion of fructose (labeled with [U-(13)C]fructose) (0.72 g/kg) and unlabeled glucose (0.72 g/kg). Four hours after ingestion, subjects received 1 mg of glucagon intravenously to stimulate glycogenolysis. When galactose was ingested alone, the area under the curve (AUC) of [(13)C(6)]glucose and [(13)C(3)]glucose was 7.28 +/- 0.39 and 3.52 +/- 0.05 mmol/L per 4 hours, respectively. When [U-(13)C]fructose was ingested with unlabeled fructose or unlabeled fructose plus glucose, no [(13)C(6)]glucose was detected in plasma. The AUC of [(13)C(3)]glucose after fructose and fructose plus glucose ingestion was 20.21 +/- 2.41 and 6.25 +/- 0.34 mmol/L per 4 hours, respectively. Comparing the AUC for the (13)C(3) vs (13)C(6) enrichments, 67% of oral galactose enters the systemic circulation via a direct route and 33% via an indirect route. In contrast, fructose only enters the systemic circulation via the indirect route. Finally, when ingested alone, fructose and galactose contribute little to glycogen synthesis. After the coingestion of fructose and glucose with the resultant insulin response from the glucose, fructose is a significant contributor to glycogen synthesis.

However, few studies have investigated PFAS alternatives and isomers, and even less is known about the association among women conceiving through assisted reproductive technology (ART). The prospective cohort study aimed to explore associations of legacy PFAS, alternatives and isomers with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and glucose homeostasis during pregnancy among 336 women conceiving through ART. Nineteen PFAS, including nine linear legacy PFAS, four short-chain alternatives, four branched isomers, and two emerging PFAS alternatives, were determined in first-trimester maternal serum. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 1-h and 2-h glucose concentrations following the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were measured during the second trimester. After adjusting for confounding variables, nearly half of individual PFAS (10/19) and PFAS mixtures were correlated with increased GDM risk or elevated 2-h glucose levels. Among PFAS congeners, emerging PFAS alternatives, chlorinated perfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acids (Cl-PFESAs), showed a notable association with impaired glucose homeostasis. For example, 6:2 Cl-PFESA exhibited a correlation with GDM (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.02, 1.68) and 2-h glucose concentrations (β = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.08, 0.36), and contributed most to the overall association with 2-h glucose concentrations.

889,889,1439534,"It is possible to point out subjects consuming considerable quantities of fructose and sorbitol, and the intake seems to be increasing both from added and natural sources. Studies of the absorption of fructose in animals are inconsistent, and the mechanisms of fructose uptake seem to vary in accordance with the species. In most species fructose absorption takes place by a specific carrier (facilitated transport), but it may be active in the rat. In vitro studies of human intestine are very scarce; there is no evidence of active intestinal fructose transport in the human intestine. By means of hydrogen breath tests, a very low absorption capacity for fructose given as the free monosaccharide has been found in humans. Fructose given as sucrose or in equimolar combinations with glucose is well absorbed, and only fructose in excess of glucose is malabsorbed. On this basis it is hypothesized that two different uptake mechanisms for fructose are present in the human intestine. One of these may be a disaccharidase-related uptake system. Sorbitol ingestion may aggravate malabsorption of fructose given as the monosaccharide; it is not known whether a specific mechanism is involved. In children and adults with functional bowel distress the absorption capacities for fructose may not differ from those of healthy individuals, but malabsorption of fructose and/or sorbitol may be the cause of or aggravate abdominal symptoms. Fructose polymers (fructans) are also subject to increasing nutritional interest. Fructans are not absorbed in the small intestine but are strongly fermented in the large bowel.

898,898,3242735,"In Ceara State in northeastern Brazil in 1986 infant mortality reached 110-139 per 1000 live births, and 50% of those deaths were due to diarrhea and dehydration. Diarrheal deaths can be prevented by oral rehydration therapy (ORT), which replaces lost fluids and electrolytes with oral rehydration salts (ORS) and water. ORT was known in the 1830s, but only in the 1960s was the importance of sugar, which increases the body's ability to absorb fluid some 25 times, realized. In northeastern Brazil access to ORT has been severely limited by poverty, official incompetence, and bureaucratic restrictions. In 1984 a 2-year research project was initiated in the village of Pacatuba to test the theory that mobilizing and training popular healers in ORT would 1) increase awareness and use of ORS, 2) promote continued feeding during diarrhea, 3) increase breast feeding, and 4) reduce the use of costly and nonindicated drugs. 46 popular healers, including rezadeiras and oradores (prayers), Umbandistas (priests), espiritas (mediums), an herbalist, and a lay doctor, were recruited and trained. Most of these people practiced a mixture of folk medicine and religion and were highly respected in the community. For purposes of survey, Pacatuba was divided into 3 groups, each containing houses at 4 different income levels. The mothers in 204 Group 1 homes were interviewed concerning ORT and diarrhea-related knowledge before intervention, and 226 households in Group 2 were interviewed after intervention. The healers were taught the basic biomedical concept of rehydration and how to mix the ORS -- 7 bottle cap-fulls of sugar and 1 of salt in a liter of unsweetened traditional tea. The healers were also taught how to use the World Health Organization's (WHO) ORS packets (2% glucose, 90 mmol/1 of sodium chloride, 1.5 gm potassium chloride, and 2.9 gm sodium bicarbonate) for cases of moderate to severe dehydration. In addition, the healers were taught the 5 basic health messages: give ORS-tea for diarrhea and dehydration (or any similar folk illness, such as evil eye, fallen fontanelle), continue feeding, encourage breast feeding, eliminate drugs, and ask people to seek the healer quickly at the onset of diarrhea. The healers continued to perform all the popular rites and prayers traditionally associated with curing diarrhea. The healers distributed approximately 7400 liters of ORS-tea in 12 months at a unit cost of 48 cents (US). A post-intervention survey of diarrhea-related knowledge was then carried out among the 226 Group 2 households. Before the intervention 2.9% of the mothers knew about ORS; 71.2% did afterward. All of the healers demonstrated that they knew exactly how to mix the ORS-tea. Knowledge of the WHO packets also increased. The number of mothers who continued feeding their children during diarrhea increased to 92%. Following the introduction of the ORS-tea, purchases of the more costly WHO packets and other commercial medications and antibiotics fell off significantly. The people's belief in folk etiologies remained unchanged, showing that traditional healers can be successfully integrated into an effective health care program. The success rate of the ORT program in Pacatuba, carried out entirely by word of mouth, compares favorably with expensive mass media campaigns other places.

The aim of this study was to examine the protective effects of notoginsenoside R1 (NR1) on the maintenance of podocyte number and foot process architecture via the inhibition of apoptosis, the induction of autophagy and the maintenance pf podocyte biology in target cells. The effects of NR1 on conditionally immortalized human podocytes under high glucose conditions were evaluated by determining the percentage apoptosis, the percentage autophagy and the expression levels of slit diaphragm proteins. Our results revealed that NR1 protected the podocytes against high glucose-induced injury by decreasing apoptosis, increasing autophagy and by promoting cytoskeletal recovery. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway was further investigated in order to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the protective effects of NR1 on podocytes. Our data indicated that treatment with NR increased the phosphorylation levels of PI3K, Akt and mTOR, leading to the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in podocytes.

902,902,26181104,"Reduced de novo lipogenesis in adipose tissue, often observed in obese individuals, is thought to contribute to insulin resistance. Besides trapping excess glucose and providing for triglycerides and energy storage, endogenously synthesized lipids can function as potent signaling molecules. Indeed, several specific lipids and their molecular targets that mediate insulin sensitivity have been recently identified. Here, we report that carbohydrate-response element-binding protein (ChREBP), a transcriptional inducer of glucose use and de novo lipogenesis, controls the activity of the adipogenic master regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ. Expression of constitutive-active ChREBP in precursor cells activated endogenous PPARγ and promoted adipocyte differentiation. Intriguingly, ChREBP-constitutive-active ChREBP expression induced PPARγ activity in a fatty acid synthase-dependent manner and by trans-activating the PPARγ ligand-binding domain. Reducing endogenous ChREBP activity by either small interfering RNA-mediated depletion, exposure to low-glucose concentrations, or expressing a dominant-negative ChREBP impaired differentiation. In adipocytes, ChREBP regulated the expression of PPARγ target genes, in particular those involved in thermogenesis, similar to synthetic PPARγ ligands. In summary, our data suggest that ChREBP controls the generation of endogenous fatty acid species that activate PPARγ. Thus, increasing ChREBP activity in adipose tissue by therapeutic interventions may promote insulin sensitivity through PPARγ.

903,903,15848039,"Plant secondary metabolites are unique sources for pharmaceuticals, food additives, flavors, and other industrial materials. Accumulation of such metabolites often occurs in plants subjected to stresses including various elicitors or signal molecules. Understanding signal transduction paths underlying elicitor-induced production of secondary metabolites is important for optimizing their commercial production. This paper summarizes progress made on several aspects of elicitor signal transduction leading to production of plant secondary metabolites, including: elicitor signal perception by various receptors of plants; avirulence determinants and corresponding plant R proteins; heterotrimeric and small GTP binding proteins; ion fluxes, especially Ca2+ influx, and Ca2+ signaling; medium alkalinization and cytoplasmic acidification; oxidative burst and reactive oxygen species; inositol trisphosphates and cyclic nucleotides (cAMP and cGMP); salicylic acid and nitric oxide; jasmonate, ethylene, and abscisic acid signaling; oxylipin signals such as allene oxide synthase-dependent jasmonate and hydroperoxide lyase-dependent C12 and C6 volatiles; as well as other lipid messengers such as lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidic acid, and diacylglycerol. All these signal components are employed directly or indirectly by elicitors for induction of plant secondary metabolite accumulation. Cross-talk between different signaling pathways is very common in plant defense response, thus the cross-talk amongst these signaling pathways, such as elicitor and jasmonate, jasmonate and ethylene, and each of these with reactive oxygen species, is discussed separately. This review also highlights the integration of multiple signaling pathways into or by transcription factors, as well as the linkage of the above signal components in elicitor signaling network through protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Some perspectives on elicitor signal transduction and plant secondary metabolism at the transcriptome and metabolome levels are also presented.

904,904,29622770,"Neural progenitor cell (NPC) transplantation has been shown to be beneficial in the ischemic brain. However, the low survival rate of transplanted NPCs in an ischemic microenvironment limits their therapeutic effects. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is one of the proinflammatory cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of various injuries. On the other hand, several studies have shown that TNF-α influences the proliferation, survival, and differentiation of NPCs. Our study investigated the effect of TNF-α pretreatment on human NPCs (hNPCs) under ischemia-related conditions in vitro. hNPCs harvested from fetal brain tissue were pretreated with TNF-α before being subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) to mimic ischemia in vitro. TNF-α pretreatment improved the viability and reduced the apoptosis of hNPCs after OGD. At the molecular level, TNF-α markedly increased the level of NF-κB signaling in hNPCs, and an NF-κB pathway inhibitor, BAY11-7082, completely reversed the protective effects of TNF-α on hNPCs. These results suggest that TNF-α improves hNPC survival by activating the NF-κB pathway. In addition, TNF-α significantly enhanced the expression of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 (cIAP2). Use of a lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA targeting cIAP2 mRNA demonstrated that cIAP2 protected against OGD-induced cytotoxicity in hNPCs. Our study of intracellular NF-κB signaling revealed that inhibition of NF-κB activity abolished the TNF-α-mediated upregulation of cIAP2 in hNPCs and blocked TNF-α-induced cytoprotection against OGD. Therefore, this study suggests that TNF-α pretreatment, which protects hNPCs from OGD-induced apoptosis by activating the NF-κB pathway, provides a safe and simple approach to improve the viability of transplanted hNPCs in cerebral ischemia.

Thus, our goal was to test anxiety- and depression-like behaviors after infant peripheral nerve injury and evaluate the effect of environmental enrichment on these models of affective disorders. Open field, elevated plus maze, sucrose preference, and pain behaviors (paw withdrawal threshold, spontaneous guarding score, and cold response to acetone) were measured in rats that received infant spared nerve injury (SNI). Enzyme-linked immune absorbent assay of cytokines was performed to evaluate the inflammatory response in the brain. Then, the ability of intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of a microglia inhibitor, minocycline (MIN), and EE (a free-running wheel, a staircase, a plastic tunnel, a raised platform, and various colored balls) to reverse the infant SNI effects on behaviors and cytokines was examined. Infant nerve injury resulted in adolescent anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. The medial prefrontal cortex, basolateral amygdala, and ventral hippocampus were skewed to a pro-inflammatory profile. ICV injection of MIN reduced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors without affecting pain behaviors. In addition, ICV MIN skewed the brain towards an anti-inflammatory profile. Finally, environmental enrichment improved anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, as well as pain behaviors. EE increased brain IL-10 and decreased IL-1β and TNF-α.

907,907,11475286,"Glucose in the aqueous humor appears to correlate with plasma glucose in humans. It is therefore a potential substrate for noninvasive optical glucose monitoring techniques. We wished to determine the potential for using rabbit aqueous humor as a model to develop a noninvasive method of measuring glucose with Raman spectroscopy. Aqueous humor from 32 rabbit eyes was removed immediately after sacrifice by rapid exsanguination under anesthesia. Raman spectroscopy was performed on the aqueous humor using near infrared (NIR) excitation wavelengths. The Raman spectra from 785 nm and 787.2 nm were subtracted one from the other to eliminate broadband fluorescence. The spectra were then analyzed with linear and nonlinear multivariate analysis and assessed for ability to predict actual aqueous humor glucose concentration. Nine other rabbits were anesthetized with xylazine in order to cause elevation of blood glucose by blocking release of insulin. Blood and aqueous humor glucose were measured at various times after injection of xylazine. Correlation of aqueous humor glucose with simultaneous plasma glucose was assessed. Partial least squares analysis of raw Raman spectra of aqueous humor showed fair correlation with actual glucose concentration (r2 = 0.76). When the fluorescence spectrum was subtracted prior to linear multivariate analysis correlation was good (r2 = 0.90). When back-propagation with an artificial neural network was added to the analysis, correlation was further improved (r2 = 0.98). Aqueous humor glucose concentration exceeded blood glucose concentration at normoglycemic levels. When blood glucose rose above 200 mg/dL, aqueous humor glucose correlated linearly with plasma glucose. Raman spectroscopy can accurately predict glucose concentration in rabbit aqueous humor in vitro. Although rabbit aqueous humor is probably not a good model of human aqueous humor glucose physiology, its reliable correlation with plasma glucose makes it a good model on which to test noninvasive optical sensing techniques.

909,909,9237941,"Quantification of the metabolism of dietary glucose by the splanchnic tissues is incomplete. Whether habitual carbohydrate intake affects splanchnic glucose metabolism is not known. Female mice were offered isoenergetic and isonitrogenous quantities of diets containing high (HCD) or low (LCD) amounts of carbohydrate, 5% of which was [U-13C]-glucose. Four mice from each dietary group were killed after 24, 48 and 120 h. The 13C-isotopomer distribution in blood glucose, lactate and alanine and in hepatic alanine and glycogen was measured by selected ion monitoring mass spectrometry. [U-13C]-Glucose and its products, [U-13C]-lactate and alanine, were in complete isotopic equilibrium in the blood. The tracer:tracee ratio of hepatic [U-13C]-alanine was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than that of circulating alanine. In both groups, the tracer:tracee ratio of circulating [U-13C]-glucose was significantly (P < 0.001) lower than that of the dietary carbohydrate, and the ratio of [13C3]-glucose:[U-13C]-glucose [0.57 (HCD) and 0.78 (LCD); diet effect P < 0.05], a measure of glucose metabolic cycling, was between two- and fivefold higher than published values obtained with intravenous tracer glucose. The tracer:tracee ratio of [U-13C]-glycogen glucose was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that of arterial glucose. We conclude the following: 1) dietary glucose is extensively recycled, via pyruvate, within the liver; 2) this metabolic cycle is maintained in mice consuming low carbohydrate diets; and 3) dietary carbohydrate is channelled to hepatic glycogen.

Intestinal tissue is a pivotal organ for the regulation of glucose metabolism, mainly via glucose absorption into the circulation; however, the significance of the intestinal circadian clock network for glucose metabolism remains largely unclear. We herein utilized a mouse model in which Bmal1, a core clock gene, was deleted in an intestine-specific manner (Bmal1Int-/- mice) and demonstrated a rhythmic expression of Sglt1 with its peak at zeitgeber time (ZT) 10.7 ± 2.8 in control mice, whereas this was lost in Bmal1Int-/- mice. Mechanistically, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed rhythmic binding of CLOCK to the E-box elements in the Sglt1 gene in control mice; however, this was absent in Bmal1Int-/- mice. Accordingly, SGLT1 protein levels were decreased during the dark phase in Bmal1Int-/- mice and this was associated with impaired glucose absorption, leading to a decline in hepatic glycogen levels at ZT4, which was restored by ingestion of high-sucrose water. Additionally, when mice were starved from ZT0, greater expression of the lipolysis-related gene Pnpla2 was observed in adipose tissue of Bmal1Int-/- mice, and this was not noted when glycogen storage was restored by high-sucrose water prior to fasting, suggesting that higher Pnpla2 expression in Bmal1Int-/- mice was likely caused by lower glycogen storage. These results indicate that disruption of the intestinal circadian clock system impairs glucose absorption in the intestine and affects systemic glucose homeostasis.

A human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) senescence model was developed using high palmitic acid and high glucose (PA/HG) concentrations in vitro. Western blotting, immunofluorescence, SA-β-galactosidase staining, cell cycle, reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell migration, and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays were performed to determine the protective role of EOFAZ against vascular endothelial cell senescence in diabetes. Moreover, the PPAR-γ agonist rosiglitazone, inhibitor GW9662, and siRNA were used to verify the underlying mechanism by which EOFAZ combats vascular endothelial cell senescence in diabetes. EOFAZ treatment ameliorated abnormal lipid metabolism, vascular histopathological damage, and vascular endothelial aging in diabetic mice. Proteomics and network pharmacology analysis revealed that the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and drug-disease targets were associated with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) signalling pathway, a key player in vascular endothelial cell senescence. Molecular docking indicated that the small-molecule compounds in EOFAZ had a high affinity for the PPAR-γ protein.

Individuals with CF demonstrate airway and systemic oxidation compared to people without CF. Furthermore, systemic oxidation precipitated by hyperglycemia in non-CF diabetes has been shown to lead to enhanced inflammation. We hypothesized that the presence of both CF and diabetes in an individual would result in hyperglycemia-induced redox imbalance to an oxidative state. This in turn would result in enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Systemic redox balance and pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured before and following a standard oral glucose tolerance test in healthy controls (HC) and in CF individuals with a spectrum of glucose homeostasis (i.e. normal glucose tolerant - NGT, prediabetes or frank CFRD). There were no significant differences between groups in terms of basal or glucose-induced levels of inflammatory markers. However, baseline systemic redox potential was significantly more oxidized in CF subjects with prediabetes and CFRD compared to both CF with NGT and HC. Systemic oxidation was significantly worsened, and to a profound degree, two hours following ingestion of glucose in all CF groups (NGT, prediabetes, and CFRD). The level of redox imbalance at the two hour point was the same in all three CF groups and was not associated with the degree of hyperglycemia. There was a significant correlation between worse systemic oxidation and reduced insulin secretion. This supports a newly identified abnormality of metabolism in CF - glucose induced redox imbalance to the oxidative state.

918,918,37721853,"The facilitative GLUT1 and GLUT3 hexose transporters are expressed abundantly in macrophages, but whether they have distinct functions remains unclear. We confirmed that GLUT1 expression increased after M1 polarization stimuli and found that GLUT3 expression increased after M2 stimulation in macrophages. Conditional deletion of Glut3 (LysM-Cre Glut3fl/fl) impaired M2 polarization of bone marrow-derived macrophages. Alternatively activated macrophages from the skin of patients with atopic dermatitis showed increased GLUT3 expression, and a calcipotriol-induced model of atopic dermatitis was rescued in LysM-Cre Glut3fl/fl mice. M2-like macrophages expressed GLUT3 in human wound tissues as assessed by transcriptomics and costaining, and GLUT3 expression was significantly decreased in nonhealing, compared with healing, diabetic foot ulcers. In an excisional wound healing model, LysM-Cre Glut3fl/fl mice showed significantly impaired M2 macrophage polarization and delayed wound healing. GLUT3 promoted IL-4/STAT6 signaling, independently of its glucose transport activity. Unlike plasma membrane-localized GLUT1, GLUT3 was localized primarily to endosomes and was required for the efficient endocytosis of IL-4Rα subunits. GLUT3 interacted directly with GTP-bound RAS in vitro and in vivo through its intracytoplasmic loop domain, and this interaction was required for efficient STAT6 activation and M2 polarization. PAK activation and macropinocytosis were also impaired without GLUT3, suggesting broader roles for GLUT3 in the regulation of endocytosis. Thus, GLUT3 is required for efficient alternative macrophage polarization and function, through a glucose transport-independent, RAS-mediated role in the regulation of endocytosis and IL-4/STAT6 activation.

Although previous cross-sectional reports reported an association between low circulating concentrations of IGF-1 and glucose dysregulation (GD), its role is still debated. The present retrospective study was designed to assess the circulating IGF-1 levels in β-thalassemia major (β -TM) patients with normal oral glucose tolerance test (NGT-OGTT) and (GD) referred for an endocrine evaluation to explore the potential link between low IGF-1 and GD. Our study included 34 young adult patients with β-TM; 12 patients with NGT after OGTT, 7 with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), 9 with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) plus IGT, and 6 patients with β-TM-related diabetes mellitus (β-TM- DM). Twenty-two β-TM patients with GD or β-TM- DM and 1 patient with NGT had IGF-1 levels below the 2.5th percentile. Correlation of IGF-1 with fasting plasma glucose, HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance) and OGIS (oral glucose insulin sensitivity) was found. Moreover, a negative correlation was documented between ALT and the Insulinogenic Index (IGI) and a positive correlation between serum ferritin and PG 2-h after OGTT. This study reports for the first time an association between low levels of IGF-1 and GD in β-TM patients.

These domains play important roles in signaling, binding, prion formation, and functional phase separation. Azf1p is a prion-forming yeast transcription factor that contains two homorepeat domains, a polyglutamine and a polyasparagine domain. In this work, we report a new phenotype for Azf1p and identify a large set of genes that are regulated by Azf1p during growth in glucose. We show that the polyasparagine (polyN) domain plays a subtle role in transcription but is dispensable for Azf1p localization and prion formation. Genes upregulated upon deletion of the polyN domain are enriched in functions related to carbon metabolism and storage. This domain may therefore be a useful target for engineering yeast strains for fermentation applications and small molecule production. We also report that both the polyasparagine and polyglutamine domains vary in length across strains of S. cerevisiae and propose a model for how this variation may impact protein function.

Experimental animals were pretreated with sorbinil, while comparison rats received the drug vehicle. Rats were made hypernatremic for 96 h by water deprivation and injections of hypertonic saline, while hyponatremia was provoked over 48 h by daily administration of 5% dextrose in water and vasopressin. Sorbinil treatment was continued throughout the hyper- and hyponatremic periods. The severity of hypernatremia and hyponatremia was similar in sorbinil-treated and corresponding vehicle-treated rats. Brain electrolyte content and the size of the cerebral intracellular water compartment were comparable in sorbinil-treated rats vs. controls under hypernatremic and hyponatremic conditions. Sorbinil reduced the cerebral sorbitol content by approximately 50%, irrespective of the serum Na+ concentration. In contrast, sorbinil had no effect on brain myo-inositol content which rose by 114% during chronic hypernatremia (P less than 0.0001). Cerebral levels of myo-inositol did not decline in hyponatremic rats.

As most human lncRNAs are non-conserved, we recently employed a unique humanized liver mouse model to study lncRNAs expressed in human livers. We identified a human hepatocyte-specific lncRNA, hLMR1 (human lncRNA metabolic regulator 1), which is induced by feeding and promotes hepatic cholesterol synthesis. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) found that several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the hLMR1 gene locus are associated with blood lipids and markers of liver damage. These results suggest that dietary and genetic factors may regulate hLMR1 to affect disease progression. In this study, we first screened for nutritional/hormonal factors and found that hLMR1 was robustly induced by insulin/glucose in cultured human hepatocytes, and this induction is dependent on the transcription factor SREBP1. We then tested if GWAS SNPs genetically linked to hLMR1 could regulate hLMR1 expression. We found that DNA sequences flanking rs9653945, a SNP from the last exon of the hLMR1 gene, functions as an enhancer that can be robustly activated by SREBP1c depending on the presence of rs9653945 major allele (G). We further performed CRISPR base editing in human HepG2 cells and found that rs9653945 major (G) to minor (A) allele modification resulted in blunted insulin/glucose-induced expression of hLMR1. Finally, we performed genotyping and gene expression analyses using a published human NAFLD RNA-seq dataset and found that individuals homozygous for rs9653945-G have a higher expression of hLMR1 and risk of NAFLD. Taken together, our data support a model that rs9653945-G predisposes individuals to insulin/glucose-induced hLMR1, contributing to the development of hyperlipidemia and NAFLD.

Since the neuropathology of hypoxia-ischemia also appears to be mediated by release of glutamate/aspartate at the synapse, the valproate-induced reduction of the levels of these neuroexcitatory/neurotoxic amino acids suggested that valproate might increase the tolerance of young mice to anoxia.

However, the energy substrates fueling OXPHOS in osteoclasts remain to be fully defined. Here, we showed that osteoclast differentiation was coupled with increased oxidation of glucose, glutamine, and oleate. Transcriptomic analyses with RNA sequencing revealed marked upregulation of genes participating in OXPHOS and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, during osteoclast differentiation. Increased mitochondrial oxidation of long-chain fatty acids was required for osteoclast differentiation in vitro. However, blocking fatty acid oxidation in vivo, by deletion of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a) in osteoclast progenitors, impaired osteoclast formation only in the female mice. The Cpt1a-deficient females were further protected from osteoclast activation by a high-fat diet. The males, on the contrary, exhibited normal bone resorption despite Cpt1a deletion, regardless of the dietary fat content. Moreover, concurrent deletion of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 and Cpt1a, blocking mitochondrial oxidation of both glucose and fatty acids in the osteoclast lineage, failed to impede bone resorption in the males. The study therefore uncovers a female-specific dependence on mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids and glucose in osteoclasts in vivo.

Here, we report that β-klotho (KLB), a single-pass transmembrane protein known as a co-receptor for fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), fine tunes GSIS via modulation of glycolysis in pancreatic β-cells independent of the actions of FGF21. β-cell-specific deletion of Klb but not Fgf21 deletion causes defective GSIS and glucose intolerance in mice and defective GSIS in islets of type-2 diabetic mice is mitigated by adenovirus-mediated restoration of KLB. Mechanistically, KLB interacts with and stabilizes the cytokine receptor subunit GP130 by blockage of ubiquitin-dependent lysosomal degradation, thereby facilitating interleukin-6-evoked STAT3-HIF1α signaling, which in turn transactivates a cluster of glycolytic genes for adenosine triphosphate production and GSIS. The defective glycolysis and GSIS in Klb-deficient islets are rescued by adenovirus-mediated replenishment of STAT3 or HIF1α. Thus, KLB functions as a key cell-surface regulator of GSIS by coupling the GP130 receptor signaling to glucose catabolism in β-cells and represents a promising therapeutic target for diabetes.

Therefore, we sought to determine whether SGLT2 inhibitors could improve left ventricular (LV) function in these patients. A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases from their inception to July 9, 2021. Randomized clinical trials and cohort studies that reported LV function-related variables were included. Thirteen studies comprising 1437 patients (830 SGLT2 inhibitor-treated and 607 non-SGLT2 inhibitor-treated patients) and representing 7 randomized controlled trials with 640 individuals and 6 cohort studies with 797 individuals were included in this meta-analysis.

However, some neurons - namely, glucose-inhibited (GI) neurons - paradoxically increase their firing activity in low-glucose conditions and decrease that activity in high-glucose conditions. The ionic mechanisms mediating electric responses of GI neurons to glucose fluctuations remain unclear. Here, we showed that currents mediated by the anoctamin 4 (Ano4) channel are only detected in GI neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) and are functionally required for their activation in response to low glucose. Genetic disruption of the Ano4 gene in VMH neurons reduced blood glucose and impaired counterregulatory responses during hypoglycemia in mice. Activation of VMHAno4 neurons increased food intake and blood glucose, while chronic inhibition of VMHAno4 neurons ameliorated hyperglycemia in a type 1 diabetic mouse model. Finally, we showed that VMHAno4 neurons represent a unique orexigenic VMH population and transmit a positive valence, while stimulation of neurons that do not express Ano4 in the VMH (VMHnon-Ano4) suppress feeding and transmit a negative valence. Together, our results indicate that the Ano4 channel and VMHAno4 neurons are potential therapeutic targets for human diseases with abnormal feeding behavior or glucose imbalance.

The structural characterization and functional identification of a second GH140 family enzyme, termed MmApi, discovered through mangrove soil metagenomic approach, are described. Among the various substrates tested, MmApi exhibited activity on an apiose-containing oligosaccharide derived from the pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan-II. While the crystallographic model of MmApi was similar to the endo-apiosidase from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, differences in the shape of the binding sites indicated that MmApi could cleave apioses within oligosaccharides of different compositions.

Development of new antiresorptive therapies calls for a holistic understanding of osteoclast differentiation and function. Although much has been learned about the molecular regulation of osteoclast biology, little is known about the metabolic requirement and bioenergetics during osteoclastogenesis. Here, we report that glucose metabolism through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is the predominant bioenergetic pathway to support osteoclast differentiation. Meanwhile, increased lactate production from glucose, known as aerobic glycolysis when oxygen is abundant, is also critical for osteoclastogenesis. Genetic deletion of Glut1 in osteoclast progenitors reduces aerobic glycolysis without compromising OXPHOS, but nonetheless diminishes osteoclast differentiation in vitro. Glut1 deficiency in the progenitors leads to osteopetrosis due to fewer osteoclasts specifically in the female mice. Thus, Glut1-mediated glucose metabolism through both lactate production and OXPHOS is necessary for normal osteoclastogenesis.

Here, we recapitulate stress due to jet lag or work-life imbalances by flattening glucocorticoid oscillations in mice. Within 3 days, mice achieve a metabolic state with persistently high insulin, but surprisingly low glucose and fatty acids in the bloodstream, that precedes a more than 2-fold increase in brown and white adipose tissue mass within 3 weeks. Transcriptomic and Cd36-knockout mouse analyses show that hyperinsulinemia-mediated de novo fatty acid synthesis and Cd36-mediated fatty acid uptake drive fat mass increases. Intriguingly, this mechanism by which glucocorticoid flattening causes acute hyperinsulinemia and adipocyte hypertrophy is unexpectedly beneficial in preventing high levels of circulating fatty acids and glucose for weeks, thus serving as a protective response to preserve metabolic health during chronic stress.

Cell loss occurs with disease progression. Putative injury mediators include metabolic stress (low glucose/nutrient), pro-inflammatory mediators (interferon γ and tumour necrosis factor α), and excitotoxins (glutamate). Our objective was to compare the impact of these disease relevant mediators on the injury responses of human mature oligodendrocytes. In the current study, we determined the effects of these mediators on process extension and survival of human brain derived mature oligodendrocytes in vitro and used bulk RNA sequencing to identify distinct effector mechanisms that underlie the responses. All mediators induced significant process retraction of the oligodendrocytes in dissociated cell culture. Only metabolic stress (low glucose/nutrient) conditions resulted in delayed (4-6 days) non-apoptotic cell death. Metabolic effects were associated with induction of the integrated stress response, which can be protective or contribute to cell injury dependent on its level and duration of activation. Addition of Sephin1, an agonist of the integrated stress response induced process retraction under control conditions and further enhanced retraction under metabolic stress conditions. The antagonist ISRIB restored process outgrowth under stress conditions, and if added to already stressed cells, reduced delayed cell death and prolonged the period in which recovery could occur. Inflammatory cytokine functional effects were associated with activation of multiple signalling pathways (including Jak/Stat-1) that regulate process outgrowth, without integrated stress response induction. Glutamate application produced limited transcriptional changes suggesting a contribution of effects directly on cell processes.

The cellular communication between astrocytes and neurons via exosomes might affect neurological function after ischemic stroke, which plays a vital role in the therapy of ischemic stroke. The present study focused on the effects of exosomes released from astrocytes induced by the glucose and oxygen deprivation model with berberine pretreatment (BBR-exos) treatment for ischemic stroke and its regulatory mechanism. Oxygen-glucose-deprivation/Reoxygenation (OGD/R)-treated primary cells were used to mimic cerebral ischemia/reperfusion conditions in vitro. With the treatment of BBR-exos and exosomes released from primary astrocytes induced by the glucose and oxygen deprivation model (OGD/R-exos), the cell viability was detected. C57BL/6J mice were used to establish middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model. The anti-neuroinflammation effects of BBR-exos and OGD/R-exos were evaluated. Subsequently, the key miRNA in BBR-exos was identified by exosomal miRNA sequencing and cell validation. miR-182-5p mimic and inhibitors were provided to verify the effects in inflammation. Finally, the binding sites between miR-182-5p and Rac1 were predicted online and verified by using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. BBR-exos and OGD/R-exos both improved the decreased activity of OGD/R-induced neurons, and decreased the expression of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α (all P ＜ 0.05), which reduced neuronal injury and inhibited neuroinflammation in Vitro. And BBR-exos showed better effects (P ＜ 0.05). The same effect has been verified in vivo experiments: BBR-exos and OGD/R-exos both reduced cerebral ischemic injury and inhibited neuroinflammation in MCAO/R mice (all P ＜ 0.05). Likewise, BBR-exos showed better effects (P ＜ 0.05). The exosomal miRNA sequencing results showed that miR-182-5p was highly expressed in BBR-exos and inhibited neuroinflammation by targeting Rac1 (P ＜ 0.05). BBR-exos can carry miR-182-5p to injured neurons and inhibit the expression of Rac1, which could inhibit neuroinflammation and improved brain injury after ischemic stroke.

Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) is a new iron formulation (150 kDa) that can be given at high doses (20 mg/kg, up to 1000 mg) over a short period (≤ 15 min), without test dosing. This paper reviews studies dealing with the efficacy and safety of FCM for treating anemia in relatively large numbers of patients, in addition to analyzing the differences regarding clinical conditions, iron doses, follow-up, comparators, and hematologic response targets. Overall, there is substantial evidence that FCM is effective in treating iron-deficiency anemia in many acute and chronic conditions, with a favorable benefit-risk profile. The efficacy of FCM for correcting anemia is similar to that of iron sucrose, and it is superior to oral iron or placebo in replenishing iron stores. Despite higher acquisition costs (as fewer administrations are needed), treatment with FCM (as well as with iron isomaltoside 1000 or ferumoxytol) seems to be cost-effective when compared to iron sucrose, and is more convenient for patients.

957,957,36757814,"Major depressive disorder is a common and devastating psychiatric disease, and the prevalence and burden are substantially increasing worldwide. Multiple studies of depression patients have implicated glucose metabolic dysfunction in the pathophysiology of depression. However, the molecular mechanisms by which glucose and related metabolic pathways modulate depressive-like behaviors are largely uncharacterized. Uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) is a glucose metabolite with pivotal functions as a donor molecule for O-GlcNAcylation. O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), a key enzyme in protein O-GlcNAcylation, catalyzes protein posttranslational modification by O-GlcNAc and acts as a stress sensor. Here, we show that Ogt mRNA was increased in depression patients and that astroglial OGT expression was specifically upregulated in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of susceptible mice after chronic social-defeat stress. The selective deletion of astrocytic OGT resulted in antidepressant-like effects, and moreover, astrocytic OGT in the mPFC bidirectionally regulated vulnerability to social stress. Furthermore, OGT modulated glutamatergic synaptic transmission through O-GlcNAcylation of glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) in astrocytes. OGT astrocyte-specific knockout preserved the neuronal morphology atrophy and Ca2+ activity deficits caused by chronic stress and resulted in antidepressant effects. Our study reveals that astrocytic OGT in the mPFC regulates depressive-like behaviors through the O-GlcNAcylation of GLT-1 and could be a potential target for antidepressants.

960,960,28223503,"Diabetes is associated with impaired glucose metabolism in the presence of excess insulin. Glucose and fatty acids provide reducing equivalents to mitochondria to generate energy, and studies have reported mitochondrial dysfunction in type II diabetes patients. If mitochondrial dysfunction can cause diabetes, then we hypothesized that increased mitochondrial metabolism should render animals resistant to diabetes. This was confirmed in mice in which the heart-muscle-brain adenine nucleotide translocator isoform 1 (ANT1) was inactivated. ANT1-deficient animals are insulin-hypersensitive, glucose-tolerant, and resistant to high fat diet (HFD)-induced toxicity. In ANT1-deficient skeletal muscle, mitochondrial gene expression is induced in association with the hyperproliferation of mitochondria. The ANT1-deficient muscle mitochondria produce excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) and are partially uncoupled. Hence, the muscle respiration under nonphosphorylating conditions is increased. Muscle transcriptome analysis revealed the induction of mitochondrial biogenesis, down-regulation of diabetes-related genes, and increased expression of the genes encoding the myokines FGF21 and GDF15. However, FGF21 was not elevated in serum, and FGF21 and UCP1 mRNAs were not induced in liver or brown adipose tissue (BAT). Hence, increased oxidation of dietary-reducing equivalents by elevated muscle mitochondrial respiration appears to be the mechanism by which ANT1-deficient mice prevent diabetes, demonstrating that the rate of mitochondrial oxidation of calories is important in the etiology of metabolic disease.

Initially 20 g of glutamine was given orally as a flavored solution which resulted in doubling of blood ammonia concentration and this was associated with a deterioration in performance of the choice reaction time. The effect could have been due to a direct effect of glutamine rather than the ammonia generated so in subsequent experiments a glutamine free mixture of amino acids resembling the composition of haemoglobin was used (gastrointestinal bleeding is a known precipitant of hepatic encephalopathy). In Child grade B and C patients, 2-3 h after 54 g, slowing of the EEG was observed. The cerebral effects of induced hyperammonaemia were studied with diffusion weighted imaging and MR spectroscopy after giving 54 g of a mixture of threonine, serine and glycine when apparent diffusion coefficient increased. Also the change in ammonia levels correlated with the change in cerebral glutamine levels (r = 0.78, p = 0.002) suggesting intra cerebral formation of glutamine from ammonia and this may have accounted for the fall in cerebral myoinositol concentrations observed. Finally a colonic source for ammonia was confirmed by administering urea using colon coated capsules when ammonia concentrations slowly increased from 5 h after administration and rapidly after 10 h. In two patients the hyperammonaemia was ameliorated by pre treatment with Rifaximin 1200 mg per day for 1 week.

Androgen receptor (Ar) mediates the effect of androgen, and this study examines how neuronal Ar in the central nervous system mediates metabolism under normal and increased androgen conditions in female mice. The neuron-specific ARKO mouse (SynARKO) was created from female (Ar fl/wt; synapsin promoter driven Cre) and male (Ar fl/y) mice. A glucose tolerance test revealed impaired glucose tolerance that was partially alleviated in the SynARKO-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) mice compared with Con-DHT mice after 4 months of DHT treatment. Heat production and food intake was higher in Con-DHT mice than in Con-veh mice; these effects were not altered between SynARKO-veh and SynARKO-DHT mice, indicating that excess androgens may partially alter calorie intake and energy expenditure in females via the neuronal Ar. The pAkt/Akt activity was higher in the hypothalamus in Con-DHT mice than in Con-veh mice, and this effect was attenuated in SynARKO-DHT mice. Western blot studies show that markers of inflammation and microglia activation, such as NF-kB p-65 and IBA1, increased in the hypothalamus of Con-DHT mice compared with Con-veh. These studies suggest that neuronal Ar mediates the metabolic impacts of androgen excess in females.

968,968,33057854,"The objective of this review is to provide up-to-date and comprehensive discussion of tissue-specific fructose metabolism in the context of diabetes, dyslipidemia, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Increased intake of dietary fructose is a risk factor for a myriad of metabolic complications. Tissue-specific fructose metabolism has not been well delineated in terms of its contribution to detrimental health effects associated with fructose intake. Since inhibitors targeting fructose metabolism are being developed for the management of NAFLD and diabetes, it is essential to recognize how inability of one tissue to metabolize fructose may affect metabolism in the other tissues. The primary sites of fructose metabolism are the liver, intestine, and kidney. Skeletal muscle and adipose tissue can also metabolize a large portion of fructose load, especially in the setting of ketohexokinase deficiency, the rate-limiting enzyme of fructose metabolism. Fructose can also be sensed by the pancreas and the brain, where it can influence essential functions involved in energy homeostasis. Lastly, fructose is metabolized by the testes, red blood cells, and lens of the eye where it may contribute to infertility, advanced glycation end products, and cataracts, respectively. An increase in sugar intake, particularly fructose, has been associated with the development of obesity and its complications. Inhibition of fructose utilization in tissues primary responsible for its metabolism alters consumption in other tissues, which have not been traditionally regarded as important depots of fructose metabolism.

It was recently reported (Roberts et al. (1987) J. Med. Chem. 30, 1891-1896) that this thiazolidine, D-glucose-L-cysteine (DGC), offered no significant protection against the hepatic injury caused by 5 mmol/kg of acetaminophen in mice, suggesting that the cysteine present as DGC is poorly bioavailable in vivo. In the present study, fasted male ICR mice given 1.6 or 2.6 mmol/kg of acetaminophen sustained hepatic injury, estimated by elevations in plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities. Administration of 2.5 mmol/kg of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) 1 h before acetaminophen given i.p. prevented the rise in plasma ALT activities, apparently through support of glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Administration of 2.5 mmol/kg of DGC prior to acetaminophen resulted in slightly lower mean plasma ALT activities than were observed in animals given saline before acetaminophen, but the effect was not statistically significant. When DGC was given 1 h before p.o. administration of 1.6 or 2.6 mmol/kg of acetaminophen, the protective effects of DGC were statistically significant (P < 0.01, 0.025, respectively), although NAC afforded significantly greater protection than did DGC at the higher dose of acetaminophen. Given 4 h before acetaminophen, DGC attenuated acetaminophen-induced increases in plasma ALT activities significantly, whereas NAC was without effect. These results indicate that the cysteine in DGC is at least partially bioavailable in vivo and, further, that DGC may function as a slow release formulation of cysteine.

The increase in NO results in S-nitrosylation of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), thus inhibiting insulin and Aβ catabolism as well as hyperactivating mitochondrial fission machinery. Consequent elevation in Aβ levels and compromise in mitochondrial bioenergetics result in dysfunctional synaptic plasticity and synapse loss in cortical and hippocampal neurons.

An investigation of the role of miR-124-3p, in the ischaemia damage repair or protection in the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) model, was the purpose of this research. The expression of miRNA and mRNA in the MCAO model was predicted using bioinformatics analysis. The OGD/R neuronal model was developed. We examined the influence of a number of compounds on the OGD/R model in vitro using gain- and loss-of-function approaches. For starters, miR-124-3p and Nrep level in the MCAO model were found to be lower in the model predicted by bioinformatics than in the sham-operated group.

Evidence indicates that VAs have multiple targets, with anesthetic and non-anesthetic effects mediated by neuroreceptors, ion channels, and the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Here, we characterize an unexpected metabolic effect of VAs in neonatal mice. Neonatal blood β-hydroxybutarate (β-HB) is rapidly depleted by VAs at concentrations well below those necessary for anesthesia. β-HB in adults, including animals in dietary ketosis, is unaffected. Depletion of β-HB is mediated by citrate accumulation, malonyl-CoA production by acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and inhibition of fatty acid oxidation.

979,979,27195679,"Diabetes is a chronic disease that results from the body's inability to properly control circulating blood glucose levels. The loss of glucose homoeostasis can arise from a loss of β-cell mass because of immune-cell-mediated attack, as in type 1 diabetes, and/or from dysfunction of individual β-cells (in conjunction with target organ insulin resistance), as in type 2 diabetes. A better understanding of the transcriptional pathways regulating islet-cell survival is of great importance for the development of therapeutic strategies that target β-cells for diabetes. To this end, we previously identified the transcription factor Myt3 as a pro-survival factor in islets following acute suppression of Myt3 in vitro. To determine the effects of Myt3 suppression on islet-cell survival in vivo, we used an adenovirus to express an shRNA targeting Myt3 in syngeneic optimal and marginal mass islet transplants, and demonstrate that suppression of Myt3 impairs the function of marginal mass grafts. Analysis of grafts 5 weeks post-transplant revealed that grafts transduced with the shMyt3 adenovirus contained ~20% the number of transduced cells as grafts transduced with a control adenovirus. In fact, increased apoptosis and significant cell loss in the shMyt3-transduced grafts was evident after only 5 days, suggesting that Myt3 suppression sensitizes islet cells to stresses present in the early post-transplant period. Specifically, we find that Myt3 suppression sensitizes islet cells to high glucose-induced cell death via upregulation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family member Bim. Taken together these data suggest that Myt3 may be an important link between glucotoxic and immune signalling pathways.

The null mice exhibit impaired β3-adrenoreceptor-dependent thermogenesis and are prone to diet-induced obesity and defective glucose disposal.

Whilst exercise stimulated activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an important energy sensor, has been highlighted for its potential to promote insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, the underlying mechanisms for this remain largely unknown. Here we found that AMPK positively regulates the activation of Rab5, a small GTPase which is involved in regulating Glut4 translocation, in both myoblasts and skeletal muscles. We further verified that TBC1D17, identified as a potential interacting partner of Rab5 in our recent study, is a novel GTPase activating protein (GAP) of Rab5. TBC1D17-Rab5 axis regulates transport of Glut1, Glut4, and transferrin receptor. TBC1D17 interacts with Rab5 or AMPK via its TBC domain or N-terminal 1-306 region (N-Ter), respectively. Moreover, AMPK phosphorylates the Ser 168 residue of TBC1D17 which matches the predicted AMPK consensus motif. N-Ter of TBC1D17 acts as an inhibitory region by directly interacting with the TBC domain. Ser168 phosphorylation promotes intra-molecular interaction and therefore enhances the auto-inhibition of TBC1D17.

Neonatal female pigs were administered TPN (n = 12) or fed enterally with a liquid enteral milk-replacer formula (EN, n = 12) for 14 d. After transitioning TPN pigs to enteral feeding of liquid formula (days 15-26), both groups were adapted to a solid high-fat diet (30% of the total diet) and sucrose (20% of the total diet) diet (days 27-33), which was fed until the end of the study (140 d). Body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at 14, 45, and 140 d. Serum biochemistry and glucose-insulin values (after a fasting intravenous glucose tolerance test) were obtained at 140 d. Liver and muscle were analyzed for insulin receptor signaling and triglycerides. Body weight was similar, but percent fat was higher, whereas percent lean and bone mineral density were lower in TPN than in EN pigs (P < 0.01) at 45 d of age but not at 140 d. At 140 d, there were no differences in serum markers of liver injury or lipidemia. Intravenous glucose tolerance test at 140 d showed a lower (P < 0.05) AUC for both glucose and insulin in TPN than in EN pigs, but the ratio of AUCs of insulin and glucose was not different between groups. Administration of TPN during the neonatal period increased adipose deposition that transiently persisted in early adolescence when challenged with a high-fat diet but was not sustained or manifested as glucose intolerance.

985,985,24530811,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a typical manifestation of very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD), the most common long-chain β-oxidation defects in humans; however in some patients cardiac function is fully compensated. Cardiomyopathy may also be reversed by supplementation of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT). We here characterize cardiac function of VLCAD-deficient (VLCAD(-/-)) mice over one year. Furthermore, we investigate the long-term effect of a continuous MCT diet on the cardiac phenotype. We assessed cardiac morphology and function in VLCAD(-/-) mice by in vivo MRI. Cardiac energetics were measured by (31)P-MRS and myocardial glucose uptake was quantified by positron-emission-tomography (PET). Metabolic adaptations were identified by the expression of genes regulating glucose and lipid metabolism using real-time-PCR. VLCAD(-/-) mice showed a progressive decrease in heart function over 12 months accompanied by a reduced phosphocreatine-to-ATP-ratio indicative of chronic energy deficiency. Long-term MCT supplementation aggravated the cardiac phenotype into dilated cardiomyopathy with features similar to diabetic heart disease. Cardiac energy production and function in mice with a β-oxidation defect cannot be maintained with age. Compensatory mechanisms are insufficient to preserve the cardiac energy state over time. However, energy deficiency by impaired β-oxidation and long-term MCT induce cardiomyopathy by different mechanisms. Cardiac MRI and MRS may be excellent tools to assess minor changes in cardiac function and energetics in patients with β-oxidation defects for preventive therapy.

There is limited study regarding periventricular leukomalacia treatment. A neonatal rat brain slice perfusion model was used for reproducing the condition of cardiopulmonary bypass, and oxygen glucose deprivation simulated circulatory arrest. Seven-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 7 groups: (1) control group with 36°C; (2) 60 minutes of oxygen glucose deprivation group on 15°C, 25°C, 36°C, respectively; and (3) 60 minutes of oxygen glucose deprivation group on 15°C, 25°C, 36°C, plus minocycline (10 μmol/L), respectively. Immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and inflammatory mediators were compared after the perfusion procedures in the different groups. This neonatal rat brain slice perfusion with oxygen glucose deprivation model could replicate the pathophysiologic process and injury after cardiopulmonary bypass and hypothermic circulatory arrest. With the increase of oxygen glucose deprivation perfusion temperature, we found that both microglia activation and preoligodendrocyte loss increased. The application of minocycline can significantly inhibit microglial activation and preoligodendrocyte cells loss in the normothermic (36°C) and moderate hypothermia (25°C) oxygen glucose deprivation groups (P < .05), with accompanying significant decreasing microglial inflammatory productions; however, no significant improvement was found in the deep hypothermia (15°C) group.

We investigated the role of iodothyronine deiodinase 2 (DIO2) in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. Retinas from streptozotocin-induced diabetic and nondiabetic mice were evaluated by RNA sequencing, RT-PCR, and immunostaining. Media and cell lysates from mouse retinal microvascular endothelial cells and retinal astrocytes exposed to physiologic (5 mM) and high glucose (25 mM) containing media were assessed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to measure tetraiodothyronine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3) concentrations and by Western blot analysis to determine the relationship of T4/T3 to oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators. Cell death was determined by Trypan Blue exclusion assay. At 12 weeks of diabetes duration, retinas from diabetic mice compared with nondiabetic mice demonstrated a significant decrease in Dio2 transcripts and Dio2 gene and protein (P < 0.05) expression. When cultured in the presence of high glucose, both mouse retinal astrocytes and microvascular endothelial cells demonstrated a significant reduction of DIO2 protein compared with cells cultured in physiologic glucose. High glucose inhibited generation of T3, leading to a significantly increased T4/T3 (P < 0.0079). Supplementation of cells with T3, but not T4, prevented the high glucose-induced rise in endothelial nitric oxide synthase, intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1, and endothelial cell death (P < 0.0079). Decreased intraretinal T3 owing to diabetes-induced loss of DIO2 may lead to dysfunction and death of cells in the retina, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of early diabetic retinopathy.

We tested whether forced reversal of adult cardiomyocytes back to a fetal glycolytic phenotype would restore proliferative capacity. We deleted Uqcrfs1 (mitochondrial Rieske iron-sulfur protein, RISP) in hearts of adult mice. As RISP protein decreased, heart mitochondrial function declined, and glucose utilization increased. Simultaneously, the hearts underwent hyperplastic remodeling during which cardiomyocyte number doubled without cellular hypertrophy. Cellular energy supply was preserved, AMPK activation was absent, and mTOR activation was evident. In ischemic hearts with RISP deletion, new cardiomyocytes migrated into the infarcted region, suggesting the potential for therapeutic cardiac regeneration. RNA sequencing revealed upregulation of genes associated with cardiac development and proliferation. Metabolomic analysis revealed a decrease in α-ketoglutarate (required for TET-mediated demethylation) and an increase in S-adenosylmethionine (required for methyltransferase activity). Analysis revealed an increase in methylated CpGs near gene transcriptional start sites. Genes that were both differentially expressed and differentially methylated were linked to upregulated cardiac developmental pathways. We conclude that decreased mitochondrial function and increased glucose utilization can restore mitotic capacity in adult cardiomyocytes, resulting in the generation of new heart cells, potentially through the modification of substrates that regulate epigenetic modification of genes required for proliferation.

Viruses modulate HIF-1α to support viral replication and the survival of infected cells, but it is unclear if this transcription factor also plays an important role in regulating antiviral immune responses. In this study, we found that short and long dsRNA differentially engage TLR3, inducing distinct levels of proinflammatory cytokine production (TNF-α and IL-6) in bone marrow-derived macrophages from C57BL/6 mice. These responses are associated with differential accumulation of HIF-1α, which augments NF-κB activation. Unlike TLR4 responses, increased HIF-1α following TLR3 engagement is not associated with significant alterations in glycolytic activity and was more pronounced in low glucose conditions. We also show that the mechanisms supporting HIF-1α stabilization may differ following stimulation with short versus long dsRNA and that pyruvate kinase M2 and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species play a central role in these processes. Collectively, this work suggests that HIF-1α may fine-tune proinflammatory cytokine production during early antiviral immune responses, particularly when there is limited glucose availability or under other conditions of stress. Our findings also suggest we may be able to regulate the magnitude of proinflammatory cytokine production during antiviral responses by targeting proteins or molecules that contribute to HIF-1α stabilization.

Vitamin D receptors (VDRs) are found within multiple tissues, including the brain. Given the importance of the brain in controlling both glucose levels and body weight, we hypothesized that activation of central VDR links vitamin D to the regulation of glucose and energy homeostasis. Indeed, we found that small doses of active vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3) (calcitriol), into the third ventricle of the brain improved glucose tolerance and markedly increased hepatic insulin sensitivity, an effect that is dependent upon VDR within the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. In addition, chronic central administration of 1,25D3 dramatically decreased body weight by lowering food intake in obese rodents. Our data indicate that 1,25D3-mediated changes in food intake occur through action within the arcuate nucleus. We found that VDR colocalized with and activated key appetite-regulating neurons in the arcuate, namely proopiomelanocortin neurons. Together, these findings define a novel pathway for vitamin D regulation of metabolism with unique and divergent roles for central nervous system VDR signaling.

However, whether estradiol-17β (E2) reprograms cellular metabolism to support proliferation of human primary endometrial stromal cells (hESCs) and the molecular basis of this reprogramming are not well understood. Our objectives were to study whether E2 induces reprogramming of glucose metabolism in hESCs and to investigate the potential roles of PKM2 in E2-induced metabolic reprogramming and proliferation of these cells. The oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate were assessed by a Seahorse XF24 analyzer. PKM2 expression was assessed by real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting. E2 induces a Warburg-like glucose metabolism in hESCs by inducing the expression of PKM. E2 also enhanced PKM splicing into the PKM2 isoform by upregulating the c-Myc-hnRNP axis. Furthermore, E2 induces PKM2 oxidation, phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation. In addition to its glycolytic function, PKM2 physically interacted with estrogen receptor-α (ERα) and functioned as an ERα coactivator. Small-molecule PKM2 activators ameliorated ERα transcriptional activity and abrogated the E2-induced hESC proliferation. We show for the first time that E2-induced hESC proliferation is associated with a shift in glucose metabolism toward aerobic glycolysis, and the molecular basis for this metabolic shift is linked to the effects of E2 on PKM2.

After adjustments for gestational weeks at sampling, pre-pregnancy BMI, and age, women with GDM had 3.7% (95% CI 0.1%-7.3%) lower SHBG levels, 3.1% (95% CI 0.1%-6.2%) higher T levels, and 4.6% (95% CI 1.9%-7.3%) higher FAI levels than controls.

Lower SHBG levels were associated especially with early-onset GDM, higher fasting glucose and insulin treatment, whereas androgen excess was associated with higher post-prandial glucose values. Thus, a low SHBG level may reflect the degree of existing insulin resistance, while androgen excess might impair post-prandial insulin secretion.

However, some cancer cell lines do not require GLN for survival and the basis for this discrepancy is not well understood. GLN is a precursor for antioxidants such as glutathione (GSH) and NADPH, and GLN deprivation is therefore predicted to deplete antioxidants and increase reactive oxygen species (ROS). Using diverse human cancer cell lines we show that this occurs only in cells that rely on GLN for survival. Thus, the preference for GLN as a dominant antioxidant source defines GLN addiction. We show that despite increased glucose uptake, GLN addicted cells do not metabolize glucose via the TCA cycle when GLN is depleted, as revealed by (13)C-glucose labeling. In contrast, GLN independent cells can compensate by diverting glucose-derived pyruvate into the TCA cycle. GLN addicted cells exhibit reduced PDH activity, increased PDK1 expression, and PDK inhibition partially rescues GLN starvation-induced ROS and cell death. Finally, we show that combining GLN starvation with pro-oxidants selectively kills GLN addicted cells.

Maternal obesity adversely influences adult offspring energy balance and propensity for obesity, which is ameliorated by maternal PDX treatment with associated changes in gut microbiota composition and skeletal muscle mitochondrial function.

999,999,36811561,"Evidence-based dietary reference intakes for nutrients in healthy individuals were last set in 2005 by the Institute of Medicine. For the first time, these recommendations included a guideline for carbohydrate intake during pregnancy. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) was set at ≥175 g/d or 45%-65% of total energy intake. In the decades since, carbohydrate intake has been declining in some populations, and many pregnant women consume carbohydrates below the RDA. The RDA was developed to account for both maternal brain and fetal brain glucose requirements. However, the placenta also requires glucose as its dominant energy substrate and is as dependent on maternal glucose as the brain. Prompted by the availability of evidence demonstrating the rate and quantity of human placental glucose consumption, we calculated a potential new estimated average requirement (EAR) for carbohydrate intake to account for placental glucose consumption. Further, by narrative review, we have re-examined the original RDA by applying contemporary measurements of adult brain and whole-body fetal glucose consumption. We also propose, using physiologic rationale, that placental glucose consumption be included in pregnancy nutrition considerations. Calculated from human in vivo placental glucose consumption data, we suggest that 36 g/d represents an EAR for adequate glucose to support placental metabolism without supplementation by other fuels. A potential new EAR of 171 g/d accounts for maternal (100 g) and fetal (35 g) brain, and now placental glucose utilization (36 g), and with extrapolation to meet the needs of nearly all healthy pregnant women, would result in a modified RDA of 220 g/d. Lower and upper safety thresholds for carbohydrate intake remain to be determined, of importance as preexisting and gestational diabetes continue to rise globally, and nutrition therapy remains the cornerstone of treatment.
