Part of the difficulty arises because of inadequate knowledge about the actual consumption of populations, as well as individuals within a population. Data on the sucrose content of foods are lacking. This review presents information published in the 1970s on these topics as well as current research and thinking about possible relationships of sucrose consumption to dental caries, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and other disease conditions. Current attitudes toward recommendations concerning sugar consumption in the U.S. Dietary Goals are examined, as are data on the use of sugar as a fortification vehicle.

2,2,16363346,"Topiramate (TPM) has peculiar side effects such as speech difficulties, weight loss, oligohidrosis and hyperthermia. We present the frequency and severity of hypohidrosis in our patients under TPM treatment. One hundred and two patients treated with TPM were evaluated retrospectively. Five (8 months-15 years of age) of them experienced symptomatic hypohidrosis manifested with prolonged or intermittent fever. Pilocarpine iontophoresis sweat test had been performed on the five patients before they were managed, and no sweat had been collected in 4/5 cases. Of the 102 patients, 42 who started TPM treatment when the study was established were evaluated prospectively regarding oligohidrosis. First, they were questioned about whether hypohidrosis occurred after TPM. Of 42, 11 patients complained of hypohidrosis. A sweat test was then performed on these 11 patients. Sweat could not be obtained in 5/11, and increased chloride concentration was found in 4/11. However, sweat could be obtained in the patients who had no complaint of hypohidrosis. Pediatricians should be aware of this side effect of TPM to prevent nonrelevant and cumbersome investigations in patients with prolonged or intermittent fever onset during TPM treatment. Our findings suggest that 5% of patients would experience hyperthermia during TPM treatment. Hypohidrosis without hyperthermia would be more frequent. If it is possible to collect sweat in patients who get fever during TPM treatment, it would be highly probable that the fever is not due to hypohidrosis. Increased chloride concentration alone does not seem to be significant for the hyperthermia risk.

The present study investigated fundamental serum components of PCF, including total proteins (TP), albumin (Alb), urea nitrogen (UN), creatinine (Cr), uric acid (UA), glucose (Glu), sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) in PCF with regard to the postmortem and survival periods, and cause of death in serial medicolegal autopsy cases (n=288) with intact pericardial and cardiac structures within 48h postmortem. The amount of PCF (mostly 5-25ml) showed no survival or postmortem time dependence, or difference among the causes of death. For all cases, there were moderate postmortem decreases of Na and Cl, and increases of K and Mg, which were insufficient for application to estimate the time since death; however, characteristic findings with regard to the cause of death were detected in cases of hours-long survival, especially in 'functional causes of death': higher Alb, UN, Cr, UA, K and Mg, and lower Na, Cl and Ca in intoxication; lower TP, Alb, Cr, K and Mg, and higher Na and Cl in hypothermia (cold exposure); higher Alb, UN, Cr, UA and Mg, and lower Glu and Ca in hyperthermia (heatstroke).

5,5,29222961,"As dietary components are delivered directly to the periportal zone of the liver lobule, there is the potential for greater injury in this zone (zone 1) compared to the perivenous zone (zone 3). We investigated the associations between dietary fructose consumption and uric acid concentrations and differential zonal injury in periportal and perivenous zones. A total of 271 children's histological images were scored in 5 periportal and 5 perivenous zones for steatosis, ballooning, inflammation and fibrosis severity. Dietary fructose consumption (g/d) was assessed and uric acid measured in serum. Logistic regression was undertaken to test associations between both high fructose consumption and hyperuricaemia, and histological disease in periportal and perivenous zones. Children with a mean age of 12.5 years were included in the study. Inflammation (mean ± SD) was increased in the periportal vs perivenous zones (0.78 ± 0.43 vs 0.41 ± 0.48, P = .041). There were non-significant trends towards greater steatosis, ballooning and fibrosis in the periportal zone. In the fully adjusted models, high fructose intake was associated with disease in both zones. Example for periportal and perivenous zones, respectively, steatosis 1.56 (1.12, 2.49) and 1.21 (1.09, 2.73); inflammation 4.29 (2.31, 5.88) and 3.69 (2.14, 4.56); and fibrosis 2.72 (1.43, 3.76) and 1.96 (1.24, 2.37). Hyperuricaemia (uric acid ≥5.9 mg/dL) was associated with inflammation in the periportal zone 1.71 (1.17, 2.35); and was associated with steatosis and fibrosis in both zones; for example, for periportal and perivenous zones, respectively, steatosis 2.98 (1.65, 3.23) and 1.14 (1.05, 1.99); and fibrosis, 2.65 (1.35, 2.99) and 1.31 (1.13, 2.17).

6,6,17016954,"Traditionally, the main strategies used to control micronutrient deficiencies have been food diversification, consumption of medicinal supplements, and food fortification. In Tanzania, we conducted efficacy trials using a dietary supplement as a fourth approach. These were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy trials conducted separately first in children and later in pregnant women. The dietary supplement was a powder used to prepare an orange-flavored beverage. In the school trial, children consumed 25 g per school day attended. In the pregnancy trial, women consumed the contents of two 25-g sachets per day with meals. This dietary supplement, unlike most medicinal supplements, provided 11 micronutrients, including iron and vitamin A, in physiologic amounts. In both trials we compared changes in subjects consuming either the fortified or the nonfortified supplement. Measures of iron and vitamin A status were similar in the groups at the baseline examination, but significantly different at follow-up, always in favor of the fortified groups. Children receiving the fortified supplement had significantly improved anthropometric measures when compared with controls. At four weeks postpartum, the breast milk of a supplemented group of women had significantly higher mean retinol content than did the milk of mothers consuming the nonfortified supplement. The advantages of using a fortified dietary supplement, compared with other approaches, include its ability to control several micronutrient deficiencies simultaneously; the use of physiologic amounts of nutrients, rather than megadoses that require medical supervision; and the likelihood of better compliance than with the use of pills because subjects liked the beverage used in these trials.

8,8,30807589,"Children with medically complicated severe acute malnutrition (SAM) have high risk of inpatient mortality. Diarrhea, carbohydrate malabsorption, and refeeding syndrome may contribute to early mortality and delayed recovery. We tested the hypothesis that a lactose-free, low-carbohydrate F75 milk would serve to limit these risks, thereby reducing the number of days in the stabilization phase. In a multicenter double-blind trial, hospitalized severely malnourished children were randomized to receive standard formula (F75) or isocaloric modified F75 (mF75) without lactose and with reduced carbohydrate. The primary endpoint was time to stabilization, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), with intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality, diarrhea, and biochemical features of malabsorption and refeeding syndrome. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02246296). Four hundred eighteen and 425 severely malnourished children were randomized to F75 and mF75, respectively, with 516 (61%) enrolled in Kenya and 327 (39%) in Malawi. Children with a median age of 16 months were enrolled between 4 December 2014 and 24 December 2015. One hundred ninety-four (46%) children assigned to F75 and 188 (44%) to mF75 had diarrhea at admission. Median time to stabilization was 3 days (IQR 2-5 days), which was similar between randomized groups (0.23 [95% CI -0.13 to 0.60], P = 0.59). There was no evidence of effect modification by diarrhea at admission, age, edema, or HIV status. Thirty-six and 39 children died before stabilization in the F75 and in mF75 arm, respectively (P = 0.84). Cumulative days with diarrhea (P = 0.27), enteral (P = 0.42) or intravenous fluids (P = 0.19), other serious adverse events before stabilization, and serum and stool biochemistry at day 3 did not differ between groups. The main limitation was that the primary outcome of clinical stabilization was based on WHO guidelines, comprising clinical evidence of recovery from acute illness as well as metabolic stabilization evidenced by recovery of appetite. Empirically treating hospitalized severely malnourished children during the stabilization phase with lactose-free, reduced-carbohydrate milk formula did not improve clinical outcomes. The biochemical analyses suggest that the lactose-free formulae may still exceed a carbohydrate load threshold for intestinal absorption, which may limit their usefulness in the context of complicated SAM.

It was found that chewing of areca nut/quid or pan masala (a commercial preparation of areca nuts, lime, catechu and undisclosed colouring, flavouring and sweetening agents) was directly related to OSF. Also, pan masala was chewed by a comparatively younger age group and was associated with OSF changes earlier than areca nut/quid chewing. However, chewing or smoking tobacco with various other chewing habits did not increase the risk of developing OSF.

10,10,36771442,"The connection between increased dietary salt intake and arterial hypertension has been recognized for a long time, even in children. This study aimed to investigate salt consumption in normotensive and hypertensive children and evaluate their dietary habits.

Subjects' body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, body composition and arterial blood pressure were measured, and their daily salt intake was calculated from 24-h urine samples. Using the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), the data on the average daily total energy and food intakes were collected and analyzed using a suitable program. Estimated daily salt intake was significantly higher in hypertensive compared to normotensive children, and this is positively associated with blood pressure and body mass index (BMI). Hypertensive children had significantly higher BMIs, which also positively correlated with blood pressure. Consistently, resting metabolic rate (kcal) is higher in hypertensive children compared to normotensive, and this is also associated with blood pressure. Reported energy intake is also enlarged in hypertensive compared to normotensive children and for both groups, levels are significantly higher than the recommended values. Our study results confirm the relationship between daily salt consumption, blood pressure and body weight. Sodium consumption related to blood pressure and body weight among children.

11,11,24605698,"Background. Since fortification of sugar with vitamin A was mandated in 1998, Zambia's fortification program has not changed, while the country remains plagued by high rates ofmicronutrient deficiencies. Objective. To provide evidence-based fortification options with the hope of reinvigorating the Zambian fortification program. Methods. Zambia's 2006 Living Conditions Monitoring Survey is used to estimate the apparent intakes of vitamin A, iron, and zinc, as well as the apparent consumption levels and coverage of four fortification vehicles. Fourteen alternativefoodfortification portfolios are modeled, and their costs, impacts, average cost-effectiveness, and incremental cost-effectiveness are calculated using three alternative impact measures. Results. Alternative impact measures result in different rank orderings of the portfolios. The most cost-effective portfolio is vegetable oil, which has a cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) saved ranging from 12% to 25% of that of sugar, depending on the impact measure used. The public health impact of fortified vegetable oil, however, is relatively modest. Additional criteria beyond cost-effectiveness are introduced and used to rank order the portfolios. The size of the public health impact, the total cost, and the incremental cost-effectiveness of phasing in multiple vehicle portfolios over time are analyzed. Conclusions. Assessing fortification portfolios by measuring changes in the prevalence of inadequate intakes underestimates impact. A more sensitive measure, which also takes into account change in the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) gap, is provided by a dose-response-based approach to estimating the number ofDALYs saved. There exist highly cost-effective fortification intervention portfolios with substantial public health impacts and variable price tags that could help improve Zambians' nutrition status.

A retrospective review of case notes of children with medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency undergoing anesthesia between 1997 and 2014. Fourteen patients underwent 21 episodes of anesthesia. In 20 episodes, the patient received a glucose-containing fluid during their perioperative fast, of which eight received fluid containing 10% dextrose throughout the entire perioperative period. No episodes of hypoglycemia or decompensation occurred, but perioperative hyperglycemia occurred in five episodes. A propofol bolus was administered at induction in 16 episodes and volatile agents were administered for maintenance of anesthesia in all episodes without any observed complications. In one episode, delayed offset of atracurium was reported. Perioperative metabolic decompensation and hypoglycemia appear to be uncommon in children who are well and receive glucose supplementation. Hyperglycemia may occur as a consequence of surgery and glucose supplementation. Propofol boluses and volatile anesthetic agents were used without any apparent complications. Prolonged action of atracurium was reported in one case, suggesting that nondepolarizing muscle relaxants may have delayed offset in this patient group. We do not recommend any particular approach to anesthesia but would advise administering glucose supplementation according to current guidelines, frequent monitoring of blood glucose perioperatively, and monitoring of neuromuscular blockade.

We have conducted a biochemical study on sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) cases in an attempt to establish the characteristic biochemical values to diagnose these deaths. This was a hospital based case-control study done at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi for one year. Twenty SUDEP cases and 20 age- and sex-matched controls were included in the study. Femoral blood, cerebrospinal fluid, vitreous humor, and pericardial fluid were biochemically analyzed for sodium, potassium, calcium, glucose, N-acetyl- cysteine activated creatine kinase (CK-NAC) and isoenzyme CK-MB. Serum sodium, CK-MB and CK-NAC level was found significantly increased and potassium level was found decreased in SUDEP cases in comparison to non-epileptic deaths. Likewise, in CSF, sodium and CK-NAC was found increased and potassium level was found decreased in SUDEP cases. In vitreous humor, sodium and CK-MB level was found increased and potassium level was found decreased in SUDEP cases in comparison to non-epileptic deaths. In pericardial fluid, sodium, CK-NAC and CK-MB level was found increased and potassium level was found decreased in SUDEP cases in comparison to non-epileptic deaths.

17,17,19110538,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Raised blood pressure (BP), cholesterol and smoking, are the major risk factors. Among these, raised BP is the most important cause, accounting for 62% of strokes and 49% of coronary heart disease. Importantly, the risk is throughout the range of BP, starting at systolic 115 mm Hg. There is strong evidence that our current consumption of salt is the major factor increasing BP and thereby CVD. Furthermore, a high salt diet may have direct harmful effects independent of its effect on BP, for example, increasing the risk of stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy and renal disease. Increasing evidence also suggests that salt intake is related to obesity through soft drink consumption, associated with renal stones and osteoporosis and is probably a major cause of stomach cancer. In most developed countries, a reduction in salt intake can be achieved by a gradual and sustained reduction in the amount of salt added to food by the food industry. In other countries where most of the salt consumed comes from salt added during cooking or from sauces, a public health campaign is needed to encourage consumers to use less salt. Several countries have already reduced salt intake, for example, Japan (1960-1970), Finland (1975 onwards) and now the United Kingdom. The challenge is to spread this out to all other countries. A modest reduction in population salt intake worldwide will result in a major improvement in public health.

However, few studies have examined appetite and food intake (FI) regulation during development of puberty in children and adolescents. Therefore, the objective was to measure the effect of pubertal status on FI and subjective appetite after pre-meal glucose and whey protein drinks in 9- to 14-year-old boys and girls. In a within-subject, randomized, repeated-measures design, children (21 pre-early pubertal, 15 mid-late pubertal) received equally sweetened drinks containing Sucralose (control), glucose, or whey protein (0.75 g/kg body weight) in 250 mL of water 2 h after a standardized breakfast on 6 separate mornings. Ad libitum FI was measured either 30 or 60 min later and appetite was measured over time. In pre-early and mid-late pubertal boys and girls there was no effect of sex on total FI (kcal). Glucose and whey protein drinks reduced calorie intake similarly at 30 min. But at 60 min, whey protein reduced FI (p < 0.001) compared with control and glucose in pre-early pubertal children, but not in mid-late pubertal children. However, sex was a factor (p = 0.041) when FI was expressed per kilogram body weight. Pubertal status did not affect FI/kilogram body weight in boys, but it was 32% lower in mid-late pubertal girls than at pre-early puberty (p = 0.010).

The research and selection of articles was also supported by the long-term authors' experience in the use of OGTT for the diagnosis of GD in children and adolescents. The complexity of diagnosing GD presupposes that clinicians have specific knowledge and experience to perform rigorous assessment of glucose metabolism. It is worth mentioning that during OGTT, subjects with glucose levels  close to the cut-off values proposed  by WHO (World Health Organization)/ADA (American Diabetes Association) require careful evaluation in order to avoid misclassification and unnecessary interventions.

Routine investigations were done for all patients in addition to blood levels of lactate, free fatty acids (FFA), and insulin. All patients were compared according to outcome as survivors and nonsurvivors and according to glucose level as normoglycemic and hyperglycemic groups. There were 62 scorpion sting cases; their mean age was 8.6 ± 3.2 years. Patients aged more than 6 years (74.2%), and males (66.1%) were more affected than others. As regards severity, 25.8% were suffering organ dysfunction, 40.3% suffered systemic manifestations without organ dysfunction, and (33.9%) with only local manifestations. Serum glucose and FFA were significantly higher in nonsurvivors compared with survivors. Shock, convulsion, coma, heart failure, and pulmonary edema were significantly more common in hyperglycemic than normoglycemic group.

We probed the underlying biology of bitter sensing and the efficacy of two known bitter blockers in children and adults. A racially diverse group of 154 children (3-10 years old) and their mothers (N = 118) evaluated the effectiveness of two bitter blockers, sodium gluconate (NaG) and monosodium glutamate (MSG), for five food-grade bitter compounds (quinine, denatonium benzoate, caffeine, propylthiouracil (PROP), urea) using a forced-choice method of paired comparisons. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01407939). The blockers reduced bitterness in 7 of 10 bitter-blocker combinations for adults but only 3 of 10 for children, suggesting that efficacy depends on age and is also specific to each bitter-blocker combination. Only the bitterness of urea was reduced by both blockers in both age groups, whereas the bitterness of PROP was not reduced by either blocker in either age group regardless of TAS2R38 genotype. Children liked the salty taste of the blocker NaG more than did adults, but both groups liked the savory taste of MSG equally. Bitter blocking was less effective in children, and the efficacy of blocking was both age and compound specific. This knowledge will pave the way for evidence-based strategies to help develop better-tasting medicines and highlights the conclusion that adult panelists and genotyping alone may not always be appropriate in evaluating the taste of a drug geared for children.

Schools were randomly chosen in each local government area and children aged 8-12 years in each school were determined.

The method known as the Sandell-Kolthoff reaction was adopted, in which the iodide in the urine samples catalyses the reduction of ceric ammonium sulphate (yellow colour) to the cerous form (colourless) in the presence of arsenious acid. The degree of reduction in colour intensity of the yellow ceric ammonium sulphate is proportional to the iodine content in the urine sample. : The results from this study show that the median urinary iodine excretion for this sampled population in Nigeria, drawn mostly from IDD-endemic areas, is 14.65 microgram dl-1 with a mean value of 13.39 microgram dl-1. : This finding would suggest that Nigeria, in general terms, has achieved the goal of universal salt iodisation and should now focus its attention on constant monitoring in order to sustain this iodisation level.

This is especially true for functional disorders causing death (e.g. arrhythmias) or cases where death occurs in an initial stage of disease with still lacking morphological findings (e.g. myocarditis). Molecular pathological techniques, which were initially of great importance for identification, today contribute also to the determination of the cause and manner of death, especially in cases, where classical methods do not reveal a clear anatomical cause of death. This will be addressed on the basis of several case groups, especially cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Using immunohistochemical methods with qualification and quantification of interstitial leucocytes, PCR and Rt-PCR methods for identifying virus genome within the myocardium, it is possible to identify in about 25% of SIDS cases a myocarditis as cause of death. However, proposed limit values for the diagnosis of myocarditis have to be seen with caution since they lack any statistical power. The value of immunohistochemical and molecular pathological methods to identify the cause of death will also be addressed in cases of sudden death of young adults.

The abnormality in permeability ratio principally reflects a reduced urinary recovery of mannitol following oral administration.

We tested for associations between mutations in genes encoding reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases, neutrophil function, and phenotypes of CD in pediatric patients. We performed whole-exome sequence analysis to identify mutations in genes encoding NADPH oxidases (such as CYBA, CYBB, NCF1, NCF2, NCF4, RAC1, and RAC2) using DNA from 543 pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. Blood samples were collected from an additional 129 pediatric patients with CD and 26 children without IBD (controls); we performed assays for neutrophil activation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and bacteria uptake and killing. Whole-exome sequence analysis was performed using DNA from 46 of the children with CD to examine associations with NADPH gene mutations; RNA sequence analyses were performed using blood cells from 46 children with CD to test for variations in neutrophil gene expression associated with ROS production. We identified 26 missense mutations in CYBA, CYBB, NCF1, NCF2, and NCF4. Patients with CD who carried mutations in these genes were 3-fold more likely to have perianal disease (P = .0008) and stricturing complications (P = .002) than children with CD without these mutations. Among patients with CD with none of these mutations, 9% had undergone abdominal surgery; among patients with mutations in these NADPH oxidase genes, 31% had undergone abdominal surgery (P = .0004). A higher proportion of neutrophils from children with CD had low ROS production (47%) than from controls (15%) among the 129 patients tested for ROS (P = .002). Minor alleles of the NADPH genes were detected in 7% of children with CD whose neutrophils produced normal levels of ROS vs 38% of children whose neutrophils produced low levels of ROS (P = .009). Neutrophils that produced low levels of ROS had specific alterations in genes that regulate glucose metabolism and antimicrobial responses. We identified missense mutations in genes that encode NADPH oxidases in children with CD; these were associated with a more aggressive disease course and reduced ROS production by neutrophils from the patients.

Inadequate cerebral glucose supply, due to recurrent episodes of severe hypoglycemia during the neonatal period or infancy, when the brain is still developing, lead to serious long-term neurological impairments, ranging from mild neurocognitive dysfunction to severe mental retardation, epilepsy, microcephaly or even hemiparesis or aphasia. Moreover, in the most common form of severe recurrent hypoglycemia of infancy due to hyperinsulinism, not only abnormalities in neurocognitive function, but also the later development of diabetes mellitus are observed. Furthermore, recurrent hypoglycemia, supervening as a side-effect of intensified insulin treatment in young diabetic children, may also induce mild neurocognitive dysfunction and, specifically, memory deficits that predispose these children to new hypoglycemic episodes and hypoglycemia unawareness. In conclusion, prompt and meticulous management of hypoglycemia and its prevention during the neonatal period, infancy and childhood constitute the main goal of physicians taking care of these patients in order to ascertain a long-standing quality of life devoid of long-term sequelae.

Design/Setting/Subjects UIC assessed among schoolchildren in nine consecutive years; 240 schoolchildren aged 8-10 years selected by systematic random sampling each year in the West Azerbaijan Province.

To investigate this, we performed automated quantitative histomorphometry and molecular analyses on 256 standardized peritoneal and 172 omental specimens from 56 children with normal renal function, 90 children with end-stage kidney disease at time of catheter insertion, and 82 children undergoing peritoneal dialysis using dialysates with low-glucose degradation products. Follow-up biopsies were obtained from 24 children after a median peritoneal dialysis of 13 months. Prior to dialysis, mild parietal peritoneal inflammation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and vasculopathy were present. After up to six and 12 months of peritoneal dialysis, blood microvessel density was 110 and 93% higher, endothelial surface area per peritoneal volume 137 and 95% greater, and submesothelial thickness 23 and 58% greater, respectively. Subsequent peritoneal changes were less pronounced. Mesothelial cell coverage was lower and vasculopathy advanced, whereas lymphatic vessel density was unchanged. Morphological changes were accompanied by early fibroblast activation, leukocyte and macrophage infiltration, diffuse podoplanin presence, epithelial mesenchymal transdifferentiation, and by increased proangiogenic and profibrotic cytokine abundance. These transformative changes were confirmed by intraindividual comparisons. Peritoneal microvascular density correlated with peritoneal small-molecular transport function by uni- and multivariate analysis. Thus, in children on peritoneal dialysis neutral pH dialysates containing low-glucose degradation products induce early peritoneal inflammation, fibroblast activation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and marked angiogenesis, which determines the PD membrane transport function.

In this study, we examined the potential medium- and long-term implications for health and health inequalities among children and adolescents in England. We conducted a controlled interrupted time series analysis to measure the effects of the SDIL on the amount of sugar per household per week from soft drinks purchased, 19 months post implementation and by index of multiple deprivation (IMD) quintile in England. We modelled the effect of observed sugar reduction on body mass index (BMI), dental caries, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in children and adolescents (0 to 17 years) by IMD quintile over the first 10 years following announcement (March 2016) and implementation (April 2018) of the SDIL. Using a lifetable model, we simulated the potential long-term impact of these changes on life expectancy for the current birth cohort and, using regression models with results from the IMD-specific lifetable models, we calculated the impact of the SDIL on the slope index of inequality (SII) in life expectancy. The SDIL was found to have reduced sugar from purchased drinks in England by 15 g/household/week (95% confidence interval: -10.3 to -19.7). The model predicts these reductions in sugar will lead to 3,600 (95% uncertainty interval: 946 to 6,330) fewer dental caries and 64,100 (54,400 to 73,400) fewer children and adolescents classified as overweight or obese, in the first 10 years after implementation. The changes in sugar purchasing and predicted impacts on health are largest for children and adolescents in the most deprived areas (Q1: 11,000 QALYs [8,370 to 14,100] and Q2: 7,760 QALYs [5,730 to 9,970]), while children and adolescents in less deprived areas will likely experience much smaller simulated effects (Q3: -1,830 QALYs [-3,260 to -501], Q4: 652 QALYs [-336 to 1,680], Q5: 1,860 QALYs [929 to 2,890]). If the simulated effects of the SDIL are sustained over the life course, it is predicted there will be a small but significant reduction in slope index of inequality: 0.76% (95% uncertainty interval: -0.9 to -0.62) for females and 0.94% (-1.1 to -0.76) for males. We predict that the SDIL will lead to medium-term reductions in dental caries and overweight/obesity, and long-term improvements in life expectancy, with the greatest benefits projected for children and adolescents from more deprived areas.

But all variants have one thing in common: humour. It can be used to hide the seriousness of life or, in this case, everyday scientific life for a brief moment. Moreover, serious social or ethical questions are also met. The GPP, a group of German, Austrian and Swiss Pediatric Pulmonologists (GPP) is a scientific society with regular annual meetings. Unsystematic observations and preliminary data suggest that beer consumption increased by some of the participants during this event. Recently, electronic nose (eNose) devices have been developed as a technology for disease screening using exhaled-breath analysis. Here we addressed the issue, if the eNose can be used to differentiate between real beer and fake beer. In this single-centre experimental study, 12 different ""real beer"" types and one ""fake beer"" were analyzed with regard to their emittance of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with the eNose as an electronic VOC-sensing technology. Every single beer type can be identified by a characteristic VOC-smell print using the eNose. Distinct clusters exist for bottom- and top-fermented ales. Intriguingly, ""Sylter Hopfen"", which is marketed as a ""champagne-beer"" and tested as representative of a ""fake beer"", can be clearly differentiated from all other genuine beer types. Our study provides the first objective data of beer flavor.

We performed a cross-sectional study, involving South London school children across 3 age tiers: young children (5- to 6-year olds), intermediate-aged children (8- to 9-year olds), and adolescents (13- to 17-year olds). Dietary salt intake was measured by 24-hour urinary sodium excretion and compared with newly derived maximum salt intake recommendations. In addition, dietary sources of salt were assessed using a 24-hour photographic food diary. Valid urine collections were provided by 340 children (162 girls, 178 boys). The mean salt intakes were 3.75 g/d (95% confidence interval, 3.49-4.01), 4.72 g/d (4.33-5.11), and 7.55 g/d (6.88-8.22) for the 5- to 6-year olds, 8- to 9-year olds, and 13- to 17-year olds, respectively. Sixty-six percent of the 5- to 6-year olds, 73% of the 8- to 9-year olds, and 73% of 13- to 17-year olds had salt intake above their maximum daily intake recommendations. The major sources of dietary salt intake were cereal and cereal-based products (36%, which included bread 15%), meat products (19%), and milk and milk products (11%). This study demonstrates that salt intake in children in South London is high, with most of the salt coming from processed foods. Much further effort is required to reduce the salt content of manufactured foods.

Superficial injury generally needs only observation; deeper injury that violates the retropharyngeal space may produce dissecting emphysema into the neck and mediastinum followed by prevertebral soft tissue infections and mediastinitis. Injury involving the parapharyngeal space might damage vital cervical vessels. Life-threatening complications may result unless treatment is adequate. Three children who sustained oropharyngeal blast injury are presented. The direct cause was the blast effect of a new, spoiled, orange-flavor beverage just released on the market. The bottle cap of the soft drink and its effervescent liquid ""exploded"" into their mouths while they were trying to open the bottle with their teeth. Obviously, the failure to observe due precautions, as frequently happens among children, contributed to the occurrence of the accidents.

55,55,19949663,"This is a long-term, open label, observational study aimed to broaden our clinical experiences in managing infants and toddlers with epilepsy. The long-term retention rate and side effects of topiramate (TPM) in them were evaluated and compared with carbamazepine (CBZ). A total of 146 children were involved in the study (TPM=41, CBZ=105). The retention rates at 24 , 36, and 48 months were 46.3%, 34.1%, 26.8% for TPM and 36.2%, 23.8%, 13.3% for CBZ, respectively. At 6 months after starting antiepileptic drugs (AED), the seizure freedom or clinical efficacy (seizure reduction rate more than 50 percent) were 73.2% for TPM and 62.9% for CBZ. The major side effects led to discontinuation included psychomotor slowing, poor oral intake from TPM and sleepiness and skin rash from CBZ. TPM was discontinued due to side effects in one case (2.4%) and lack of efficacy in five cases (12.2%), whereas CBZ was discontinued due to lack of efficacy (22.9%) and side effects (6.7%). As compared with CBZ, TPM showed the same long-term retention rate in children under the age of 2 yr, and no serious side effects. It is therefore concluded that TPM can be considered as a major AED for treating children with epilepsy under the age of 2 yr.

56,56,22698380,"Epileptic spasms (ES) beyond infancy are a highly refractory type of seizures that require the development of an effective treatment. We therefore studied the efficacy and safety of topiramate (TPM), which is a drug that is indicated to be effective for intractable childhood epilepsy, for ES. Out of 58 children with ES, we enrolled 33 patients treated with TPM at ≤ 12 years of age. The administration of TPM was limited to cases of epilepsies that were resistant to any other potent treatment. We retrospectively investigated the efficacy of TPM for seizures and changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) findings. The median age at the start of TPM treatment was 5 years, 8 months. All patients had ES and 28 also had tonic seizures. As for the efficacy of TPM for all seizures, five patients became seizure-free and two had a ≥ 50% reduction in seizures. Seizure aggravation was observed in six patients. Of 29 patients whose EEG findings were compared before and during TPM treatment, nine showed EEG improvement with reduced epileptic discharges. Adverse effects were observed in 13 patients and included somnolence, anorexia, and irritability. In general, TPM was well tolerated. TPM can be effective at suppressing very intractable ES in a proportion of patients who do not respond to any other treatment. The efficacy of TPM may be predictable based on EEG changes observed early in the course of treatment. TPM is promising for the treatment of extremely intractable childhood epilepsy and it has largely tolerable adverse effects.

59,59,27540260,"Patient I is a 15 year old female with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency prescribed L-arginine 1.5 g three times daily and sodium benzoate 4.2 g three times daily. By taking her medication and controlling her diet she is able to lead a normal life and does well at school. However she struggles with the palatability of her medication and has not been able to transition to solid dosage forms. She has therefore been stabilised on an unlicensed sodium benzoate liquid and has L-arginine capsules which she takes by opening and dispersing the contents in water. This creates problems for the patient because the volume of sodium benzoate liquid that she needs is very large. This means it has been difficult to come to collect supplies from our pharmacy due to the volume that needs to be carried and transported in one go, and also makes going away on holiday difficult. In addition, the liquid version is more expensive than other options so being able to convert to tablets would be a cost saving measure. Previous attempts to encourage her to take tablets and alternative options such as licensed sodium phenylbutyrate granules have failed. A recommendation was therefore made by the pharmacist to try using Pill Glide swallowing spray as an aid to help her learn to swallow sodium benzoate tablets, in conjunction with nurse-led teaching. Pill Glide is a flavoured spray that helps patients swallow tablets and capsules more easily. It comes in a number of flavours that patients can choose from and can be used for as long as it is beneficial. Patient I found the spray useful in helping her to swallow sodium benzoate tablets and swallow her L-arginine capsules whole and has now successfully transitioned from using sodium benzoate liquid. This has benefitted the patient by reducing the need collect and transport large volumes of liquid, and by helping her to transition to adulthood. Importantly it has also enabled a significant cost saving, with a saving of £367/month by switching her from liquid sodium benzoate to sodium benzoate tablets and Pill Glide. Pill Glide is a useful potential option to help patients who struggle to take solid dosage forms. Liquid medicines are usually much more expensive than tablets and capsules, and therefore helping children with chronic conditions to transition to taking tablets and capsules could be an important cost-saving measure. In addition it could improve compliance in taking medicines where there is no liquid form available or where patients find liquid forms unpalatable. The option of Pill Glide has now been rolled out to other specialties such as renal and respiratory patients where there may also be cost savings and patient benefits for those who find transitioning to solid dosage forms difficult.

Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans failed to show evidence of leptomeningeal angioma in all four children. Three of the children had a history of seizures. Detailed neuropsychologic testing of three children revealed a similar presentation, characterized by developmental disturbance, particularly involving delayed onset of language, and early-emerging social atypicality. Positron emission tomography scanning of cerebral glucose metabolism revealed hypometabolism in the bilateral medial temporal regions, anterior cingulate gyrus, frontal cortex, right temporal cortex, and cerebellum. The pattern of glucose hypometabolism differed from that of 12 children with infantile autism (age 2.7-7.9 years) who had mild left medial temporal but more severe right temporal cortical hypometabolism and showed a reversal of normal frontotemporal asymmetry of glucose metabolism.

61,61,17440007,"Most medicines are available only as solid, adult-strength dosage forms from which oral extemporaneous liquids are often prepared for children. There are few comprehensive reference lists for the preparation of pediatric extemporaneous formulations. Some pediatric reformulations are made by diluting the suspending vehicle, and a shelf life of up to 3 months can be used without documented microbial stability. Although most commercially available ready-to-use vehicles are supplied as preserved formulations, it is still common practice in many European dispensaries to prepare and dilute these vehicles as required for specific prescriptions. To determine what influence dilution of vehicles has on the preservation efficiency of extemporaneous formulations. Suspending vehicles were made by diluting methylcellulose 1% and simple syrup, BP (British Pharmacopoeia) in ratios of 1:1 and 1:4. The efficacy of antimicrobial preservation was tested according to the 2007 standards required by the BP. Dilution in ratios greater than 1:1 failed the BP 2007 criteria. Such dilution represents a potential biohazard, especially to premature, newborn, or immunocompromised children, exposing them not only to possible organoleptic changes of the preparation, but also to ingestion of either dangerous numbers of microorganisms or medicines that may have undergone biotransformation, rendering them inactive or toxic. Significant concerns have been raised regarding the quality of extemporaneous preparations. We call for further research in this neglected area to address issues of antimicrobial preservation, including revision of existing quality assurance monographs. Moreover, these monographs should take into account testing that simulates multiple dosing from a single storage container during the intended in-use shelf life of multidose extemporaneous preparations.

62,62,28027215,"This position paper considers different aspects of complementary feeding (CF), focussing on healthy term infants in Europe. After reviewing current knowledge and practices, we have formulated these recommendations: Timing: Exclusive or full breast-feeding should be promoted for at least 4 months (17 weeks, beginning of the 5th month of life) and exclusive or predominant breast-feeding for approximately 6 months (26 weeks, beginning of the 7th month) is a desirable goal. Complementary foods (solids and liquids other than breast milk or infant formula) should not be introduced before 4 months but should not be delayed beyond 6 months. Infants should be offered foods with a variety of flavours and textures including bitter tasting green vegetables. Continued breast-feeding is recommended alongside CF. Whole cows' milk should not be used as the main drink before 12 months of age. Allergenic foods may be introduced when CF is commenced any time after 4 months. Infants at high risk of peanut allergy (those with severe eczema, egg allergy, or both) should have peanut introduced between 4 and 11 months, following evaluation by an appropriately trained specialist. Gluten may be introduced between 4 and 12 months, but consumption of large quantities should be avoided during the first weeks after gluten introduction and later during infancy. All infants should receive iron-rich CF including meat products and/or iron-fortified foods. No sugar or salt should be added to CF and fruit juices or sugar-sweetened beverages should be avoided. Vegan diets should only be used under appropriate medical or dietetic supervision and parents should understand the serious consequences of failing to follow advice regarding supplementation of the diet. Parents should be encouraged to respond to their infant's hunger and satiety queues and to avoid feeding to comfort or as a reward.

This cohort study was based on data from the Healthy Start primary intervention study, the Danish Medical Birth registry and the Danish Health Visitor's Child Health Database. Infant feeding was registered by health nurses while home-visiting the mother and child up to four times within the first year. Information on eating behaviour and diet intake at age 2-6 years was obtained by parents. Crude and adjusted logistic and general linear regression models were used to investigate associations.

In the crude analysis only, exclusively breastfed until age 6-10 months was associated with a higher daily intake of vegetables (p = 0.04).

Twelve trained, heat-acclimatized girls (age = 10.6 +/- 0.2 years) performed three 3-h sessions, each consisting of four 20-min cycling bouts at 60% VO2max, alternating with 25-min rest. One of three beverages was assigned: unflavored water (W), flavored water (FW) or flavored water plus 6% carbohydrate and 18 mmol/l NaCl (CNa). Drinking was ad libitum. Total intake was similar among conditions (W = 953.3 +/- 107.8 ; FW = 1026.5 +/- 138.1; CNa = 906.4 +/- 107.5 g). A mild hypohydration occurred during the three conditions (W = -1.12%; FW = -0.95%; CNa = -0.74% BW, P > 0.05).

This was a randomised, triple-blind, controlled, clinical non-inferiority trial comparing oat-RUTF to s-RUTF in rural Sierra Leone. Children aged 6-59 months with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) were randomised to oat-RUTF or s-RUTF. s-RUTF was composed of milk powder, sugar, peanut paste and vegetable oil, with a hydrogenated vegetable oil additive. Oat-RUTF contained oats and no hydrogenated vegetable oil additives. The primary outcome was graduation, an increase in anthropometric measurements such that the child was not acutely malnourished. Secondary outcomes were rates of growth, time to graduation and presence of adverse events. Intention to treat analyses was used. Of the 1406 children were enrolled, graduation was attained in 404/721 (56%) children receiving oat-RUTF and 311/685 (45%) receiving s-RUTF (difference 10.6%, 95% CI 5.4% to 15.8%).

83,83,25663362,"Iodine (I) deficiency has been known for more than a century and is known to cause cretinism at the extreme end of the spectrum but also, importantly, impaired development and neurocognition in areas of mild deficiency. The WHO has indicated that median urinary iodine of 100-199 μg/l in a population is regarded as indicative of an adequate iodine intake. The understanding of the spectrum of iodine deficiency disorders led to the formation of The International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders which has promulgated the use of household iodized salt and the use of such salt in food processing and manufacture. Iodine deficiency is particularly important in pregnancy as the fetus relies on maternal thyroxine (T4) exclusively during the first 14 weeks and also throughout gestation. As this hormone is critical to brain and nervous system maturation, low maternal T4 results in low child intelligence quotient. The recommendation for I intake in pregnancy is 250 μg/day to prevent fetal and child brain function impairment. During the past 25 years, the number of countries with I deficiency has reduced to 32; these still include many European developed countries. Sustainability of adequate iodine status must be achieved by continuous monitoring and where this has not been performed I deficiency has often recurred. More randomized controlled trials of iodine supplementation in pregnancy are required in mild iodine-deficient areas to inform public health strategy and subsequent government action on suitable provision of iodine to the population at risk.

84,84,11113223,"In classical lissencephaly, the cerebral cortex is four-layered, containing neurons that have failed to complete their migration between 12 and 16 weeks of gestation. The authors studied the functional activity of lissencephalic cortex using 2-deoxy-2[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose PET (FDG PET) in eight patients (six girls and two boys, mean age 7.5 years) with isolated lissencephaly sequence. The PET scans revealed a remarkably similar and bilaterally symmetric pattern of glucose metabolism in all eight patients. The cerebral cortex of lissencephaly showed two layers that could be differentiated based on metabolic activity. The inner layer, which probably corresponds to the inner cellular layer of lissencephalic cortex, showed 8 to 63% higher glucose utilization rate than the outer layer, which probably represents a composite of the molecular, outer cellular, and cell-sparse layers. Patients with a higher metabolic ratio between the cortical layers (inner/outer) showed greater delay in communication (p = 0.007) and socialization (p = 0.03). These findings are consistent with [(14)C]-2-deoxyglucose autoradiography studies in fetal sheep that have shown that before the development of significant numbers of axons, dendrites, and synapses, glucose metabolism appears to be highest in regions with the highest density of cell bodies, compared to the more mature state when glucose metabolism is highest in areas of greatest dendritic arborization.

Mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation were used to explore the E3 ligase which regulated BMP7 post-translationally. We initially confirmed that BMP7 protein, but not mRNA, is downregulated when cultured under high glucose mimicking DN conditions, which was rescued by MG-132 treatment. Proteomic analysis of NRK-52E cells ± MG-132 revealed a list of ubiquitin ligases associated with BMP7. Knockdown of the ubiquitin ligase UBE4A stabilized BMP7 expression in NRK-52E cells grown under high glucose conditions.

Seventy-five per cent of the pharmacists stated that they had not received formal education concerning sugar in medication and it's effect on dental health. Their main source of information on the subject was dental health literature. Eighty-seven per cent felt that all medication should be available in sugar-free form. Forty-six per cent stated that sugar in medication was definitely an important cause of dental caries in children and 44% felt that it was a possible factor. The major factors influencing the provision of sugar-free medicines were parental request, health promotion literature, reports and media advertising. Thirty-nine per cent of the pharmacists always offered a sugar-free preparation for over-the-counter medication (provided that a sugar-free alternative was available), and 56% sometimes did so.

Experiment 2 (n = 20) compared the effects of isocaloric (130 kcal) amounts of 2% milk and fruit punch on subjective appetite, FI, and glycemic and appetite hormone responses. One serving of the beverages was given as a pre-meal drink at baseline (0 min) and a second serving 60 min later with an ad libitum pizza meal. Meal FI in experiment 1 was lower by 14% and 10%, respectively, after chocolate milk and yogurt drink (p < 0.001), but not milk, compared with water. Cumulative energy intake (beverages plus meal) was higher after caloric beverages than water. In experiment 2, no differences occurred in pre-meal but post-meal glucose was 83% higher in overweight/obese than normal-weight children (p = 0.02).

In phase two, 519 children were randomly selected from these households and serum TSH levels were assayed. Salt powder (54.5%) was preferred to salt crystals. Salt crystals were washed before use in 20% households. Salt was kept away from the fire-place in 90.4% of households. Salt samples of 88.7% households had an adequate iodine concentration. Salt iodine concentration was significantly lower when salt was stored near a fire-place and washed before use (p<0.001). The median TSH level of children from households with adequate salt iodine concentrations was significantly lower than that of children from households with inadequate salt iodine concentration (p<0.001). A significant number of households did not have adequate iodine in salt samples probably due to inappropriate handling and storage.

Mod + vig PA was associated with both glucose and C-peptide measures (fasting, 120-min, and AUC); higher mod + vig PA was associated with a better OGTT response primarily in children with longer duration of multiple autoantibody positivity. Mod + vig PA also interacted with child age; lower mod + vig PA was associated with a greater increase in C-peptide response across age. Mod + vig PA was not related to fasting insulin, HOMA-IR or HbA1c. The OGTT is the gold standard for diabetes diagnosis and is used to monitor those at high risk for T1D.

AUCs of lactate could significantly predict the mortality and were higher than those of glucose in all patients, subgroup of isolated TBI and subgroup of GCS ≤ 8, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression showed that admission lactate (Adjusted OR = 1.189; 95% CI: 1.002-1.410; P = 0.047) was independently associated with mortality, while admission glucose (Adjusted OR = 1.077; 95% CI: 0.978-1.186; P = 0.133) wasn't an independent risk factor of death.

Median urinary iodine excretion is significantly and positively related to household availability of iodized salt (elasticity, 0.73) for developing countries, but the soil coefficient is not significant, probably because the dummy variable is not well measured. For the developed countries, there is a positive and significant effect of salt penetration rates (elasticity, 0.83) and a positive and significant effect of soil iodine (elasticity, 0.77). There is also a suggestion that countries with more serious soil deficits are more likely to iodize salt, so that univariate regressions of urinary iodine excretion on salt availability or penetration rates underestimate the beneficial effects of iodized salt availability on iodine nutrition. There are limitations to cross-sectional (ecologic) studies such as this, and the data are not perfect.

To examine this effect and its mechanisms in children, we compared symptoms and hydrogen production as an index of lactose malabsorption after typical servings of milk, pasteurized yogurt, and yogurt containing active live culture in 14 lactose-malabsorbing children (mean age 9.5 y). Symptoms and interval breath-hydrogen concentrations were recorded for 8 h after ingestion of 12 g lactose served as milk and yogurts. Lactose-malabsorbing children experienced significantly fewer symptoms after consuming yogurt containing active cultures than after consuming milk (P < 0.005). Pasteurized yogurt showed an intermediate effect. Lactose from yogurt was not better absorbed than was lactose from milk, as indicated by similar areas under the hydrogen curve; however, yogurt was associated with a delayed time to rise and lower rate of rise of the hydrogen curve.

The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to describe the longitudinal profile of CSF parameters in children with CSF shunt infections and assess their association with treatment and outcome. Participants were children treated at 11 tertiary pediatric hospitals in Canada and the United States for CSF shunt infection, from July 1, 2013, through June 30, 2019, with hardware removal, external ventricular drain placement, intravenous antibiotics, and subsequent permanent shunt reinsertion. The relationship between CSF parameters and a complicated course (a composite outcome representing children with at least one of the following: contiguous soft-tissue infection, worsening hydrocephalus, CSF leak, intracranial bleed, brain abscess, venous thrombosis, reinfection after insertion of the new shunt, other complication, ICU admission, or death) was analyzed. A total of 109 children (median age 2.8 years, 44% female) were included in this study. CSF pleocytosis, elevated protein, and hypoglycorrhachia had sensitivities of 69%, 47%, and 38% for the diagnosis of culture-confirmed CSF shunt infection, respectively. The longitudinal profile of the neutrophil percentage followed a monotonic trend, decreasing by 1.5% (95% CI 1.0%-2.0%, p < 0.0001) per day over the course of treatment. The initial WBC count differed significantly between pathogens (p = 0.011), but the proportion of neutrophils, protein concentration, and glucose level did not, and was lowest with Cutibacterium acnes. The duration of antibiotic treatment and the time to shunt reinsertion were longer in patients with a higher initial neutrophil percentage. Fifty-eight patients (53%) had one or more complications during their admission. A neutrophil percentage > 44% (Youden index) in the initial CSF sample was associated with a 1.8-fold (95% CI 1.2- to 2.8-fold) higher relative risk of a complicated course. In a random-intercept, random-slope linear mixed-effects model, the longitudinal neutrophil trajectory differed significantly between patients with and without complications (p = 0.030). A higher proportion of neutrophils in the CSF at diagnosis was associated with a complicated clinical course. Other CSF parameters were associated with treatment and outcome; however, wide variability in values may limit their clinical utility.

In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness and tolerability of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (IV FCM) on clinical symptoms and iron indices in children with RLS or PLMD. This was a single-center retrospective data analysis. Children with a diagnosis of RLS or PLMD, who underwent a single infusion of IV FCM, were included. Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale scores, serum ferritin, and serum iron profile at baseline and after eight weeks post infusion were obtained. Adverse effects were assessed. Thirty-nine children received IV FCM, 29 with RLS and 10 with PLMD.

Our aim was to assess global and regional iodine status as of 2011 and compare it to previous WHO estimates from 2003 and 2007. Using the network of national focal points of the International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders as well as a literature search, we compiled new national data on urinary iodine concentration (UIC) to add to the existing data in the WHO Vitamin and Mineral Nutrition Information System Micronutrients Database. The most recent data on UIC, primarily national data in school-age children (SAC), were analyzed. The median UIC was used to classify national iodine status and the UIC distribution to estimate the number of individuals with low iodine intakes by severity categories. Survey data on UIC cover 96.1% of the world's population of SAC, and since 2007, new national data are available for 58 countries, including Canada, Pakistan, the U.K., and the U.S.. At the national level, there has been major progress: from 2003 to 2011, the number of iodine-deficient countries decreased from 54 to 32 and the number of countries with adequate iodine intake increased from 67 to 105. However, globally, 29.8% (95% CI = 29.4, 30.1) of SAC (241 million) are estimated to have insufficient iodine intakes. Sharp regional differences persist; southeast Asia has the largest number of SAC with low iodine intakes (76 million) and there has been little progress in Africa, where 39% (58 million) have inadequate iodine intakes. In summary, although iodine nutrition has been improving since 2003, global progress may be slowing.

However, the symptomatology in the paediatric population remains understudied and heavily reliant on questionnaires. The aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of OD in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection and to assess the use of olfactory testing in predicting COVID-19 in children. Furthermore, we aimed to investigate the correlation between subjective and objective sense of smell in children. Children aged 6-12 years presenting at Test Centre Aarhus for a reverse transcription PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were invited to participate during the study period (from 8 January to 22 February 2022). They underwent olfactory testing with Sniffin' Sticks 16 Identification Kit and they were asked about their subjective assessment of smell and any confounding factors. A total of 78 children completed inclusion of whom 51 had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. We found no correlation between either current SARS-CoV-2 status and Sniffin' Sticks Identification score (p = 0.500) or previous self-reported infection. We also found no correlation between subjective and objective sense of smell (p = 0. 109). The lack of correlation between SARS-CoV-2 infection and OD may indicate that OD is not a dominant symptom in children. Therefore, olfactory testing is not recommended as a screening method for SARS-CoV-2 as was suggested in adults.

107,107,12494927,"Monitoring and evaluation are the last phases of a national iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) control program but among the most important. This paper summarizes the latest recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the International Council for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD) about indicators and their normative values for monitoring the progress of IDD elimination and illustrates the successful monitoring programs in Switzerland and in China. Salt is the usual vehicle for iodine supplementation and quality control for iodine content can be assessed quantitatively by titration and qualitatively by simple test kits that can be used in the field. The most useful indicator of iodine nutrition is the median urinary iodine concentration. Thyroid size, especially by ultrasound, and neonatal thyrotropin (TSH) are also valuable. In Switzerland, access to iodized salt on a voluntary basis started in 1922. The initial level of iodization, 1.9-3.75 ppm iodine as potassium iodide (KI), was slowly increased to 15 ppm, and recently to 20 ppm, after careful epidemiologic and biologic monitoring. Elimination of IDD has been highly successful. The program costs US dollars 0.07 per year per person. In China, a national program of iodized salt (10-30 ppm) started in 1960 under the authority of the central government and rapidly expanded. National monitoring surveys have taken place every 2 years since 1993. Median urinary iodine, initially low, increased to 165 microg/L in 1995 and to 306 microg/L in 1999, prompting a decrease in the amount of iodine added to salt. The total goiter rate decreased to 20.4% in 1995 and to 8.8% in 1999. IDD can presently be considered as eliminated in China. Review of monitoring in the 128 other major countries affected by IDD shows extremely variable achievements, with evidence of IDD elimination in at least 18 additional countries. Some countries that were severely iodine deficient in the past are now exposed to iodine excess and risk its effects. Sustainable elimination of IDD is within reach and would constitute an unprecedented global success story in the field of noncommunicable diseases, but continuing vigorous action is required to attain this goal.

Animal studies of in utero and lactational TCDD exposure report associations with alterations in insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis, but epidemiologic evidence is limited. We examined the relationship of prenatal TCDD exposure with markers of glucose homeostasis in the Seveso Second Generation study, a unique cohort of children born to TCDD-exposed women resulting from a 1976 explosion in Seveso, Italy. We included 426 children who were 18 years or older with complete follow-up data including a fasting blood draw. Insulin and glucose were measured and the updated homoeostatic model assessment was used to estimate insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR) and beta-cell function (HOMA2-B). Prenatal TCDD exposure was defined in two ways, as initial maternal serum TCDD concentration and TCDD estimated at pregnancy. The children (222 female, 204 male) averaged 28.6 (±6.0) years.

The most significant change for both D/P creatinine and D/D0 glucose occurred after 24 months of PD. It seems reasonable to consider the mean PET values at 24 months of PD as the standard PET values.

Children aged 2-10 years with oSDB were selected for ATO based uponclinical findings according to current standards of care in Denmark. Each childunderwent standardized assessment before and 3 months after surgery, including aPSG, tonsil size assessment, and the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire -Sleep RelatedBreathing Disorder (PSQ) to quantify symptom burden. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)was defined as an obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (oAHI) ≥2/h. Successfultreatment was defined as post-surgery oAHI ≤5/h, and complete cure as oAHI ≤2/h. Fifty-two children were included. Mean age was 5.0 years (SD ± 1.76). Thirteen children were identified with baseline oAHI <2/h. Significant improvement inOSA severity was observed in children with moderate-to-severe OSA, in whom oAHI decreased from 15.7/h to 2.6/h (p < 0.001).

It is incriminated in disturbing the antioxidant system, but also has beneficial effects, as GLA metabolism plays a crucial role in homeostasis. This study highlights which positive or negative aspects of MSG sub-chronic consumption are better reflected in subjects potentially affected by advanced age. Daily doses of MSG were administered to four groups of two-year-old Wistar rats for 90 days: (I) 185 mg/kg bw, (II) 1500 mg/kg bw, (III) 3000 mg/kg bw and (IV) 6000 mg/kg bw, compared to a MSG non-consumer group. Aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, direct and total bilirubin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine and urea levels were analysed; stomach, liver and kidney samples were subjected to histopathological analysis. Although, in most cases, there were no statistical differences, interesting aspects of the dose-effect relationship were observed. After MSG sub-chronic consumption, the positive aspects of GLA seem to be reflected better than the negative ones. The hormesis effect, with low-level reactive oxygen species' protective effects and GLA metabolism, may represent the hypothesis of a potential defence mechanism triggered by MSG sub-chronic consumption in ageing rats.

Studies involving critically ill children who have not undergone cardiac surgery are lacking. In a 35-center trial, we randomly assigned critically ill children with confirmed hyperglycemia (excluding patients who had undergone cardiac surgery) to one of two ranges of glycemic control: 80 to 110 mg per deciliter (4.4 to 6.1 mmol per liter; lower-target group) or 150 to 180 mg per deciliter (8.3 to 10.0 mmol per liter; higher-target group). Clinicians were guided by continuous glucose monitoring and explicit methods for insulin adjustment. The primary outcome was the number of intensive care unit (ICU)-free days to day 28. The trial was stopped early, on the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board, owing to a low likelihood of benefit and evidence of the possibility of harm. Of 713 patients, 360 were randomly assigned to the lower-target group and 353 to the higher-target group. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the median number of ICU-free days did not differ significantly between the lower-target group and the higher-target group (19.4 days [interquartile range {IQR}, 0 to 24.2] and 19.4 days [IQR, 6.7 to 23.9], respectively; P=0.58).

This study aimed to compare IOS indexes and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) in children for the assessment of bronchial hyperreactivity to methacholine, mannitol, and eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation (EVH). Children aged 3-14 years (mean 10.0 ± 3.1) with symptoms suggestive of asthma were recruited. IOS measurements were taken before spirometry. Methacholine, mannitol, and EVH tests were performed without a specific order. We included 190 children, whose mean age was 10.0 ± 3.1 years. Changes in FEV1 correlated significantly with variation in IOS indexes (P < .05). The indexes with the greatest discriminative capacity were Z5, R5, and X5. Optimal cut-offs were: for methacholine tests, ≧22% in R5, ≧82% for reactance area (AX), and ≦41% for X5; for the mannitol test, ≧18% in R5, ≧40% in AX, and ≦21% for X5. In the EVH test, ≧23% for R5, ≧40% for AX, and a fall of 29% for X5. When using the optimal cut-off points obtained from IOS, the mean number of steps and doses required for methacholine and mannitol tests to induce significant bronchoconstriction were significantly lower compared with spirometry ( P < .05). The effectiveness of R5, X5, and AX indexes were comparable to FEV1 in assessing bronchial obstruction during bronchial challenge testing. Therefore, IOS may be useful in assessing bronchial obstruction in children who cannot reliably perform spirometric maneuvers during bronchial challenge testing.

A total of 117 obese children and adolescents 12.1+/-2.7 years old underwent a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Insulin resistance (IR) and beta-cell function were estimated using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-IR and the insulinogenic index, respectively. A total of 17 patients (14.5%) had IGT, and none had DM2. The overall prevalence rates of both IGT and DM2 in our subjects were lower than those reported in a recent multiethnic U.S. study. Nevertheless, the difference between our IGT data and those of the U.S. study was due mostly to the prepubertal subjects (9% vs. 25.4%), whereas no difference was observed in the pubertal population (18% vs. 21%). Fasting glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR values were not predictive of IGT. The absolute value of insulin at 2 hours of the OGTT combined with the time-integrated glycemia (AUCG) can strongly predict IGT, whereas higher area under the curve for insulin (AUCI) values were found to be protective. In ethnic groups less prone to diabetes development, IGT or DM2 in obese subjects is more likely to develop at puberty than at the prepubertal stage. It is advisable that physicians caring for obese adolescents perform an OGTT for early detection of IGT because HOMA-IR values, although higher in IGT subjects and indicative of IR, cannot predict IGT.

Preclinical studies suggest that topiramate (an anticonvulsant) may have disease-modifying properties in IBD, but its efficacy in humans is unknown. To evaluate whether topiramate use is associated with clinical benefit in IBD patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using administrative claims data from the MarketScan databases. Persons with IBD were identified between 2000 and 2010. New users of topiramate were compared with users of other anticonvulsant and anti-migraine medications. The primary outcome was a new prescription for an oral steroid (≥14 days). Secondary outcomes included initiation of biologic agents, abdominal surgery, and hospitalization. Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to adjust for potential confounders. We identified 773 new users of topiramate and 958 users of comparator drugs. After adjusting for potential confounders, topiramate use was not associated with the primary outcome of steroid prescriptions [hazard ratio (HR) 1.14, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.74, 1.73].

124,124,31912158,"Rhabdoid tumors (RTs) arise within (atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor [AT/RT]) or outside the brain (extra [e]CNS-RT) and are driven mainly by inactivation of the SWItch/sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) complex subunit SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily B member 1 (SMARCB1). A pathognomonic hallmark of RTs is heterogeneous multilineage differentiation, including anomalous neuronal differentiation in some eCNS-RTs. Because remodeling of the SWI/SNF complex regulates differentiation, we hypothesized that SWI/SNF Brahma-associated factors (BAF) and polybromo-associated BAF (PBAF) complex heterogeneity are related to both multilineage differentiation and clinical outcome. We performed an integrated analysis of SWI/SNF complex alterations in the developing kidney and cerebellum (most common regions of RT origin) in comparison to eCNS-RT (n = 14) and AT/RT (n = 25) tumors. RT samples were interrogated using immunohistochemistry, DNA methylation, and gene expression analyses. The SWI/SNF BAF paralogs actin-like protein (ACTL)6A and ACTL6B were expressed in a mutually exclusive manner in the developing cerebellum and kidney. In contrast, a subset of eCNS-RTs lost mutual exclusivity and coexpressed both subunits. These tumors showed aberrant DNA methylation of genes that regulate neuronal and renal development and demonstrated immunohistochemical evidence of neuronal differentiation. In addition, low expression of the PBAF subunit polybromo-1 (PBRM1) identified a group of AT/RTs in younger children with better overall prognosis. PBRM1-low AT/RT and eCNS-RTs showed altered DNA methylation and gene expression in immune-related genes. PBRM1 knockdown resulted in lowering immunosuppressive cytokines, and PBRM1 levels in tumor samples showed an inverse relationship with cluster of differentiation (CD)8 cytotoxic T-cell infiltration. Heterogeneity in SWI/SNF BAF (ACTL6A/ACTL6B) and PBAF (PBRM1) subunits is related to histogenesis, contributes to the immune microenvironment and prognosis in RTs, and may inform opportunities to develop immunotherapies.

The brain glucose metabolism, however, showed a >10% increase in the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices and cerebellum. Thus, a short course of tongue and body acupuncture was shown to increase brain glucose metabolism, despite lacking any clinical functional improvement seen during the eight-week course, possibly owing to the severity of the motor dysfunction and the short duration of treatment. The objective increase in brain glucose metabolism might serve as a surrogate marker for assessing the subclinical efficacy of an alternative treatment before any objective clinical improvement is evident.

To determine if oral hydration with dilute apple juice/preferred fluids is noninferior to electrolyte maintenance solution in children with mild gastroenteritis. Randomized, single-blind noninferiority trial conducted between the months of October and April during the years 2010 to 2015 in a tertiary care pediatric emergency department in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Study participants were children aged 6 to 60 months with gastroenteritis and minimal dehydration. Participants were randomly assigned to receive color-matched half-strength apple juice/preferred fluids (n=323) or apple-flavored electrolyte maintenance solution (n=324). Oral rehydration therapy followed institutional protocols. After discharge, the half-strength apple juice/preferred fluids group was administered fluids as desired; the electrolyte maintenance solution group replaced losses with electrolyte maintenance solution. The primary outcome was a composite of treatment failure defined by any of the following occurring within 7 days of enrollment: intravenous rehydration, hospitalization, subsequent unscheduled physician encounter, protracted symptoms, crossover, and 3% or more weight loss or significant dehydration at in-person follow-up. Secondary outcomes included intravenous rehydration, hospitalization, and frequency of diarrhea and vomiting. The noninferiority margin was defined as a difference between groups of 7.5% for the primary outcome and was assessed with a 1-sided α=.025. If noninferiority was established, a 1-sided test for superiority was conducted. Among 647 randomized children (mean age, 28.3 months; 331 boys [51.1%]; 441 (68.2%) without evidence of dehydration), 644 (99.5%) completed follow-up. Children who were administered dilute apple juice experienced treatment failure less often than those given electrolyte maintenance solution (16.7% vs 25.0%; difference, -8.3%; 97.5% CI, -∞ to -2.0%; P < .001 for inferiority and P = .006 for superiority). Fewer children administered apple juice/preferred fluids received intravenous rehydration (2.5% vs 9.0%; difference, -6.5%; 99% CI, -11.6% to -1.8%). Hospitalization rates and diarrhea and vomiting frequency were not significantly different between groups.

128,128,32377804,"We aimed to characterize the association of dietary sugar intake with blood lipids and glucose-related markers in childhood. Data from the multicentric European Childhood Obesity Project Trial were used. Three-day weighed dietary records were obtained at 8 years of age along with serum concentrations of triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), glucose, and insulin. Total sugar intake comprised all mono- and disaccharides; different sugar sources were defined. Linear regression models were applied to investigate the cross-sectional association of total sugar intake with blood lipids and glucose-related markers with adjustment for total energy intake using the residual method. Data were available for 325 children. Children consumed on average 332 kcal (SD 110) and 21% (SD 6) of energy from total sugar. In an energy-adjusted model, an increase of 100 kcal from total sugar per day was significantly associated with a z score HDL-C decrease (- 0.14; 95% CI - 0.01, - 0.27; p value = 0.031). Concerning different food groups of total sugar intake, 100 kcal total sugar from sweetened beverages was negatively associated with z score HDL-C (- 1.67; 95% CI - 0.42, - 2.91; p value = 0.009), while total sugar from milk products was positively related to z score HDL-C (1.38, 95% CI 0.03, 2.72; p value = 0.045). None of the other blood lipids or glucose-related markers showed a significant relationship with total sugar intake.

A nine-day fructose reduction trial, controlling for other dietary factors and weight, in children with obesity and metabolic syndrome, decreased DNL and mitigated cardiometabolic risk (CMR) biomarkers. Ceramides are bioactive sphingolipids whose dysregulated metabolism contribute to lipotoxicity, insulin resistance, and CMR. We evaluated the effect of fructose reduction on ceramides and correlations between changes observed and changes in traditional CMR biomarkers in this cohort. Analyses were completed on data from 43 participants. Mean weight decreased (-0.9 ± 1.1 kg). The majority of total and subspecies ceramide levels also decreased significantly, including dihydroceramides, deoxyceramides and ceramide-1-phoshates. Change in each primary ceramide species correlated negatively with composite insulin sensitivity index (CISI). Change in deoxyceramides positively correlated with change in DNL. These results suggest that ceramides decrease in response to dietary fructose restriction, negatively correlate with insulin sensitivity, and may represent an intermediary link between hepatic DNL, insulin resistance, and CMR.

132,132,34590674,"Epidemic obesity is the most important risk factor for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in youth as it is in adults. Obesity shares pathophysiological mechanisms with T2D and is likely to share part of the genetic background. We aimed to test if weighted genetic risk scores (GRSs) for T2D, fasting glucose (FG) and fasting insulin (FI) predict glycaemic traits and if there is a causal relationship between obesity and impaired glucose metabolism in children and adolescents. Genotyping of 42 SNPs established by genome-wide association studies for T2D, FG and FI was performed in 1660 Italian youths aged between 2 and 19 years. We defined GRS for T2D, FG and FI and tested their effects on glycaemic traits, including FG, FI, indices of insulin resistance/beta cell function and body mass index (BMI). We evaluated causal relationships between obesity and FG/FI using one-sample Mendelian randomization analyses in both directions. GRS-FG was associated with FG (beta = 0.075 mmol/l, SE = 0.011, P = 1.58 × 10-11) and beta cell function (beta = -0.041, SE = 0.0090 P = 5.13 × 10-6).

133,133,9587181,"Thermoregulation during exposure to hot or cold environments differs between children and adults. Many physical and physiological changes occur during growth and maturation that can affect thermoregulation during rest as well as during exercise. Thus, physical as well as physiological differences between children and adults may explain the different response to thermal stress. The main physical difference between children and adults affecting thermoregulation is the much higher surface-area-to-mass ratio of children. In a warm environment this allows them to rely more on dry heat loss and less on evaporative cooling. However, in extreme conditions, hot or cold, the greater surface-area-to-mass ratio results in a higher rate of heat absorption or heat loss, respectively. The lower body fat in girls compared with women provides lower insulation and presents a disadvantage in a cold environment. The smaller blood volume in children compared with adults, even relative to body size, may limit the potential for heat transfer during heat exposure and may compromise exercise performance in the heat. The main physiological difference between children and adults is in the sweating mechanism, affecting their thermoregulation in the heat, but not in the cold. The lower sweating rate characteristic of children is due to a lower sweating rate per gland and not to a lower number of sweat glands. In fact, children are characterised by a higher density of heat-activated sweat glands. The lower sweating rate per gland may be explained by the smaller sweat gland size, a lower sensitivity of the sweating mechanism to thermal stimuli and, possibly, a lower sweat gland metabolic capacity. Other physiological differences between children and adults that may affect thermoregulation include metabolic, circulatory and hormonal disparities. The higher metabolic cost of locomotion in children provides an added strain on the thermoregulatory system during exercise in the heat. On the other hand, during acute exposure to cold it may prove advantageous by increasing heat production. Circulatory differences, such as a lower cardiac output at any given exercise intensity and the lower haemoglobin concentration in boys compared with men, are likely to increase the cardiovascular strain during exercise in the heat, although their effects in a cold environment are unknown. Finally, testosterone and prolactin are 2 hormones that differ in baseline levels between children and adults and may affect sweat gland function and sweat composition. These possible effects need to be further investigated. The effectiveness of thermoregulation is reflected by the stability of core temperature. In a thermoneutral environment, children are characterised by a similar rectal temperature and a higher skin temperature when compared with adults. The latter may reflect the higher reliance on dry heat loss compared with evaporative cooling in children. In a hot environment, children's body temperatures are higher compared with adults while walking and running but not necessarily while cycling. This may be related to the higher metabolic cost, and therefore higher heat production, in children while walking or running but not while cycling. In a cold environment, children are characterised by lower skin temperatures, reflecting greater vasoconstriction. Their metabolic heat is increased in the cold to a greater extent than that of adults, although this appears to be sufficient to maintain their body temperature during exercise but not during prolonged rest. Neither children nor adults sufficiently replace fluid loss during exercise in the heat. Nevertheless, recent studies suggest that in children, when the available beverage is flavoured and enriched with NaCl and carbohydrates, dehydration can be prevented.

137,137,37698113,"The use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigs), especially among teenagers, has reached alarming and epidemic levels, posing a significant threat to public health. However, the short- and long-term effects of vaping on the airway epithelial barrier are unclear. Airway epithelial cells are the forefront protectors from viruses and pathogens. They contain apical junctional complexes (AJCs), which include tight junctions (TJs) and adherens junctions (AJs) formed between adjacent cells. Previously, we reported respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, the leading cause of acute lower respiratory infection-related hospitalization in children and high-risk adults, induces a ""leaky airway"" by disrupting the epithelial AJC structure and function. We hypothesized chemical components of e-cigs disrupt airway epithelial barrier and exacerbate RSV-induced airway barrier dysfunction. Using confluent human bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells and well-differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells, we found that exposure to extract and aerosol e-cig nicotine caused a significant decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and the structure of the AJC even at noncytotoxic concentrations. Western blot analysis of 16HBE cells exposed to e-cig nicotine extract did not reveal significant changes in AJC proteins. Exposure to aerosolized e-cig cinnamon or menthol flavors also induced barrier disruption and aggravated nicotine-induced airway barrier dysfunction. Moreover, preexposure to nicotine aerosol increased RSV infection and the severity of RSV-induced airway barrier disruption.

Plasma was obtained every 10 minutes for 60 minutes for the measures of glucose, insulin, and GLP-1 (radioimmunoassay) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP; ELISA). Incremental glucose and hormone levels were compared between lean individuals and those with obesity by a linear mixed model.

Changes in GIP were similar in both groups. After glucose ingestion, the GLP-1 response (P < 0.001) was higher in the lean group. The GLP-1 increment during 60 minutes from fructose drink was correlated with a lower oDIcpep (r2 = 0.22, P = 0.009).

Whereas infants typically outgrow regurgitation by 1 year of age, the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms in those aged 3 to >18 years ranges from 1.8% to 22%. The pathophysiology of GERD in children is similar to that in adults. However, children may present with gastroesophageal and extraesophageal symptoms distinct from classic heartburn. In addition to a growing awareness of the high prevalence of the disorder, increasing evidence supports GERD being a lifelong condition in some individuals that begins in childhood.

142,142,12693779,"The progressive nature of Sturge-Weber syndrome is well known, but the mechanisms of focal cortical and subcortical degeneration in this disorder are poorly understood. In the present study, we assessed the structural and functional integrity of gray and white matter in unihemispheric Sturge-Weber syndrome using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumetry and MRI-based partial volume correction of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomographic (PET) images. Gray- and white-matter volumes and glucose metabolism were measured in three brain regions (parieto-occipital underneath the angioma, temporal, and frontal) in six children with Sturge-Weber syndrome (two infants, ages 6 and 9 months; four older children, ages 4 to 14 years), all with unilateral parieto-occipital leptomeningeal angiomatosis. The gray-matter volumes ipsilateral to the angioma were smaller in all children, with the posterior regions underneath the angioma the most affected. In the infants, the white-matter volumes were increased in the region of the angioma, whereas in the regions remote from the angioma in the infants and in all regions of the older children, there were large decreases in white-matter volume. The decreases of frontal and temporal white-matter volume were more pronounced than the corresponding gray-matter volume decreases. The PET studies showed severe hypometabolism in the parieto-occipitalregion underneath the angioma in all of the children. However, the two infants showed glucose hypermetabolism in the frontal and temporal cortical gray matter, whereas these regions had relatively preserved metabolism in the older patients. These results demonstrate differential involvement of gray and white matter in Sturge-Weber syndrome. Both structural and functional abnormalities extend well beyond the angioma, indicating widespread abnormalities of growth and development of the affected hemisphere. Furthermore, whereas increased white-matter volume underlying the angioma may be seen in infants, ipsilateral white-matter regions outside the angioma show volume loss both in infants and in older patients. Extensive gray- and white-matter volume loss and hypometabolism ipsilateral to the angioma likely contribute to the frequently observed progressive cognitive dysfunction in these patients, regardless of the extent of the angioma.

143,143,2591179,"Concern at the high prevalence of dental caries in Iceland prompted this survey of 158 preschool children in Reykjavik. On initial examination in 1987 45.8% of the children were caries-free and the prevalence of caries was a mean dmft 2.4 and a mean dmfs 3.3. A dietary questionnaire aimed at discovering the frequency of sugar consumption per week revealed a threshold value of 30 instances of sugar intake per week above which caries prevalence increased markedly. Some of this sugar is consumed in paediatric medicines, particularly antibiotics and anti-asthmatics, which are widely used in Iceland. Caries prevalence (dmft) for children taking such medicines regularly was 3.0 compared with 2.1 for remaining children (P less than 0.05). Those children who took fluoride tablets regularly had less caries (mean dmft 1.1) than those who used fluoride tablets irregularly or not at all (mean dmft 2.8; P less than 0.001). Samples of saliva from the dorsum of the tongue were taken for determination of numbers of Streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli. High bacterial counts were strongly associated with caries. Only 5% of children with more than 5 x 10(5 S. mutans cfu per ml were caries free but 27% of subjects had 67% of the total amount of caries for the group and all of these would have been detected by the bacterial test.

144,144,32357947,"Iodine is an essential micronutrient for thyroid gland function. Iodine deficiency disorders are a spectrum of conditions affecting the fetus, child, adolescent and adult. Iodine requirements are increased in pregnancy in order that the fetus receives enough maternal thyroxine via transplacental passage. Previous studies in Israel have shown widespread iodine deficiency by measurement of urinary iodine concentrations in school age children and adults. The present study clearly shows iodine deficiency in a group of 2nd trimester women as judged by measurement of serum thyroglobulin (a recently evaluated marker of iodine deficiency). An additional factor in this work is that the subjects all resided in an area using desalinated water. Desalination has previously been shown to significantly reduce the iodine content of water compared to water in Israel not subject to this process.The data in this group of pregnant women should serve as a wakeup call to the public health community to correct this deficiency which is known to significantly affect child neurodevelopment. There are several issues to be addressed. The knowledge base relating to iodine nutrition especially during pregnancy is low. An educational plan is required. The strategy for achieving adequate iodine nutrition in the population and particularly before and during pregnancy requires urgent review. While iodine supplementation before and during gestation can correct iodine deficiency, the provision of iodised salt in the community is recommended, similar to more than 80% of countries in the world.It is indeed a time for action to ensure the adequate intellectual performance of Israel's children.

146,146,28779468,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been associated with depressive symptoms, but the causal direction of this association and the underlying mechanisms, such as increased glucose levels, remain unclear. We used instrumental-variable regression with a genetic instrument (Mendelian randomization) to examine a causal role of increased glucose concentrations in the development of depressive symptoms. Data were from the population-based Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study (n = 1217). Depressive symptoms were assessed in 2012 using a modified Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-I). Fasting glucose was measured concurrently with depressive symptoms. A genetic risk score for fasting glucose (with 35 single nucleotide polymorphisms) was used as an instrumental variable for glucose. Glucose was not associated with depressive symptoms in the standard linear regression (B = -0.04, 95% CI [-0.12, 0.04], p = .34), but the instrumental-variable regression showed an inverse association between glucose and depressive symptoms (B = -0.43, 95% CI [-0.79, -0.07], p = .020).

147,147,24994857,"Studies suggest that improvements in type 2 diabetes (T2D) post- Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery are attributable to decreased intestinal glucose absorption capacity mediated by exclusion of sweet taste-sensing pathways in isolated proximal bowel. We probed these pathways in rat models that had undergone RYGB with catheter placement in the biliopancreatic (BP) limb to permit post-RYGB exposure of isolated bowel to sweet taste stimulants. Lean Sprague Dawley (n = 13) and obese Zucker diabetic fatty rats (n = 15) underwent RYGB with BP catheter placement. On postoperative day 11 (POD 11), rats received catheter infusions of saccharin [sweet taste receptor (T1R2/3) agonist] or saline (control). Jejunum was analyzed for changes in glucose transporter/sensor mRNA expression and functional sodium-glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1)-mediated glucose uptake. Saccharin infusion did not alter glucose uptake in the Roux limb of RYGB rats. Intestinal expression of the glucose sensor T1R2 and transporters (SGLT1, glucose transporter 2) was similar in saccharin- vs. saline-infused rats of both strains. However, the abundance of SGLT3b mRNA, a putative glucose sensor, was higher in the common limb vs. BP/Roux limb in both strains of bypassed rats and was significantly decreased in the Roux limb after saccharin infusion. We concluded that failure of BP limb exposure to saccharin to increase Roux limb glucose uptake suggests that isolation of T1R2/3 is unlikely to be involved in metabolic benefits of RYGB, as restimulation failed to reverse changes in intestinal glucose absorption capacity. The altered expression pattern of SGLT3 after RYGB warrants further investigation of its potential involvement in resolution of T2D after RYGB.

Consuming an intake of water below recommendations (underhydration) in addition to the substitution of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) for water are habits deeply ingrained in several countries. This behavior is due to voluntary and involuntary dehydration; and because young children are exposed to SSB, the preference for a sweet taste is profoundly implanted in the brain. Underhydration and SSB intake lead to mild hyperosmolarity, which stimulates biologic processes, such as the stimulation of vasopressin and the polyol-fructose pathway, which restore osmolarity to normal but at the expense of the continued activation of these biological systems. Unfortunately, chronic activation of the vasopressin and polyol-fructose pathways has been shown to mediate many diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease. It is therefore urgent that we encourage educational and promotional campaigns that promote the evaluation of personal hydration status, a greater intake of potable water, and a reduction or complete halting of the drinking of SSB.

Data were available from the Childhood Obesity Project Trial initiated in 2002. Sugar intake was measured by 3-day weighed food protocols at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 years of age. Body mass index (BMI) and fat mass index (FMI) were available at the same time points. To investigate the association of sugar intake with anthropometrics over time, linear mixed models were applied. Odds ratios for having a high BMI or FMI (above one standard deviation) were estimated by logistic random-effects models. To control for total energy intake, the residual method was chosen and models were additionally adjusted for total energy intake. Data were available for 809 children with in total 2846 observations. In an isocaloric model, an increase of 100 kcal from sugar per day was significantly associated with lower zBMI (- 0.033; 95% CI -0.061, - 0.005) and zFMI (- 0.050; 95% CI - 0.089, - 0.011). In addition, a 100 kcal higher sugar intake was related to lower odds of having a high zBMI (OR 0.743; 95% CI 0.611, 0.903).

Compared to individuals with low levels of PCB-118, individuals with high levels exhibited a 4.7 mg/dL (p = 0.02) higher glucose concentration at 15 min and a 3.6 mg/dL (p = 0.01) higher glucose concentration at 30 min. The effects observed with exposure to organochlorine compounds were independent of pubertal stages. PBDE-153 was associated with the development of dysregulated glucose metabolism beginning in late puberty. At Tanner stage 4, exposure to PBDE-153 was associated with a 12.7 mg/dL higher 60-min glucose concentration (p = 0.009) and a 16.1 mg*dl Our results suggest that childhood exposure to lipophilic POPs is associated with dysregulated glucose metabolism.

162,162,38515179,"The gut microbiota is recognized as a regulator of brain development and behavioral outcomes during childhood. Nonetheless, associations between the gut microbiota and behavior are often inconsistent among studies in humans, perhaps because many host-microbe relationships vary widely between individuals. This study aims to stratify children based on their gut microbiota composition (i.e., clusters) and to identify novel gut microbiome cluster-specific associations between the stool metabolomic pathways and child behavioral outcomes. Stool samples were collected from a community sample of 248 typically developing children (3-5 years). The gut microbiota was analyzed using 16S sequencing while LC-MS/MS was used for untargeted metabolomics. Parent-reported behavioral outcomes (i.e., Adaptive Skills, Internalizing, Externalizing, Behavioral Symptoms, Developmental Social Disorders) were assessed using the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC-2). Children were grouped based on their gut microbiota composition using the Dirichlet multinomial method, after which differences in the metabolome and behavioral outcomes were investigated. Four different gut microbiota clusters were identified, where the cluster enriched in both Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium (Ba2) had the most distinct stool metabolome. The cluster characterized by high Bifidobacterium abundance (Bif), as well as cluster Ba2, were associated with lower Adaptive Skill scores and its subcomponent Social Skills. Cluster Ba2 also had significantly lower stool histidine to urocanate turnover, which in turn was associated with lower Social Skill scores in a cluster-dependent manner. Finally, cluster Ba2 had increased levels of compounds involved in Galactose metabolism (i.e., stachyose, raffinose, alpha-D-glucose), where alpha-D-glucose was associated with the Adaptive Skill subcomponent Daily Living scores (i.e., ability to perform basic everyday tasks) in a cluster-dependent manner. These data show novel associations between the gut microbiota, its metabolites, and behavioral outcomes in typically developing preschool-aged children. Our results support the concept that cluster-based groupings could be used to develop more personalized interventions to support child behavioral outcomes. Video Abstract.

164,164,26586275,"Dietary guidelines continue to recommend restricting intake of saturated fats. This recommendation follows largely from the observation that saturated fats can raise levels of total serum cholesterol (TC), thereby putatively increasing the risk of atherosclerotic coronary heart disease (CHD). However, TC is only modestly associated with CHD, and more important than the total level of cholesterol in the blood may be the number and size of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles that contain it. As for saturated fats, these fats are a diverse class of compounds; different fats may have different effects on LDL and on broader CHD risk based on the specific saturated fatty acids (SFAs) they contain. Importantly, though, people eat foods, not isolated fatty acids. Some food sources of SFAs may pose no risk for CHD or possibly even be protective. Advice to reduce saturated fat in the diet without regard to nuances about LDL, SFAs, or dietary sources could actually increase people's risk of CHD. When saturated fats are replaced with refined carbohydrates, and specifically with added sugars (like sucrose or high fructose corn syrup), the end result is not favorable for heart health. Such replacement leads to changes in LDL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglycerides that may increase the risk of CHD. Additionally, diets high in sugar may induce many other abnormalities associated with elevated CHD risk, including elevated levels of glucose, insulin, and uric acid, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin and leptin resistance, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and altered platelet function. A diet high in added sugars has been found to cause a 3-fold increased risk of death due to cardiovascular disease, but sugars, like saturated fats, are a diverse class of compounds. The monosaccharide, fructose, and fructose-containing sweeteners (e.g., sucrose) produce greater degrees of metabolic abnormalities than does glucose (either isolated as a monomer, or in chains as starch) and may present greater risk of CHD. This paper reviews the evidence linking saturated fats and sugars to CHD, and concludes that the latter is more of a problem than the former. Dietary guidelines should shift focus away from reducing saturated fat, and from replacing saturated fat with carbohydrates, specifically when these carbohydrates are refined. To reduce the burden of CHD, guidelines should focus particularly on reducing intake of concentrated sugars, specifically the fructose-containing sugars like sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup in the form of ultra-processed foods and beverages.

Animal studies suggest that exposure to artificial sweeteners in utero may predispose offspring to develop obesity; however, to our knowledge, this has never been studied in humans. To determine whether maternal consumption of artificially sweetened beverages during pregnancy is associated with infant body mass index (BMI [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]). This cohort study included 3033 mother-infant dyads from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study, a population-based birth cohort that recruited healthy pregnant women from 2009 to 2012. Women completed dietary assessments during pregnancy, and their infants' BMI was measured at 1 year of age (n = 2686; 89% follow-up). Statistical analysis for this study used data collected after the first year of follow-up, which was completed in October 2013. The data analysis was conducted in August 2015. Maternal consumption of artificially sweetened beverages and sugar-sweetened beverages during pregnancy, determined by a food frequency questionnaire. Infant BMI z score and risk of overweight at 1 year of age, determined from objective anthropometric measurements and defined according to World Health Organization reference standards. The mean (SD) age of the 3033 pregnant women was 32.4 (4.7) years, and their mean (SD) BMI was 24.8 (5.4). The mean (SD) infant BMI z score at 1 year of age was 0.19 (1.05), and 5.1% of infants were overweight. More than a quarter of women (29.5%) consumed artificially sweetened beverages during pregnancy, including 5.1% who reported daily consumption. Compared with no consumption, daily consumption of artificially sweetened beverages was associated with a 0.20-unit increase in infant BMI z score (adjusted 95% CI, 0.02-0.38) and a 2-fold higher risk of infant overweight at 1 year of age (adjusted odds ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.23-3.88). These effects were not explained by maternal BMI, diet quality, total energy intake, or other obesity risk factors. There were no comparable associations for sugar-sweetened beverages. To our knowledge, we provide the first human evidence that maternal consumption of artificial sweeteners during pregnancy may influence infant BMI. Given the current epidemic of childhood obesity and widespread use of artificial sweeteners, further research is warranted to confirm our findings and investigate the underlying biological mechanisms, with the ultimate goal of informing evidence-based dietary recommendations for pregnant women.

However, human evidence, especially in adolescents, is unavailable. We utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2014 to evaluate whether urinary OPEs metabolites were associated with prediabetes and glucose homeostasis. A total of 349 adolescents (12-19-year old) who provided at least 8 h fasting blood samples, had urinary OPEs metabolites detected were included. Prediabetes was defined according to the levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h post oral plasma glucose (2 h-OGTT) and glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). The homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) and the Single Point Insulin Sensitivity Estimator (SPISE) were used to assess insulin resistance and sensitivity, respectively. Multiple binary logistic and linear regressions were used to evaluate the associations with prediabetes and indices of glucose homeostasis. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to assess the associations in a multi-pollutant context. After adjusting for covariates, certain urinary OPEs metabolites were associated with prediabetes and indices of glucose homeostasis in all adolescents. Stratified analyses by sex revealed that such associations were largely sex-dependent. In females, the multiple pollutant models showed that bis(1,3-32 dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP) was positively associated with prediabetes [odds ratio (OR) = 2.51, 95%CI:1.29, 4.89, for one scaled unit increase in exposure] and 2 h-OGTT (β = 0.07, 95%CI:0.01,0.12); bis(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (BCEP) was negatively associated with fasting insulin (β = -0.10, 95%CI: 0.19,-0.01) and HOMA-IR (β = -0.10, 95%CI: 0.19,-0.003); and detectable bis(1-choloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BCIPP) (>LOD vs < LOD) was inversely associated with 2 h-OGTT (β = -0.11, 95%CI: 0.21,-0.02). In males, consistent inverse associations were found for detectable di-n-butyl phosphate (DNBP) with prediabetes, FPG, 2 h-OGTT, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR.

176,176,37804855,"Diabetes is a highly heterogeneous condition; yet, it is diagnosed by measuring a single blood-borne metabolite, glucose, irrespective of aetiology. Although pragmatically helpful, disease classification can become complex and limit advances in research and medical care. Here, we describe diabetes heterogeneity, highlighting recent approaches that could facilitate management by integrating three disease models across all forms of diabetes, namely, the palette model, the threshold model and the gradient model. Once diabetes has developed, further worsening of established diabetes and the subsequent emergence of diabetes complications are kept in check by multiple processes designed to prevent or circumvent metabolic dysfunction. The impact of any given disease risk factor will vary from person-to-person depending on their background, diabetes-related propensity, and environmental exposures. Defining the consequent heterogeneity within diabetes through precision medicine, both in terms of diabetes risk and risk of complications, could improve health outcomes today and shine a light on avenues for novel therapy in the future.

177,177,9579921,"Presurgical evaluation for intractable frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) is difficult and invasive, partly because anatomic neuroimaging studies with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) typically do not show a discrete lesion. In adult patients with FLE, functional neuroimaging of glucose metabolism with positron emission tomography (PET) is less sensitive in detecting focal metabolic abnormalities than in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Comparable data on children with FLE are not available. We used high-resolution PET scanning of glucose metabolism to evaluate 13 children (age 17 months to 17 years; mean age 9.5 years) with intractable FLE being considered for surgical treatment. Only children with normal CT and MRI scans were included. Hypometabolism including the frontal lobe was evident in 12 of the 13 children, was unilateral in 11 of 13, and was restricted to the frontal lobe in 8 of 13. One child showed bilateral frontal cortex hypometabolism and another had an ictal PET scan demonstrating unilateral frontal cortex hypermetabolism surrounded by hypometabolism. Additional hypometabolic areas outside the frontal cortex were observed in 5 children in parietal and/or temporal cortex. Localization of seizure onset on scalp EEG was available in 10 children and corresponded to the location of frontal lobe PET abnormality in 8. However, in 4 of the 10 children, the extent of hypometabolism exceeded the epileptogenic region indicated by ictal EEG. In 2 of the 13 children, the abnormality evident on EEG was more extensive than that evident on PET. In the remaining 3 children for whom only interictal EEG data were available, the PET foci did not correspond in location to the interictal EEG abnormalities. In 11 of the 13 children, the presumed region of seizure onset in the frontal lobe, as based on analysis of seizure semiology, corresponded to the locations of frontal lobe glucose metabolism abnormalities. Although high-resolution PET appears to be very sensitive in localizing frontal lobe glucose metabolic abnormalities in children with intractable FLE and normal CT/MRI scans, the significance of extrafrontal metabolic disturbances requires further study; these may represent additional epileptogenic areas, effects of diaschisis, seizure propagation sites, or secondary epileptogenic foci.

179,179,2152051,"A community based study was conducted on the understanding and knowledge of childhood diarrhoea and use of oral rehydration therapy (ORT), in four selected villages in Tumpat District, Kelantan. The calculated annual incidence of diarrhoeal disease in children aged 0 to four years in all study villages was 1.38 episodes for each child. The main care-givers of children aged 0 to four years were interviewed and asked to demonstrate how to mix a standard ORS (oral rehydration solution) sachet if they had previously used ORT. Forty percent of care-givers had heard of the locally available ORT and 30% had actually used ORT. Of those who had heard of or used ORT, 10% had good knowledge of what it was and what it was used for, 51% had some knowledge and 39% had either no knowledge or inaccurate knowledge. Of care-givers who had previously used ORT only 20.5% demonstrated the correct volume of water to add to one sachet of ORT, but 82% would discard an unused solution within 24 hours. Significantly more literate women had used ORT than those not literate (p = 0.002). Mothers, particularly those literate, are the primary target group for ORT intervention strategies. Components of health education should include advice on what ORS is, what it is used for, and how to correctly mix a standard sachet. In May-June 1988, community medicine professors oversaw interviews of 265 primary caregivers of 0-4 year old children living in 4 villages in Tumpat District in Kelantan State, Thailand, and collected secondary data from the health centers and district hospital serving these villages to identify epidemiological features of childhood diarrhea and knowledge and use of oral rehydration therapy. The annual incidence of diarrhea stood at 1.38 episodes/child. 21 children (5.3%) had diarrhea in the 2 weeks before the interview. Literate mothers were considerably more likely to use oral rehydration solution (ORS) than were illiterate mothers (38.7% vs. 22.6%; p = .002). 40% of all mothers were familiar with ORS, but only 30% had used ORS. 10% of mothers who knew about our used ORS demonstrated strong knowledge of ORS and 39% had no knowledge.

Nevertheless, 82.1% of the mothers stating they knew how to prepare ORS knew that they had to throw out the unused prepared solution in less than 24 hours. The study population used 5 different ORS sachets, the most commonly used sachet being that of the Ministry of Health (250 ml). Other ORS sachets included the 200-ml sachet (Eltolit) from the Universiti Sains Malaysia Hospital, an orange flavored Eltolit, and 2 sachets with instructions in English (240 ml and 250 ml).

Analysis of the covariance showed that the age of the patients was influential (P < 0.001) and also showed a difference in TPM-CDR between the non-inducers group (TPM or TPM + lamotrigine or valproate) and the inducers group (TPM + carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin) (P < 0.001). The TPM-CDR was 0.4 +/- 0.1 in patients under 11 years with inducers (n = 7), 0.8 +/- 0.3 in patients over 11 years with inducers (n = 32), 1.1 +/- 0.4 in patients under 11 years with noninducers (n = 30), and 1.8 +/- 0.6 in patients over 11 years with noninducers (n = 21). A two-way analysis of the variance showed differences between patients under 11 years and those over 11 years (P < 0.001), and between the noninducers and inducers groups (P < 0.001).

These 29 children were reasonably representative of normal children and provided an otherwise unobtainable population in which to study developmental changes in local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (lCMRGlc). In infants less than 5 weeks old lCMRGlc was highest in sensorimotor cortex, thalamus, brainstem, and cerebellar vermis. By 3 months, lCMRGlc had increased in parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices; basal ganglia; and cerebellar cortex. Frontal and dorsolateral occipital cortical regions displayed a maturational rise in lCMRGlc by approximately 6 to 8 months. Absolute values of lCMRGlc for various grey matter regions were low at birth (13 to 25 mumol/min/100 gm), and rapidly rose to reach adult values (19 to 33 mumol/min/100 gm) by 2 years. lCMRGlc continued to rise until, by 3 to 4 years, it reached values of 49 to 65 mumol/min/100 gm in most regions. These high rates were maintained until approximately 9 years, when they began to decline, and reached adult rates again by the latter part of the second decade. The highest increases of lCMRGlc over adult values occurred in cerebral cortical structures; lesser increases were seen in subcortical structures and in the cerebellum. This time course of lCMRGlc changes matches that describing the process of initial overproduction and subsequent elimination of excessive neurons, synapses, and dendritic spines known to occur in the developing brain.

Principal component analysis was performed for 9599 children and three patterns were extracted: 'family foods' associated with traditional British family foods such as meat, fish, puddings, potatoes and vegetables; 'sweet and easy' associated with foods high in sugar (sweets, chocolate, fizzy drinks, flavoured milks) and foods requiring little preparation (crisps, potatoes, baked beans, peas, soup); 'health conscious' associated with fruit, vegetables, eggs, nuts and juices. We found clear associations between dietary pattern scores and socio-demographic variables, with maternal education being the most important. Higher levels of education were associated with higher scores on both the 'family foods' and the 'health conscious' patterns, and decreased scores on the 'sweet and easy' pattern. Relationships were evident between dietary pattern scores and various feeding difficulties and behaviours. Notably, children who were introduced late to lumpy (chewy) solids (after 9 months) scored lower on both the 'family foods' and the 'health conscious' patterns.

The aims of this study were to delineate the biochemical characteristics and to examine the effect of different therapeutic strategies on ultrasound staging of parapneumonic effusion. The ultrasonic appearances were classified according to the deposition of fibrin or formation of fibrin septations. A total of 81 patients were enrolled in the present study. Chest ultrasound was performed and results were stratified into anechoic fluid (stage 1, n = 23), with floating fibrin strands (stage 2, n = 30), and with septated fibrin (stage 3, n = 28). The mean days of fever elapsed before detection of these stages appeared to be higher at advanced stages (7.3 +/- 2.1 vs. 8.5 +/- 2.7 vs. 9.7 +/- 4.2, respectively; P = 0.03). Univariate analysis revealed that WBC, platelet count in hemogram and pH, glucose, protein, LDH in pleural effusion were significantly associated with the stages of parapneumonic effusion. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that pH (less than 7.27) in pleural fluid was the only significant factor for the formation of fibrin with/without fibrin septations. The rate of successful tube drainage decreased as the advancement of stages of parapneumonic effusion, especially in patients using chest tube for drainage initially (P = 0.001). Total duration of fever and hospital stay was significantly shorter for those children who had initial video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) compared to those who had initial chest tube drainage (P < 0.001). Chest sonography can well discriminate the progressive stages of bacterial parapneumonic effusion.

Antecedents likely begin in childhood and whether childhood exposure to air pollution plays a contributory role is not well understood. To assess whether children's exposure to air pollution is associated with markers of risk for metabolic syndrome and oxidative stress, a hypothesized mediator of air pollution-related health effects. We studied 299 children (ages 6-8) living in the Fresno, CA area. At a study center visit, questionnaire and biomarker data were collected. Outcomes included hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), urinary 8-isoprostane, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and BMI.

The effect of oral clonidine premedication on plasma glucose and lipid homeostasis associated with exogenous glucose infusion were investigated in children undergoing minor surgery. Otherwise healthy children (n, 120; aged 3-13 yr) were assigned randomly to six groups according to the glucose concentration of the intravenous solution (0%, 2%, or 5%, at a rate of 6 ml kg(-1) x h(-1)) and the preoperative medications (4 microg/kg clonidine or placebo given 100 min before anesthesia) they were to receive. The plasma concentrations of glucose, nonesterified fatty acid, ketone bodies, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol were determined. Infusion of 5% glucose caused hyperglycemia (mean glucose concentration >200 mg/dl) in six children receiving placebo and two receiving clonidine. Although the mean plasma glucose concentration increased in three placebo groups, it was unchanged and the plasma concentrations of total ketone bodies and nonesterified fatty acid were increased in children receiving clonidine and glucose-free solution. The plasma epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol levels in children receiving placebo increased in response to surgery. Clonidine attenuated the increase in catecholamines and cortisol. Oral clonidine premedication attenuated the hyperglycemic response, probably by inhibiting the surgical stress-induced release of catecholamines and cortisol.

We reviewed the medical records of all children (1 month to 18 years of age) with bacterial meningitis who presented to 20 pediatric emergency departments between 2001 and 2004. Bacterial meningitis was defined by positive cerebrospinal fluid culture results for a bacterial pathogen or cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis with positive blood culture and/or cerebrospinal fluid latex agglutination results. Probable bacterial meningitis was defined as positive cerebrospinal fluid Gram stain results with negative results of bacterial cultures of blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Antibiotic pretreatment was defined as any antibiotic administered within 72 hours before the lumbar puncture. We identified 231 patients with bacterial meningitis and another 14 with probable bacterial meningitis. Of those 245 patients, 85 (35%) had received antibiotic pretreatment. After adjustment for patient age, duration and severity of illness at presentation, and bacterial pathogen, longer duration of antibiotic pretreatment was not significantly associated with cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count, cerebrospinal fluid absolute neutrophil count. However, antibiotic pretreatment was significantly associated with higher cerebrospinal fluid glucose and lower cerebrospinal fluid protein levels. Although these effects became apparent earlier, patients with >or=12 hours of pretreatment, compared with patients who either were not pretreated or were pretreated for <12 hours, had significantly higher median cerebrospinal fluid glucose levels (48 mg/dL vs 29 mg/dL) and lower median cerebrospinal fluid protein levels (121 vs 178 mg/dL).

199,199,34740605,"The roles of systemic and airway-specific epithelial energy metabolism in altering the developmental programming of airway epithelial cells (AECs) in early life are poorly understood. Our aim was to assess carbohydrate metabolism in developing AECs among children with and without wheeze and test the association of infant plasma energy biomarkers with subsequent recurrent wheeze and asthma outcomes. We measured cellular carbohydrate metabolism in live nasal AECs collected at age 2 years from 15 male subjects with and without a history of wheeze and performed a principal component analysis to visually assess clustering of data on AEC metabolism of glycolitic metabolites and simple sugars. Among 237 children with available year 1 plasma samples, we tested the associations of year 1 plasma energy biomarkers and recurrent wheeze and asthma by using generalized estimating equations and logistic regression. Children with a history of wheeze had lower utilization of glucose in their nasal AECs than did children with no wheeze. Systemically, a higher plasma glucose concentration at year 1 (within the normal range) was associated with decreased odds of asthma at age 5 years (adjusted odds ratio = 0.56; 95% CI = 0.35-0.90). Insulin concentration, glucose-to-insulin ratio, C-peptide concentration, and leptin concentration at year 1 were associated with recurrent wheeze from age 2 years to age 5 years. These results suggest that there is significant energy metabolism dysregulation in early life, which likely affects AEC development. These pertubations of epithelial cell metabolism in infancy may have lasting effects on lung development that could render the airway more susceptible to allergic sensitization.

200,200,14725575,"The management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) continues to garner vast amounts of attention among physicians who care for adults. However, there is an increasing awareness of the fact that this disease, as well as several other lifelong digestive diseases (i.e. Crohn's disease) may actually have their origins in childhood. Paediatric gastro-oesophageal reflux (GER) is likely to share a similar pathophysiology to adult GER, and mounting evidence from published preliminary data suggests a genetic susceptibility to GERD. However, further studies will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis. In children, GER has a distinct presentation from that in adults, with the diagnostic work-up based upon the patient's age as well as their presenting signs and symptoms. Like their adult counterparts, the early detection and treatment of GER in children may result in a better long-term outcome, improved quality-of-life, and a reduction in overall healthcare burden. While the treatment of GER in infants tends to be conservative (i.e. positioning during feeding, smaller feedings), its management in older children parallels that of adults and includes lifestyle changes and pharmacological therapy. However, with persistent symptoms, acid suppression is the mainstay of GERD management in both children and adults. Several studies in children have verified that acid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor is superior to histamine-2 receptor antagonists. Among the proton pump inhibitors, both lansoprazole and omeprazole have been the subject of published adult and paediatric studies demonstrating their short and long-term safety, in addition to their efficacy in a variety of oesophageal and supra-oesophageal GERD related conditions. These two proton pump inhibitors are manufactured as capsules containing enteric-coated granules that can be emptied into soft foods or liquids without compromising their pharmacological effects or pharmacokinetic properties. Lansoprazole is also available as a strawberry-flavoured suspension that is acceptable to children and as an oral disintegrating tablet.

Difficulty with glucose regulation may be a contributing modifiable risk factor during perioperative anesthetic management. To mitigate the risk of hyperglycemia in neonates, some providers empirically halve the preoperative rate of dextrose-containing infusions during surgery. To assess the association between halving the preoperative maintenance dextrose rate and postoperative euglycemia in neonatal intensive care unit patients undergoing exploratory laparotomies. Neonatal intensive care unit patients who underwent exploratory laparotomy under general anesthesia from 1/1/2014 to 11/21/2019 were included in this analysis. Hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia were defined as >150 mg/dL and <46 mg/dL. A calculated dextrose ratio was utilized to categorize patients into full and half intraoperative dextrose rate cohorts. Univariate analyses were performed with Fisher's exact test, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, or Spearman's correlation. Multivariable analyses with regression models were conducted after graphical evaluation of a predetermined set of independent variables. 107 patients were included in the full dextrose rate cohort and 96 patients in the half dextrose rate cohort with postoperative hyperglycemia occurring in 47 and 28 patients, respectively. On univariate analysis, halving the preoperative dextrose rate was associated with decreased postoperative hyperglycemia (odds ratio: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.28-0.98, P = 0.041). This association continued in the regression model (adjusted odds ratio: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.25-0.80, P = 0.008) after controlling for preoperative dextrose rate, preoperative serum glucose, preoperative pH, surgical duration, postmenstrual age at surgery, and the presence of necrotizing enterocolitis. Only one patient was hypoglycemic postoperatively, and they were in the full dextrose cohort. Halving of preoperative dextrose rates intraoperatively during exploratory laparotomy in neonatal intensive care unit patients was associated with a decreased risk of postoperative hyperglycemia without substantially increasing the occurrence of postoperative hypoglycemia. The practice of halving preoperative dextrose rates may be an effective empirical approach for intraoperative glucose management in the high-risk neonatal population when blood glucose monitoring is challenging.

207,207,10722675,"A novel animal model of insulin resistance, the fructose-fed Syrian golden hamster, was employed to investigate the mechanisms mediating the overproduction of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) in the insulin resistant state. Fructose feeding for a 2-week period induced significant hypertriglyceridemia and hyperinsulinemia, and the development of whole body insulin resistance was documented using the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique. In vivo Triton WR-1339 studies showed evidence of VLDL-apoB overproduction in the fructose-fed hamster. Fructose feeding induced a significant increase in cellular synthesis and secretion of total triglyceride (TG) as well as VLDL-TG by primary hamster hepatocytes. Increased TG secretion was accompanied by a 4.6-fold increase in VLDL-apoB secretion. Enhanced stability of nascent apoB in fructose-fed hepatocytes was evident in intact cells as well as in a permeabilized cell system. Analysis of newly formed lipoprotein particles in hepatic microsomes revealed significant differences in the pattern and density of lipoproteins, with hepatocytes derived from fructose-fed hamsters having higher levels of luminal lipoproteins at a density of VLDL versus controls. Immunoblot analysis of the intracellular mass of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, a key enzyme involved in VLDL assembly, showed a striking 2.1-fold elevation in hepatocytes derived from fructose-fed versus control hamsters. Direct incubation of hamster hepatocytes with various concentrations of fructose failed to show any direct stimulation of its intracellular stability or extracellular secretion, further supporting the notion that the apoB overproduction in the fructose-fed hamster may be related to the fructose-induced insulin resistance in this animal model.

Prevalence and associated factors were assessed in a multicentre, Asian longitudinal paediatric cohort. CLHIV were considered to have lipid or glucose abnormalities if they had total cholesterol ≥200 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ≤35 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) ≥100 mg/dL, triglycerides (TG) ≥110 mg/dL, or fasting glucose >110 mg/dL. Factors associated with lipid and glucose abnormalities were assessed by logistic regression. Of 951 CLHIV, 52% were male with a median age of 8.0 (interquartile range [IQR] 5.0-12.0) years at ART start and 15.0 (IQR 12.0-18.0) years at their last clinic visit. 89% acquired HIV perinatally, and 30% had ever used protease inhibitors (PIs). Overall, 225 (24%) had hypercholesterolemia, 105 (27%) low HDL, 213 (58%) high LDL, 369 (54%) hypertriglyceridemia, and 130 (17%) hyperglycemia. Hypercholesterolemia was more likely among females (versus males, aOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.40-2.67). Current PIs use was associated with hypercholesterolemia (current use: aOR 1.54, 95% CI 1.09-2.20); low HDL (current use: aOR 3.16, 95% CI 1.94-5.15; prior use: aOR 10.55, 95% CI 2.53-43.95); hypertriglyceridemia (current use: aOR 3.90, 95% CI 2.65-5.74; prior use: aOR 2.89, 95% CI 1.31-6.39); high LDL (current use: aOR 1.74, 95% CI 1.09-2.76); and hyperglycemia (prior use: aOR 2.43, 95% CI 1.42-4.18).

209,209,36407313,"Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) is gaining in popularity for patients with paediatric hypoglycaemia disorders such as Congenital Hyperinsulinism (CHI), but no standard measures of accuracy or associated clinical risk are available. The small number of prior assessments of CGM accuracy in CHI have thus been incomplete. We aimed to develop a novel Hypoglycaemia Error Grid (HEG) for CGM assessment for those with CHI based on expert consensus opinion applied to a large paired (CGM/blood glucose) dataset. Paediatric endocrinology consultants regularly managing CHI in the two UK centres of excellence were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding glucose cutoffs and associated anticipated risks of CGM errors in a hypothetical model. Collated information was utilised to mathematically generate the HEG which was then approved by expert, consensus opinion. Ten patients with CHI underwent 12 weeks of monitoring with a Dexcom G6 CGM and self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) with a Contour Next One glucometer to test application of the HEG and provide an assessment of accuracy for those with CHI. CGM performance was suboptimal, based on 1441 paired values of CGM and SMBG showing Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MARD) of 19.3% and hypoglycaemia (glucose <3.5mmol/L (63mg/dL)) sensitivity of only 45%. The HEG provided clinical context to CGM errors with 15% classified as moderate risk by expert consensus when data was restricted to that of practical use. This provides a contrasting risk profile from existing diabetes error grids, reinforcing its utility in the clinical assessment of CGM accuracy in hypoglycaemia. The Hypoglycaemia Error Grid, based on UK expert consensus opinion has demonstrated inadequate accuracy of CGM to recommend as a standalone tool for routine clinical use. However, suboptimal accuracy of CGM relative to SMBG does not detract from alternative uses of CGM in this patient group, such as use as a digital phenotyping tool. The HEG is freely available on GitHub for use by other researchers to assess accuracy in their patient populations and validate these findings.

There is global variation in beverage formulation in terms of glucose and fructose concentration, which may pose unique health risks linked to glycemic control for Australian consumers. However, previous systematic reviews have overlooked Australian-based literature. A systematic review was performed to synthesise evidence for the associations between consumption of SSBs and intense-sweetened beverages with clinical cardiometabolic risk factors in the Australian population. Articles were sourced from Global Health, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, Medline, and Culmative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. To be eligible for review, studies had to report on the consumption of sugar-sweetened (including fruit juice and fruit drinks) and/or intense-sweetened beverages, and at least one clinical cardiometabolic risk factor. Eighteen studies were included in this review. Research has mostly focused on the relationship between SSB consumption and adiposity-related outcomes. No studies have examined indices of glycaemic control (glucose/insulin), and the evidence for the health impact of intense-sweetened drinks is limited. In addition, studies have primarily been of cross-sectional design, and have examined children and adolescents, as opposed to adult populations.

Participants were followed up through mailed questionnaires. SSBs consumption was assessed at baseline and at the 6-year follow-up questionnaires. The outcome was the incidence of hypertension. To assess the relationship between categories of SSB consumption and the risk of developing hypertension during follow-up, Cox regression models were fitted. Additionally stratified by sex analysis were conducted. During follow-up (median: 8.1-y), 1308 incident cases of hypertension were identified. After adjusting for potential confounders, the hazard ratio for developing hypertension among participants in the highest category (≥7 servings/week) of SSB consumption was 1.33 (95% CI:1.08-1.68) compared to those in the lowest category (non-drinkers) (p for trend: 0.007).

DATA SOURCES PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Clinical Trials, and bibliography of retrieved articles through August 11, 2012. STUDY SELECTION Randomized trials of headache treatment among children and adolescents (&lt;18 years old). INTERVENTION Any placebo-controlled trial or comparisons between 2 or more active medications. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Number of headaches per month. RESULTS Among 21 included trials, there were 13 placebo-controlled and 10 active comparator trials (2 also included placebo). Twenty trials focused on episodic migraines and 1 on chronic daily headaches. Drugs more effective than placebo for episodic migraines (&lt;15 headaches per month) included topiramate (difference in headaches per month, -0.71; 95% CI, -1.19 to -0.24) and trazodone (-0.60; 95% CI, -1.09 to -0.11). Ineffective drugs included clonidine, flunarizine, pizotifen, propranolol, and valproate. A single trial of fluoxetine for chronic daily headaches found it ineffective. Patients given placebo experienced a significant (P = .03) decline in headaches, from 5.6 (95% CI, 4.52-6.77; Q = 8.14 [Cochran Q is a measure of the heterogeneity of the included studies]) to 2.9 headaches per month (95% CI, 1.66-4.08; Q = 4.72).

However, evidence of long-term impacts of maternal glycemic status on offspring amino acid (AA) profiles is scarce. We aimed to investigate the association between maternal antenatal glycaemia and offspring mid-childhood amino acid (AA) profiles, which are emerging cardiometabolic biomarkers. Data were drawn from the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) study, a multi-ethnic Asian birth cohort. A subset of 422 mother-child dyads from the GUSTO study, who was followed from early pregnancy to mid-childhood, was included. Mothers underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 26-28 weeks gestation, with fasting and 2-h plasma glucose concentrations measured and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) diagnosed per WHO 1999 guidelines. Offspring fasting plasma samples were collected at mean age 6.1 years, from which AA profiles of nine AAs, alanine, glutamine, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, valine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine were measured. Total branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) were calculated as the sum of isoleucine, leucine, and valine concentrations. Multi-variable linear regression was used to estimate the association of maternal glycemic status and offspring mid-childhood AA profiles adjusting for maternal age, ethnicity, maternal education, parity, family history of diabetes, ppBMI, child sex, age and BMI z-scores. Approximately 20% of mothers were diagnosed with GDM. Increasing maternal fasting glucose was significantly associated with higher offspring plasma valine and total BCAAs, whereas higher 2-h glucose was significantly associated with higher histidine, isoleucine, valine, and total BCAAs. Offspring born to mothers with GDM had higher valine (standardized mean difference 0.27 SD; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.52), leucine (0.28 SD; 0.02, 0.53), and total BCAAs (0.26 SD; 0.01, 0.52) than their counterparts. Inconsistent associations were found between maternal GDM and other amino acids among offspring during mid-childhood. Increasing maternal fasting and post-OGTT glucose concentrations at 26-28 weeks gestation were significantly associated with mid-childhood individual and total BCAAs concentrations. The findings suggest that elevated maternal glycaemia throughout pregnancy, especially GDM, may have persistent programming effects on offspring AA metabolism which were strongly associated with adverse cardiometabolic profiles at mid-childhood.

Subsequent PET (28 months later) in this child revealed the typical ICMRGIc pattern seen in advanced SWS. Further study of this transient ICMRGIc increase may be important in disclosing the pathogenesis of unilateral cerebral degeneration in SWS. In neurologically asymptomatic children with the facial stigmata of SWS and in children with early SWS, PET provides a sensitive measure of the extent and degree of cerebral metabolic impairment. Serial PET studies in children with SWS can be used to assess disease progression and, together with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, may be useful in the selection of suitable candidates for cerebral hemispherectomy or focal cortical resection.

225,225,25998217,"To review the literature regarding electronic cigarettes and discuss potential implications and need for advocacy for the pediatric otolaryngologist. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are battery-operated devices that deliver nicotine-containing vapors via inhalation. Research on the health related consequences of e-cigarettes is ongoing and safety has yet to be established. E-cigarettes are not presently under the regulation of any national governing body with wide accessibility to minors. Use of these products has substantially increased since arrival to the market, particularly within the adolescent population. These products are marketed via various platforms including television, Internet and social media. Hundreds of flavors are offered and e-cigarettes are packaged in various colors. Not only are the ill health effects and addictive quality of nicotine concerning, these products have the potential to serve as a gateway for minors to tobacco use. The relationship between tobacco use, secondhand smoke exposure and otolaryngology specific diseases has well been defined. As use of electronic cigarettes increases, pediatric otolaryngologists should be aware of the ongoing literature regarding these products and to be prepared to counsel families accordingly. The use of e-cigarettes among teenagers, potential implications of secondhand vapor exposure from parents and friends, and concerns this may encourage adolescents to utilize conventional tobacco products needs to be considered.

227,227,28779443,"Headaches in children are quite common; however, the study and characterization of headache disorders in the pediatric age group has historically been limited. Because of the lack of controlled studies on prophylactic treatment of headache disorders in this age group, the diagnosis of migraine rests on criteria similar those in adults. Likewise, data from adult studies is often inferred and applied to children. Although it appears that many preventives are safe in children, currently none are FDA or EMA approved for this age group. Consequently, many children who present to their primary care physicians with migraines do not receive any preventive therapy despite experiencing significant disability. Controlled clinical trials investigating the use of preventive medications in children have suffered from high placebo response rates. The shorter duration of headaches and other characteristic features seen in children are such that designing randomized controlled trials in this age group is more problematic and limiting. Treatment practices vary widely, even among specialists, due to the absence of evidence-based guidelines from clinical trials. The Childhood and Adolescent Migraine Prevention Study (CHAMP) was developed to examine the effectiveness of two of the most widely prescribed preventive medications for pediatric migraine and help narrow this gap. To date, it has been the largest enrolling study of its kind within the pediatric migraine world; its results and implications will be discussed and considered here. The CHAMP trial was discontinued early on account of futility and exhibited that neither of two preventive medications for pediatric migraine was more effective than placebo in reducing the number of headache days over a period of 24 weeks. Subjects in the amitriptyline and topiramate groups had higher rates of adverse events than those who had received placebo.

231,231,26330302,"Iodine deficiency can adversely affect child development including stunted growth. However, the effect of iodine supplementation or fortification on prenatal and postnatal growth in children (<18 years) is unclear. We identified the potential need for a systematic review to contribute to the evidence base in this area. To avoid duplication and inform the need for a new systematic review and its protocol, we undertook a rapid scoping review of existing systematic reviews investigating the effect of iodised salt and iodine supplements on growth and other iodine-related outcomes. We searched TRIP and Epistemokinos (latest search date 15 December 2014). All English language systematic reviews reporting on the effect of iodine supplementation or fortification in any form, dose or regimen on any iodine-related health outcomes (including but not limited to growth) were included. Eligible systematic reviews could include experimental or observational studies in pregnant or lactating women or children to age 18. We tabulated the extracted data to capture the scope of questions addressed, including: author, publication year, most recent search date, participants, pre-specified treatment/exposure and comparator, pre-specified outcomes, outcomes relevant to our question and number and type of studies included. Methodological quality of included reviews was assessed using AMSTAR. Nine hundred and seventy-six records were screened and 10 reviews included. Most studies were of moderate methodological quality. Outcomes included assessments of thyroid function, iodine deficiency disorders, mental development and growth. Populations studied included pregnant women, preterm infants and children into adulthood. Most reviews looked at direct iodine supplementation or fortification, though some reviews considered iodine status, including the relationship between iodine intake and iodine biomarkers. Although five reviews pre-specified inclusion of growth outcomes, none provided synthesised evidence on the effects of iodine supplementation or fortification on prenatal and postnatal somatic growth. Our rapid scoping review demonstrates a gap in the evidence base with no existing, up-to-date systematic reviews on the effects of all forms of iodine supplementation/fortification in all of the relevant population groups on relevant growth and growth-related outcomes.

To assess the effects of a front-of-package 100% vitamin C claim, fruit imagery, percentage juice and teaspoons of added sugar disclosures, and high-added sugar warnings on parents' choices, knowledge, and perceptions of beverages. This randomized clinical trial was conducted May to July 2021 as a single-exposure (no follow-up) online survey of primary caregivers of children ages 0 to 5 years throughout the US. Participants were shown no-, low-, and high-added sugar beverages and asked to choose 1 for their child. Participants were randomized to see high-added sugar beverages with 1 of 7 front-of-package conditions: (1) claim and imagery (control); (2) no claim; (3) no imagery; (4) no claim or imagery; (5) claim, imagery, and percentage juice disclosure; (6) claim, imagery, and warning; or (7) claim, imagery, warning, and teaspoons of added sugar disclosure. Primary outcomes were type of beverage chosen (eg, high-added sugar beverage) and resulting calories and added sugar (in grams). Secondary outcomes were fruit drink knowledge (added sugar and percent juice) and perceptions.

237,237,35315383,"Glucose dysregulation (GD) in patients with β-thalassemia major (β-TM) usually develops gradually. Prediabetes consists of two abnormalities, impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), the latter detected by a standardized oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Diagnosis of prediabetes is essential for an early identification of high-risk individuals who will benefit from intensive iron chelation therapy and lifestyle modification. Therefore, patients with β-TM should undergo annual screening for glucose abnormalities, according to international recommendations, starting from the age of 10 years. OGTT remains the preferred screening method as it is more sensitive for GD than fasting plasma glucose (FPG), although it is poorly reproducible. The use of HbA1c measurement has limited use as it is generally considered unreliable in patients with thalassemia. Continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) is an accurate method to detect the variability of glucose fluctuations and offers the opportunity for better assessment of glucose homeostasis in a selected group of β-TM patients. Pancreatic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) associated with insulin secretion-sensitivity index-2 (ISSI-2) could be a complementary test, minimizing the necessity for OGTT and identifying high-risk patients before irreversible pancreatic damage occurs.

Seven parents (58%) reported improvement (three children had 75% improvement; four children had 25% improvement). There was a significant correlation between the interval of onset of visual impairment and starting treatment with clinical or functional outcome, with a longer interval resulting in a better outcome (P = .0282). However, there was no correlation between cause, severity, or clinical or functional visual outcome with improvement in the visual evoked potential or PET. We demonstrated that tongue and body acupuncture can improve the visual status of children with visual disorders, both peripheral and central in origin. As children with chronic visual impairment also showed some visual recovery, more studies should be done to assess the full potential of acupuncture as an adjunct to Western medicine in neuroplasticity.

The current use of capillary sampling schedules does not provide a comprehensive assessment of glycemic status and fails to detect asymptomatic hypoglycemia episodes. To investigate the efficacy and accuracy of a real-time continuous glucose monitoring system (RT-CGMS) in neonates with CHH. A sensor connected to RT-CGMS was inserted into the newborn patients and maintained for at least 6 days during their stay in the hospital. We compared the readings of CGMS with capillary blood glucose values using Bland-Altman analysis. A total of 110 blood glucose values were compared to readings from the CGMS. All results were calculated and plotted for CGMS values at 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, and 25-29 min after capillary blood glucose sampling. CGMS readings were highly correlated with blood glucose values, especially during normoglycemia. In case of hypoglycemia, the mean difference between the CGMS and capillary glucose values was higher. Although the false positive rate for hypoglycemia was relatively high in CGMS, RT-CGMS may show some episodes of hypoglycemia earlier than blood measurement. RT-CGMS is accurate during normoglycemia, and it can reduce the number of capillary blood samples in children with CHH.

242,242,29921329,"Major risk factors for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) include premature birth and formula feeding in the context of microbial colonization of the gastrointestinal tract. We previously showed that feeding formula composed of lactose vs. corn syrup solids protects against NEC in preterm pigs; however, the microbial and metabolic effects of these different carbohydrates used in infant formula has not been explored. Our objective was to characterize the effects of lactose- and corn syrup solid-based formulas on the metabolic and microbial profiles of preterm piglets and to determine whether unique metabolomic or microbiome signatures correlate with severity or incidence of NEC. Preterm piglets (103 days gestation) were given total parenteral nutrition (2 days) followed by gradual (5 days) advancement of enteral feeding of formulas matched in nutrient content but containing either lactose (LAC), corn syrup solids (CSS), or 1:1 mix (MIX). Gut contents and mucosal samples were collected and analyzed for microbial profiles by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Metabolomic profiles of cecal contents and plasma were analyzed by LC/GC mass spectrometry. NEC incidence was 14, 50, and 44% in the LAC, MIX, and CSS groups, respectively. The dominant classes of bacteria were Bacilli, Clostridia, and Gammaproteobacteria. The number of observed OTUs was lowest in colon contents of CSS-fed pigs. CSS-based formula was associated with higher Bacilli and lower Clostridium from clusters XIVa and XI in the colon. NEC was associated with decreased Gammaproteobacteria in the stomach and increased Clostridium sensu stricto in the ileum. Plasma from NEC piglets was enriched with metabolites of purine metabolism, aromatic amino acid metabolism, and bile acids. Markers of glycolysis, e.g., lactate, were increased in the cecal contents of CSS-fed pigs and in plasma of pigs which developed NEC. Feeding formula containing lactose is not completely protective against NEC, yet selects for greater microbial richness associated with changes in Bacilli and Clostridium and lower NEC incidence. We conclude that feeding preterm piglets a corn syrup solid vs. lactose-based formula increases the incidence of NEC and produces distinct metabolomic signatures despite modest changes in microbiome profiles.

243,243,25844950,"Currently bronchial provocation testing (BPT) using mannitol powder cannot be performed in children under 6 years. A primary reason is it is challenging for children at this age to generate a consistent inspiratory effort to inhale mannitol efficiently from a dry powder inhaler. A prototype system, which does not require any inhalation training from the pediatric subject, is reported here. It uses an external source of compressed air to disperse mannitol powder into a commercial holding chamber. Then the subject uses tidal breathing to inhale the aerosol. The setup consists of a commercially available powder disperser and Volumatic™ holding chamber. Taguchi experimental design was used to identify the effect of dispersion parameters (flow rate of compressed air, time compressed air is applied, mass of powder, and the time between dispersion and inhalation) on the fine particle dose (FPD). The prototype was tested in vitro using a USP throat connected to a next generation impactor. The aerosols from the holding chamber were drawn at 10 L/min. A scaling factor for estimating the provoking dose to induce a 15% reduction in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (PD15) was calculated using anatomical dimensions of the human respiratory tract at various ages combined with known dosing values from the adult BPT. Consistent and doubling FPDs were successfully generated based on the Taguchi experimental design. The FPD was reliable over a range of 0.8 (±0.09) mg to 14 (±0.94) mg. The calculated PD15 for children aged 1-6 years ranged from 7.1-30 mg. The FPDs generated from the proposed set up are lower than the calculated PD15 and therefore are not expected to cause sudden bronchoconstriction.

Despite WHO recommendations and IAP (Indian Academy of Paediatrics) and Government of India treatment guidelines, few children suffering from acute diarrhoea in India receive low osmolarity oral rehydration solution (ORS) and zinc from health care providers. The aim of this study was to analyse practitioners' prescriptions for acute diarrhoea for adherence to treatment guidelines and further to determine the factors affecting prescribing for diarrhoea in Ujjain, India. This cross-sectional study was conducted in pharmacies and major hospitals of Ujjain, India. We included prescriptions from all practitioners, including those from modern medicine, Ayurveda, Homeopathy as well as informal health-care providers (IHPs). The data collection instrument was designed to include all the possible medications that are given for an episode of acute diarrhoea to children up to 12 years of age. Pharmacy assistants and resident medical officers transferred the information regarding the current diarrhoeal episode and the treatment given from the prescriptions and inpatient case sheets, respectively, to the data collection instrument. Information was collected from 843 diarrhoea prescriptions. We found only 6 prescriptions having the recommended treatment that is ORS along with Zinc, with no additional probiotics, antibiotics, racecadotril or antiemetics (except Domperidone for vomiting). ORS alone was prescribed in 58% of the prescriptions; while ORS with zinc was prescribed in 22% of prescriptions, however these also contained other drugs not included in the guidelines. Antibiotics were prescribed in 71% of prescriptions. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were prescribed and often in illogical fixed-dose combinations. One such illogical combination, ofloxacin with ornidazole, was the most frequent oral antibiotic prescribed (22% of antibiotics prescribed). Practitioners from alternate system of medicine and IHPs are significantly less likely (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.04-0.46, P = 0.003) to prescribe ORS and zinc than pediatricians. Practitioners from 'free' hospitals are more likely to prescribe ORS and zinc (OR 4.94, 95% CI 2.45-9.96, P < 0.001) and less likely to prescribe antibiotics (OR 0.01, 95% CI 0.01-0-04, P < 0.001) compared to practitioners from 'charitable' hospitals. Accompanying symptoms like the presence of fever, pain, blood in the stool and vomiting significantly increased antibiotic prescribing. This study demonstrated low adherence to standard treatment guidelines for management of acute diarrhoea in children under 12 years in Ujjain, India. Key public health concerns were the low use of zinc and the high use of antibiotics, found in prescriptions from both specialist paediatricians as well as practitioners from alternate systems of medicine and informal health-care providers.

Iodine intake entirely depends on external sources, and deficiencies are known to be more prevalent in lower social groups, especially in countries with limited access to iodized salt. This study aimed to determine the influence of SES on iodine status and iodine availability from household salt in North Macedonia. Using cluster sampling, 1,200 children were recruited, and 1,191 children participated (response rate: 99.2%). Iodine status was assessed through urinary iodine concentration (UIC), and iodine availability through iodine content in household salt requested from participants. SES was assessed using standardized Family Affluence Score (FAS). No statistically significant correlation was found between FAS and iodine in salt. Median regression revealed no significant associations of middle vs. low FAS (β=0.00; 95%-confidence interval (CI)=[-0.61, 0.62]; p=0.999) or high vs. low affluence (β=0.48; 95% CI=[-1.37, 0.41]; p=0.291) with iodine content in household salt. UIC levels were significantly lower in middle FAS children compared to low FAS children (β=-16.4; 95% CI=[-32.3, -0.5]; p=0.043). No statistically significant differences in UIC were found between children with high and low affluence (β=-12.5; 95% CI=[-35.5, 10.5]; p=0.287), possibly due to lowered statistical power for this comparison.

Overall, there was a decline in performance over the morning on almost every cognitive task. Children showed better attention following consumption of Iso GUM compared to Std GUM but attention was not significantly different than Reform GUM and glucose. Also, Iso GUM conferred a beneficial effect over both Reform GUM and glucose on sensitivity index of numeric working memory with no difference observed between Iso GUM and Std GUM. Surprisingly, glucose group showed lowest decline in the sensitivity index of spatial working memory and highest speed in picture recognition, although the latter was significantly better than Reform GUM only. For speed of spatial working memory, Reform GUM had the lowest decline but was significantly different only with Std GUM. There was, however, no significant difference among conditions for continuity of attention, speed of numeric working memory and picture recognition sensitivity.

Although in some children obesity and asthma simply co-occur, those with 'obese asthma' have increased asthma severity, lower quality of life, and reduced medication response. Underlying mechanistic pathways may include anatomical changes of the airways such as obstruction and dysanapsis, systemic inflammation, production of adipokines, impaired glucose-insulin metabolism, altered nutrient levels, genetic and epigenetic changes, and alterations in the airway and/or gut microbiome.

The substitution levels were 3, 6, 9 and 12%. The sensory evaluation test was done by 25 trained judges using the hedonic scaling method (9 to 1 scoring). Internal and external characteristics of appearance, color, aroma, texture, bitterness and flavor, as well as general acceptability, were measured. Sensory evaluation results of the external characteristics were significant at the 9 and 12% SLF levels for color (p less than 0.05) while the other parameters did not show significant differences. In regard to the internal characteristics, a significant difference for color was found at the 3% level of SLF (p less than 0.05); and at 6, 9 and 12% SLF levels, for appearance (p less than 0.05). The general acceptability was good at all the levels tested, with no significant differences among them. An acceptability study at the consumer level for 9% lupine flour bread was carried out in a group of 90 girls, aged 10-12 years, during a 10-day period. The results showed a very good acceptability of the product (p less than 0.01).

This study investigated whether these lipid-derived surrogate markers can predict MetS in Korean children and adolescents. Data from 1,814 participants were analyzed from the 2013-2016 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. MetS was defined using three sets of criteria: Cook et al.

The main eligibility criteria were affected tissues or leukemic cells expressing the WT1 gene, and patients (and donors for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) having HLA-A*24:02. Vaccination using the WT1 peptide (CYTWNQMNL), which was modified for higher affinity to this HLA-type molecule with the adjuvant Montanide ISA51, was performed weekly 12 times. Twenty-six patients were enrolled and 13 (50.0%) completed the vaccination 12 times. Evidence for the induction of WT1-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses without severe systemic side effects was obtained. Two out of 12 patients with bulky disease exhibited a transient clinical effect (one mixed response and one stable disease), three out of six patients with minimal residual disease achieved transient molecular remission, and five out of eight patients without a detectable level of the molecular marker, but with a high risk of relapse, had the best outcome of long-term continuous complete remission. WT1 vaccination is a safe immunotherapy and induced WT1-specific CTL responses in children; however, as a single agent, vaccination only provided patients in remission, but with a high risk of relapse, with ""long-term benefits"" in the context of its use for relapse prevention.

We evaluated the genetic, biochemical, and clinical characteristics, including the Nijmegen Progression CDG Rating Scale (NPCRS), urine polyol levels and fibroblast glycoproteomics in patients with PMM2-CDG. We performed PMM enzyme measurements, multiplexed proteomics, and glycoproteomics in PMM2-deficient fibroblasts before and after epalrestat treatment. Safety and efficacy of 0.8 mg/kg/day oral epalrestat were studied in a child with PMM2-CDG for 12 months. PMM enzyme activity increased post-epalrestat treatment. Compared with controls, 24% of glycopeptides had reduced abundance in PMM2-deficient fibroblasts, 46% of which improved upon treatment. Total protein N-glycosylation improved upon epalrestat treatment bringing overall glycosylation toward the control fibroblasts' glycosylation profile. Sorbitol levels were increased in the urine of 74% of patients with PMM2-CDG and correlated with the presence of peripheral neuropathy, and CDG severity rating scale. In the child with PMM2-CDG on epalrestat treatment, ataxia scores improved together with significant growth improvement. Urinary sorbitol levels nearly normalized in 3 months and blood transferrin glycosylation normalized in 6 months. Epalrestat improved PMM enzyme activity, N-glycosylation, and glycosylation biomarkers in vitro. Leveraging cellular glycoproteome assessment, we provided a systems-level view of treatment efficacy and discovered potential novel biosignatures of therapy response.

Even though salt iodization was started to be implemented to alleviate this burden in Ethiopia, primary studies assessing iodine deficiency in the country show highly variable findings, and no systematic review was conducted to determine the pooled prevalence of the problem which makes it difficult to assess the effect of the intervention as well as to design appropriate and timely measures. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the pooled prevalence of iodine deficiency and the common factors affecting its occurrence among school-age children in Ethiopia.

Clarifying the molecular and structural modifications that transpire during the development of obesity is crucial for understanding its progression and devising effective therapies. The study was indeed conducted as part of an ongoing CO treatment trial, where data were collected from children diagnosed with CO before the initiation of non-drug treatment interventions. Our primary aim was to analyze the biochemical changes associated with childhood obesity, specifically focusing on concentrations of lipids, lipoproteins, insulin, and glucose. By comparing these parameters between the CO group (n = 60) and a control group of healthy children (n = 43), we sought to elucidate the metabolic differences present in individuals with CO. Our biochemical analyses unveiled lower LDL (low-density lipoproteins) levels and higher HDL (high-density lipoproteins), cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, and glucose levels in CO individuals compared to controls. To scrutinize these changes in more detail, we employed Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy on the serum samples. Our results indicated elevated levels of lipids and proteins in the serum of CO, compared to controls. Additionally, we noted structural changes in the vibrations of glucose, β-sheet, and lipids in CO group. The FTIR technique, coupled with principal component analysis (PCA), demonstrated a marked differentiation between CO and controls, particularly in the FTIR region corresponding to amide and lipids.

270,270,26044914,"Increased intestinal permeability has been reported in asthmatic subjects as well as in patients with gastrointestinal disease, thus suggesting the involvement of all the mucosal immune system. We aimed to assess intestinal permeability according to recurrent respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms in children with asthma and children with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). In 108 outpatients aged 3-14 years (45 asthmatic, 63 with FGIDs), we measured the urinary lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratio, performed allergy skin prick tests and administered questionnaires for recurrent respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms starting from at least 2 months which persisted over the previous 4 weeks. L/M ratios were compared with previously reported normal values yielded by our chromatographic method (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry). High L/M ratios (>0.030) were less frequent in asthmatic children than in children with FGIDs (9/45: 20% vs. 41/63: 65%, P < 0.001). High L/M ratios were associated with gastrointestinal symptoms in 8/9 asthmatic (P < 0.05) and 39/41 subjects with FGIDs (P < 0.005). L/M ratios were not associated with respiratory symptoms or atopy. In a regression model, a high L/M was predicted by low height, absence of asthma and presence of gastrointestinal symptoms (r = 0.72, P < 0.001). Increased intestinal permeability is associated with recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms rather than with recurrent respiratory symptoms in both asthmatic children and those with FGIDs. Our findings do not support the hypothesis of mucosal intestinal damage following an inflammatory stimulus in the respiratory mucosa.

CMRGlu of the whole brain after HD-MTX was reduced by 31% on the average (p less than 0.01). CMRGlu of cerebral cortex was reduced more than that of white matter. Eight children with ALL (mean age 9.6 years) were studied using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography before and after HD-MTX (200 mg/kg or 2,000 mg/M2) therapy. Although no patients clinically showed any neurological abnormalities during HD-MTX therapy, CMRGlu of the whole brain after HD-MTX was reduced by 21% on the average (p less than 0.05). Reduction rates of rCMRGlu after HD-MTX therapy were correlated with both total doses of intrathecal MTX (r = 0.717, p less than 0.05) and total doses of systemic HD-MTX (r = 0.784, p less than 0.05). The reduction rate of CMRGlu of cerebral cortex, particularly frontal and occipital cortex, was greater than either that of basal ganglia or white matter. It is suggested that measurement of rCMRGlu after HD-MTX is useful for detecting accumulated neurotoxicity of MTX.

In this study, we investigated the voluntary oral intake and preference for sucrose, glycerol or ethanol solutions by wild-type, citrin (Ctrn)-knockout (KO), mGPD-KO, and Ctrn/mGPD double-KO mice; all substances that are known or suspected precipitating factors in the pathogenesis of human citrin deficiency. The double-KO mice showed clear suppressed intake of sucrose, consuming less with progressively higher concentrations compared to the other mice. Similar observations were made when glycerol or ethanol were given. The preference of Ctrn-KO and mGPD-KO mice varied with the different treatments; essentially no differences were observed for sucrose, while an intermediate intake or similar to that of the double-KO mice was observed for glycerol and ethanol. We next examined the hepatic glycerol 3-phosphate, citrate, citrulline, lysine, glutamate and adenine nucleotide levels following forced enteral administration of these solutions. A strong correlation between the simultaneous increased hepatic glycerol 3-phosphate and decreased ATP or total adenine nucleotide content and observed aversion of the mice during evaluation of their voluntary preferences was found. Overall, our results suggest that the aversion observed in the double-KO mice to these solutions is initiated and/or mediated by hepatic metabolic perturbations, resulting in a behavioral response to increased hepatic cytosolic NADH and a decreased cellular adenine nucleotide pool. These findings may underlie the dietary predilections observed in human citrin deficient patients.

Limited data exist regarding the potential role of UPFs in the occurrence of allergic diseases. The underlying mechanisms underpinning any such associations are also poorly elucidated. We performed a systematic review and narrative evidence synthesis of the available literature to assess associations between UPF consumption and pediatric allergy outcomes (n = 26 papers), including data on the association seen with the gut microbiome (n = 16 papers) or immune system (n = 3 papers) structure and function following PRISMA guidelines. Dietary exposure to fructose, carbonated soft drinks, and sugar intake was associated with an increased risk of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergies in children. Commercial baby food intake was associated with childhood food allergy. Childhood intake of fructose, fruit juices, sugar-sweetened beverages, high carbohydrate UPFs, monosodium glutamate, UPFs, and advanced glycated end-products (AGEs) was associated with the occurrence of allergic diseases. Exposure to UPFs and common ingredients in UPFs seem to be associated with increased occurrence of allergic diseases such as asthma, wheezing, food allergies, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis, in many, but not all studies. More preclinical and clinical studies are required to better define the link between UPF consumption and the risk of allergies and asthma.

274,274,37725835,"The importance of glucokinase (GK) in the regulation of insulin secretion has been highlighted by the phenotypes of individuals with activating and inactivating mutations in the glucokinase gene (GCK). Here we report 10 individuals with congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) caused by eight unique activating mutations of GCK. Six are novel and located near previously identified activating mutations sites. The first recognized episode of hypoglycemia in these patients occurred between birth and 24 years, and the severity of the phenotype was also variable. Mutant enzymes were expressed and purified for enzyme kinetics in vitro. Mutant enzymes had low glucose half-saturation concentration values and an increased enzyme activity index compared with wild-type GK. We performed functional evaluation of islets from the pancreata of three children with GCK-HI who required pancreatectomy. Basal insulin secretion in perifused GCK-HI islets was normal, and the response to glyburide was preserved. However, the threshold for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in perifused glucokinase hyperinsulinism (GCK-HI) islets was decreased, and glucagon secretion was greatly suppressed. Our evaluation of novel GCK disease-associated mutations revealed that the detrimental effects of these mutations on glucose homeostasis can be attributed not only to a lowering of the glucose threshold of insulin secretion but also to a decreased counterregulatory glucagon secretory response. Our evaluation of six novel and two previously published activating GCK mutations revealed that the detrimental effects of these mutations on glucose homeostasis can be attributed not only to a lowering of the glucose threshold of insulin secretion but also to a decreased counterregulatory glucagon secretory response. These studies provide insights into the pathophysiology of GCK-hyperinsulinism and the dual role of glucokinase in β-cells and α-cells to regulate glucose homeostasis.

We review the literature on sulfonylurea toxicity, including cases reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC). The ingestion of one to two sulfonylurea tablets by a small child can lead to profound hypoglycemia with severe sequelae if untreated. As a result, all potential sulfonylurea ingestions by young children should be evaluated by a physician. A capillary glucose level must be rapidly determined at presentation and should then be repeated at regular intervals for up to 8 hours. A longer observation period is recommended for the extended release preparation of glipizide. Asymptomatic children who do not develop hypoglycemia within the recommended observation period may be safely discharged home. All children who exhibit clear symptoms of hypoglycemia or glucose levels < 60 mg/dL should be admitted for supplemental glucose (oral or intravenous), with careful observation of clinical condition and monitoring of serum glucose levels.

Cross-sectional study. Primary schools located in Victoria, Australia. 666 of 780 children aged 4-12 years who participated in the Salt and Other Nutrients in Children study returned a complete 24-hour urine collection. 24-hour urine collection for the measurement of sodium and potassium excretion and 24-hour dietary recall for the assessment of food sources. Parent and child reported use of discretionary salt. SES defined by parental highest level of education. Participants were 9.3 years (95% CI 9.0 to 9.6) of age and 55% were boys. Mean urinary sodium and potassium excretion was 103 (95% CI 99 to 108) mmol/day (salt equivalent 6.1 g/day) and 47 (95% CI 45 to 49) mmol/day, respectively. Mean molar Na:K ratio was 2.4 (95% CI 2.3 to 2.5). 72% of children exceeded the age-specific upper level for sodium intake. After adjustment for age, sex and day of urine collection, children from a low socioeconomic background excreted 10.0 (95% CI 17.8 to 2.1) mmol/day more sodium than those of high socioeconomic background (p=0.04). The major sources of sodium were bread (14.8%), mixed cereal-based dishes (9.9%) and processed meat (8.5%). The major sources of potassium were dairy milk (11.5%), potatoes (7.1%) and fruit/vegetable juice (5.4%). Core foods provided 55.3% of dietary sodium and 75.5% of potassium while discretionary foods provided 44.7% and 24.5%, respectively. For most children, sodium intake exceeds dietary recommendations and there is some indication that children of lower socioeconomic background have the highest intakes. Children are consuming about two times more sodium than potassium. To improve sodium and potassium intakes in schoolchildren, product reformulation of lower salt core foods combined with strategies that seek to reduce the consumption of discretionary foods are required.

Cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure were based on the clinical and/or radiological (CT, MR) findings. When treating with both mannitol and HS (Group IIIA), if patients serum osmality was greater than 325 mosmol/L, mannitol was stopped and patients were treated with only HS (Group IIIB). All patients were closely monitored for fever, pulse, blood pressure, central venous pressure (CVP), oxygen saturation, volume of fluid intake and urine output. Mannitol was given at a dose of 0.25-0.5 g/kg while the hypertonic saline was given as 3% saline to maintain the serum-Na within the range of 155-165 mEq/L. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of Glasgow coma scale, age, gender, and etiologic distribution between the groups.

Quality of life was evaluated by the OSA-18 questionnaire. Sleep architecture and OSA severity were measured by standard polysomnography. Between- and within-group comparisons were analyzed by non-parametric approaches and generalized estimating equations. Prediction of disease recovery was performed by multivariable logistic regression models. Group 1 children consumed fruit drinks with sugar, vegetables, sweets, chocolate, rice, and noodles more frequently than Control Group children. At baseline, the distributions of sex, weight status, OSA-18 scores, and polysomnographic variables were comparable between Group 1 and Group 2.

Furthermore, Group 1 no longer had excessive consumption of fruit drinks with sugar, chocolate, and noodles; however, food consumption frequencies did not change significantly. Notably, younger age and reduced intake of butter/margarine on bread and noodles were independent predictors of cured OSA in Group 1.

Biological (number of teeth at 8 and 18-20 months and enamel hypoplasia) and behavioral (brushing/cleaning, sweet snacks, breastfeeding, and dental access) factors were assessed using dental examinations and caregiver questionnaire responses at 8 and 18-20 months. Infant MS acquisition and caregiver MS levels were assessed from saliva and plaque samples collected at 8 and 18-20 months. Structural equation modeling evaluated the causal pathway with latent variables for biology and behavior. Mutans streptococci presence was similar between birth groups at 18-20 months (40% in VLBW infants and 49% in NBW infants), but was significantly higher for NBW infants at 8 months. Increased number of teeth at 8 and 18-20 months was associated with biological risk. Infants whose caregivers had a 1-point higher score on MS had a significantly (1.5) higher odds of MS presence. Caregiver behavior was not associated with MS presence.

Although the nature of BPT may seem benign, its recurrent episodes can mimic attacks of epilepsy and expose the infant to unnecessary hospitalization and adverse effects of inappropriate medications. There is no approved medication for the disease, but a few studies have suggested that cyproheptadine is useful. However, use of this agent has not been confirmed as effective for these patients, and the safe dosage for children aged <2 years has not yet been established. We report 4 patients who exhibited a successful response to treatment with topiramate (their episodes of BPT stopped). Considering the underlying relation of BPT with migraine, the satisfactory response of our patients to topiramate, and the safety of this medication in neonates and children, topiramate seems to be an effective and safe medication for the reduction and elimination of BPT episodes. In addition, 1 of our case subjects (patient 4) confirmed this finding by exhibiting an explicit dependence in the regularity and duration of her attacks with topiramate.

We conducted a survey to investigate the consumption and sources of dietary salt using the ""one-week salt estimation method"" by weighing cooking salt and major salt-containing food, and estimating salt intake during dining out based on established evidence. Nine hundred and three families (1981 adults and 971 children) with students in eight primary or junior high schools in urban and suburban Beijing were recruited. On average, the daily dietary salt intake of family members in Beijing was 11.0 (standard deviation: 6.2) g for children and adolescents (under 18 years old), 15.2 (9.1) g for adults (18 to 59 years old), and 10.2 (4.8) g for senior citizens (60 years old and over), respectively. Overall, 60.5% of dietary salt was consumed at home, and 39.5% consumed outside the home. Approximately 90% of the salt intake came from cooking (household cooking and cafeteria or restaurant cooking), while less than 10% came from processed food. In conclusion, the dietary salt intake in Beijing families far surpassed the recommended amounts by World Health Organization, with both household cooking and dining-out as main sources of salt consumption.

291,291,36074322,"Acute pancreatitis is a common indication for hospital admission, increasing in incidence, including in children, pregnancy and the elderly. Moderately severe acute pancreatitis with fluid and/or necrotic collections causes substantial morbidity, and severe disease with persistent organ failure causes significant mortality. The diagnosis requires two of upper abdominal pain, amylase/lipase ≥ 3 ×upper limit of normal, and/or cross-sectional imaging findings. Gallstones and ethanol predominate while hypertriglyceridaemia and drugs are notable among many causes. Serum triglycerides, full blood count, renal and liver function tests, glucose, calcium, transabdominal ultrasound, and chest imaging are indicated, with abdominal cross-sectional imaging if there is diagnostic uncertainty. Subsequent imaging is undertaken to detect complications, for example, if C-reactive protein exceeds 150 mg/L, or rarer aetiologies. Pancreatic intracellular calcium overload, mitochondrial impairment, and inflammatory responses are critical in pathogenesis, targeted in current treatment trials, which are crucially important as there is no internationally licenced drug to treat acute pancreatitis and prevent complications. Initial priorities are intravenous fluid resuscitation, analgesia, and enteral nutrition, and when necessary, critical care and organ support, parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, pancreatic exocrine and endocrine replacement therapy; all may have adverse effects. Patients with local complications should be referred to specialist tertiary centres to guide further management, which may include drainage and/or necrosectomy.

293,293,16551449,"In children with partial epilepsy, there is increasing evidence to suggest that not all cortical regions showing glucose hypometabolism on positron emission tomography (PET) represent epileptogenic cortex but that some hypometabolic areas might be the result of repeated seizures. Most of the supportive data, however, have come from cross-sectional imaging studies. To evaluate longitudinal changes in cortical glucose hypometabolism, we compared two sequential [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scans performed 7 to 44 months apart in 15 children with intractable nonlesional partial epilepsy. The extent of hypometabolic cortex on the side of the electroencephalography-verified epileptic focus and its changes between the two PET scans were measured and correlated to clinical seizure variables. The change in seizure frequency between the two PET scans correlated positively with the change in the extent of cortical glucose hypometabolism (r = .8, P <.001). Most patients with persistent or increased seizure frequency (one or more seizures per day) showed enlargement in the area of hypometabolic cortex on the second PET scan. In contrast, patients whose seizure frequency had decreased below daily seizures between the first and second PET scans showed a decrease in the size of the hypometabolic cortex. These results support the notion that the extent of cortical glucose hypometabolism on PET scanning can undergo dynamic changes, and these are, at least partly, related to the frequency of seizures. The findings have implications on how aggressively persistent seizures should be treated in children. (J Child Neurol 2006;21:26-31).

294,294,38177108,"Insulin resistance and glucose metabolism have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, in the metabolically more susceptible Asian populations, it is not clear whether the genetic burden of glycaemic dysregulation influences early-life neurodevelopment. In a multi-ethnic Asian prospective cohort study in Singapore (Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO)), we constructed child and parental polygenic risk scores (PRS) for glycaemic dysregulation based on the largest genome-wide association studies of type 2 diabetes and fasting glucose among Asians. We found that child PRS for HOMA-IR was associated with a lower perceptual reasoning score at ~7 years (β = -0. 141, p-value = 0.024, 95% CI -0. 264 to -0. 018) and a lower WIAT-III mean score at ~9 years (β = -0.222, p-value = 0.001, 95% CI -0.357 to -0.087). This association were consistent in direction among boys and girls. These inverse associations were not influenced by parental PRS and were likely mediated via insulin resistance rather than mediators such as birth weight and childhood body mass index. Higher paternal PRS for HOMA-IR was suggestively associated with lower child perceptual reasoning at ~7 years (β = -0.172, p-value = 0.002, 95% CI -0.280 to -0.064). Replication analysis in a European cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) birth cohort, showed that higher child PRS for fasting glucose was associated with lower verbal IQ score while higher maternal PRS for insulin resistance was associated with lower performance IQ score in their children at ~8.5 years. In summary, our findings suggest that higher child PRS for HOMA-IR was associated with lower cognitive scores in both Asian and European replication cohorts. Differential findings between cohorts may be attributed to genetic and environmental factors. Further investigation of the functions of the genetic structure and ancestry-specific PRS and a more comprehensive investigation of behavioural mediators may help to understand these findings better.

Metabolic disorders are the results of the body's chemical process. The changes in the chemical compositions could be determined by Raman spectroscopy. Therefore, in this study, we measured blood collected from children with obesity to show chemical changes caused by obesity disease. Moreover, we will also show characteristic Raman peaks/regions, which could be used as a marker of obesity, not other metabolic syndromes. Children with obesity had higher glucose levels, proteins, and lipids than the control ones. Furthermore, it was noticed that the ratio between CO and C-H is 0.23 in control patients and 0.31 in children with obesity, as well as the ratio between amide II and amide I was 0.72 in control and 1.15 in obesity, which suggests an imbalance in these two fractions in childhood obesity. PCA with discrimination analyses showed that the accuracy, selectivity, and specificity of Raman spectroscopy in differentiation between childhood obesity and healthy children was between 93% and 100%. There is an increased risk of metabolic changes in childhood obesity with higher glucose levels, lipids, and proteins in children with obesity. Also, there were differences in the ratio between proteins and lipids functional groups and glucose, amide II, and amide I vibrations as a marker of obesity. The results of the study offer valuable insights into potential alterations in protein structure and lipid composition in children with obesity, emphasizing the importance of considering metabolic changes beyond traditional anthropometric, measurements.

A secondary data analysis was undertaken of the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study, an ongoing longitudinal study. Data collected from a single 24 h dietary recall of 1905, 2 year-old children were used to calculate two food variety scores; a core food variety score (CFVS) and a fruit and vegetable variety score (FVVS). Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to identify those factors independently associated with the CFVS and FVVS. The mean CFVS was 7.52 (range 1&ndash;18) of a possible 34 food items or groups and the mean FVVS was 2.84 (range 0&ndash;10) of a possible 16 food items or groups.

301,301,8942007,"The usefulness of the peritoneal equilibration test (PET) in children is unknown. The relationship between transcapillary ultrafiltration and PET was investigated in order to evaluate the usefulness of PET in children. PET was performed on 14 patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. Their age and bodyweight ranged from 3.8 to 23.6 years and 10.2 to 55.8 kg, respectively. The patients were divided into two groups according to bodyweight; group A patients weighed < or = 40 kg (n = 7) and group B patients weighed > 40 kg (n = 7). There was no significant difference in the mean infusion volume per bodyweight between the two groups, but the mean infusion volume per body surface area was smaller in group A than in group B. Group A showed a more rapid equilibration of dialysate glucose and creatinine than group B. Higher normalized mass transfer area coefficients were evident in group A. In spite of the lower effective glucose gradient in group A, the transcapillary ultrafiltration capacity (TUFC) showed no difference between the two groups.

However, there is very limited evidence of the effect of food taxation in a real-life setting, as most evidence is based on simulation studies. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of the Danish tax on saturated fat in terms of changes in nutritional quality of the diet, that is, changes in saturated fat consumption, as well as other non-targeted dietary measures, and to model the associated changes in mortality for different age groups and genders. On the basis of household scanner data, we estimate the impact of the tax on consumption of saturated fat, unsaturated fat, salt, fruit, vegetables and fibre. The resultant changes in dietary quality are then used as inputs into a comparative risk assessment model (PRIME (Preventable Risk Integrated ModEl)) to estimate the effect of these changes on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and mortality. The tax resulted in a 4.0% reduction in saturated fat intake. Vegetable consumption increased, and salt consumption increased for most individuals, except younger females. We find a modelled reduction in mortality with 123 lives saved annually, 76 of them below 75 years equal to 0.4% of all deaths from NCDs. Modelling the effect of the changes in diet on health outcomes suggests that the saturated fat tax made a positive, but minor, contribution to public health in Denmark.

306,306,36968554,"Worldwide, 1.7 million children younger than 15 years were living with HIV in 2021. Only 52% of them had access to antiretrovirals (ARVs). Lack of age-appropriate ARV formulations (i.e. easy to swallow for young infants, acceptable taste) remains the main obstacle to the access to ARVs. Therefore, a strawberry-flavoured Abacavir/Lamivudine/Lopinavir/Ritonavir (30/15/40/10 mg) fixed-dose combination of granules in a capsule (4-in-1) for children living with HIV weighing 3-25 kg was developed. We assessed caregivers' perceived acceptability of the 4-in-1 compared with previous paediatric ARV formulations and factors influencing acceptability. This exploratory qualitative case study embedded in a phase I/II, open-label, randomized cross-over pharmacokinetic, safety and acceptability study (LOLIPOP) was conducted in three sites in Uganda (May 2019-October 2020). Thirty-six children weighing between 3 and 19.9 kg participated in the main study. We purposively sampled caregiver-child dyads according to weight bands, and conducted 20 semi-structured interviews with caregivers and 5 with healthcare providers. We triangulated these results with a quantitative acceptability questionnaire. We analysed interviews inductively using NVivo12 adopting a thematic analysis approach and acceptability questionnaires descriptively to assess concordance between them. All caregivers found the 4-in-1 formulation highly acceptable and easier to use than previous formulations (i.e. pellets/tables/syrup). Appealing taste, ease of administration, easy storage and children's acceptance contributed to acceptability despite structural challenges of food shortage and HIV stigma. Visible improvements in children's health and comprehensive and tailored healthcare provider support to overcome initial difficulties such as vomiting increased caregivers' acceptance. Concordant results from questionnaire- and interview-data confirmed high acceptability. Caregivers of children in all weight bands in this sample found the 4-in-1 granules highly acceptable compared with the pellets/tablets combination. Healthcare providers' support to caregivers allowed for individual tailoring of drug administration despite challenges such as food shortage. This enabled short-term adherence.

307,307,34902573,"Sugar overconsumption is linked to a rise in the incidence of noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. This increased incidence is becoming a real public health problem that is more severe than infectious diseases, contributing to 35 million deaths annually. Excessive intake of free sugars can cause many of the same health problems as excessive alcohol consumption. Many recent international recommendations have expressed concerns about sugar consumption in Westernized societies, as current consumption levels represent quantities with no precedent during hominin evolution. In both adults and children, the World Health Organization strongly recommends reducing free sugar intake to <10% of total energy intake and suggests a further reduction to below 5%. Most studies have focused on the deleterious effects of Western dietary patterns on global health and the intestine. Whereas excessive dietary fat consumption is well studied, the specific impact of sugar is poorly described, while refined sugars represent up to 40% of caloric intake within industrialized countries. However, high sugar intake is associated with multiple tissue and organ dysfunctions. Both hyperglycemia and excessive sugar intake disrupt the intestinal barrier, thus increasing gut permeability and causing profound gut microbiota dysbiosis, which results in a disturbance in mucosal immunity that enhances infection susceptibility. This review aims to highlight the roles of different types of dietary carbohydrates and the consequences of their excessive intake for intestinal homeostasis.

A positive association between SUA levels and the TyG index was detected by univariate analysis (p < 0.001). Furthermore, a nonlinear relationship was detected between SUA and the TyG index, whose point was 6.55 mg/dL. There was a positive association between SUA and the TyG index when the SUA level was greater than 6.55 mg/dL (β 0.17, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.27; P < 0.001).

We hypothesized that the relatively poor overall developmental outcome of surgically hemispherectomized HME patients as a group, compared to children undergoing hemispherectomy for Sturge-Weber syndrome or chronic focal encephalitis, is related to dysfunction of the structurally ""normal"" non-HME side and that PET would be helpful in the pre-surgical evaluation of HME patients with intractable epilepsy.

320,320,37073521,"The purpose of perioperative fluid management in children is to maintain adequate volume status, electrolyte level, and endocrine system homeostasis during the perioperative period. Although hypotonic solutions containing glucose have traditionally been used as pediatric maintenance fluids, recent studies have shown that isotonic balanced crystalloid solutions lower the risk of hyponatremia and metabolic acidosis perioperatively. Isotonic balanced solutions have been found to exhibit safer and more physiologically appropriate characteristics for perioperative fluid maintenance and replacement. Additionally, adding 1-2.5% glucose to the maintenance fluid can help prevent children from developing hypoglycemia as well as lipid mobilization, ketosis, and hyperglycemia. The fasting time should be as short as possible without compromising safety; recent guidelines have recommended that the duration of clear fluid fasting be reduced to 1 h. The ongoing loss of fluid and blood as well as the free water retention induced by antidiuretic hormone secretion are unique characteristics of postoperative fluid management that must be considered. Reducing the infusion rate of the isotonic balanced solution may be necessary to avoid dilutional hyponatremia during the postoperative period. In summary, perioperative fluid management in pediatric patients requires careful attention because of the limited reserve capacity in this population. Isotonic balanced solutions appear to be the safest and most beneficial choice for most pediatric patients, considering their physiology and safety concerns.

We examined whether GI and GL predict CV risk factors in children after 2 years of follow-up. Three 24-hour recalls were administered at baseline, and individual average daily GI and GL scores were calculated in a cohort of 8-10 year-old children. CV risk factors included body mass index z-score (BMIz), percent fat mass, triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Main analyses consisted of multiple linear regression adjusted for anthropometric, socioeconomic, and dietary factors. After 2 years, the highest dietary GL tertile compared with the lowest was associated with increased BMIz (mean difference [MD], 1.1; 95% CI, 0.88-1.31), fat mass (MD, 10.8%; 95% CI, 8.62-13.0), TGs (MD, 0.17 mmol/L; 95% CI, 0.07-0.28), and decreased HDL (MD, -0.13 mmol/L; 95% CI, -0.19 to -0.07).

Determine whether CSID can be detected with the 13C-sucrose BT without duodenal biopsy sucrase assay, and if the 13C-sucrose BT can document restoration of sucrose digestion by CSID patients after oral supplementation with sacrosidase (Sucraid). Ten CSID patients were diagnosed by low biopsy sucrase activity. Ten controls were children who underwent endoscopy and biopsy because of dyspepsia or chronic diarrhea with normal mucosal enzymes activity and histology. Uniformly labeled 13C-glucose and 13C-sucrose loads were orally administered. 13CO2 breath enrichments were assayed using an infrared spectrophotometer. In CSID patients, the 13C-sucrose load was repeated adding Sucraid. Sucrose digestion and oxidation were calculated as a mean percent coefficient of glucose oxidation averaged between 30 and 90 minutes. Classification of patients by 13C-sucrose BT percent coefficient of glucose oxidation agreed with biopsy sucrase activity. The breath test also documented the return to normal of sucrose digestion and oxidation after supplementation of CSID patients with Sucraid. 13C-sucrose BT is an accurate and specific noninvasive confirmatory test for CSID and for enzyme replacement management.

323,323,27446854,"Background. The European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition endorses serological diagnosis (SD) for pediatric celiac disease (CD). The objective of this study was to pilot SD and to prospectively evaluate gastrointestinal permeability and mucosal inflammation at diagnosis and after one year on the gluten-free diet (GFD). We hypothesized that SD would be associated with similar short term outcomes as ED. Method. Children, 3-17 years of age, referred for possible CD were eligible for SD given aTTG level ≥200 U/mL, confirmed by repeat aTTG and HLA haplotypes. Gastrointestinal permeability, assessed using sugar probes, and inflammation, assessed using fecal calprotectin (FC), at baseline and after one year on a GFD were compared to patients who had ED. Results. Enrolled SD (n = 40) and ED (n = 48) patients had similar demographics. ED and SD groups were not different in baseline lactulose: mannitol ratio (L : M) (0.049 versus 0.034; p = 0.07), fractional excretion of sucrose (%FES; 0.086 versus 0.092; p = 0.44), or fecal calprotectin (FC; 89.6 versus 51.4; p = 0.05). At follow-up, urine permeability improved and was similar between groups, L : M (0.022 versus 0.025; p = 0.55) and %FES (0.040 versus 0.047; p = 0.87) (p > 0.05). FC improved but remained higher in the SD group (37.1 versus 15.9; p = 0.04). Conclusion. Patients on the GFD showed improved intestinal permeability and mucosal inflammation regardless of diagnostic strategy. This prospective study supports that children diagnosed by SD have resolving mucosal disease early after commencing a GFD.

324,324,36079737,"Iodine is a mineral nutrient essential for the regulation of a variety of key physiological functions including metabolism and brain development and function in children and adults. As such, iodine intake and status within populations is an area of concern and research focus. This paper will review recently published studies that focus on the re-emerging issue of iodine deficiency as a global concern and declining intake among populations in developed countries. Historically, the implementation of salt-iodization programs worldwide has reduced the incidence of iodine deficiency, but 30% of the world's population is still at risk. Iodine nutrition is a growing issue within industrialized countries including the U.S. as a result of declining iodine intake, in part due to changing dietary patterns and food manufacturing practices. Few countries mandate universal salt iodization policies, and differing agriculture and industry practices and regulations among countries have resulted in inconsistencies in supplementation practices. In the U.S., in spite of salt-iodization policies, mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency is common and appears to be increasing. European countries with the highest incidence of deficiency lack iodization programs. Monitoring the iodine status of at-risk populations and, when appropriate, public health initiatives, appear to be warranted.

328,328,33752207,"Neonatal hypoglycaemia is a common metabolic disorder presenting in the first days of life and one potentially preventable cause of brain injury. However, a universal approach to diagnosis and management is still lacking. The rapid decrease in blood glucose (BG) after birth triggers homeostatic mechanisms. Most episodes of hypoglycaemia are asymptomatic, and symptoms, when they occur, are nonspecific. Therefore, neonatologists are presented with the challenge of identifying infants at risk who might benefit from a rapid and effective therapy while sparing others unnecessary sampling and overtreatment. There is much controversy regarding the definition of hypoglycaemia, and one level does not fit all infants since postnatal age and clinical situations trigger different accepted thresholds for therapy. The concentration and duration of BG which cause neurological damage are unclear. Recognizing which newborn infants are at risk of hypoglycaemia and establishing protocols for treatment are essential to avoid possible deleterious effects on neurodevelopment. Early breastfeeding may reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia, but in some cases, the amount of breast milk available immediately after birth is insufficient or non-existent. In these situations, other therapeutic alternatives such as oral dextrose gel may lower the risk for NICU admissions. Current guidelines continue to be based on expert opinion and weak evidence. However, malpractice litigation related to neurodevelopmental disorders is frequent in children who suffered hypoglycaemia in the neonatal period even if they had other important factors contributing to the poor outcome. This review is aimed to help the practicing paediatricians and neonatologists to comprehend neonatal hypoglycaemia from physiology to therapy, hoping it will result in a rational decision-making process in an area not sufficiently supported by evidence.

334,334,23536823,"Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the mammalian NAD+ biosynthesis of a salvage pathway and exists in 2 known forms, intracellular Nampt (iNampt) and a secreted form, extracellular Nampt (eNampt). eNampt can generate an intermediate product, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), which has been reported to support insulin secretion in pancreatic islets. Nampt has been reported to be expressed in the pancreas but islet specific expression has not been adequately defined. The aim of this study was to characterize Nampt expression, secretion and regulation by glucose in human islets. Gene and protein expression of Nampt was assessed in human pancreatic tissue and isolated islets by qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence/confocal imaging respectively. Variable amounts of Nampt mRNA were detected in pancreatic tissue and isolated islets. Immunofluorescence staining for Nampt was found in the exocrine and endocrine tissue of fetal pancreas. However, in adulthood, Nampt expression was localized predominantly in beta cells. Isolated human islets secreted increasing amounts of eNampt in response to high glucose (20 mM) in a static glucose-stimulated insulin secretion assay (GSIS). In addition to an increase in eNampt secretion, exposure to 20 mM glucose also increased Nampt mRNA levels but not protein content. The secretion of eNampt was attenuated by the addition of membrane depolarization inhibitors, diazoxide and nifedipine. Islet-secreted eNampt showed enzymatic activity in a reaction with increasing production of NAD+/NADH over time. In summary, we show that Nampt is expressed in both exocrine and endocrine tissue early in life but in adulthood expression is localized to endocrine tissue.

VAT via Magnet Resonance Imaging (MRI), cortisol awakening response (CAR) via multiple salivary samples, and SSB intake via multiple 24-hour diet recalls. SSB intake was divided into the following: low SSB consumers (<1 servings per day), medium SSB consumers (≥1-<2 servings per day), high SSB consumers (≥2 servings per day). Analysis of covariance were run with VAT and CAR as dependent variables and SSB intake categories (independent variable) with the following a priori covariates: sex, Tanner stage, ethnicity, caloric intake, and body mass index. The high SSB intake group exhibited a 7% higher VAT compared to the low SSB intake group (β=0.25, CI:(0.03, 0.33), p=0.02). CAR was associated with VAT (β=0.31, CI:(0.01,0.23), p=0.02).

338,338,11821824,"Due to technical refinements and steady advances in the development of highly sophisticated nutrient solutions consisting of optimal combinations of macronutrients and micronutrients, parenteral nutrition (PN) is now playing an important role in patient management. However, some PN-associated complications, such as catheter-related sepsis (CRS) and cholestasis, continue at high incidence, particularly in neonates. The objective of this study was to investigate the changing profiles of PN over the past 30 years in our department. The medical records of 893 children (225 neonates, 245 infants, 261 preschool-age children, and 162 school-age children) who were placed on PN for >7 days in our department were reviewed, and the following data were extracted: birth weight, underlying disease, indications for PN, PN delivery route, type of catheter used, duration of PN, substrate and energy intake, type of amino acid solution used, and incidence of complications including CRS and liver dysfunction. The results were analyzed by dividing the patients into 3 groups according to their basic stages in management of PN and consisted of group 1 (1970 to 1979), group 2 (1980 to 1989), and group 3 (1990 to 1999). The parameters were compared in each group. The total number of patients in each group showed no significant difference; however, the percentage of low birth-weight neonates increased in group 3. In group 1, 85% of PN was administered through the peripheral vein; in group 2, 51.2%; and in group 3, 9.7%. The total calorie and nutrient intake decreased in groups 2 and 3 compared with group 1, particularly regarding fat intake. In groups 1 and 2, commercially available amino acid solution based on the Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization formula was usually used as the nitrogen source, but in group 3, it was changed to an amino acid solution for children. CRS decreased significantly, particularly in neonates, and occurred at a rate of 45.4% in group 1, 10.7% in group 2, and 1.5% in group 3. The incidence of liver dysfunction also showed a decrease: 35.7% in group 1, 22.3% in group 2, and 18.0% in group 3. A multivariate analysis showed a strong relationship between PN-related liver dysfunction and the duration of PN, the presence of infection, and the type of amino acid solution used. PN via central venous catheters has been regarded as safe and effective treatment in pediatric surgical patients. Over the past 30 years, the incidence of CRS has decreased.

Individual EDCs were studied in detail, while humans' ""cocktail effect"" is still unclear. In utero, early postnatal life, and/or pubertal development are highly susceptible periods to exposure. Human epidemiological studies suggest that EDCs affect prenatal growth, thyroid function, glucose metabolism, obesity, puberty, and fertility through several mechanisms. Further studies are needed to clarify which EDCs can mainly act on epigenetic processes.

After analyzing the inclusion and removal of duplicates, only five studies were analyzed for the quality of evidence. With the analysis through the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system, it was possible to verify the very low level of scientific evidence on the effectiveness of gums containing only xylitol for the prevention of caries in children. The preventive fraction obtained varied between - 0.31 and 0.57 depending on the compared prevention strategy.

341,341,37264481,"Dental caries is a microbe and sugar-mediated biofilm-dependent oral disease. Of particular significance, a virulent type of dental caries, known as severe early childhood caries (S-ECC), is characterized by the synergistic polymicrobial interaction between the cariogenic bacterium, Streptococcus mutans, and an opportunistic fungal pathogen, Candida albicans. Although cross-sectional studies reveal their important roles in caries development, these exhibit limitations in determining the significance of these microbial interactions in the pathogenesis of the disease. Thus, it remains unclear the mechanism(s) through which the cross-kingdom interaction modulates the composition of the plaque microbiome. Here, we employed a novel ex vivo saliva-derived microcosm biofilm model to assess how exogenous pathogens could impact the structural and functional characteristics of the indigenous native oral microbiota. Through shotgun whole metagenome sequencing, we observed that saliva-derived biofilm has decreased richness and diversity but increased sugar-related metabolism relative to the planktonic phase. Addition of S. mutans and/or C. albicans to the native microbiome drove significant changes in its bacterial composition. In addition, the effect of the exogenous pathogens on microbiome diversity and taxonomic abundances varied depending on the sugar type. While the addition of S. mutans induced a broader effect on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) ortholog abundances with glucose/fructose, S. mutans-C. albicans combination under sucrose conditions triggered unique and specific changes in microbiota composition/diversity as well as specific effects on KEGG pathways. Finally, we observed the presence of human epithelial cells within the biofilms via confocal microscopy imaging. Our data revealed that the presence of S. mutans and C. albicans, alone or in combination, as well as the addition of different sugars, induced unique alterations in both the composition and functional attributes of the biofilms. In particular, the combination of S. mutans and C. albicans seemed to drive the development (and perhaps the severity) of a dysbiotic/cariogenic oral microbiome. Our work provides a unique and pragmatic biofilm model for investigating the functional microbiome in health and disease as well as developing strategies to modulate the microbiome. Video Abstract.

Blood glucose was sampled immediately after induction of anesthesia, prior to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), after separation from CPB, on arrival in the ICU, and the morning of the first postoperative day. Data were analyzed using Student's t-test for independent samples, paired t-test, and analysis of variance, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Although moderate elevations in blood glucose (mean less than 165 mg/dl) after CPB were present in Group A, significantly higher levels (mean greater than 250 mg/dl) were noted in Group B. No children were hypoglycemic (glucose less than 40 mg/dl). Glucose levels were normal in both groups on the morning of the first postoperative day despite patients' having received continuous dextrose infusions in the ICU and the presumed stress of emergence from anesthesia. Extreme postbypass hyperglycemia can be controlled by eliminating intraoperative dextrose infusions. Hypoglycemia, an unlikely event, can easily be avoided by regular blood sampling, which is facilitated by the routine placement of arterial catheters.

Correlation coefficients, the method of triads and linear regression models were used to investigate the relationship between intake of different types of sugar and urinary sugars. The correlation between usual sugar density calculated from multiple 24HDRs and the sum of USUC/Cr and UFRU/Cr (USUC/Cr + UFRU/Cr) was 0.38 (p < 0.001). The method of triads revealed validity coefficients for the 24HDR from 0.64 to 0.87.

We partly updated a formerly published systematic review and searched several databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and Clinicaltrials.gov) in May 2019. Summary measures were estimated as relative risks (RR) and standardized mean differences (SMD). The primary endpoint of our analysis was frequency of hypoglycemic events. Quality of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach. Eleven studies with a total number of 818 patients were included in our review. Meta-analyses indicated a potential benefit of CGM systems regarding the relative risk of a severe hypoglycemic event (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.29 to 2.04) and mean level of HbA1c at end of study (SMD -0.23; 95% CI -0.46 to 0.00). Certainty of evidence for effect estimates of these meta-analyses was low due to risk of selection bias and imprecision of the included studies. Qualitative analyses of the secondary outcomes of user satisfaction and long-term development of blood glucose supported these findings. CGM systems may improve glycemic control in children and adolescents diagnosed with diabetes type 1, but the imprecision of effects is still a problem.

The objective of this landscape review is to summarize these issues to help policymakers guide the planning and design of calcium fortification as a public health strategy. One challenge is the low bioavailability of calcium salts (∼20-40%); thus, large amounts need to be added to food to have a meaningful impact. Solubility is important when fortifying liquids and acidic foods. Calcium salts could change the flavor, color, and appearance of the food and may account for 70-90% of the total fortification cost. Safety is key to avoid exceeding the recommended intake; so the amount of added calcium should be based on the target calcium intake and the gap between inadequate and adequate levels. Monitoring includes the quality of the fortified food and population calcium intake using dietary assessment methods.

To determine whether the use of dornase alfa in cystic fibrosis is associated with improved mortality and morbidity compared to placebo or other medications that improve airway clearance, and to identify any adverse events associated with its use. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and abstracts from conferences. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Register: 23 April 2018.Clinicaltrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were also searched to identify unpublished or ongoing trials. Date of most recent search: 07 June 2018. All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing dornase alfa to placebo, standard therapy or other medications that improve airway clearance. Authors independently assessed trials against the inclusion criteria; two authors carried out analysis of methodological quality and data extraction. GRADE was used to assess the level of evidence. The searches identified 69 trials, of which 19 (2565 participants) met our inclusion criteria. Fifteen trials compared dornase alfa to placebo or no dornase alfa (2447 participants); two compared daily dornase to hypertonic saline (32 participants); one compared daily dornase alfa to hypertonic saline and alternate day dornase alfa (48 participants); one compared dornase alfa to mannitol and the combination of both drugs (38 participants). Trial duration varied from six days to three years.Dornase alfa compared to placebo or no treatmentDornase alfa improved forced expiratory volume at one second at one month (four trials, 248 participants), three months (one trial, 320 participants; moderate-quality evidence), six months (one trial, 647 participants; high-quality evidence) and two years (one trial, 410 participants). Limited low-quality evidence showed no difference between groups for changes in quality of life. There was a decrease in pulmonary exacerbations with dornase alfa in trials of up to two years (moderate-quality evidence). One trial that examined the cost of care, including the cost of dornase alfa, found that the cost savings from dornase alfa offset 18% to 38% of the medication costs.Dornase alfa: daily versus alternate dayOne cross-over trial (43 children) found no differences between treatment regimens for lung function, quality of life or pulmonary exacerbations (low-quality evidence).Dornase alfa compared to other medications that improve airway clearanceResults for these comparisons were mixed. One trial (43 children) showed a greater improvement in forced expiratory volume at one second for dornase alfa compared to hypertonic saline (low-quality evidence), and one trial (23 participants) reported no difference in lung function between dornase alfa and mannitol or dornase alfa and dornase alfa plus mannitol (low-quality evidence). One trial (23 participants) found a difference in quality of life favouring dornase alfa when compared to dornase alfa plus mannitol (low-quality evidence); other comparisons found no difference in this outcome (low-quality evidence). No trials in any comparison reported any difference between groups in the number of pulmonary exacerbations (low-quality evidence).When all comparisons are assessed, dornase alfa did not cause significantly more adverse effects than other treatments, except voice alteration and rash. There is evidence to show that, compared with placebo, therapy with dornase alfa improves lung function in people with cystic fibrosis in trials lasting from one month to two years. There was a decrease in pulmonary exacerbations in trials of six months or longer.

350,350,19366844,"Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism has been reported in the early phases of almost all iodine fortification programs, depending on prior iodine intake in the population, the amount of fortification, and the rate of change. The aim of the study was to monitor the effect of the Danish iodine fortification program on incidence of hyperthyroidism as measured by the incident use of antithyroid medication. We conducted a register study. Using the unique identification number of all Danes, we linked data from the Register of Medicinal Product Statistics and the Civil Registration register on an individual level. All dispensing of antithyroid medication from 1995 to 2007 was studied. The place of residency was used to divide patients into mildly and moderately iodine-deficient groups. We measured the incident use of antithyroid medication. In the region with moderate iodine deficiency, the number of incident users of antithyroid medication increased 46% in the first 4 yr of iodine fortification. The use increased the most among the youngest age group (younger than 40 yr) and the oldest age group (older than 75 yr). In the mildly iodine-deficient region, the number of incident users increased only 18%, and only in the youngest age groups (below 40 and 40-59 yr). After 4 yr of fortification, the incidence rates started to fall and reached baseline, for most groups, 6 yr after onset of fortification. This study shows that iodine fortification induced a temporary, modest increase in the incidence of hyperthyroidism as measured by use of antithyroid medication. A new steady state has not yet evolved.

Oral rehydration solution (ORS) is being used as a standard treatment for acute watery diarrhea for a long time. Our objective is to compare the efficacy of amino acid-based ORS ""VS002A"" compared to standard glucose-based WHO-ORS in infants and young children suffering from acute non-cholera watery diarrhea. It is a randomized, double-blind, two-cell clinical trial at Dhaka Hospital of icddr,b. A total of 312 male children aged 6-36 months old with acute non-bloody watery diarrhea are included in this study. Intervention arm participants get amino acid-based ORS (VS002A) and the control arm gets standard glucose-based WHO-ORS. The primary efficacy endpoint is the duration of diarrhea in the hospital. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) with the present ORS formulation has certain limitations - it does not reduce the volume, frequency, or duration of diarrhea. Additionally, the failure of present standard ORS to significantly reduce stool output likely contributes to the relatively limited use of ORS by mothers as they do not feel that ORS is helping their child recover from the episode of diarrhea. Certain neutral amino acids (e.g., glycine, L-alanine, L-glutamine) can enhance the absorption of sodium ions and water from the gut. By using this concept, a shelf-stable, sugar-free amino acid-based hydration medicinal food named 'VS002A' that effectively rehydrates, and improves the barrier function of the bowel following infections targeting the gastrointestinal tract has been developed. If the trial shows significant benefits of VS002A use, this may provide evidence to support consideration of the use of VS002A in the present WHO diarrhea management guidelines.

Lower insulin might promote endogenous lipolysis during meal absorption, which may facilitate fat loss.

Seven healthy, obese, exclusively breastfeeding women and 7 healthy, obese, nonlactating women were studied on 2 occasions according to a randomized, crossover, single-blinded design. Subjects received drinks providing ≈70% of the daily estimated energy requirement, of which 60% was either glucose or galactose. The primary outcomes were the rate of appearance (Ra) of glycerol and palmitate, and the secondary outcomes were glucose Ra, milk production, energy expenditure, and substrate oxidation. Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were lower (P < 0.05) and those of glycerol, palmitate, free fatty acids, and triglycerides were higher (P < 0.05) during galactose than during glucose feeding in both nonlactating and lactating women. During galactose feeding, glucose Ra was lower (P < 0.01) and glycerol, palmitate, and free fatty acid Ra were higher (P < 0.01) in both groups. During galactose feeding in all women combined, fat oxidation was higher (P = 0.01) and protein oxidation was lower (P < 0.01).

362,362,20158456,"Pediatric HIV is scarce in developed countries; 90% of pediatric HIV patients are in developing countries. In contrast, children represent 15% of the new infections in poor countries. Approximately 90% of the HIV-positive children do not have access to antiretrovirals (ARVs). Without treatment, 50% of the patients die before the 2 years of age. Efavirenz (EFV, aqueous solubility approximately 4 microg/mL, 40-45% bioavailability), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), is a first-choice pediatric ARV. To assure therapeutic plasma concentrations, the low oral bioavailability demands the administration of relatively high EFV doses. Aqueous EFV irritates the oral mucosa, causing a Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS). A triglyceride-based liquid formulation of EFV (30 mg/mL) is not commercially available worldwide, making the appropriate dose adjustment and the swallowing difficult. More importantly, clinical trials indicated that the oral bioavailability of this oily solution is lower than that of the solid one. Moreover, a relatively high inter-subject variability has been found. The present work reports the development and full characterization of a concentrated (20 mg/mL, 2%) and taste-masked aqueous formulation of EFV for a more appropriate management of the pediatric anti-HIV therapy. Formulations displayed high physicochemical stability over time under regular storage conditions. Release assays in vitro showed a burst effect (2 h) and zero-order kinetics later on (between 2 and 24 h), compatible with the oral administration route and release. Finally, taste tests performed by adult healthy volunteers indicated that the unique combination of flavors and sweeteners employed (i) reduced the intensity of the BMS and (ii) shortened its duration significantly. Overall results indicate that the cost-effective and scalable nanotechnological strategy proposed could enable the more convenient and compliant administration of lower EFV doses. Due to a better pharmacokinetic profile, this would result in similar plasma levels than higher doses administered in solid or triglyceride-soluble form. In this context, some reduction of the treatment cost can be envisioned. This could improve the access of less affluent pediatric patients to medication in poor countries.

We assessed the efficacy of FCM and the rate of post-infusion hypophosphatemia in a large cohort of children with IBD and IDA. All children with IBD with IDA treated with FCM over 5-year period were reviewed. Disease activity, biohumoral assessment and treatments were evaluated at baseline, 4-6 and 12 weeks after each infusion. 128 patients [median age at first infusion: 13 years] were identified, 81 (63.3%) were <14 years, 10 (7.8%) <6 years. Eighty-three children (64.8%) received one infusion, whilst 45 (35.2%) repeated infusions. A significant increase in Hb (p<0.001), iron (p<0.001) and ferritin (p<0.001) was observed 4-6 and 12 weeks post-infusion. Hb gain was unrelated to disease severity. Low baseline iron was the main predicting factor for repeated infusions (p<0.05). Three patients reported infusion reactions, none <6 years. Twenty-five children had low post-infusion serum phosphate (11 were <14 years, 3 <6 years). Two children developed severe hypophosphatemia.

368,368,12489072,"Multiple methods are used to determine insulin sensitivity. Most commonly used in children are euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance (FSIVGTT) with minimal modeling (MinMod). The parameters S(G) and S(I) of MinMod are related to insulin sensitivity and glucose effectiveness, respectively, but inappropriate modeling of glucose kinetics causes inaccuracies. Glucose tracer use may mitigate such inaccuracies, allowing use of multiple modeling approaches, including a 2-compartment model (2CMM). This study was designed to compare the 1-compartment model (1CMM) and 2CMM in a pediatric population. Twenty-three children were studied 4 times using FSIVGTT with [6,6] D(2) glucose. Glucose effectiveness and insulin sensitivity were calculated by 1CMM (S*(G1) and S*(I1)) and 2CMM (S*(G2) and S*(I2)). Indices were reliably estimated in 86 of 87 tests for 1CMM, but only in 49 for 2CMM. S*(G1) overestimated S*(G2), but they were positively related. S*(I1) and S*(12) were not different and were positively related. This suggests that inadequate modeling by the 1CMM has a smaller impact on glucose tolerance indices in children than in adults. Comparison with classical MinMod gave results analogous to those in adults (MinMod S(G) was larger than S*(G1), MinMod S(I) was smaller than S*(I1)). These results demonstrate significant differences in glucose effectiveness, but not insulin sensitivity, as measured by 1CMM and 2CMM in early adolescents. Thus, when insulin sensitivity is the primary interest, the 1CMM is more robust because its parameters are more reliably estimated than those of 2CMM and is the logical choice in pediatric population-based studies.

The signs, symptoms, and laboratory values of 51 patients with bacterial meningitis admitting to the Department of Pediatrics at Sendai City Hospital from January 1985 to December 1994 were analyzed in order to evaluate their prognostic value. The overall mortality rate was 3.9%. The incidence of neurological deficit on discharge was 31.4%. According to their prognoses, patients were divided into two groups: those who recovered with no detectable disabilities (good prognosis) and those who died or were left with neurological deficits (poor prognosis). An analysis of these groups using Fisher's exact probability test revealed that the following risk factors were associated with poor prognosis: 1) duration of fever (including the periods of relapse) for more than 10 days ; 2) abnormal findings on brain imaging, such as cerebral infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral abscess and subdural effusion: 3 initial serum CRP value above 16 mg/dl; 4) initial CSF glucose value below 12 mg/dl; and 5) initial CSF LDH value above 220 IU/l. Streptococcus pneumoniae infection carried the worst prognosis: the causal organism of both the two fetal cases was S. pneumoniae. The incidence of poor prognosis was also high in S. pneumoniae meningitis (60.0%), compared to those by Hemophilus influenzae (46.7%) and group B streptococcus (25.0%). In the cases in which causal agents were not detected, this incidence was as low as 10 percent, showing significant difference from cases in which causal agents were identified.

372,372,21660518,"Iodization of salt is an effective strategy to prevent iodine deficiency disorders. Recent studies, however, indicate that increasing the iodine intake in a population may give rise to an increased incidence of hypothyroidism, but the association has not been fully clarified. In Denmark, iodization of salt was initiated in 1998 because of mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the raised iodine intake on the nationwide incident use of thyroid hormone replacement therapy (levothyroxine) to treat hypothyroidism. Data on all use of levothyroxine was extracted from the Register of Medicinal Product Statistics during the period 1995-2009 and linked to other nationwide registers by use of the Danish identification number. Persons with previous thyroid surgery were excluded. In the studied period 71,565 incident users were identified. The incidence rate increased 75% in the moderately iodine deficient region (72.2 incident users/100,000 person-years in 1997 to 126.6 in 2008) and 87% in the mildly deficient region (86.9-162.9). When stratified by sex and age-group (00-39, 40-64, 65+) the largest relative increase was seen among women in the youngest age-group, where more than a doubling was seen. The mechanisms behind the increase may be a result of iodine-induced hypothyroidism, although a higher diagnostic activity with regard to thyroid dysfunction and intensified treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism may also play a role. Our findings stress the need for caution when initiating iodine fortification programs to keep the intake within the optimal range, and the need for continuous monitoring.

None of the children had pure temporal lobe epilepsy. Computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were normal in four of the eight children. The scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) showed lateralized interictal epileptiform abnormalities in all eight and lateralized ictal onset in five of eight. In seven children, interictal PET showed focal hypometabolism; the eighth child had focal, ictal hypermetabolism. ECoG at the time of surgery showed epileptiform spiking, slowing, and/or suppression of normal background activity that in every case corresponded to the focus on PET scan. The ECoG findings support the notion that in children with epilepsy focal metabolic abnormalities on PET correspond to electrophysiologically abnormal areas of cortex, which are presumably also the epileptogenic regions. Such areas can appear normal on anatomic imaging studies (CT and MRI). When ictal scalp EEG data are ambiguous or contradictory, PET provides a less invasive means than chronic grid or depth electrode recording for evaluating whether a localized epileptogenic area exists.

In this observational study, we assessed the utility of [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)-PET in understanding dystonia pathophysiology by revealing specific resting awake brain glucose metabolism patterns in different childhood dystonia subgroups. PET scans from 267 children with dystonia being evaluated for possible deep brain stimulation surgery between September 2007 and February 2018 at Evelina London Children's Hospital (ELCH), UK, were examined. Scans without gross anatomical abnormality (e.g. large cysts, significant ventriculomegaly; n = 240) were analysed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12). Glucose metabolism patterns were examined in the 144/240 (60%) cases with the 10 commonest childhood-onset dystonias, focusing on nine anatomical regions. A group of 39 adult controls was used for comparisons. The genetic dystonias were associated with the following genes: TOR1A, THAP1, SGCE, KMT2B, HPRT1 (Lesch Nyhan disease), PANK2 and GCDH (Glutaric Aciduria type 1). The acquired cerebral palsy (CP) cases were divided into those related to prematurity (CP-Preterm), neonatal jaundice/kernicterus (CP-Kernicterus) and hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (CP-Term). Each dystonia subgroup had distinct patterns of altered FDG-PET uptake. Focal glucose hypometabolism of the pallidi, putamina or both, was the commonest finding, except in PANK2, where basal ganglia metabolism appeared normal. HPRT1 uniquely showed glucose hypometabolism across all nine cerebral regions. Temporal lobe glucose hypometabolism was found in KMT2B, HPRT1 and CP-Kernicterus. Frontal lobe hypometabolism was found in SGCE, HPRT1 and PANK2. Thalamic and brainstem hypometabolism were seen only in HPRT1, CP-Preterm and CP-term dystonia cases. The combination of frontal and parietal lobe hypermetabolism was uniquely found in CP-term cases. PANK2 cases showed a distinct combination of parietal hypermetabolism with cerebellar hypometabolism but intact putaminal-pallidal glucose metabolism. HPRT1, PANK2, CP-kernicterus and CP-preterm cases had cerebellar and insula glucose hypometabolism as well as parietal glucose hypermetabolism. The study findings offer insights into the pathophysiology of dystonia and support the network theory for dystonia pathogenesis. 'Signature' patterns for each dystonia subgroup could be a useful biomarker to guide differential diagnosis and inform personalized management strategies.

To investigate efficacy and tolerability of nebulised hypertonic saline treatment in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) compared to placebo or other treatments that enhance mucociliary clearance. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched ongoing trials databases. Most recent search: 25 April 2022. We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials assessing hypertonic saline compared to placebo or other mucolytic therapy, for any duration or dose regimen in people with CF (any age or disease severity). Two authors independently reviewed all identified trials and data, and assessed trial quality. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. For cross-over trials we stipulated a one-week washout period. We planned to use results from a paired analysis in the review, but this was only possible in one trial. For other cross-over trials, we chose to treat the trials as if they were parallel. We included 24 trials (1318 participants, aged one month to 56 years); we excluded 29 trials, two trials are ongoing and six are awaiting classification.

388,388,33780391,"Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) or vaping use in adolescents has emerged as a public health crisis that impacts the perioperative care of this vulnerable population. E-cigarettes have become the most commonly used tobacco products among youth in the United States. Fruit and mint flavors and additives such as marijuana have enticed children and adolescents. E-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) is a newly identified lung disease linked to vaping. Clinical presentation of EVALI can be varied, but most commonly includes the respiratory system, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and constitutional symptoms. Clinical management of EVALI has consisted of vaping cessation and supportive therapy, including supplemental oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation, glucocorticoids, and empiric antibiotics, until infectious causes are eliminated, and in the most severe cases, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Currently, although there is an insufficient evidence to determine the safety and the efficacy of e-cigarettes for perioperative smoking cessation, EVALI clearly places these patients at an increased risk of perioperative morbidity. Given the relatively recent introduction of e-cigarettes, the long-term impact on adolescent health is unknown. As a result, the paucity of postoperative outcomes in this potentially vulnerable population does not support evidence-based recommendations for the management of these patients. Clinicians should identify ""at-risk"" individuals during preanesthetic evaluations and adjust the risk stratification accordingly. Our societies encourage continued education of the public and health care providers of the risks associated with vaping and nicotine use and encourage regular preoperative screening and postoperative outcome studies of patients with regard to smoking and vaping use.

The transition into young adulthood offers opportunities for adaptation and growth but also increased susceptibility to environmental perturbations, such as the characteristics of social relationships, family environment, quality of schools and activities, financial security, urbanization and pollution, drugs, cultural practices, and values, that all act in concert with our genetic architecture and biology. Our multivariate brain-behavior mapping in 7,577 children aged 9 to 11 y across 585 brain imaging phenotypes and 617 cognitive, behavioral, psychosocial, and socioeconomic measures revealed three population modes of brain covariation, which were robust as assessed by cross-validation and permutation testing, taking into account siblings and twins, identified using genetic data. The first mode revealed traces of perinatal complications, including preterm and twin birth, eclampsia and toxemia, shorter period of breastfeeding, and lower cognitive scores, with higher cortical thickness and lower cortical areas and volumes.

Consecutive case series. Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of a children's hospital. Six patients with ARDS secondary to sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome, who had persistent anasarca complicating their respiratory course despite intravenous diuretic therapy. Continuous flow peritoneal dialysis (CFPD) was instituted after percutaneously inserting two Tenckhoff dialysis catheters into the peritoneal cavity of each patient and tunneling them through the subcutaneous tissue to exit from opposite lower abdominal quadrants. A dialysis solution with 2.5% dextrose was administered continuously via one of the catheters at a rate ranging from 10-30 mL/kg/hr, and concomitantly drained via the other catheter. The concentration of the dialysis solution and rate of inflow were adjusted as needed to achieve the desired peritoneal outflow rate. CFPD was discontinued when adequate weight loss had occurred and the patient's daily urine output exceeded their daily fluid intake. The patient's overall fluid balance and change in weight were recorded daily. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio, alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, and oxygenation index were also calculated daily. Six patients with ARDS, mean age 18.7+/-37.0 months were mechanically ventilated for 8.0+/-4.0 days before CFPD, during which time average body weight increased to 63%+/-22% above admission body weight, despite the use of intravenous diuretic therapy.

Iodine requirements are higher in infants, children, and during pregnancy and lactation than in adult men and non-pregnant women. Iodine is available in a wide range of foods and water and is susceptible to almost complete gastric and duodenal absorption as an iodide ion. A healthy diet usually provides a daily iodine consumption not exceeding 50% of the recommended intake. Iodine supplementation is usually necessary to prevent iodine deficiency disorders (IDDs), especially in endemic areas. The community-based strategy of iodine fortification in salt has eradicated IDDs, such as endemic goiter and cretinism, in countries providing adequate measures of iodine prophylaxis over several decades in the 20th century. Iodized salt is the cornerstone of iodine prophylaxis in endemic areas, and the continuous monitoring of community iodine intake and its related clinical outcomes is essential. Despite the relevant improvement in clinical outcomes, subclinical iodine deficiency persists even in Western Europe, especially among girls and women, being an issue in certain physiological conditions, such as pregnancy and lactation, and in people consuming unbalanced vegetable-based or salt-restricted diets.

In a targeted analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in genes associated with intestinal barrier function related or not to inflammatory bowel disease, we did not find a significant association with intestinal permeability.

398,398,37337008,"Obesity is a common chronic disease in children and adolescents and its prevalence is increasing worldwide. The causes are multifactorial but involve biological predisposition towards a specific body-weight set point and defended adipose tissue mass converging with an obesogenic environment. Comprehensive treatment of paediatric obesity includes lifestyle modification therapy, anti-obesity medications (AOMs) and/or metabolic surgery. Lifestyle modification therapy used alone produces fairly modest weight loss for most youth with obesity. The emergence of new AOMs has changed the landscape of paediatric weight management, improving the outlook for youth with obesity. This Review briefly highlights obesity development pathways in youth and the role that pharmacotherapy can play in counteracting these pathophysiological forces. Here, results from adolescent AOM clinical trials published since 2020 are reviewed, including the safety, efficacy and tolerability of the newest treatments (glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and phentermine-topiramate).

399,399,25524846,"There is strong evidence for the use of the ketogenic diet (KD) in Dravet syndrome (DS). The purpose of this study was to evaluate both effectiveness and tolerability in comparison with various antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). 32 children (19 males) with genetically confirmed DS treated at our center since 1999 were analyzed retrospectively. Data collected from patients' files included type of mutation, age at treatment initiation and treatment lag, overall seizure frequency and frequency of different seizure types, especially prolonged seizures and status epilepticus (SE). Efficacy and safety of the KD were evaluated. In addition, the effect on seizure count was compared with that of various AED regimen and the vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Overall response to the KD was 70% at 3 months and 60% at 12 months. No SE occurred while patients were on the diet, and the frequencies of prolonged generalized and myoclonic seizures were reduced. No severe side effects requiring withdrawal of the KD were observed. Although the effect of the KD was independent of age at initiation, it had to be withdrawn due to noncompliance more frequently in solid fed older children compared with infants treated with the liquid ketogenic formula. The KD was not significantly inferior to the current gold standard AED triple combination of Stiripentol+Valproate+Clobazam (89%), Bromides (78%), Valproate alone (48%), Topiramate (35%) and VNS (37%) and significantly more effective than Levetiracetam (30%; p=0.037, Pearson's Chi-square). These data suggest that the KD ranks among currently used AEDs as an effective treatment for seizures in DS. According to our results (good effect on SE and prolonged seizures, good tolerability, less compliance problems due to formula treatment) the KD should be considered as an early treatment option in infants with DS.

400,400,10764130,"In a sub-population of Nigerian children in the southern rain forest of Edo State, we recently observed widespread relative insensitivity to the taste of sodium chloride (NaCl-salt). This prompted the present study, in which we measured taste recognition threshold to NaCl (30, 60, 120, 180 mM) and sucrose (15, 50, 100, 150 mM) in a group of fifth-and sixth-grade pupils in the northeastern semi-Sahel part of Nigeria, in order to observe the extent to which the findings cited above would apply to similar groups of Nigerians with different ethnic backgrounds in other parts of the country. Three hundred twenty-eight pupils (149 boys, 179 girls) from 9 to 18 years of age were involved. Five subjects were taste-blind to the highest concentration (180 mM) of NaCl. In addition, 44.5% of the study population did not taste NaCl until a concentration of 60 mm or higher was used. This distribution was influenced neither by gender (x2 = 2.75, df = 3, P = .43) nor age (r = .029, P = .60). In addition, only 33% of the population recognized sucrose sweetness at a sucrose concentration of 15 mm or lower. The remaining two-thirds of the population had sucrose threshold values of 50 mm or higher and neither gender (x2 = 3.09, df = 3, P = .379) nor age (r = .046, P = .41) influenced these findings. These results substantiate our earlier observations that relative taste insensitivity to salt (NaCl) may be common in Nigerian children. When compared to our earlier data, these results indicate that taste insensitivity to NaCl and sucrose may be more common in children in the northern parts of the country, thus suggesting that geographic location and ethnicity may be important variables in taste perception of NaCl and sucrose in adolescent Nigerians.

The aim of this work was to analyze the characteristics of the lactulose H(2) breath test (LHBT) in children with functional gastrointestinal symptoms according to more recent criteria. Seventy-two patients and 17 controls were enrolled. A questionnaire was administered regarding digestive symptoms (abdominal pain, bloating, vomiting, and bowel-movement disorders). A lactose hydrogen breath test was performed to rule out lactose malabsorption and a LHBT was used to measure the time elapsed between lactulose oral ingestion and an increment of H(2) concentration of 20 ppm over basal. There were no differences of age and gender between patients and controls. Mean time to 20-ppm change was shorter in patients (56.3 ± 3 min) compared to healthy children (74.7 ± 5 min), p\0.05. In 39% of patients, rise of H(2) occurred during the first 40 min after lactulose ingestion, and in almost all controls, an increment was observed between 50 and 90 min (p\0.05). Symptoms were unrelated to time to 20-ppm change. An abnormal LHBT was found in children with functional symptoms of the digestive tract, but the exact mechanism involved, accelerated intestinal transit or SIBO, needs to be confirmed by an additional method.

403,403,34499672,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder, with potential effects on offspring both genetically and through altered intrauterine environment. Metformin, which ameliorate hormonal disturbances in non-pregnant women with PCOS is increasingly used in pregnancy. It passes the placenta, and the evidence on potential consequences for offspring endocrine development is scarce. We explore the potential effects of maternal PCOS status and intrauterine metformin exposure on offspring steroid hormone levels. This is a follow-up study of 5-10 years old children from the PregMet-study-a randomized controlled trial comparing metformin (2000 mg/day) to placebo during PCOS pregnancies. Of the 255 children invited, 117 (46%) were included. There was no intervention in this follow-up study. Outcomes were serum levels of androstenedione, testosterone, SHBG, cortisol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, 11-deoxycortisol and calculated free testosterone converted to gender-and age adjusted z-scores from a Norwegian reference population. These were compared in i) placebo-exposed children versus children from the reference population (z-score zero) by the deviation in z-score by one-sample t-tests and ii) metformin versus placebo-exposed children by two-sample t-tests. Holm-Bonferroni adjustments were performed to account for multiple endpoints. Girls of mothers with PCOS (n = 30) had higher mean z-scores of androstenedione (0.73 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 1.06), p<0.0001), testosterone (0.76 (0.51 to 1.00), p<0.0001), and free testosterone (0.99 (0.67 to 1.32), p<0.0001) than the reference population. Metformin-exposed boys (n = 31) tended to have higher 11-deoxycortisol z-score than placebo-exposed boys (n = 24) (mean difference 0.65 (95% CI 0.14-1.17), p = 0.014). Maternal PCOS status was associated with elevated androgens in 5- to 10-year-old daughters, which might indicate earlier maturation and increased risk of developing PCOS. An impact of metformin in pregnancy on steroidogenesis in children born to mothers with PCOS cannot be excluded. Our findings need confirmation in studies that include participants that have entered puberty.

This study describes the use of 2D Shear Wave Elastography (2D SWE) in screening for CFLD in a clinical setting and explores its correlation to other indicators of CFLD. Furthermore, a relationship between liver stiffness and nutritional status, lung function and glucose tolerance was explored. A retrospective cohort study was performed at a pediatric CF center. Information was gathered from the patients' charts and the Swedish national CF registry. The patients included had been evaluated for the presence of CFLD by ultrasound and 2D SWE during 2018-2020. Demographic data as well as data concerning nutritional status, lung function and glucose tolerance were collected. Fifty-one subjects were included with a median age of 11 years. Four children who had biopsy confirmed liver cirrhosis had significantly increased liver stiffness. There was a statistically significant negative correlation between liver stiffness and vitamin D levels and FEV1% predicted respectively. Children with abnormal glucose tolerance had increased liver stiffness compared to their normal glucose tolerant counterparts. Measuring liver stiffness by 2D SWE is a reliable addition to CFLD screening with data comparable to the more conventional ultrasound investigation.

The AppSalt program is a school-based multi-component mobile health (mhealth) salt reduction program designed to tackle the high salt intake in China. This mixed-methods process evaluation was conducted to investigate the implementation of this program across sites, identify factors associated with the implementation, and collect evidence to optimize the intervention design for future scale-up. Mixed methods were used sequentially to collect data regarding five process evaluation dimensions: fidelity, dose delivered, dose received, reach, and context. Quantitative data were collected during the intervention process. Participation rate of intervention activities was calculated and compared across cities. The quantitative data was used for the selection of representative intervention participants for the qualitative interviews. Qualitative data were collected in face-to-face semi-structured interviews with purposively selected students ( The total number of families recruited for the intervention was 1,124. The overall retention rate of the AppSalt program was 97%. The intervention was implemented to a high level of fidelity against the protocol. About 80% of intervention participants completed all the app-based salt reduction courses, with a significant difference across the three cities (Shijiazhuang: 95%; Luzhou: 73%; Yueyang: 64%).

Alternatively, there may be a direct effect of a specific dietary factor, such as sodium, on mechanisms regulating blood pressure. The average daily sodium intake by children and adolescents exceeds recommended amounts. Despite the high sodium intake among children, there are few data showing that decreasing sodium intake lowers blood pressure. Children who do express blood pressure sensitivity to sodium intake also have related risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as a positive family history or obesity.

Current evidence on fruit juice and weight gain has yielded mixed findings from both observational studies and clinical trials. To synthesize the available evidence on 100% fruit juice consumption and body weight in children and adults. MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched through May 18, 2023. Prospective cohort studies of at least 6 months and randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of at least 2 weeks assessing the association of 100% fruit juice with body weight change in children and adults were included. In the trials, fruit juices were compared with noncaloric controls. Data were pooled using random-effects models and presented as β coefficients with 95% CIs for cohort studies and mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs for RCTs. Change in body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was assessed in children and change in body weight in adults. A total of 42 eligible studies were included in this analysis, including 17 among children (17 cohorts; 0 RCTs; 45 851 children; median [IQR] age, 8 [1-15] years) and 25 among adults (6 cohorts; 19 RCTs; 268 095 adults; median [IQR] age among cohort studies, 48 [41-61] years; median [IQR] age among RCTs, 42 [25-59]). Among cohort studies in children, each additional serving per day of 100% fruit juice was associated with a 0.03 (95% CI, 0.01-0.05) higher BMI change. Among cohort studies in adults, studies that did not adjust for energy showed greater body weight gain (0.21 kg; 95% CI, 0.15-0.27 kg) than studies that did adjust for energy intake (-0.08 kg; 95% CI, -0.11 to -0.05 kg; P for meta-regression <.001). RCTs in adults found no significant association of assignment to 100% fruit juice with body weight but the CI was wide (MD, -0.53 kg; 95% CI, -1.55 to 0.48 kg). Based on the available evidence from prospective cohort studies, in this systematic review and meta-analysis, 1 serving per day of 100% fruit juice was associated with BMI gain among children. Findings in adults found a significant association among studies unadjusted for total energy, suggesting potential mediation by calories. Further trials of 100% fruit juice and body weight are desirable. Our findings support guidance to limit consumption of fruit juice to prevent intake of excess calories and weight gain.

Twenty prepubertal children with epilepsy who were treated with topiramate were enrolled in the study. Topiramate was used at a daily dose of 5 mg/kg. Body mass index and fasting insulin-to-glucose ratio were calculated.

415,415,29659964,"Dietary iodine requirements are high during pregnancy, lactation, and infancy, making women and infants vulnerable to iodine deficiency. Universal salt iodization (USI) has been remarkably successful for preventing iodine deficiency in the general population, but it is uncertain if USI provides adequate iodine intakes during the first 1000 d. We set out to assess if USI provides sufficient dietary iodine to meet the iodine requirements and achieve adequate iodine nutrition in all vulnerable population groups. We conducted an international, cross-sectional, multicenter study in 3 study sites with mandatory USI legislation. We enrolled 5860 participants from 6 population groups (school-age children, nonpregnant nonlactating women of reproductive age, pregnant women, lactating women, 0-6-mo-old infants, and 7-24-mo-old infants) and assessed iodine status [urinary iodine concentration (UIC)] and thyroid function in Linfen, China (n = 2408), Tuguegarao, the Philippines (n = 2512), and Zagreb, Croatia (n = 940). We analyzed the iodine concentration in household salt, breast milk, drinking water, and cow's milk. The salt iodine concentration was low (<15 mg/kg) in 2.7%, 33.6%, and 3.1%, adequate (15-40 mg/kg) in 96.3%, 48.4%, and 96.4%, and high (>40 mg/kg) in 1.0%, 18.0%, and 0.5% of household salt samples in Linfen (n = 402), Tuguegarao (n = 1003), and Zagreb (n = 195), respectively. The median UIC showed adequate iodine nutrition in all population groups, except for excessive iodine intake in school-age children in the Philippines and borderline low intake in pregnant women in Croatia. Salt iodization at ∼25 mg/kg that covers a high proportion of the total amount of salt consumed supplies sufficient dietary iodine to ensure adequate iodine nutrition in all population groups, although intakes may be borderline low during pregnancy. Large variations in salt iodine concentrations increase the risk for both low and high iodine intakes. Strict monitoring of the national salt iodization program is therefore essential for optimal iodine nutrition. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02196337.

The ""Healthy China 2030"" Action Plan set the goal of reducing salt intake by 20% by 2030. However, salt intake in China is still at a very high level in the world, with adults reaching 11 g/d, more than twice the recommended limit of 5 g/d. The current policies and action plans of China have targeted catering workers, children, adolescents, and home chefs in salt, oil, and sugar reduction actions. However, there are still obvious deficiencies in the coordinated promotion and implementation. This study, therefore, proposed a set of comprehensive strategies (named CHRPS that is composed of communication and education, salt reduction in home cooking, salt reduction in restaurants, reducing salt content in pre-packaged food, and surveillance and evaluation) and key implementation points for further deepening the salt reduction action in China. These strategies were developed based on the main sources of dietary sodium for Chinese residents, the status of ""knowledge, attitude and practice"" in salt reduction, evidence of effective intervention measures, existing policies and requirements, and the salt reduction strategies of the World Health Organization and experience from some other countries. As a scientific reference, the CHRPS strategies will help the government and relevant organizations quickly implement salt reduction work and facilitate the earlier realization of China's salt reduction goal. 高钠或高盐饮食是导致我国居民健康寿命损失的第一位膳食危险因素。《“健康中国2030”规划纲要》提出到2030年我国居民食盐摄入量降低20%的目标。然而，我国居民食盐摄入量仍徘徊在很高水平，成年人为11 g/d，超过了食盐推荐量上限5 g/d的2倍。我国现行政策和行动计划已将餐饮从业人员、儿童青少年、家庭主厨作为减盐、减油、减糖行动的重点人群，具有很好的针对性，但在协同推进和落实力度上尚存在明显不足。为此，本研究基于我国居民膳食钠主要来源、减盐“知信行”现状、干预措施有效性证据、现有政策和要求，同时参考世界卫生组织和一些国家的减盐策略，提出了进一步深化我国减盐行动的综合策略（又称 CHRPS策略，包括宣传与健康教育、家庭烹饪减盐、餐饮业减盐、预包装食品减盐和监测与评价）和实施方案要点的建议。作为科学参考，CHRPS策略将有助于政府和相关单位快速落实减盐工作，支持中国减盐目标的早日实现。.

This paper compares these recommendations with current clinical practice in Europe. Questionnaires were returned by 194 paediatric respiratory centres caring for PCD patients in 26 countries. In most countries, PCD care was not centralised, with a median (interquartile range) of 4 (2-9) patients treated per centre. Overall, 90% of centres had access to nasal or bronchial mucosal biopsy. Samples were analysed by electron microscopy (77%) and ciliary function tests (57%). Nasal nitric oxide was used for screening in 46% of centres and saccharine tests in 36%. Treatment approaches varied widely, both within and between countries. European region, size of centre and the country's general government expenditure on health partly defined availability of advanced diagnostic tests and choice of treatments. In conclusion, we found substantial heterogeneity in management of PCD within and between countries, and poor concordance with current recommendations. This demonstrates how essential it is to standardise management and decrease inequality between countries.

The primary end point was effect on serum electrolytes and acidosis. Compared to 47 patients who received only NS (group A) throughout the recovery period and 33 patients who received NS but were switched to half NS (group B) at some point during recovery, 41 who received only half NS (group C) had a significant decrease in corrected serum sodium (P < .01). Hyperchloremia leading to nonanion gap acidosis was significantly greater in NS groups A and B than in half NS group C (P < .01). This led to increased duration of insulin infusion and length of stay in the PICU in the NS groups. Hyperchloremia resulting in nonanion gap acidosis can occur and may prolong the duration of insulin infusion and length of PICU stay in patients receiving NS as post-bolus rehydration fluid. Alternatively, the use of half NS may result in a decrease in serum-corrected sodium.

Ordinal regression was used to analyse the dependent variables of urinary iodine concentration. The urinary iodine concentration of non-iodized salt district was lower than that in iodized salt district (87 microg/L compared with 150 microg/L, u=7.296, P=0.000) ,whereas the amount of daily iodine intake in the two groups was 34.5 microg/d and 62.3 microg/d (u=6.925, P=0.000). The urinary iodine concentration of 58.6 % children in non-iodized salt district was below 100 microg/L. Age and iodized-salt intake were significant factors in the final regression model (P<0.05) with the OR of 1.119 and 3.238, respectively. The daily dietary iodine intake for children in Zhoushan island is insufficient, the iodized salt prophylaxis is necessary.

Diabetic ketoacidosis may be the initial manifestation of type 1 diabetes or may result from increased insulin requirement in type 1 diabetic patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the percentage of DKA death investigated by the Office of Chief Medical Examiner that was not associated with a known history of diabetes.Cases investigated by the Office of Chief Medical Examiner during a 6-year period whose cause of death was DKA were identified using a centralized database. To determine the percentage with known history of diabetes, investigation reports were reviewed for any documentation of this history. The toxicology reports of all DKA deaths were reviewed together with histologic slides, if available, for possible microscopic changes. Concentrations of vitreous glucose, vitreous acetone, and blood acetone were used to diagnose DKA in these autopsied cases.Nearly a third of all death from DKA (32 of 92 during a 6-year period) occurred in individuals who had no known history of diabetes, emphasizing the importance of regular physicals that include a check of glucose concentration, and especially if any warning signs are present.

Over the past 10-20 years, an alarming increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been reported from pediatric diabetes centers in North America and elsewhere in the world. Lifestyle factors responsible for the worldwide epidemic of overweight and obesity are responsible for the increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in adults and children. This article briefly discusses the diagnosis and major types of diabetes in children but focuses on aspects of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents, including demographics, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, screening, prevention and treatment. The identification of children at risk for type 2 diabetes and the implementation of community-wide preventive programs will be essential to reverse the tide. The availability of calorie dense ""fast foods,"" candy, and sugared soft drinks must be restricted in schools and other venues frequented by children. Parents must limit the amount of time their children spend watching television and playing computer games.

434,434,35140061,"To determine whether a smartphone application based education programme can lower salt intake in schoolchildren and their families. Parallel, cluster randomised controlled trial, with schools randomly assigned to either intervention or control group (1:1). 54 primary schools from three provinces in northern, central, and southern China, from 15 September 2018 to 27 December 2019. 592 children (308 (52.0%) boys; mean age 8.58 (standard deviation 0.41) years) in grade 3 of primary school (about 11 children per school) and 1184 adult family members (551 (46.5%) men; mean age 45.80 (12.87) years). Children in the intervention group were taught, with support of the app, about salt reduction and assigned homework to encourage their families to participate in activities to reduce salt consumption. Primary outcome was the difference in salt intake change (measured by 24 hour urinary sodium excretion) at 12 month follow-up, between the intervention and control groups. After baseline assessment, 297 children and 594 adult family members (from 27 schools) were allocated to the intervention group, and 295 children and 590 adult family members (from 27 schools) were allocated to the control group. During the trial, 27 (4.6%) children and 112 (9.5%) adults were lost to follow-up, owing to children having moved to another school or adults unable to attend follow-up assessments. The remaining 287 children and 546 adults (from 27 schools) in the intervention group and 278 children and 526 adults (from 27 schools) in the control group completed the 12 month follow-up assessment. Mean salt intake at baseline was 5.5 g/day (standard deviation 1.9) in children and 10.0 g/day (3.5) in adults in the intervention group, and 5.6 g/day (2.1) in children and 10.0 g/day (3.6) in adults in the control group. During the study, salt intake of the children increased in both intervention and control groups but to a lesser extent in the intervention group (mean effect of intervention after adjusting for confounding factors -0.25 g/day, 95% confidence interval -0.61 to 0.12, P=0.18). In adults, salt intake decreased in both intervention and control groups but to a greater extent in the intervention group (mean effect -0.82 g/day, -1.24 to -0.40, P<0.001).

The app based education programme delivered through primary school, using a child-to-parent approach, was effective in lowering salt intake and systolic blood pressure in adults, but the effects were not significant in children.

This study was designed to assess small intestinal and gastric permeability in patients with EoE and to see whether it differed from healthy individuals and patients with reflux esophagitis (RE). Gastric and small intestinal permeability was measured using sugar probe tests containing lactulose, mannitol, and sucrose. Lactulose-to-mannitol (L/M) ratios in the patient's urine were a measure for intestinal permeability, and total sucrose was a measure for gastric permeability. We analyzed samples from 23 patients with EoE, 20 RE, 14 normal upper endoscopy with gastrointestinal symptoms, and 26 healthy controls.

437,437,16531503,"Studies have shown that the effectiveness of programs or curricula may depend in part on who delivers the material. In adolescent health education programs, peer leaders are often recruited to implement programs because they are more persuasive to other adolescents than adults. Teachers also systematically vary how groups are constructed in school-based health education programs. This study compared the effects of three leader and group selection methods within the context of two tobacco prevention programs. Eight schools received a social influences program (Chips) and eight received a program with a multicultural emphasis (Flavor). Within these 16 schools 84 classrooms consisting of 1486 students were randomly assigned to one of three leader and group creation conditions: (i) leaders defined as those who received the most nominations by students and groups created randomly (random group), (ii) same as (i) but groups created by assigning students to the leaders they nominated (network), and (iii) leaders and groups created by teachers (teacher). One year follow-up data showed that main effects of the curriculum and network assignments were non-significant on smoking initiation when entered alone. Interaction terms of curriculum and assignment methods, however, were significant such that the network and teacher conditions were less effective than the random group condition with Chips, and more effective than random group condition with Flavor. These data show that school-based prevention programs should be evaluated in light of who implements the program. Even a peer-led program will be differentially effective based on how leaders are selected and how groups are formed, and this effect may be curriculum dependent.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) studies that evaluated brain structural, chemical and metabolite changes in methamphetamine subjects, or children with prenatal methamphetamine exposure, were reviewed and summarized. Relevant pre-clinical studies that provided insights to the interpretations of these imaging studies were also reviewed. In adults who used methamphetamine, MRI demonstrates enlarged striatal volumes, while MR spectroscopy shows reduced concentrations of the neuronal marker N-acetylasparate and total creatine in the basal ganglia. In contrast, children with prenatal methamphetamine exposure show smaller striatal structures and elevated total creatine. Furthermore, PET studies consistently showed reduced dopamine transporter (DAT) density and reduced dopamine D(2) receptors in the striatum of methamphetamine subjects. PET studies also found lower levels of serotonergic transporter density and vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) across striatal subregions, as well as altered brain glucose metabolism that correlated with severity of psychiatric symptoms in the limbic and orbitofrontal regions. Neuroimaging studies demonstrate abnormalities in brain structure and chemistry convincingly in individuals who used methamphetamine and in children with prenatal methamphetamine exposure, especially in the striatum. However, many important questions remain and larger sample sizes are needed to validate these preliminary observations.

To analyze whether the extent of cortex showing 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) or FMZ PET abnormalities correlates with the outcome of resective epilepsy surgery. Cortical FDG and FMZ PET abnormalities in 15 young patients (mean age, 12.2 +/- 7.0 years) with intractable partial epilepsy of neocortical origin were marked as regions with abnormal asymmetry using an objective semiautomated software package. These marked regions were then projected and measured on the brain surface reconstructed from the coregistered high-resolution MRI. Following cortical resection, the size of nonresected cortex with preoperative PET abnormalities was also measured (calculated separately for marked areas in the lobe of seizure onset as defined by long-term video EEG monitoring, and in remote cortical areas). Extent of preoperative PET abnormalities and postoperative nonresected cortex abnormalities on PET were correlated with outcome scores. Large preoperative FMZ PET abnormalities were associated with poor outcome (r = 0.57; p = 0.025).

No significant correlations between nonresected FDG PET abnormalities and surgical outcome were found. Extensive cortical abnormalities on FMZ PET predict poor outcome in neocortical epilepsy surgery. Resection of FMZ abnormalities in the lobe of seizure onset is associated with excellent outcome even in the absence of a structural lesion. In contrast, although FDG PET abnormalities regionalized the epileptogenic area, their size was not related to the extent of epileptogenic tissue to be removed.

446,446,3703566,"A comprehensive program review of Indonesia's Control of Diarrheal Diseases (CDD) program conducted in 1983 indicated that considerable success has been achieved in this area. Oral rehydration solution (ORS) is widely available, there has been community involvement, a strong managerial structure has developed, baseline data on diarrhea morbidity and mortality are being collected, and staff have received adequate training. At the same time, there have been some problems: inadequate use of ORS, a lack of coordination among CDD programs, insufficient surveillance, budgetary problems, and a lack of laboratory support. During the last 10 years, diarrhea mortality in Indonesia has been reduced by 50-70%, to about 20,000 (20% of child mortality). The Government has established the goal of reducing mortality from diarrhea to less than 1% of child deaths by the year 2000. A major strategy for achieving this goal is integrating family planning, nutrition, maternal-child health, immunization, and CDD programs. Another strategy involves improving research in this area. Areas for further research include: epidemiologic studies, rehydration treatment, antidiarrheal agents, social aspects, immunity and vaccine development, and laboratory examination. The cause of diarrheal diseases is not only enteric infection, it is indirectly caused by acute respiratory infection, malnutrition, measles and other systemic infection as well as the health knowledge and education of the mother. Priority is to be given to 7 areas of research: 1) the use of home-prepared rehydration fluids, 2) feeding practices during acute diarrhea that can prevent chronic diarrhea and malnutrition, 3) the determinants of progression to chronic diarrhea, 4) the impact of simple health information on hygienic and feeding practices on mortality, 5) the potential of using traditional birth attendants in ORS campaigns, 6) traditional attitudes and practices, and 7) the effectiveness of traditional medicines in diarrhea treatment.

Experimental and observational studies assessing the association between sodium intake and BP and involving children or adolescents between 0 and 18 years of age with any clinical condition were included. Out of the 6861 records identified, 51 full texts were reviewed, and 16 studies (10 experimental and 6 observational), involving overall 2902 children and adolescents, were included. Ten studies were conducted in children with elevated BP without identifiable cause, two in children with familial hypertension, one in children with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, one in children with chronic renal insufficiency, one in children with urolithiasis, and one in premature infants. A positive association between sodium intake and BP was found in all studies, except one.

We aimed to evaluate the long-term clinical effects of adding dry powder inhaled (DPI) mannitol in subjects with CF who are taking daily dornase alfa. We conducted a retrospective case-control study on subjects with CF. The effect of DPI mannitol was assessed by comparing DPI mannitol and dornase alfa combination with daily dornase alfa alone in children with CF during a 12-month period. The primary outcome measures of the study were absolute changes in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and FEV1 z-scores and the secondary outcomes included other spirometry indices, body mass index, frequency of pulmonary exacerbations, SPO Of a total of 28 patients who committed to use DPI mannitol treatments during the study period, five had a positive challenge with DPI mannitol and two were aged over 18 years. Therefore, the mannitol treatment group consisted of 21 patients. However, the effect of DPI mannitol was analyzed using 15 patients in the mannitol treatment group who received DPI mannitol for at least 12 months, and 18 patients who only used dornase alfa constituted the control group. The median absolute change in FEV1 between baseline and the third month; and baseline and the 12th month were significantly higher in the mannitol treatment group (p = 0.038, p = 0.004, respectively). When the groups are compared with respect to absolute z-score changes, all spirometry indices, except FVC at the end of 3 months, showed statistically significant improvements in the mannitol treatment group. Some secondary outcomes like pulmonary exacerbation frequency during the study year and median absolute body mass index z-score changes from baseline to the end of the study showed no significant differences between the groups (p = 0.735, p = 0.161, respectively). No colonization changes were observed in the treatment group. This study showed that in those patients who tolerated long-term (12 months) treatment with DPI mannitol and dornase alfa made greater improvements in FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, FEF25-75 z-scores than treatment with dornase alfa alone in children with CF.

462,462,3792257,"The discovery that a solution of salt and sugar is an excellent way to treat and prevent dehydration was an important advance in the primary health care field, as it was expected that mothers, even illiterate mothers, could easily learn to prepare the solution at home, thus preventing serious consequences of untreated diarrhea. In addition to the low price, an important quality of this simple solution is that it gives the mother a sense of responsibility and the knowledge that she herself can do much to alleviate the suffering of her children. Unfortunately, the pharmaceutical industry and chemists were quick to realize that big profits can be made from oral rehydration and to package ready-made solutions. Consequently, there has been a movement away from teaching the mother how to make a simple solution at home, using salt, sugar, and water. The responsibility for this situation needs to be shared by both the scientist and the health worker. Scientists seem to have some difficulty accepting the fact that simple can be good and better is not always best. By adding 1.5 grams of potassium chloride or 2.9 grams of trisodium citrate to improve the mixture, it becomes a medicine, which only can be given/prescribed/sold by health personnel or chemists. The improved formula is good in a clinic setting, but in terms of primary health care and self-help this is not the best approach. The solution is being put beyond the reach of the poor child, certainly in the rural areas of the developing world. All health workers should know how to prepare a salt-sugar solution and also should show mothers/parents/caretakers how to make it.

463,463,28230619,"Topiramate is a second-generation antiepileptic drug used as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in adults and children with partial seizures. A population pharmacokinetic (PPK) analysis was performed to improve the topiramate dosage adjustment for individualized treatment. Patients whose steady-state serum concentration of topiramate was routinely monitored at Kyoto University Hospital from April 2012 to March 2013 were included in the model-building data. A nonlinear mixed effects modeling program was used to evaluate the influence of covariates on topiramate pharmacokinetics. The obtained PPK model was evaluated by internal model validations, including goodness-of-fit plots and prediction-corrected visual predictive checks, and was externally confirmed using the validation data from January 2015 to December 2015. A total of 177 steady-state serum concentrations from 93 patients were used for the model-building analysis. The patients' age ranged from 2 to 68 years, and body weight ranged from 8.6 to 105 kg. The median serum concentration of topiramate was 1.7 mcg/mL, and half of the patients received carbamazepine coadministration. Based on a one-compartment model with first order absorption and elimination, the apparent volume of distribution was 105 L/70 kg, and the apparent clearance was allometrically related to the body weight as 2.25 L·h·70 kg without carbamazepine or phenytoin. Combination treatment with carbamazepine or phenytoin increased the apparent clearance to 3.51 L·h·70 kg. Goodness-of-fit plots, prediction-corrected visual predictive check, and external validation using the validation data from 43 patients confirmed an appropriateness of the final model. Simulations based on the final model showed that dosage adjustments allometrically scaling to body weight can equalize the serum concentrations in children of various ages and adults. The PPK model, using the power scaling of body weight, effectively elucidated the topiramate serum concentration profile ranging from pediatric to adult patients. Dosage adjustments based on body weight and concomitant antiepileptic drug help obtain the dosage of topiramate necessary to reach an effective concentration in each individual.

467,467,33084957,"The World Health Organization recommends reduction of salt intake to < 5 g/day and the use of iodized salt to prevent iodine deficiency states. A high prevalence of excess salt consumption and an inadequate iodine intake has been previously shown in an Italian pediatric population. It was appropriate, therefore, to analyse in the same population the relationship occurring between salt consumption and iodine intake. The study population was made of 1270 children and adolescents. Estimates of salt consumption and iodine intake were obtained by measuring 24 h urinary sodium and iodine excretion. The iodine intake increased gradually across quartiles of salt consumption independently of sex, age and body weight (p < 0.001). Median iodine intake met the European Food Safety Authority adequacy level only in teenagers in the highest quartile of salt consumption (salt intake > 10.2 g/day). We estimated that approximately 65-73% of the total iodine intake was derived from food and 27-35% from iodized salt and that iodized salt made actually only 20% of the total salt intake. In this pediatric population, in face of an elevated average salt consumption, the use of iodized salt was still insufficient to ensure an adequate iodine intake, in particular among teenagers. In the perspective of a progressive reduction of total salt intake, the health institutions should continue to support iodoprophylaxis, in the context of the national strategies for salt reduction. In order for these policies to be successful, in addition to educational campaigns, it is needed that the prescriptions contained in the current legislation on iodoprophylaxis are made compelling through specific enforcement measures for all the involved stakeholders.

Evidence suggests that secondary school students are frequent consumers of SSBs, with high daily consumption. The promotion of water consumption and provision of chilled water stations can reduce SSBs consumption. The Thirsty Choose Water! study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions, a behavioural intervention, Thirsty? Choose Water! behavioural intervention (TCW-BI), that target students through the domains of the health promoting high schools framework, and the second intervention is the installation and promotion of chilled water stations. This community trial will recruit 60 secondary schools from across three Local Health Districts (LHDs) within New South Wales (NSW). A two-by-two factorial study design will be used to determine the effect of the Thirsty? Choose Water! behavioural intervention (TCW-BI), and the installation of chilled water stations. The recruited secondary schools will be randomised and non-blinded to one of four study arms receiving either the TCW-BI or chilled water stations, both interventions, or neither (control group). Baseline measures will be collected including student self-report surveys which will gather data regarding knowledge, attitudes and consumption of water and SSBs, a school profile and an environmental scan. Student surveys will be repeated post the intervention and at follow-up. Regular water meter readings will determine the water flow from the chilled water stations across the study period. There is an increasing body of evidence which suggests that decreasing consumption of SSBs can impact positively on childhood overweight and obesity.

472,472,31209026,"The causes of obesity are complex and multifactorial. We propose that one unconsidered but likely important factor is the energetic demand of brain development, which could constrain energy available for body growth and other functions, including fat deposition. Humans are leanest during early childhood and regain body fat in later childhood. Children reaching this adiposity rebound (AR) early are at risk for adult obesity. In aggregate data, the developing brain consumes a lifetime peak of 66% of resting energy expenditure in the years preceding the AR, and brain energy use is inversely related to body weight gain from infancy until puberty. Building on this finding, we hypothesize that individual variation in childhood brain energy expenditure will help explain variation in the timing of the AR and subsequent obesity risk. The idea that brain energetics constrain fat deposition is consistent with evidence that genes that elevate BMI are expressed in the brain and mediate a trade-off between the size of brain structures and BMI. Variability in energy expended on brain development and function could also help explain widely documented inverse relationships between the BMI and cognitive abilities. We estimate that variability in brain energetics could explain the weight differential separating children at the 50th and 70th BMI-for-age centiles immediately before the AR. Our model proposes a role for brain energetics as a driver of variation within a population's BMI distribution and suggests that educational interventions that boost global brain energy use during childhood could help reduce the burden of obesity.

476,476,37751803,"Clinical cardiovascular health is a construct that includes 4 health factors-systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, total cholesterol, and body mass index-which together provide an evidence-based, more holistic view of cardiovascular health risk in adults than each component separately. Currently, no pediatric version of this construct exists. This study sought to develop sex-specific charts of clinical cardiovascular health for age to describe current patterns of clinical cardiovascular health throughout childhood. Data were used from children and adolescents aged 8-19 years in six pooled childhood cohorts (19,261 participants, collected between 1972 and 2010) to create reference standards for fasting glucose and total cholesterol. Using the models for glucose and cholesterol as well as previously published reference standards for body mass index and blood pressure, clinical cardiovascular health charts were developed. All models were estimated using sex-specific random-effects linear regression, and modeling was performed during 2020-2022. Models were created to generate charts with smoothed means, percentiles, and standard deviations of clinical cardiovascular health for each year of childhood. For example, a 10-year-old girl with a body mass index of 16 kg/m Clinical cardiovascular health charts based on pediatric data offer a standardized approach to express clinical cardiovascular health as an age- and sex-standardized percentile for clinicians to assess cardiovascular health in childhood to consider preventive approaches at early ages and proactively optimize lifetime trajectories of cardiovascular health.

Health care personnel delivering the dose were unaware of the study hypothesis. A total of 82 containers were obtained in this manner. Each container was labelled to contain 25 g AC and 48 g sorbitol. Five unused containers of ACS were obtained as controls. Each container was thoroughly cleaned, and the contents vacuum filtered and washed with 1 L of tap water. The tared filter paper and charcoal was dried for 24 h and weighed. The average amount of charcoal retained in each used container (retained) was 0.549 g (range 0.318-1.637 g). This accounts for 2.2% of the 25 g dose expected to be delivered. The average amount of charcoal found in each unused container (actual) was 25.892 g. The delivered dose (actual minus retained) may be calculated as 101.4% of the expected 25 g dose. When using this formulation of ACS there is no significant difference between the amount of charcoal given to an overdose patient and the amount ordered for gut decontamination.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a low-lactose, low-calcium diet on the bone mineral content (BMC) of prepubertal children with documented lactose intolerance. Radial BMC was determined by single-photon absorptiometry. Dietary intake was assessed by 24-h recall and two 3-day food records, and weight and height were measured. The group of lactose-intolerant children was compared with a group of healthy children of similar age, gender, race, and size and to the prediction equations based on body size from Chan's Utah children. Nineteen children, ages 9.6 +/- 1.9 years, participated in the study. They were relatively short compared with standards (height Z score, -0.30 +/- 0.83). BMC was 0.428 +/- 0.081 g/cm in the study group versus 0.440 +/- 0.116 g/cm in the comparison group (n = 19; p > 0.05). Both the study group and the size-selected comparison group had lower BMC than the Utah children.

However, few data exist on the risk of excessive iodine intake in this age group. Thyroglobulin (Tg) is a sensitive marker of iodine intake in school-age children and adults and may be used to estimate the optimal iodine intake range in infancy. The aim of this study was to assess the association of low and high iodine intakes with Tg and thyroid function in weaning infants. This multicenter cross-sectional study recruited infants aged 6-24 months (n = 1543; M Median UIC ranged from 48 μg/L (interquartile range 31-79 μg/L) to 552 μg/L (interquartile range 272-987 μg/L) across the study sites. Median Tg using dried blood spot testing was high (>50 μg/L) at estimated habitual iodine intakes <50 μg/day and >230 μg/day. Prevalence of overt thyroid disorders was low (<3%). Yet, subclinical hyperthyroidism was observed in the countries with the lowest iodine intake. Tg is a sensitive biomarker of iodine intake in 6- to 24-month-old infants and follows a U-shaped relationship with iodine intake, suggesting a relatively narrow optimal intake range. Infants with low iodine intake may be at increased risk of subclinical thyroid dysfunction. In population monitoring of iodine deficiency or excess, assessment of iodine status using UIC and Tg may be valuable in this young age group.

Therefore, the present study investigated the longitudinal relationship between multiple screen time and nutrient intake in children and adolescents. The present study was conducted utilizing 3 years longitudinal data. Study subjects were 740 Japanese children aged between 6 and 12 years at baseline and between 9 and 15 years in the follow-up. Screen-based sedentary behavior was assessed using screen time, including television (TV) viewing, personal computer (PC) use, and mobile phone (MP) use. The main outcomes were the intakes of nutrients. Mixed effect multivariate linear regression analyses were used to examine the longitudinal relationship between screen-based sedentary time and nutrient intake. Covariates included in the multivariable analysis consisted of sex, age, solitary eating, skipping breakfast, staying up late, and body weight status, as confounders, and physical inactivity, as mediator. In boys, a longer total screen time longitudinally correlated with higher intake of energy and lower intakes of protein, dietary fiber, minerals, and vitamins. In girls, longer total screen time longitudinally associated with higher intake of sucrose and lower intakes of protein, minerals, and vitamins. In boys, a longer TV viewing time was associated with higher intake of sucrose and lower intakes of protein, minerals, and vitamins. In girls, a longer TV viewing time was associated with higher intake of carbohydrates and lower intakes of protein, fat, minerals, and vitamins. In boys, relationships were observed between a longer PC use time and higher intakes of energy as well as lower intakes of protein, minerals, and vitamins. Relationship was observed between longer PC use time and lower intakes of minerals in girls.

The primary outcome measure was the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score. Twenty-five (25) children and adolescents received topiramate, with a mean final dose of 126 mg/day (range, 25-350 mg).

483,483,29597877,"The dual sugar absorption test, specifically the lactulose:mannitol test, is used to assess gut health. Lactulose absorption is said to represent gut damage and mannitol absorption is used as a measure of normal small bowel function and serves as normalizing factor for lactulose. A underappreciated limitation of this common understanding of the lactulose:mannitol test is that mannitol is not absorbed to any substantial extent by a transcellular process. Additionally, this interpretation of lactulose:mannitol is not consistent with current understanding of paracellular pathways, where three pathway types exist: pore, leak, and unrestricted. Pore and leak pathways are regulated biological constructions of the small bowel barrier, and unrestricted pathways represent micropathological damage. We analyzed 2334 lactulose:mannitol measurements rigorously collected from 622 young rural Malawian children at high risk for poor gut health in light of the pathway model. An alternative method of normalizing for gut length utilizing autopsy data is described. In our population, absorbed lactulose and mannitol are strongly correlated, r = 0.68 P <0.0001, suggesting lactulose and mannitol are traversing the gut barrier via the same pathways. Considering measurements where pore pathways predominate, mannitol flux is about 14 times that of lactulose. As more leak pathways are present, this differential flux mannitol:lactulose falls to 8:1 and when increased numbers of unrestricted pathways are present, the differential flux of mannitol:lactulose is 6:1. There was no substantial correlation between the lactulose:mannitol and linear growth. Given that mannitol will always pass through a given pathway at a rate at least equal to that of lactulose, and lactulose absorption is a composite measure of flux through both physiologic and pathologic pathways, we question the utility of the lactulose:mannitol test. We suggest using lactulose alone is as informative as lactulose:mannitol in a sugar absorption testing in subclinical gut inflammation. Impact statement Our work integrates the standard interpretation of the lactulose:mannitol test (L:M), with mechanistic insight of intestinal permeability. There are three paracellular pathways in the gut epithelium; pore, leak, and unrestricted. Using thousands of L:M measurements from rural Malawian children at risk for increased intestinal permeability, we predict the differential flux of L and M through the pathways. Our findings challenge the traditional notions that little L is absorbed through a normal epithelial barrier and that M is a normalizing factor for L. Our observations are consistent with pore pathways allowing only M to pass. And that substantial amounts of L and M pass through leak pathways which are normal, regulated, cell-junctional adaptations. So M is a composite measure of all pathways, and L is not a measure solely of pathologic gut damage. Using L alone as a probe will yield more information about gut health than L:M.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the intake of salt in children and to assess its impact on BP taking into account gender and nutritional status. A total of 298 children aged 8-9 years were evaluated in a cross-sectional study. Anthropometric measurements and 24-h ambulatory monitoring were performed, and salt intake was determined by 24-h urinary sodium excretion. The average estimated salt intake among the entire cohort of children enrolled in the study was 6.5 ± 2.2 g/day, and it was significantly higher in boys than in girls (6.8 ± 2.4 vs. 6.1 ± 1.9 g/day, respectively; p = 0.018) and in overweight/obese children than in normal weight children (6.8 ± 2.4 vs. 6.1 ± 2.0 g/day, respectively; p = 0.006). Salt intake exceeded the upper limit of the US Dietary Reference Intake in 72% of children. Daytime systolic BP increased by 1.00 mmHg (95% confidence interval 0.40-1.59) per gram of daily salt intake in overweight/obese boys, but not in normal weight boys or in girls. Our results demonstrate an extremely high salt intake among 8- to 9-year-old Portuguese children. Higher salt intake was associated with higher systolic BP in boys, specifically in those who were overweight/obese. Longitudinal studies are needed to further evaluate the causal relationship between obesity and high BP and the mechanism by which salt intake modulates this relationship.

485,485,35684009,"Iodine deficiency is an ongoing problem. The implementation of salt iodization has significantly reduced the effects of iodine deficiency worldwide in recent years, and the remaining iodine deficiency is mild to moderate. Iodine is an essential substrate for the synthesis of thyroid hormones in the thyroid gland. It can also act as an antioxidant, as well as an anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic factor. Pregnant women, breastfeeding women, and children are particularly affected by iodine deficiency. It leads to thyroid diseases and metabolic and developmental disorders, as well as cancer. However, an excessive iodine intake may, similarly to iodine deficiency, lead to the development of goiter, and toxic amounts of iodine can lead to thyroiditis, hyperthyroidism, and hypothyroidism, and even to the development of papillary thyroid cancer. Correcting iodine deficiency potentially reduces the chance of developing malignancies. Additional research is needed to better understand both the effect of iodine on carcinogenesis and the clinical outcome of iodine deficiency compensation on cancer patients' prognosis. The upcoming public health challenge appears to be reducing salt consumption, which could result in a lower iodine intake. Thus, an iodine enrichment vehicle other than salt could be considered if salt iodine levels are not increased to compensate, and urine iodine levels should be monitored more frequently.

Secondary outcomes were CVD incidence and mortality. During an average of 18.5 years of follow-up, 3447 (22.3%) participants with incident CVD and 7638 (49.3%) deaths were documented. After multivariable adjustment, when comparing the categories of lowest intake of beverages with the highest intake, the pooled hazard ratios for all cause mortality were 1.20 (95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.37) for sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs), 0.96 (0.86 to 1.07) for artificially sweetened beverages (ASBs), 0.98 (0.90 to 1.06) for fruit juice, 0.74 (0.63 to 0.86) for coffee, 0.79 (0.71 to 0.89) for tea, 0.77 (0.70 to 0.85) for plain water, 0.88 (0.80 to 0.96) for low fat milk, and 1.20 (0.99 to 1.44) for full fat milk.

Replacing SSBs with ABSs was significantly associated with lower all cause mortality and CVD mortality, and replacing SSBs, ASBs, fruit juice, or full fat milk with coffee, tea, or plain water was consistently associated with lower all cause mortality. Individual beverages showed divergent associations with all cause mortality and CVD outcomes among adults with type 2 diabetes. Higher intake of SSBs was associated with higher all cause mortality and CVD incidence and mortality, whereas intakes of coffee, tea, plain water, and low fat milk were inversely associated with all cause mortality.

A new regulation introduced in 1996, specified 25 mg KI/kg of salt resulting in an increase of median UIC to 248 μg/L. Afterwards, goiter prevalence was only assessed in two small studies. Methods In this study, we investigated the prevalence and etiology of goiter in 3594 schoolchildren 17 years after an increase in salt iodization in Croatia. Thyroid size was determined by palpation in 1777 girls and 1817 boys aged 10-18 years. In goitrous children, a thyroid ultrasound and thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine (fT4), free triiodothyronine (fT3), thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (TG) antibody measurements were performed. Results Goiter was found in 32 children (0.89% vs. 2.8% in 1991, p<0.00001 and 27% in 1995, p<0.00001), simple goiter (SG) in 18/32 (56%) goitrous children vs. 126/152 (82.8%) in 1991 p<0.00001, autoimmune thyroiditis (AT) in 13/32 (40.6%) vs. 19/152 (12.5%) in 1991 p<0.0009, nodules in four: two cysts, toxic adenoma and carcinoma (in 1991 two adenomas and one cyst), Graves' disease was not found (four in 1991). Subclinical hypothyroidism was found in three children. Thyroid disease was diagnosed in four of 32 children before the investigation. Increased iodine supply decreased goiter prevalence and SG/AT ratio in goitrous patients. Conclusions As thyroid abnormalities were found in 0.89% of children and some required treatment, thyroid examination is important in apparently healthy children regardless of sufficient iodization.

491,491,26908961,"To describe changes in household access to iodized salt in relation to socioeconomic factors. We extracted data on iodized household salt from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys conducted in 2000 and 2010. As part of the surveys, household salt samples were tested for iodization by standardized rapid-test kits that yield results to indicate whether salt is not iodized, inadequately iodized, (less than 15 parts per million, ppm), or adequately iodized (more than 15 ppm). We calculated indices of household salt iodization in 2000 and 2010, taking into account survey sampling weights. We explored associations between these indices and socioeconomic variables, both within and between countries. We analysed data from 105 162 households in 2000 and 144 018 households in 2010. Between 2000 and 2010, household coverage of adequately iodized salt increased by 6.1% (from 46.3% to 52.4%) on average, but with regional differences: coverage fell by 13.0% (from 77.5% to 64.5%) in the Central African Republic but improved by 40.4% (from 22.2% to 62.6%) in Sierra Leone. Improvements in coverage were higher in rural areas and among the poorest households, but within-country socioeconomic disparities remained. There were weak associations between changes in salt iodization and national level socioeconomic indicators. Overall, the coverage of adequately iodized household salt increased over the last decade. However, the changes varied widely among countries. The goal of universal salt iodization is still distant for many countries and requires renewed efforts by governments, bilateral and multilateral agencies and civil society. Décrire les changements survenus dans l'accès des ménages à du sel iodé par rapport à divers facteurs socioéconomiques. Nous avons extrait des données sur le sel de cuisine iodé d'enquêtes par grappes à indicateurs multiples menées en 2000 et 2010. Dans le cadre de ces enquêtes, l'iodation d'échantillons de sel de cuisine a été évaluée à l'aide de kits de tests rapides standardisés qui ont permis d'obtenir des résultats indiquant que le sel n'est pas iodé, insuffisamment iodé (moins de 15 parties par million, ppm) ou suffisamment iodé (plus de 15 ppm). Nous avons calculé les indices d'iodation du sel de cuisine en 2000 et 2010 en tenant compte des poids d'échantillonnage des enquêtes. Nous avons examiné les liens entre ces indices et plusieurs variables socioéconomiques dans et entre les pays. Nous avons analysé des données provenant de 105 162 ménages en 2000 et 144 018 ménages en 2010. Entre 2000 et 2010, le nombre de ménages consommant du sel suffisamment iodé a augmenté de 6,1% (de 46,3% à 52,4%) en moyenne, mais des différences régionales ont été constatées: ce taux a baissé de 13,0% (de 77,5% à 64,5%) en République centrafricaine, mais a augmenté de 40,4% (de 22,2% à 62,6%) en Sierra Leone. Il a été noté que les améliorations étaient plus importantes dans les zones rurales et au sein des ménages les plus pauvres, mais que des disparités socioéconomiques subsistaient au sein des pays. Les liens entre les changements dans l'iodation du sel et les indicateurs socioéconomiques au niveau national se sont révélés faibles. Dans l'ensemble, l'accès à du sel de cuisine suffisamment iodé s'est amélioré au cours de la dernière décennie. Il a cependant été observé que les changements variaient considérablement d'un pays à l'autre. Dans de nombreux pays, l'objectif de l'iodation universelle du sel est loin d'être atteint et exige des gouvernements, des organismes bilatéraux et multilatéraux et de la société civile qu'ils renouvellent leurs efforts. Describir los cambios del acceso doméstico a sal yodada en relación con factores socioeconómicos. Se extrajeron datos sobre la sal doméstica yodada de encuestas de indicadores múltiples a nivel de grupos realizadas en 2000 y 2010. Como parte de las encuestas, se analizaron las muestras de sal doméstica para comprobar su yodación mediante kits de pruebas rápidas estandarizadas, cuyos resultados indicaron si la sal no estaba yodada, estaba insuficientemente yodada, menos de 15 partes por millón (ppm) o suficientemente yodada (más de 15 ppm). Se calcularon los índices de yodación de la sal doméstica en el 2000 y el 2010, teniendo en cuenta las ponderaciones de muestreo de las encuestas. Se exploraron las relaciones entre dichos índices y las variables socioeconómicas, tanto a nivel nacional como entre países. Se analizaron los datos de 105 162 hogares en el año 2000 y 144 018 en el año 2010. Entre el 2000 y 2010, la cobertura doméstica de sal suficientemente yodada aumentó un 6,1% (de un 46,3% a un 52,4%) de media, pero con diferencias regionales: la cobertura cayó un 13,0% (de un 77,5% a un 64,5%) en la República Centroafricana, pero mejoró un 40,4% (de un 22,2% a un 62,6%) en Sierra Leona. Las mejoras de la cobertura fueron mayores en zonas rurales y entre los hogares más pobres, pero las disparidades socioeconómicas nacionales se mantuvieron. Había una pequeña relación entre los cambios de la yodación de la sal y los indicadores socioeconómicos nacionales. En general, la cobertura de sal doméstica suficientemente yodada ha aumentado durante la última década. No obstante, los cambios son muy diferentes entre países. El objetivo de la yodación universal de la sal sigue siendo lejano en muchos países y requiere de nuevos esfuerzos por parte de los gobiernos, los organismos bilaterales y multilaterales y la sociedad civil. وصف التغييرات في مدى تيسر سبل حصول الأُسر على الملح المعزز باليود فيما يتعلق بالعوامل الاجتماعية والاقتصادية. قمنا باستخلاص البيانات الخاصة بالملح المعزز باليود المتداول في المنازل من واقع المسوحات العنقودية متعددة المؤشرات التي أُجريت بين عاميّ 2000 و2010. وفي إطار هذه المسوحات، فقد تم اختبار عينات الملح المتداول في المنازل للكشف عن درجة المعالجة باليود باستخدام أدوات موحدة لإجراء الاختبارات السريعة، التي تعطي نتائج لبيان ما إذا كان الملح لم يخضع للمعالجة باليود، أو تمت معالجته على نحو غير كافٍ (أي يحتوي على أقل من 15  قمنا بتحليل البيانات الصادرة عن 105 162  بشكل إجمالي، زادت نسبة الحصول على الملح المعزز باليود المتداول في المنازل بشكل كافٍ على مدار العقد الماضي. ومع ذلك، فقد تباينت التغييرات بشكل كبير بين الدول. ولا يزال الهدف من معالجة الملح باليود بعيد المنال بالنسبة للعديد من البلدان ويتطلب بذل جهود جديدة من جانب الحكومات، والوكالات الثنائية ومتعددة الأطراف، والمجتمع المدني. 旨在说明家用碘盐普及情况的变化与社会经济因素的相关性。. 我们从 2000 年至 2010 年进行的多指标类集调查中提取了家庭摄取碘盐的数据。作为调查的一部分，通过标准化的快速检测试剂盒检测家用盐，验证是否为碘盐、碘含量不足，少于 15 ppm 或充分加碘（超过 15 ppm）。 考虑到调查抽样权重，我们计算了 2000 年至 2010 年家庭食盐加碘指数。 我们研究了在国家内部和国家之间这些指标与社会经济变量的相关性。. 我们分析了从 2000 年的 105 162 户家庭到 2010 年的 144 018 户家庭的调查数据。在 2000 年至 2010 之间，充分加碘盐的覆盖率上升了 6.1%（从 46.3% 到 52.4%），但是仍有地区差异：中非共和国充分含碘盐的覆盖率下降了 13.0％（从 77.5％ 到 64.5％），塞拉利昂的覆盖率却上升了 40.4％（从 22.2％ 上升到 62.6％）。农村地区和最贫困家庭充分含碘盐覆盖率提高了，但是国家内部的社会经济差距依然存在。 加碘盐的变化与国家社会经济指标之间的关联性不强。. 总而言之，过去十年充分含碘的家用盐覆盖率上升了。 然而，不同国家之间变化的差异很大。 对于许多国家而言，全民食盐加碘的目标仍然遥不可及，需要政府、双边和多边机构以及民间社团作出新的努力。. Описать изменения, произошедшие в семьях в отношении доступа к иодированной соли в связи с социально-экономическими факторами. Данные по потреблению иодированной соли семействами были взяты из многоиндикаторных кластерных обследований, проведенных в 2000 и 2010 годах. В рамках этих обследований образцы соли, употребляемой в домашнем хозяйстве, проверялись на содержание иода с помощью стандартных наборов для экспресс-тестирования, которые показывают, является ли соль неиодированной, недостаточно иодированной (менее 15 частей на миллион) или достаточно иодированной (более 15 частей на миллион). С учетом весовых коэффициентов пробы были рассчитаны показатели йодирования домашней соли в 2000 и 2010 годах. Были изучены связи между этими показателями и социально-экономическими переменными как внутри стран, так и между странами. Нами были проанализированы данные для 105 162 семейств в 2000 году и для 144 018 семейств в 2010 году. В период между 2000 и 2010 годами доля семейств, пользовавшихся достаточно иодированной солью, выросла в среднем на 6,1% (с 46,3 до 52,4%), но при этом были выявлены региональные отличия: доля таких семейств упала на 13% в Центральноафриканской Республике (с 77,5 до 64,5%), но выросла на 40,4% (с 22,2 до 62,6%) в Сьерра-Леоне. Улучшение было заметнее в сельской местности и среди самых бедных семейств, но при этом сохранялось неравенство социально-экономических показателей внутри страны. Между социально-экономическими показателями на национальном уровне и изменениями в потреблении йодированной соли была выявлена слабая взаимосвязь. В целом доля семейств, использующих достаточно иодированную соль, за последнее десятилетие выросла. Однако от страны к стране изменения значительно варьировались. Многие страны все еще далеки от достижения цели всеобщего обеспечения иодированной солью, и для этого требуется возобновление работы со стороны правительств, двусторонних и многосторонних учреждений и гражданского общества.

492,492,27788026,"Which medication, if any, to use to prevent the headache of pediatric migraine has not been established. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of amitriptyline (1 mg per kilogram of body weight per day), topiramate (2 mg per kilogram per day), and placebo in children and adolescents 8 to 17 years of age with migraine. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive one of the medications or placebo. The primary outcome was a relative reduction of 50% or more in the number of headache days in the comparison of the 28-day baseline period with the last 28 days of a 24-week trial. Secondary outcomes were headache-related disability, headache days, number of trial completers, and serious adverse events that emerged during treatment. A total of 361 patients underwent randomization, and 328 were included in the primary efficacy analysis (132 in the amitriptyline group, 130 in the topiramate group, and 66 in the placebo group). The trial was concluded early for futility after a planned interim analysis. There were no significant between-group differences in the primary outcome, which occurred in 52% of the patients in the amitriptyline group, 55% of those in the topiramate group, and 61% of those in the placebo group (amitriptyline vs. placebo, P=0.26; topiramate vs. placebo, P=0.48; amitriptyline vs. topiramate, P=0.49). There were also no significant between-group differences in headache-related disability, headache days, or the percentage of patients who completed the 24-week treatment period. Patients who received amitriptyline or topiramate had higher rates of several adverse events than those receiving placebo, including fatigue (30% vs. 14%) and dry mouth (25% vs. 12%) in the amitriptyline group and paresthesia (31% vs. 8%) and weight loss (8% vs. 0%) in the topiramate group. Three patients in the amitriptyline group had serious adverse events of altered mood, and one patient in the topiramate group had a suicide attempt. There were no significant differences in reduction in headache frequency or headache-related disability in childhood and adolescent migraine with amitriptyline, topiramate, or placebo over a period of 24 weeks. The active drugs were associated with higher rates of adverse events. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health; CHAMP ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01581281 ).

493,493,39232002,"Breastfeeding provides many health benefits, but its impact on respiratory health remains unclear. This study addresses the complex and dynamic nature of the mother-milk-infant triad by investigating maternal genomic factors regulating human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), and their associations with respiratory health among human milk-fed infants. Nineteen HMOs are quantified from 980 mothers of the CHILD Cohort Study. Genome-wide association studies identify HMO-associated loci on chromosome 19p13.3 and 19q13.33 (lowest P = 2.4e-118), spanning several fucosyltransferase (FUT) genes. We identify novel associations on chromosome 3q27.3 for 6'-sialyllactose (P = 2.2e-9) in the sialyltransferase (ST6GAL1) gene. These, plus additional associations on chromosomes 7q21.32, 7q31.32 and 13q33.3, are replicated in the independent INSPIRE Cohort. Moreover, gene-environment interaction analyses suggest that fucosylated HMOs may modulate overall risk of recurrent wheeze among preschoolers with variable genetic risk scores (P < 0.01). Thus, we report novel genetic factors associated with HMOs, some of which may protect the respiratory health of children.

494,494,35488031,"Pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes (T1D) involves immune responses that may be associated with early exposure to environmental factors among preterm newborns. The aim of this work was to evaluate for association between T1D and maternal, nutritional, and medical exposures during the neonatal period among premature newborns. This is a multicenter, matched case-control study. Preterm newborns, who developed T1D before 18 years, were matched by sex, gestational age (GA), birth date, and medical center of birth with newborns who did not develop TID. Data included maternal medical history, birth weight (BW), length of hospitalization, enteral and parenteral medications, fluid administration, and feeding modalities during hospitalization. Fifty-two patients with T1D, 26 males, median age at T1D diagnosis 8.17 years (5.92-9.77), median GA 34 weeks (33-m36), and 132 matched controls, were included. Multivariate-conditional-regression demonstrated a significant association between T1D and any maternal illness (23.1% vs. 9.1%, OR = 4.99 (1.69-14.72), p = 0.004), higher BW-SDS (0.07 ± 0.95 vs. -0.27 ± 0.97, OR = 2.03 (1.19-3.49), p = 0.01), longer duration of glucose infusion (3 (1-5) days vs. 2 (0-4), OR = 1.23 (1.03-1.46), p = 0.02), and antibiotic therapy beyond the first week of life (19.2% vs. 6.9%, OR = 5.22 (1.32-20.70), p = 0.019). Antibiotic treatment during the first week of life was negatively associated with T1D (51.9% vs. 67.2%, OR 0.31 (0.11-0.88), p = 0.027). A novel association was demonstrated between the development of T1D and early interventions and exposures among preterm newborns. Type 1 diabetes mellitus during childhood may be associated with early exposures during the neonatal period, in addition to known maternal and neonatal metabolic parameters. Early exposure to intravenous antibiotics, differing between the first week of life and later, and longer parenteral glucose administration to preterm newborns were associated with childhood type 1 diabetes. This is in addition to familiar maternal risk factors.

495,495,7953590,"We have studied seven patients with Spielmeyer-Vogt disease (SV), aged 11-29 years, using PET and 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose. Five patients showed a distinctive age-related progression with decreased metabolic activity starting in the calcarine area and spreading rostrally to the entire cortex, leaving normal uptake only in the basal ganglia and brainstem of the oldest patients. Calcarine hypometabolism was mild in the youngest patient. All patients, including the youngest when the study was repeated 2 years later, had significantly decreased calcarine metabolic activity (P = 0.002). Two patients had PET patterns markedly different from the five others, with significantly decreased metabolic activity in most brain areas. Both patients may represent a new SV variant. An adult pathological control with congenital amaurosis showed normal cerebral metabolic activity in all areas. Two patients had older sisters, one now deceased, the other not available for study, who presented a rapid regression associated with epilepsy. Phenytoin and carbamazepine probably caused increased seizure activity and faster regression. The younger siblings treated with phenobarbital monotherapy had few seizures and maintained motor functions 5-8 years longer compared with their respective sisters. While the clinical course made obvious that some areas, such as the macula, are damaged before others, the progression from the calcarine area to the more anterior regions (but sparing the basal ganglia) provides unexpected insights into selective vulnerability of neurons that will allow a more precise way of monitoring individual patients.

496,496,30808291,"The excessive consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is a public health concern worldwide. Several clinical trials examining the effects of consuming sucrose or high-fructose corn syrup demonstrated the link between this consumption and increased risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases. In this issue of Environmental Health and Preventive Medicine, Li et al. examined the sugar-sweetened beverage consumption among undergraduate students and evaluated the relationship between this consumption and the ""late"" chronotype, sleep duration, and weight increase. They concluded that the sugar-sweetened beverage intake might mediate the associations among sleep duration, late chronotype, and weight gain and that the intake of sugar-sweetened beverages in the evening may be a risk factor for the development of overweight/obesity. A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled trials provided evidence that the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages promotes weight gain in both children and adults. The World Health Organization guideline highly recommends reducing the intake of sugars to less than 10% of one's total energy intake. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet and the Mediterranean diet were shown to help individuals refrain from sweets and sugar-containing beverages. A global evaluation revealed how much disability during accumulated lifetime hours is due to sugar-sweetened beverages. Interventions are necessary, but many individuals find it quite difficult to reduce or eliminate their high intake of sugar-sweetened beverages. The taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages was demonstrated to have a significant positive influence on individuals' planned purchases and the probability of the purchase of healthy beverages. Western countries are working on the social regulation of sugar-sweetened beverages, but Japan has not implemented any similar regulations.

Systematic review (PROSPERO registration No. CRD42018094676) of controlled trials with adult and child participants where chewing of SFG was the main intervention. Databases searched (1 Jan 1946 to 31 August 2020): MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, Allied and Complimentary Medicine Database, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Open Grey, PROSPERO and the Cochrane library of systematic reviews.

Data extraction and Risk of Bias assessment was undertaken by three researchers using a modified version of the Cochrane RoB tool (version 1). Data synthesis was conducted using meta-analysis in STATA. Thirteen studies of SFG with micro-organisms as outcomes were identified. The use of SFG significantly reduced the load of Streptococcus mutans (effect size - 0.42; 95% CI - 0.60 to - 0.25) compared to all controls. In seven of the 13 studies the confidence intervals of the effect size estimate included zero, suggesting no effect of the intervention. Twelve trials used xylitol gum only as the basis of the intervention; xylitol gum significantly reduced the load of Streptococcus mutans (effect size - 0.46; 95% CI - 0.64 to - 0.28) in comparison to all controls. There was a moderate level of heterogeneity across the included studies. No adverse effects were recorded. Chewing SFG reduces the load of Streptococcus mutans in the oral cavity in comparison to non-chewing controls. Considering the degree of variability in the effect and the moderate quality of the trials included, there is a need for future research exploring the use SFG as a preventive measure for reducing the cariogenic oral bacterial load.

Children aged 1-5 years who did not use xylitol or sorbitol at enrolment. Children were randomly assigned to use a placebo syrup with sorbitol or xylitol syrup two times per day for 6 months. Primary outcome was the number of clinician-diagnosed AOM episodes over 6 months. Secondary outcomes were caregiver-reported URTIs and dental caries. Among the 250 randomised children, the mean (SD) age was 38±14 months and there were 124 girls (50%).

Aims of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the sensitivity to THs, the severity of overweight and the glyco-metabolic alterations in prepubertal euthyroid children with obesity. Prepubertal subjects with simple obesity and matched controls were recruited from three Italian pediatric endocrinology centers and underwent clinical and biochemical evaluations. HOMA-IR, HOMA-β, insulinogenic index, Matsuda index were evaluated in children with obesity. Indexes of peripheral sensitivity (FT3/FT4 ratio) and central sensitivity (TSH index, TSHI; TSH T4 resistance index, TT4RI; Thyroid Feedback Quantile-based Index, TFQI; Parametric TFQI, PTFQI) to thyroid hormones were calculated in both groups. Eighty prepubertal children with obesity (Group 1; mean age 7.60 ± 1.51 years) and 28 healthy normal-weight controls (Group 2) were recruited. BMI and leptin were higher in group 1 than in group 2. The FT3/FT4 ratio correlated negatively with HOMA-β (r = -0.29; p = 0.01) and was significantly positively associated with BMI (p = 0.03), IR (p = 0.03) and fasting blood glucose (p = 0.04) in group 1. TT4RI, TSHI, PTFQI, TFQI, were significantly negatively associated with Matsuda-index, IGI and BMI in group 1.

Drawings of secondary sexual characteristics and self-reported age at menarche or voice breaking were used to assess pubertal stages. Dietary intake was assessed using a detailed semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Generalized estimating equation modeling was applied to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to represent the effects of each drink on early pubertal development outcomes. In boys, an one cup/day increment of a SSB was associated with earlier voice breaking (β = -0.12; 95% CI = -0.20, -0.04), whereas consuming yogurt (≥2 cups/day) was a protective factor against early puberty (OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.73, 0.83).

This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the CONTOUR PLUS and CONTOUR PLUS ONE glucometers (new wireless systems that link to a smart mobile device) when used as point-of-care devices for blood glucose monitoring in neonates and critically ill adults in inpatient settings. This cross-sectional study was conducted at a medical center in central Taiwan and enrolled patients admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, sick child room, or respiratory intensive care unit between November 2020 and April 2021. Neonates with suspected infection or abnormal blood coagulation and adults who had abnormal blood coagulation, were pregnant, had received organ transplants, or had undergone massive blood transfusions were excluded. The accuracy of the glucometers was determined based on the following criteria of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard: 15197:2013. Overall, 114 neonates (mean age, 4.2 days [range, 0-28 days]; 65 boys [57.0%]) and 106 hospitalized critically ill adults (mean age, 68.2 years [range, 27-94 years]; 72 men [67.9%]) were enrolled in this study.

Insulin secretion is precisely regulated so that, under normal physiological conditions, fasting plasma glucose concentrations are kept within a narrow range of 3·5-5·5 mmol/L. In hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia, insulin secretion becomes dysregulated (ie, uncoupled from glucose metabolism) so that insulin secretion persists in the presence of low plasma glucose concentrations. Hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia is the most common cause of severe and persistent hypoglycaemia in neonates and children. At a molecular level, mutations in nine different genes can lead to the dysregulation of insulin secretion and cause this disorder. In adults, hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia accounts for 0·5-5·0% of cases of hypoglycaemia and can be due either to β-cell tumours (insulinomas) or β-cell hyperplasia.

514,514,78085,"The measuring spoons described by Morley and King for making up glucose-electrolyte solutions for use in the oral treatment of children with diarrhea generally deliver less substance than they should. The deficits are significant for sodium chloride and glucose. The quantities these spoons delivered when the substances were in the damp state and after drying to constant weight were compared. Also examined was the effect of packing the substances more tightly by tapping the spoon on the table after the initial filling and then refilling it or by pressing with a thumb or knife. Both methods had a similar effect. 3 kinds of salt were tested, and the glucose spoon was used for coarse brown sugar. For the different kinds of salt in their normal damp state the sodium-chloride spoon delivered averages of 1.8-2.4g instead of the expected 3.5g. Dampness and particle size contributed to these deficits. The spoon for the final sodium concentration in a glucose-electrolyte solution delivered 2.2g of the damp substance. The glucose spoon delivered an average of 13.5g (expected 20) of the damp substance. Drying did not solve the problem as well as it did for fine salts. These problems can be largely overcome by packing the glucose and salt into their spoons more tightly, provided a fine salt is used. The problems with salt-and-sugar solutions are greater, because there is no contribution form the sodium bicarbonate to the sodium concentration and the discrepancy between the amount of salt expected and delivered becomes more critical. For the time being in Mozambique a salt-and-sugar solution will be used in more remote places, and for this purpose a modified version of the ""fingers"" method is used.

516,516,36753933,"Novel prevention programs are developed to address the increase in e-cigarette use (vaping) among children. However, it remains paramount to test their feasibility in rural settings. This pilot study implemented and evaluated the feasibility and outcomes of two innovative programs, CATCH My Breath and smokeSCREEN, among youth in rural settings in Florida. We conducted four focus groups with youth aged 11-17 recruited from 4-H rural clubs in Florida. In a subsequent randomized trial, we recruited 82 youth participants and assigned them to one of three arms: CATCH My Breath, smokeSCREEN, or control. CATCH My Breath and smokeSCREEN participants attended online group intervention sessions while the control group received educational material. Pre- and post-surveys were administered to all participants to assess knowledge, susceptibility, perceived positive outcomes and risk perceptions related to tobacco and e-cigarette use. Other feasibility parameters were also assessed. Focus group discussions provided insights about feasibility and informed the implementation of both interventions in terms of delivery format, scheduling of sessions and incentives. After the intervention, CATCH My Breath participants significantly improved their general tobacco-related knowledge (post-pre = 16.21-12.92 = 3.3, p <.01) and risk perceptions towards other flavored tobacco products (post-pre = 19.29-17.71 = 1.6, p <.05). smokeSCREEN participants significantly improved their general tobacco knowledge (post-pre = 18.77-13.77 = 5.0, p <.01), knowledge about e-cigarettes (post-pre = 9.08-6.31 = 2.8, p <.01) and risk perception towards e-cigarettes (post-pre = 24.69-21.92 = 2.8, p <.05).

517,517,29206761,"Restoring normal mitochondrial function represents a new target for strategies aimed at mitigating the stress response to severe burn trauma and hastening recovery. Our objective was to investigate the determinants of skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiratory capacity and function and its association with glucose metabolism and functional capacity in burned children. Data from burned children enrolled in the placebo arm of an ongoing prospective clinical trial were analyzed. Mitochondrial respiratory capacity was determined in permeabilized myofibers by high-resolution respirometry on at least one occasion per participant. In subsets of patients, glucose kinetics and cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak) were also determined. Mixed multiple regression models were used to identify the determinants of mitochondrial respiratory function and to assess the relationship between mitochondrial respiration and both glucose control and functional capacity (VO2peak). Increasing full-thickness burn size was associated with greater adjusted coupled (ATP-producing) respiration, adjusted for age, sex, sepsis, and time of testing (P < 0.01; n = 55, obs = 97). Girls had on average 23.3% lower coupled respiration (adjusted mean and 95% confidence of interval [CI], -7.1; -12.6 to -1.7 pmol/s/mg; P < 0.025) and 29.8% lower respiratory control than boys (adjusted mean and 95% CI, -0.66; -1.07 to -0.25; P < 0.01; n = 55, obs = 97). The presence of sepsis was associated with lower respiration coupled to ATP production by an average of 25.5% compared with nonsepsis (adjusted mean and 95% CI, -6.9; -13.0 to -0.7 pmol/s/mg; P < 0.05; n = 55, obs = 97), after adjustment for age, sex, full-thickness burn size, and time of testing. During a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, hepatic glucose release was associated with greater coupled respiration and respiratory control (P < 0.05; n = 42, obs = 73), independent of age, sepsis, full-thickness burn size, and time postinjury testing. Coupled respiration was positively associated with VO2peak after adjustment for age, full-thickness burn size, and time of exercise testing (P < 0.025; n = 18, obs = 25). Burn severity, sex, and sepsis influence skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in burned children.

520,520,22214819,"Fanconi-Bickel syndrome (FBS, OMIM #227810), a congenital disorder of carbohydrate metabolism, is caused by mutations in GLUT2 (SLC2A2), the gene encoding the glucose transporter protein-2. The typical clinical picture is characterized by hepatorenal glycogen accumulation resulting in hepato- and nephromegaly, impaired utilization of glucose and galactose, proximal tubular nephropathy, rickets, and severe short stature. We report on two siblings with FBS and an unusually mild clinical course. A 9.5-year-old boy with failure to thrive was diagnosed at the age of 9 months, his younger sister (4.5 years) was investigated in the first months of life and also diagnosed with FBS. Both patients were found to be compound heterozygous for the novel GLUT2 (SLC2A2) mutations c.457_462delCTTATA (p.153_4delLI) and c.1250C>G (p.P417R). On a diet restricted in free glucose and galactose, both children showed normal growth. Hepatomegaly, nephromegaly and hypophosphatemic rickets have never been observed. Glucosuria and tubular proteinuria were only mild compared to previously reported patients with FBS. This report describes an unusually mild phenotype of FBS expanding the spectrum of this disease. Some clinical signs that have been considered hallmarks of FBS like hepatomegaly and short stature may be absent in this condition.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of interferon on glucose metabolism and to investigate whether autoimmunity has a role in the pathogenesis. Fourteen patients (9 male, 6.3+/-2.7 years) with children with chronic hepatitis B infection were prospectively evaluated. They received interferon 10 MU/m2 for six months. Vral glucose tolerance test, fasting insulin and C-peptide, postprandial insulin and C-peptide, anti-GAD antibody, HOMA-IR and glucose/insulin ratio were measured before and after treatment. Before interferon, oral glucose tolerance test showed glucose intolerance in two patients (14.5%) and hypoglycemia in one patient (7.1%). One patient had hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance (7.1%), and four patients had hypoinsulinemia and insulin hypersensitivity (28.5%). After interferon, oral glucose tolerance test was normal in 13 patients (92.8%). Abnormal oral glucose tolerance test persisted in the same patient, but no difference was found in insulin resistance. Hypoinsulinemia and insulin hypersensitivity were present in five patients (35.7%). DM related autoantibodies were negative in all patients before interferon; however, one patient, whose glucose metabolism was within normal limits, developed anti-GAD antibody after interferon. Children with children with chronic hepatitis B infection were shown to have hypoinsulinemia and insulin hypersensitivity.

EE leads to macronutrient and micronutrient malabsorption and stunting, with a resultant increased risk for infection and reduced cognitive development. We tested the hypothesis that zinc and albendazole treatments would reduce the severity of EE in rural African children. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in rural southern Malawi, asymptomatic children, 1 to 3 years old and at high risk for EE, received either a single dose of albendazole, a 14-day course of 20 mg zinc sulfate, or a placebo. Subjects were given the dual-sugar absorption test, and the ratio of lactulose to mannitol (L:M) in urine was used to determine the severity of EE at baseline and 34 days after completion of the assigned regimen. The primary outcome was the change in the L:M. A complete set of urine samples was obtained from 222 of 234 children enrolled and analyzed. The mean baseline L:M was 0.32 ± 0.18 among all children and did not differ among groups (normal L:M range, <0.12). At the end of the study, the L:M ratio had increased more in the placebo group (0.12 ± 0.31) than in the zinc group (0.03 ± 0.20; P < .03) or the albendazole group (0.04 ± 0.22; P < .04). Treatment with zinc or albendazole protects against a significant increase in the L:M ratio, a biomarker for EE, in asymptomatic rural Malawian children.

Food-specific inhibition training, where responses to palatable food stimuli, such as sweet foods, are consistently and repeatedly inhibited, reduces sweet food intake in adults. However, no studies have yet examined the effectiveness of inhibitory control training specifically targeting sweet foods among children with high sugar cravings. We examined whether sweet food-specific inhibitory control training (SF-ICT), administered via a mobile app, reduced choice and consumption of sweet foods, and weight in a sample of children aged 7-11 with overweight or obesity and who had high sugar cravings (N = 46). This study was designed as a 2 × 3 between-within design. Participants were randomly allocated to a single-blind design with two conditions: they either received 7 sessions of active or control go/no-go training in which either sweet foods or non-food cues were paired with no-go signals. Participants' weight, sweet food choice, and consumption were measured pre and post-training, and at three-month follow-up. The results revealed that participants in the active group showed a significant reduction in sweet food choice and intake from pre to post-training relative to the control group. The effects of the training on reducing sweet food intake persisted over the 3-month follow-up No significant changes in weight loss were observed. These results provide preliminary evidence that sweet food-specific inhibitory control training (SF-ICT) via a mobile app is effective in modifying eating behavior among children with excessive consumption of sugary foods.

530,530,32875444,"Subdural empyema (SDE) is a rare condition which can appear secondary to meningitis in childhood, especially in infants. This study was planned to evaluate and compare clinical and laboratory features, treatment, and outcome of children with SDE to those with acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) without SDE. The electronic medical files of 266 patients diagnosed with ABM between January 2009 and December 2019 were evaluated. Patients' demographic and clinical features, laboratory results, cranial imaging findings, treatment, and outcomes were recorded. SDE was identified in 10 patients, 3.7% of all diagnosed with meningitis. The etiology of SDE was identified in eight (80%). The most common responsible pathogen was Streptococcus pneumoniae. Cranial imaging was performed between the 2nd and 13th days of admission, and the most common reason of performing cranial imaging was persistence of fever. Two patients were healed with 4-6 weeks of antibiotic treatment without surgery, eight (80%) needed surgical intervention.Conclusion: The clinical signs and symptoms of SDE may be subtle. If the fever persists or focal neurological findings are seen during the treatment of bacterial meningitis, SDE should be suspected. Furthermore, patients with ABM who are determined to have a protein-to-glucose ratio in the cerebrospinal fluid above 4.65 should be carefully monitored for SDE development.

Twenty-two African countries had SAC mUIC < 175 μg/l, which correlated with insufficient iodine intake during pregnancy (pMUIC < 150 μg/l). However, nine of these twenty-two countries had adequate iodine intake based on SAC mUIC.

Burst suppression coma was induced by high-dose suppressive therapy; 24-h electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring was performed on each patient. The goal of treatment was to achieve complete clinical seizure control or burst-suppression pattern on EEG, aiming for an interburst interval of >5s. Brain imaging was done for each patient. There were nine patients (seven boys), aged 5-15 years. Clinical symptoms included fever (100%), upper respiratory symptoms (66.7%) and altered consciousness (66.7%). All patients received multiple high-dose suppressive drugs and were intubated with/without inotropic agents.

534,534,36133310,"Over the years, non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD) disease has progressed to become the most frequent chronic liver disease in children and adolescents. The full pathology is not yet known, but disease progression leads to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Risk factors included hypercaloric diet, obesity, insulin resistance and genetics. Hyperglucagonemia appears to be a pathophysiological consequence of hepatic steatosis, thus, the hypothesis of the study is that hepatic fat accumulation leads to increased insulin resistance and impaired glucagon metabolism leading to hyperglucagonemia in pediatric NAFLD. 132 children and adolescents between 10 and 18 years, with varying degrees of obesity, were included in the study. Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) average liver fat was determined, and patients were stratified as NAFLD (>5% liver fat content) and non-NAFLD (<5%). All patients underwent a standardized oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Additionally, anthropometric parameters (height, weight, BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference) such as lab data including lipid profile (triglycerides, HDL, LDL), liver function parameters (ALT, AST), uric acid, glucose metabolism (fasting insulin and glucagon, HbA1c, glucose 120 min) and indices evaluating insulin resistance (HIRI, SPISE, HOMA-IR, WBISI) were measured. Children and adolescents with NAFLD had significantly higher fasting glucagon values compared to the non-NAFLD cohort (p=0.0079). In the NAFLD cohort univariate analysis of fasting glucagon was associated with BMI-SDS (p<0.01), visceral adipose tissue volume (VAT) (p<0.001), average liver fat content (p<0.001), fasting insulin concentration (p<0.001), triglycerides (p<0.001) and HDL (p=0.034). This correlation equally applied to all insulin indices HOMA-IR, WBISI, HIRI (all p<0.001) and SPISE (p<0.002). Multivariate analysis (R² adjusted 0.509) for the same subgroup identified HIRI (p=0.003) and VAT volume (p=0.017) as the best predictors for hyperglucagonemia.

For the first time in the Middle-East region, this study aimed to assess the long-term effectiveness of a community-based lifestyle intervention on the incidence of hypertension in school-aged children during 16 years of follow-up. This study was conducted within the framework of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS). Participants were 2080 children aged 8-18 years with normal blood pressure who were under the coverage of three health care centers selected using multistage cluster random sampling method. One of the health care centers far from the other two was selected for implementing lifestyle intervention (1053 children, 48.2% boys). Triennial examinations were conducted, and survival Cox models were used to assess intervention effects on the incidence of hypertension in boys and girls. Crude incidence rates (per 1000 person-years) of hypertension were 8.11, 3.7, and 5.8 among boys, girls, and the total sample, respectively. Our results showed that HTN has occurred significantly less (P = 0.025) in the intervention group than in the control group, only in female participants. These results remained significant even after adjusting for individuals' and parental characteristics (P = 0.033).

This study thus aimed to assess ID among children aged 12-59 months by monitoring the Urinary Iodine Concentrations (UIC), the prevalence of goitre, and the factors causing ID. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 846 children aged 12-59 months in Jaffna District, Sri Lanka. Sociodemographic characteristics and other factors were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Dietary pattern of children was obtained using semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. We performed urinary iodine estimation and physical examinations to detect the goitre, according to the World Health Organization criteria. A multivariate logistic linear regression model was used to identify the factors that causing ID. The median UIC was 146.4 μg/L (interquartile range = 112.6-185.3 μg/L). Based on the UIC (<100 μg/L), 17.8% had ID, of which 15.7% and 2.1% had mild and moderate ID. The mean consumption of iodine from food was 128.7 (±20.2) μg/day. Gender variation had no influence on ID (p>0.05). Median UIC was significantly associated with living area, wealth status, type of drinking water, and method of iodized salt usage. A higher percentage of ID was significantly associated with younger age [AOR 2.32 (95% CI: 1.31-4.10)], urban area [AOR 1.94 (95% CI 1.27-2.96)], inland regions [AOR 3.20 (95% CI 1.85-5.55)], improper method of iodized salt usage [AOR 3.63 (95% CI: 1.38-9.56)], and low consumption of iodine-containing foods.

Clinical and demographic variables were analyzed to identify subpopulations at risk for hypoglycemia. Of the 1254 hypoglycemia triggers produced, 198 were adverse events (positive predictive value: 15.8%).

540,540,19734012,"The spatial relationship between an intracranial EEG-defined epileptic focus and cortical hypometabolism on glucose PET has not been precisely described. In order to quantitatively evaluate the hypothesis that ictal seizure onset and/or rapid seizure propagation, detected by subdural EEG monitoring, commonly involves normometabolic cortex adjacent to hypometabolic cortical regions, we applied a novel, landmark-constrained conformal mapping approach in 14 children with refractory neocortical epilepsy. The 3D brain surface was parcellated into finite cortical elements (FCEs), and hypometabolism was defined using lobe- and side-specific asymmetry indices derived from normal adult controls. The severity and location of hypometabolic areas vs. ictal intracranial EEG abnormalities were compared on the 3D brain surface. Hypometabolism was more severe in the seizure onset zone than in cortical areas covered by non-onset electrodes. However, similar proportions of the onset electrodes were located over and adjacent to (within 2 cm) hypometabolic regions (46% vs. 41%, respectively), whereas rapid seizure spread electrodes preferred these ""adjacent areas"" rather than the hypometabolic area itself (51% vs. 22%). On average, 58% of the hypometabolic regions had no early seizure involvement. These findings strongly support that the seizure onset zone often extends from hypometabolic to adjacent normometabolic cortex, while large portions of hypometabolic cortex are not involved in seizure onset or early propagation. The clinical utility of FDG PET in guiding subdural electrode placement in neocortical epilepsy could be greatly enhanced by extending grid coverage to at least 2 cm beyond hypometabolic cortex, when feasible.

The subjects comprised 580 schoolchildren (471 elementary school pupils and 109 junior high school pupils) who wanted to evaluate their salt intake in Kuji, a northeast coastal area in Japan. We estimated salt intake using spot urine samples and a formula. Lifestyle was assessed using a questionnaire. We also evaluated the salt intake and the lifestyles of 440 parents. The estimated salt intakes of elementary school pupils, junior high school pupils and their parents were 7.1±1.5, 7.6±1.5 and 8.0±1.7 g per day, respectively. The proportion of lower-grade children who achieved the recommended salt intake was low. In the multivariate analysis, the estimated salt intake of school-aged children correlated with their age, estimated salt intake of their parents and the menu priorities of the household. The estimated salt intake of the parents was associated with female gender, obesity, age and the habitual consumption of bread and noodles. In conclusion, the estimated salt intake of school-aged children positively correlated with the estimated salt intake of their parents, and the proportion of lower-grade children who achieved the recommended salt intake was low. Guidance on salt restriction for children and their parents may reduce the salt intake of school-aged children.

546,546,9253327,"To evaluate glucose kinetics in children with falciparum malaria, basal glucose production and gluconeogenesis and an estimate of the flux of the gluconeogenic precursors were measured in Kenyan children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria before (n = 11) and during infusion of alanine (1.5 mg/kg.min; n = 6). Glucose production was measured by [6,6-2H2]glucose, gluconeogenesis by mass isotopomer distribution analysis of glucose labeled by [2-13C]glycerol. Basal plasma glucose concentration ranged from 2.1-5.5 mmol/L, and basal glucose production ranged from 3.3-7.3 mg/kg.min. Glucose production was largely derived from gluconeogenesis (73 +/- 4%; range, 52-93%). During alanine infusion, plasma glucose increased by 0.4 mmol/L (P = 0.03), glucose production increased by 0.8 mg/kg.min (P = 0.02), and gluconeogenesis increased by 0.8 mg/kg.min (P = 0.04). We conclude that glucose production in children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria is largely dependent on gluconeogenesis. However, gluconeogenesis is potentially limited by insufficient precursor supply. These data indicate that in children with falciparum malaria, gluconeogenesis fails to compensate in the presence of decreased glycogen flux to glucose, increasing the risk of hypoglycemia.

Longitudinal analyses revealed annualized area under the curve (AUC) of C-peptide increases in nonprogressors versus decreases in progressors (P ≤ 0.026 for DPT-1 and TNPTP). Vector indices for AUC glucose and AUC C-peptide changes (on a two-dimensional grid) also differed significantly (P < 0.001). Despite marked baseline metabolic impairment of nonprogressors, changes in AUC C-peptide, AUC glucose, AUC C-peptide-to-AUC glucose ratio (AUC ratio), and Index60 did not differ from Ab- relatives during follow-up. Divergence between nonprogressors and progressors occurred by 6 months from baseline in both cohorts (AUC glucose, P ≤ 0.007; AUC ratio, P ≤ 0.034; Index60, P < 0.001; vector indices of change, P < 0.001). Differences in 6-month change were positively associated with greater diabetes risk (respectively, P < 0.001, P ≤ 0.019, P < 0.001, and P < 0.001) in DPT-1 and TNPTP, except AUC ratio, which was inversely associated with risk (P < 0.001). Novel findings show that even with similarly abnormal baseline risk, progressors had appreciably more metabolic impairment than nonprogressors within 6 months and that the measures showing impairment were predictive of type 1 diabetes.

Success or failure of recruitment methods has been reported for a variety of clinical trials, but few specifically for G4H trials. This study's goal was to recruit 444 overweight or obese (body mass index percentile between the 84.5th-99.4th percentiles) children between the ages of 10-12 years. The article reports the results of different methods of participant recruitment. Participants had to agree to three fasting blood samples (baseline, immediately after, and 2 months later); be willing to wear an accelerometer for 7 days at each assessment; read and speak English fluently (because the games were in English); have no history of any condition that would affect what he/she could eat or how much physical activity he/she could get; and have an eligible home computer purchased in the last 5 years with high-speed internet. Hardware criteria reflected the types of computers upon which Diab-Nano could be effectively played. Recruitment was conducted over a 35-month period and included electronic media, print advertising, community recruitment, and an internal volunteer list. Respondents were guided to a web-based screening questionnaire that asked for source of hearing about the study. Although diverse recruitment methods were used, slow recruitment resulted in obtaining only 45% of the recruitment goal (n = 199). Electronic media (e.g., radio, television, and internet), which reached millions of targeted parents, resulted in only 76 respondents, of whom 13 became participants; print media (e.g., magazine, newsletter/newspaper, and mail), which also reached large numbers of parents, resulted in 192 respondents, of whom 19 became participants; community recruitment (e.g., school, friend or family, doctors office, flyer, work, community program) resulted in 162 respondents, of whom 38 became participants; and the internal volunteer list resulted in 413 respondents, of whom 128 became participants.

A strong relationship between SSB intake and weight gain is described. we performed a narrative review to present an overview of the role of SSBs as a pivotal contributor in the development of obesity and metabolism-related complications. different factors influence SSB consumption in children, including economic variables, individual attributes and behaviors to environmental factors, parent features and parents' behaviors. Data suggest that SSB intake has a negative effect on weight and obesity-related diseases. The leading mechanism linking SSB intake to the risk of gaining weight is decreased satiety and incomplete compensatory reduction in energy intake at meals following ingestion of liquid calories. Additionally, the effects of SSBs on gut microbiota and on eating behaviors were also reported. An association between SSB intake, weight gain and cardiometabolic risks is evident. Consumption of SSBs had a significant impact on the prevalence of obesity and related metabolic risks, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and metabolic syndrome. Limiting consumption of SSBs and increasing knowledge of the effect of SSBs on early metabolic and cardiovascular disorders will be useful in developing strategies to counteract the problem and to prevent obesity and related complications.Key future research areas for which further studies are needed include investigating the long-term effects of SSBs on health outcomes as well as analyzing the health effects of sugar consumed in solid compared to liquid forms and further elucidating the biological mechanisms of sugar addiction and energy compensation.

552,552,33963735,"The UK salt reduction program started in 2003, consisting of education campaigns to raise awareness about the risks associated with a high-salt diet and of a reformulation strategy for food manufacturers. This program is often cited as an example of a successful public health program. This study aimed to assess: 1) the impacts of changes in food composition and changes in consumer behavior on sodium intakes; and 2) whether changes were similar across socioeconomic groups. Food intakes for the UK population were derived from food diaries in the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey for 2008/09 (year 1; n = 1334) and 2016/17 (year 9; n = 995). Year-specific sodium densities of foods were used to calculate the average sodium density of all food and beverage consumed. Changes in sodium density between the 2 years were explained by changes in food composition (change in sodium density of products) and/or changes in behavior (type and quantity of food consumed) using a decomposition approach. The program was linked to a 16% (95% CI: -21% to -12%) decrease in sodium intake between years 1 and 9, while the sodium density of foods consumed decreased by 17% (95% CI: -21% to -12%). This decrease was largely driven by reformulation (-12.0 mg/100 g). Changes in food choices reinforced the effects of the program, but had a smaller impact (-1.6 mg/100 g). These effects were similar across socioeconomic groups, whether stratified by education or income, with a consistent effect of reformulation across groups and no differences between groups in behavioral responses to the program. A multi-component sodium reduction strategy deployed in the United Kingdom starting in 2003 corresponded to an important reduction in sodium intakes for the population. This reduction was mostly driven by changes in the food environment (reformulated food products to reduce the sodium density of foods) and, to a smaller extent, by changes in food choices. Impacts were consistent across socioeconomic groups.

Twenty-four patients received 22 right, 1 left, and 1 left lateral lobe graft. Liver preservation was done by gravity perfusion with HTK through portal vein, and hepatic artery, and flushing of bile ducts. Total ischemia time was 191 +/- 68 minutes. There was no primary nonfunction, and all partial liver grafts showed good recovery: peak aspartate aminotransferase 577 U/L, total bilirubin 15.15 mg/dL, and partial thromboplastin time 49.37 seconds. One graft was lost from parenchymal fracture secondary to portal hyperperfusion after 6 days, and the patient was salvaged with retransplantation. Thirty-day mortality, including sudden cardiac death, pancreatitis, and hepatic artery rupture, was not related to graft dysfunction. Eight of 24 recipients developed early biliary leakage. There was no late ischemic type biliary lesion. These results confirm that HTK solution is safe and effective when used in LDLTx. Potential advantages of HTK in comparison to other preservation solutions are low potassium concentration, low viscosity, no particles, in situ perfusion, no need to flush before reperfusion, improved biliary protection, better recovery of microcirculatory changes, ready to use, and lower costs.

Date of the most recent search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Register: 30 November 2015.Clinicaltrials.gov was also searched to identify unpublished or ongoing trials. Date of most recent search: 28 November 2015. All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing dornase alfa to placebo, standard therapy or other medications that improve airway clearance. Authors independently assessed trials against the inclusion criteria; two authors carried out analysis of methodological quality and data extraction. The searches identified 54 trials, of which 19 (including a total of 2565 participants) met our inclusion criteria. Three additional papers examined the healthcare cost from one of the clinical trials. Fifteen trials compared dornase alfa to placebo or no dornase alfa treatment (2447 participants); two compared daily dornase to hypertonic saline (32 participants); one compared daily dornase alfa with hypertonic saline and alternate day dornase alfa (48 participants); one compared dornase alfa to mannitol and the combination of both drugs (38 participants). Trial duration varied from six days to three years.Compared to placebo, forced expiratory volume at one second improved in the intervention groups, with significant differences at one, three, six months and two years. There was also a significant improvement in lung clearance index at one month. There was a decrease in pulmonary exacerbations compared to placebo in trials of longer duration. The quality of the evidence from placebo-controlled trials was moderate to high for outcomes of lung function and pulmonary exacerbations. Limited, low quality evidence was available for changes in quality of life from baseline. One trial that examined the cost of care, including the cost of dornase alfa, found that the cost savings from dornase alfa offset 18% to 38% of the medication costs.The results for trials comparing dornase alfa to other medications that improve airway clearance (hypertonic saline or mannitol) were mixed, with one trial showing a greater improvement in forced expiratory volume at one second for dornase alfa compared to hypertonic saline, and three trials finding no difference between medications. In the only trial to assess the combination of dornase alfa with another medication compared to dornase alone, there was no benefit seen with the combination of dornase alfa and mannitol. Evidence of dornase alfa compared to other medications was limited and the open-label design of the trials may have induced bias, therefore the quality of the evidence was judged to be low.Dornase alfa did not cause significantly more adverse effects, except voice alteration and rash. There is evidence to show that, compared with placebo, therapy with dornase alfa improves lung function in people with cystic fibrosis in trials lasting one month to two years. There was a decrease in pulmonary exacerbations in trials of six months or longer. Voice alteration and rash appear to be the only adverse events reported with increased frequency in randomised controlled trials. There is not enough evidence to firmly conclude if dornase alfa is superior to hyperosmolar agents in improving lung function.

Tropical enteropathy is characterized by reduced mannitol absorption with normal or increased lactulose absorption when a dual sugar absorption test is administered, the results of which are reported as the lactulose:mannitol ratio (L:M). Zinc homeostasis is quantified with a dual stable isotope test. This study tested the hypothesis that endogenous fecal zinc (EFZ) was correlated with the L:M. A dual sugar absorption test and dual stable isotope test were performed on 25 asymptomatic Malawian children aged 3-5 y at risk for tropical enteropathy and zinc deficiency. EFZ and net zinc retention were estimated and correlated with the L:M. Twenty-two children (88%) had an abnormal L:M (L:M>0.10), and the L:M was 0.24+/-0.10 (mean+/-SD). EFZ was 1.68+/-1.06 mg/d, a quantity greater than is seen in healthy populations from the developed world. EFZ was positively correlated with the L:M (r=0.62, p<0.001). Net zinc retention (0.67+/-1.6 mg/d) was negatively correlated with the L:M (r=-0.47, p=0.02).

563,563,35416981,"The aim of this study was to assess whether exendin-(9-39) will increase fasting and postprandial plasma glucose and decrease the incidence of hypoglycemia in children with hyperinsulinism (HI). This was an open-label, four-period crossover study. In periods 1 and 2, the effect of three different dosing regimens of exendin-(9-39) (group 1, 0.28 mg/kg; group 2, 0.44 mg/kg; group 3, 0.6 mg/kg) versus vehicle on fasting glucose was assessed in 16 children with HI. In periods 3 and 4, a subset of eight subjects received either vehicle or exendin-(9-39) (0.6 mg/kg) during a mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) and an oral protein tolerance test (OPTT). Treatment group 2 showed 20% (P = 0.037) increase in the area under the curve (AUC) of fasting glucose. A significant increase in AUC of glucose was also observed during the MMTT and OPTT; treatment with exendin-(9-39) resulted in 28% (P ≤ 0.001) and 30% (P = 0.01) increase in AUC of glucose, respectively. Fasting AUC of insulin decreased by 57% (P = 0.009) in group 3. In contrast, AUC of insulin was unchanged during the MMTT and almost twofold higher (P = 0.004) during the OPTT with exendin-(9-39) treatment. In comparison with vehicle, infusion of exendin-(9-39) resulted in significant reduction in likelihood of hypoglycemia in group 2, by 76% (P = 0.009), and in group 3, by 84% (P = 0.014). Administration of exendin-(9-39) during the OPTT resulted in 82% (P = 0.007) reduction in the likelihood of hypoglycemia.

564,564,31718111,"Lactose is a unique component of breast milk, many infant formulas and dairy products, and is widely used in pharmaceutical products. In spite of that, its role in human nutrition or lactose intolerance is generally not well-understood. For that reason, a 2-day-long lactose consensus meeting with health care professionals was organized in Mexico to come to a set of statements for which consensus could be gathered. Topics ranging from lactase expression to potential health benefits of lactose were introduced by experts, and that was followed by a discussion on concept statements. Interestingly, lactose does not seem to induce a neurological reward response when consumed. Although lactose digestion is optimal, it supplies galactose for liver glycogen synthesis. In infants, it cannot be ignored that lactose-derived galactose is needed for the synthesis of glycosylated macromolecules. At least beyond infancy, the low glycemic index of lactose might be metabolically beneficial. When lactase expression decreases, lactose maldigestion may lead to lactose intolerance symptoms. In infancy, the temporary replacing of lactose by other carbohydrates is only justified in case of severe intolerance symptoms. In those who show an (epi)genetic decrease or absence of lactase expression, a certain amount (for adults mostly up to 12 g per portion) of lactose can still be consumed. In these cases, lactose shows beneficial intestinal-microbiota-shaping effects.

565,565,38276558,"Cow's milk (CM) is a healthy food consumed worldwide by individuals of all ages. Unfortunately, ""lactase-deficient"" individuals cannot digest milk's main carbohydrate, lactose, depriving themselves of highly beneficial milk proteins like casein, lactoalbumin, and lactoglobulin due to lactose intolerance (LI), while other individuals develop allergies specifically against these proteins (CMPA). The management of these conditions differs, and an inappropriate diagnosis or treatment may have significant implications for the patients, especially if they are infants or very young children, resulting in unnecessary dietary restrictions or avoidable adverse reactions. Omics technologies play a pivotal role in elucidating the intricate interactions between nutrients and the human body, spanning from genetic factors to the microbiota profile and metabolites. This comprehensive approach enables the precise delineation and identification of distinct cohorts of individuals with specific dietary requirements, so that tailored nutrition strategies can be developed. This is what is called personalized nutrition or precision nutrition (PN), the area of nutrition that focuses on the effects of nutrients on the genome, proteome, and metabolome, promoting well-being and health, preventing diseases, reducing chronic disease incidence, and increasing life expectancy. Here, we report the opinion of the scientific community proposing to replace the ""one size fits all"" approach with tailor-made nutrition programs, designed by integrating nutrigenomic data together with clinical parameters and microbiota profiles, taking into account the individual lactose tolerance threshold and needs in terms of specific nutrients intake.

We assessed the gastric contents and ARs after oral glucose water administration 1 h prior to surgery in children with cyanotic congenital heart disease (CCHD). MATERIAL AND METHODS This was a non-inferiority randomized controlled trial of children with CCHD enrolled at the Fujian Medical University Union Hospital from 09/2014 to 05/2017 and randomized to receive oral glucose water (10 g of glucose in 100 ml of warm water, 5 ml/kg) 2 h (2-h group, n=174) or 1 h (1-h group, n=170) before surgery. The primary endpoint was gastric volume. Secondary endpoints included pH of gastric content, preoperative blood glucose, and risk factors for aspiration pneumonia. Pre- and intraoperative ARs were recorded. RESULTS The 1-h group showed smaller gastric content volumes (0.34±0.35 (95% CI: 0.29-0.39) vs. 0.43±0.33 (95% CI: 0.38-0.48) ml/kg, t=2.55, P<0.05) and higher blood glucose (6.21±0.78 (95% CI: 6.09-6.33) vs. 5.59±1.11 (95% CI: 5.43-5.76) mmol/L, t=-5.91, P<0.001). The 95% confidence interval of the volume difference between the 2 groups was 0.017-0.163, the upper limit value was 0.163 <delta=0.2 (P<0.01). The non-inferiority hypothesis was correct. The 1-h group showed lower incidence of crying, thirst and hypoxia (all P<0.05 vs. 2-h group). There were no differences in ARs between the 2 groups.

The estimated treatment difference (95% CI) in HV for somapacitan 0.16/0.16 mg/kg/wk vs daily GH at year 3 was 0.8 cm/y (-0.4 to 2.1). Change in HVSDS from baseline to year 3 was comparable between somapacitan 0.16/0.16 mg/kg/wk, the pooled somapacitan groups, and daily GH. A gradual increase in HSDS from baseline was observed for all groups. At year 3, mean HSDS was similar for the pooled somapacitan groups and daily GH. Change from baseline to year 3 in mean IGF-I SDS was similar across treatments. Once-weekly somapacitan in children with GHD showed sustained efficacy over 3 years in all assessed height-based outcomes with similar safety and tolerability to daily GH.

A multicenter observational study was conducted to develop and validate a clinical prediction tool for prolonged hospitalizations in PCACP. The derivation and validation cohorts consisted of 144 and 169 patients with PCACP, respectively, hospitalized between the years 1997 and 2017 in three tertiary care hospitals. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify parameters associated with a prolonged hospitalization and to develop and validate a prediction model for constructing a useful clinical tool. Higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P < .026) and lower levels of glucose (P = .018) in pleural fluid were significantly associated with prolonged hospitalization. A predictive stepwise logistic regression model was developed and applied to the validation cohort. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) constructed indicated that the model retained good predictive value (AUROC for the derivation vs validation data, [0.77 (95% CI, 0.66-0.87) vs 0.82 (95% CI, 0.72-0.91)], respectively).

The authors' previous work reports that prenatal high sucrose (HS) diet impaired micro-vascular functions in postnatal offspring. It is unclear whether/how prenatal HS causes vascular injury during fetal life. Pregnant rats are fed with normal drinking water or 20% high-sucrose solution during the whole gestational period. Pregnant HS increases maternal weight before delivery. Fetal thoracic aorta is separated for experiments. Angiotensin II (AII)-stimulated vascular contraction of fetal thoracic arteries in HS group is greater, which mainly results from the enhanced AT1 receptor (AT1R) function and the downstream signaling. Nifedipine significantly increases vascular tension in HS group, indicating that the L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) function is strengthened. 2-Aminoethyl diphenylborinate (2-APB), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) inhibitor, increases vascular tension induced by AII in HS group and ryanodine receptors-sensitive vascular tone shows no difference in the two groups, which suggested that the activity of IP3Rs-operated calcium channels is increased. These findings suggest that prenatal HS induces vascular dysfunction of thoracic arteries in fetal offspring by enhancing AT1R, LTCCs function and IP3Rs-associated calcium channels, providing new information regarding the impact of prenatal HS on the functional development of fetal vascular systems.

Retrospective review of the patients' charts was performed, and five patients with inappropriate PET data or major health issues were excluded. We conducted an independent component analysis of FDG-PET to extract spatial metabolic components and their activities, which were used to perform cross-sectional metabolic network analysis. We divided the patients into VNS-effective and VNS-ineffective groups (VNS-effective group, ≥50% seizure reduction; VNS-ineffective group, <50% reduction) and compared metabolic connectivity differences between groups using a permutation test. Thirty-four (55.7%) patients showed >50% seizure reduction from baseline frequency 1 year after VNS. A significant difference in metabolic connectivity evaluated by preoperative FDG-PET was noted between groups. Relative changes in glucose metabolism were strongly connected among the areas of brainstem, cingulate gyrus, cerebellum, bilateral insula, and putamen in patients with <50% seizure control after VNS. This study shows that seizure outcome of VNS may be influenced by metabolic connectivity, which can be obtained from preoperative PET imaging.

CDT of E. coli is divided into five types (CDT-I through CDT-V) based on differences in amino acid sequences and its genomic location. However, in our recent studies, a few strains of cdt-II gene-positive bacteria, initially identified as atypical E. coli, were re-identified as Escherichia albertii, an emerging enteropathogen, by extensive characterization including multilocus sequence (MLS) analysis and sugar utilization tests. This finding prompted us to investigate if bacteria previously identified as cdt-II gene-positive E. coli might be E. albertii. In the present study, we therefore re-examined the identity of 20 cdt-II gene-positive bacteria isolated from children with diarrhea, which were initially identified as atypical E. coli. By extensive sugar utilization tests, these bacteria showed a closer relatedness to E. albertii than E. coli, because they did not ferment any of the tested sugars including dulcitol, lactose, d-melibiose, l-rhamnose and d-xylose. Further, both phylogenetic analyses based on nucleotide sequences of 7 housekeeping genes (MLS analysis) and rpoB gene showed that all the cdt-II gene-positive bacteria belonged to a distinct lineage of E. albertii from those of E. coli and Shigella boydii. They were also positive by an E. albertii-specific PCR. Taken together, these data suggest that cdt-II gene-positive bacteria previously identified as E. coli are actually E. albertii. Therefore, we suggest a new definition for cdt-II gene-positive E. coli as E. albertii with the inclusion of CDT-II in E. albertii CDT.

Forty-eight policy documents were included in the review, most were global and national policies and thus the focus of analysis. A policy transfer conceptual framework was applied. Global recommendations for effectively tackling unhealthy diets and NCDs advise implementing a mix of cost-effective policy options that employ a multisectoral approach. South African country-level policy action has followed the explicit global guidance, and ideas on reducing sugar intake have found expression in sectors outside of health, to a limited extent.

The pathogenesis of arterial hypertension is multifactorial, with one of the components being represented by incorrect eating habits. In particular, excessive salt and sugar intake can contribute to the onset of hypertension in children, particularly in subjects with excess weight. Babies have an innate predisposition for sweet taste, while that for salty taste manifests after a few weeks. The recent modification of dietary styles and the current very wide availability of salt and sugar has led to an exponential increase in the consumption of these two nutrients. The dietary intake of salt and sugar in children is in fact much higher than that recommended by health agencies. The purpose of this review is to explore the mechanisms via which an excessive dietary intake of salt and sugar can contribute to the onset of arterial hypertension in children and to show the most important clinical studies that demonstrate the association between these two nutrients and arterial hypertension in pediatric age.

Identification of biomarkers of gut dysfunction could identify the presence of, and, ideally, assess interventions for, enteropathy. Classically, enteropathy has been identified histopathologically. However, less invasive assays may be more sensitive for detecting earlier perturbations reflecting specific functional derangements. The most commonly used test has been the urinary lactulose to mannitol ratio (L:M), which primarily assesses gut leakiness, and which also measures absorption. We systematically reviewed the L:M literature published from 2000 to 2010 pertinent to children in developing country settings, and identified 25 relevant publications representing heterogeneous studies.

This was a real-world observational study with participant self-reported physical activity, food intake, and insulin dosing (multiple daily injection users). Heart rate, continuous glucose data, and available pump data were collected. A total of 251 adolescents (42% females), with a mean ± SD age of 14 ± 2 years, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 7.1 ± 1.3% (54 ± 14.2 mmol/mol), recorded 3,319 activities over ∼10 days. Trends for lower mean glucose after exercise were observed in those with shorter disease duration and lower HbA1c; no difference by insulin delivery modality was identified. Larger glucose drops during exercise were associated with lower postexercise mean glucose levels, immediately after activity (P < 0.001) and 12 to <16 h later (P = 0.02). Hypoglycemia occurred on 14% of nights following exercise versus 12% after sedentary days. On nights following exercise, more hypoglycemia occurred when average total activity was ≥60 min/day (17% vs. 8% of nights, P = 0.01) and on days with longer individual exercise sessions. Higher nocturnal hypoglycemia rates were also observed in those with longer disease duration, lower HbA1c, conventional pump use, and if time below range was ≥4% in the previous 24 h. In this large real-world pediatric exercise study, nocturnal hypoglycemia was higher on nights when average activity duration was higher. Characterizing both participant- and event-level factors that impact glucose in the postexercise recovery period may support development of new guidelines, decision support tools, and refine insulin delivery algorithms to better support exercise in youth with diabetes.

The bronchial provocations tests reviewed include exercise, methacholine, AMP and mannitol, with reference to methodology and monitoring of treatment. Methacholine is used for identifying bronchial hyperresponsiveness and to guide treatment. Exercise is used as a bronchial provocation test because demonstrating prevention of exercise-induced asthma is an indication for use of a drug. Both of these tests are being used to study tolerance to beta2 agonists. There is increasing use of eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea as a surrogate bronchial provocation test for exercise to identify exercise-induced asthma, particularly in athletes. For methacholine and AMP there is concern about the different breathing patterns used to inhale these aerosols and the impact they have on the cutoff point for identifying bronchial hyperresponsiveness. A new test that uses a kit containing prepacked capsules of different doses of mannitol and a delivery device is discussed. There is increasing interest in using tests that act indirectly by release of mediators because the bronchial hyperresponsiveness itself is an indicator of the presence of inflammation. Since treatment of inflammation leads to loss of bronchial hyperresponsiveness to indirect stimuli, these tests are well suited to identify success of treatment.

Thanks to this iodized salt prophylaxis endemic cretinism has died out. The incidence of hypothyroidism in newborns is currently 1 : 4600, goiter frequency in the first school year now only 1.1 to 1.5%. In contrast the goiter incidence in girls in the twelfth school year increases to 13.4% and up to one third of adults are afflicted by goiter. Studies of iodine excretion in Feldkirch, Innsbruck, Salzburg, Graz and Vienna on a total of 2627 patients showed an iodine excretion of less than 100 micrograms J/g creatinine in the majority of the patients. This proves that there is still an inadequate iodine supplement. The Austrian Nuclear Medicine Society therefore recommends an increase in the potassium iodide content from the present 10 mg potassium iodide/kg to 20 mg potassium iodide/kg table salt, in keeping with the procedure introduced in Switzerland in 1980. Through this measure a decrease in the goiter frequency to less than 3% is to be expected over a longer period. This will result in a considerable reduction in the costs of diagnosis and therapy for this disease.

600,600,15876888,"Traumatic brain injury is the result of a primary, acute injury and is complicated by the development of secondary injury due to hypotension and hypoxia. Cerebral edema due to brain injury compromises the delivery of essential nutrients and alters normal intracranial pressure. The Monroe-Kellie Doctrine defines the principles of intracranial pressure homeostasis. Treatment for intracranial hypertension is aimed at reducing the volume of 1 of the 3 intracranial compartments, brain tissue, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid. Hyperosmolar therapy is one treatment intervention in the care of patients with severe head injury resulting in cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension. The effect of hyperosmolar solutions on brain tissue was first studied nearly 90 years ago. Since that time, mannitol has become the most widely used hyperosmolar solution to treat elevated intracranial pressure. Increasingly, hypertonic saline solutions are being used as an adjunct to mannitol in basic science research and clinical studies. Hyperosmolar solutions are effective in reducing elevated intracranial pressure through 2 distinct mechanisms: plasma expansion with a resultant decrease in blood hematocrit, reduced blood viscosity, and decreased cerebral blood volume; and the creation of an osmotic gradient that draws cerebral edema fluid from brain tissue into the circulation. The pediatric section of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies adapted previously published guidelines for the treatment of adult brain injury into guidelines for the treatment of children with traumatic brain injury. These guidelines offer recommendations for the management of children with severe head injury, including the use of mannitol and hypertonic saline to treat intracranial hypertension. Acute and critical care pediatric advanced practice nurses caring for children with severe head injury should be familiar with management guidelines and the use of hyperosmolar solutions. The purpose of this article is to assist the advanced practice nurse in understanding the role of hyperosmolar therapy in the treatment of pediatric traumatic brain injury and review current guidelines for the use of mannitol and hypertonic saline.

To develop, validate, and evaluate the impact of a new murine model of undernutrition on the intestinal epithelium, based on the complementary diet of undernourished children from 7 countries with low-socioeconomic power belonging to the Malnutrition-Enteric Diseases (MAL-ED) cohort study. We used the difference in the percentage of energy, macronutrients, fiber and zinc in the complementary diet of children without undernutrition compared with stunting (height-for-age Z-score < -2) for the MAL-ED diet formulation. Subsequently, C57BL/6 mice were fed a control diet (AIN-93M diet) or MAL-ED diet for 28 d. Weight was measured daily; body composition was measured every 7 d; lactulose:mannitol ratio (LM) and morphometry were evaluated on days 7 and 28; the cotransport test and analysis of intestinal transporters and tight junctions were performed on day 7. The MAL-ED diet presented -8.03% energy, -37.46% protein, -24.20% lipid, -10.83% zinc, +5.93% carbohydrate, and +45.17% fiber compared with the control diet. This diet rapidly reduced weight gain and compromised body growth and energy reserves during the chronic period (P < 0.05). In the intestinal epithelial barrier, this diet caused an increase in the LM (P < 0.001) and reduced (P < 0.001) the villous area associated with an increase in FAT/CD36 in the acute period and increased (P < 0.001) mannitol excretion in the chronic period. The MAL-ED diet induced undernutrition in mice, resulting in acute damage to the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier and a subsequent increase in the intestinal area during the chronic period.

604,604,36097199,"Childhood obesity is rapidly increasing worldwide and is largely the consequence of adoption of unhealthy diets excessive in calories and salt (NaCl) as well as devoid in pivotal micronutrients such as potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg). Education-based programs aiming to encourage healthy food knowledge and behaviors are crucial at a young age, and for this purpose, convenient ways to assess daily dietary intake are warranted. We therefore attempted to evaluate the dietary intake of Okinawan schoolchildren in Japan by analyzing a series of biomarkers in morning spot urine samples and explore whether these biomarkers correlate with body weight and a series of metabolic parameters. We enrolled 98 third-grade elementary schoolchildren in Okinawa, Japan. Morning spot urine samples were collected and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to assess dietary intake. We found that estimated daily NaCl intake was higher in obese/overweight children as compared to healthy-weight children (p = 0.0001).

Furthermore, Na/K ratio was higher in samples collected on Monday (weekend) as compared to samples collected on Thursday or Friday (weekday) (p < 0.0001). Via the use of morning spot urine analyses, our results show that NaCl intake was associated with obesity, and Mg excretion negatively correlated with BMI in Japanese schoolchildren, highlighting the potential role of these micronutrients in maintaining a healthy body weight. •Overweight and obesity are largely due to excessive consumption of calories and positively correlated with salt (NaCl) intake. •Spot urine methods are convenient for assessing the nutritional needs and targeting prevention programs in children. •Utilizing morning spot urine analyses, estimated NaCl intake is positively correlated and Mg/Cr negatively correlated with BMI in Okinawan schoolchildren. •As estimated via morning spot urine samples, a greater proportion of children likely exceeds the recommended NaCl intake on the weekend as compared to weekday.

In subgroups matched for age, PD vintage, dialytic glucose exposure and peritonitis incidence, submesothelial hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha abundance and angiopoietin 1/2 ratio were lower after KTx, reflecting vessel maturation, while arteriolar and microvessel p16 and cleaved Casp3 were higher. Submesothelial mast cell count and interleukin-6 were lower, whereas transforming growth factor-beta induced pSMAD2/3 was similar as compared with children on PD. Peritoneal membrane damage induced with chronic administration of low-GDP PD fluids was less severe after KTx. While peritoneal microvessel density, primarily defining PD transport and ultrafiltration capacity, was normal after KTx and peritoneal inflammation less pronounced, diffuse podoplanin positivity and profibrotic activity were prevalent.

612,612,9592618,"Topiramate, a sulfamate-substituted monosaccharide, is a new antiepileptic drug (AED) approved as adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures in adults. Topiramate is rapidly absorbed, has linear pharmacokinetics, minimal protein binding and a long half-life facilitating a twice-daily dosage regimen. Topiramate has little effect on the plasma concentrations of other AEDs with the exception of phenytoin, concentrations of which may increase in some patients when topiramate is added to the therapy. Topiramate metabolism is increased when administered with carbamazepine or phenytoin. In the absence of enzyme-inducing AEDs, topiramate is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, with 50 to 80% of a dose excreted as unchanged topiramate. In 6 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, topiramate was shown to be well tolerated and effective as adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures in adults. Topiramate consistently reduced seizures across all patient groups defined by age, gender and baseline seizure frequency. Adverse effects were generally mild-to-moderate CNS-related effects and often resolved spontaneously or with slowing of topiramate titration and/or reduction of the dosage of concomitant AEDs. Clinical studies are currently evaluating the effectiveness and safety of topiramate as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in children with partial seizures, in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and in patients with generalised tonic-clonic seizures of non-focal onset.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the inter-relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and paternal and maternal vitamin D status in a sample of snoring children. We selected 137 participants for whom serum 25(OH)D had been measured and underwent overnight polysomnography evaluation. Serum glucose, lipids, liver enzymes, parathyroid hormone, insulin, and glycated hemoglobin were also measured. Glucose and insulin levels were used to estimate insulin resistance with the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR). Vitamin D insufficiency (<30 ng/mL) and deficiency (<20 ng/mL) were found in 40.9 and 17.5% of children, respectively. After adjustments for age, BMI z-score and seasonality, the odds ratio for risk of vitamin D insufficiency according to the vitamin D status of parents were: OR (95% CI): paternal insufficiency 15.1 (2.7-35.7), p = 0.002; maternal insufficiency 7.2 (2.4-22), p = 0.001.

615,615,33346472,"Radioactive iodine, flying out of the destroyed reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, like a corona virus quickly spread throughout Europe. Iodine deficiency in the regions of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia adjacent to nuclear power plants became a factor in increased uptake of radioactive iodine by the thyroid gland in children and after 5 years led to an epidemic of thyroid cancer. Optimal iodine intake could become a kind of vaccination, which sharply reduces the risk of developing thyroid cancer, as has happened after the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan. Endemic goiter was eliminated 50 years ago, but returned to the country in the early 1990s after the collapse of iodized salt production and has not been eliminated to this day due to the lack of a legislative framework for mandatory salt iodization. The actual average consumption of iodine by residents of Russia is from 40 to 80 mcg per day, which is 23 times less than the recommended norm. Mild and moderate iodine deficiency was detected throughout the Russian Federation, and it is more typical for the the rural population. The iodine deficiency has the greatest negative effect on the psychomotor development of the child during the critical period the first 1000 days of life from the moment of conception to the end of the second year of life. According to WHO, over the past 20 years, iodine deficiency has been eliminated in 115 countries of the world, and the number of iodine-deficient countries has dropped to 25, but Russia is still among them. We believe that after the COVID-19 pandemic, it will no longer be necessary to prove the need for effective support for the prevention of both infectious and non-infectious diseases, and the declared preventive direction of Russian medicine will indeed become such. Радиоактивный йод, вылетевший из разрушенного реактора Чернобыльской атомной электростанции, как коронавирус, быстро распространился по Европе. Дефицит йода в прилегавших к атомной электростанции областях Украины, Беларуси и России стал фактором повышенного захвата радиоактивного йода щитовидной железой у детей и через 5 лет привел у них к эпидемии рака щитовидной железы. Оптимальное потребление йода могло бы стать своеобразной вакцинацией, резко снижающей риск развития поражения щитовидной железы, как это случилось после аварии на атомной электростанции в Фукусиме (Япония). Эндемический зоб устранен 50 лет тому назад, но вернулся в нашу страну в начале 1990-х годов после прекращения выпуска йодированной соли и остается не устраненным до настоящего времени из-за отсутствия законодательной базы для обязательного йодирования соли. Фактическое среднее потребление йода жителями России составляет от 40 до 80 мкг в день, что в 23 раза меньше рекомендованной нормы. На всей территории Российской Федерации выявлен йодный дефицит легкой и средней тяжести, причем в большей мере он характерен для питания сельского населения. Наибольший негативный эффект на психомоторное развитие ребенка йодный дефицит оказывает в критический период первые 1000 дней жизни с момента зачатия до конца второго года жизни. По данным Всемирной организации здравоохранения, за последние 20 лет йодный дефицит устранен в 115 государствах мира, а количество йододефицитных стран снизилось до 25, но Россия по-прежнему входит в их число.

618,618,32669742,"By adapting a citrate phosphate dextrose (CPD) whole blood storage bag, residual blood from a renal replacement therapy (RRT) circuit can be saved in pediatric patients, decreasing in donor exposure later. The techniques used for autologous preoperative blood storage are the basis of storing the RRT circuit blood. The CPD anticoagulant has a benefit of having a commonly used reversal agent for its anticoagulant properties, i.e., calcium. Also, unlike the traditional anticoagulants used in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), i.e., heparin, and direct thrombin inhibitors, i.e., bivalirudin, there is no increase in anticoagulation laboratory parameters after administration. The CPD volume in the bag is reduced but keeps the original ratio the same between CPD and blood. This is accomplished by removing all CPD from the bag, adding back only the exact amount of CPD needed for the smaller amount of blood being transferred from the circuit. The RRT circuit managed at our institution uses 23 mL of CPD for 165 mL of circuit blood when stored with this technique. This calculation assumes a normal patient calcium level. This technique has been used successfully multiple times in more than 30 pediatric patients without incident for 7 years at our center. The CPD bag can also be used to store the residual blood from ECMO circuits after removal of ECMO to allow the blood to be given back to the patient at a later time by keeping the same citrate-to-blood ratio.

Attendance at this visit is crucial to identify women who have persistent diabetes mellitus (DM) following pregnancies affected by gestational DM (GDM). The medical home model has eliminated barriers to care in various other settings. This study sought to improve PP attendance among women with GDM by jointly scheduling PP visits and the 2-month well infant visits. All patients with a diagnosis of GDM who received care at a New York City-based publicly insured hospital clinic and delivered between October 2017 and June 2019 were eligible. Data were obtained via chart review. The primary outcome was attendance at the PP visit compared with previously published historical controls. Secondary outcomes were rates of PP glucose screening and well infant attendance. Of the 74 patients enrolled, 41.9% were Hispanic and 17.6% were Black, mean age was 31.6 years, and 58.1% delivered vaginally. Attendance at the 6-week PP visit was 68.9%, and attendance at the infant visit was 55.1%. PP glucose testing was ordered for 76.5% of attendees at the PP visit, and of those ordered, 43.6% of attendees completed testing. All patients had joint visits requested, though only 70.3% of visits were scheduled jointly. Among those who were jointly scheduled, 71.2% of women attended, 57.7% of infants attended, and 7.7% of pairs attended on the same day. The PP visit attendance rate was not significantly different than the prior attendance rate ( This study was unable to improve PP visit attendance among women with GDM by jointly scheduling the 6-week PP visit and the 2-month well-infant visit.

The CHAMP trial compared amitriptyline and topiramate to placebo for migraine prevention in youth and proposed to analyze change in migraine days as a secondary outcome. There is considerable variability in the field regarding what constitutes a ""migraine day,"" how this is determined and reported in trials, and how consistent these measures are with diagnostic nosology. CHAMP trial completers (N = 175) were randomized to receive amitriptyline (n = 77), topiramate (n = 63), or placebo (n = 35). Participants maintained daily headache diaries where they reported each day with headache and if they considered that headache to be a migraine. For each headache day, participants completed a symptom record and reported about symptoms such as pain location(s) and presence of nausea/vomiting or photophobia and phonophobia. We examined group differences in self-reported migraine days at trial completion (summed from trial weeks 20-24) compared to baseline. We also used an algorithm to determine whether participants' symptom reports met ICHD-3 criteria for migraine without aura, and examined the association between self-reported and ""nosology-derived"" migraine days. Results showed no significant differences between groups in self-reported migraine days over the course of the trial. Self-reported and ""nosology-derived"" migraine days during the baseline and treatment phases were strongly associated (r's = 0.73 and 0.83, respectively; p's < 0.001). Regardless of treatment, CHAMP trial completers showed clinically important reductions in self-reported migraine days over the course of the trial (about 3.8 days less). The strong association between self-reported and ""nosology-derived"" migraine days suggests youth with migraine can recognize a day with migraine and reliably report their headache features and symptoms.

The aim of this study was to evaluate efficiency, effectiveness, and possible adverse effects (increased occurrence of thyroid autoimmunity and hyperthyroidism) of the Italian iodine prophylaxis program. From 2015 to 2019, a nationwide survey was performed. The use of iodized salt was evaluated in a sample of 164 593 adults and in 998 school canteens. A sample of 4233 schoolchildren (aged 11-13 years) was recruited to assess urinary iodine concentration, prevalence of goiter, and thyroid hypoechogenicity on ultrasound, with the latter being an indirect indicator of thyroid autoimmunity. Neonatal TSH values of 197 677 infants screened in regions representative of Northern, Central, and Southern Italy were analyzed to investigate the percentage of TSH values >5.0 mIU/L. Data on methimazole prescriptions were analyzed as indirect indicators of new cases of hyperthyroidism. The prevalence of the use of iodized salt was 71.5% in adult population and 78% in school canteens. A median urinary iodine concentration of 124 μg/L, a prevalence of goiter of 2.2%, and a prevalence of thyroid hypoechogenicity of 5.7% were observed in schoolchildren. The percentage of neonatal TSH values >5.0 mIU/L resulted still higher (5.1%) than the World Health Organization threshold of 3.0%, whereas the prescriptions of methimazole showed a reduction of 13.5%.

Conservation is achieved by recycling of glucose carbon as lactate, pyruvate and alanine, and a profound decrease in the oxidation of glucose by the brain brought about by the provision and use of ketones. What glucose continues to be oxidized is for the most part formed from glycerol. Gluconeogenesis from protein plays little part in the process. Fasting hypoglycemia results from disorders affecting either one of the two critical sustaining factors--the recycling process or the availability and use of ketones.

630,630,9034972,"The population of the canton Basel-City has been provided with fluoridated water since May 1962. This paper presents a summary of basic findings from evaluations of this public health intervention. Standard methods were used for assessing dental caries, enamel fluorosis, urinary fluoride, and other data. Caries prevalence of schoolchildren declined until 1977 because of water fluoridation, after which it continued to decline until the late 1980s due to reasons other than water fluoridation. Caries prevalence in Basel was at least as low as in those other parts of Switzerland where either school-based dental health education programs or comprehensive salt fluoridation programs had been implemented for many years. Enamel fluorosis was seen in 38 percent of the children, similar to regions with comprehensive salt fluoridation, but higher than in low-fluoride regions. Overlap of salt and water fluoridation in families consuming both fluoridated water and fluoridated salt has occurred, but has not resulted in problems. Fluoride concentrations (close to, but mostly below 1.0 ppm) and excretions (0.45-0.80 mg F per day in children, around 1 mg in adults) corresponded to expected levels. Statistics from both the School Dental Service and the Public Dental Clinic indicate a dramatic reduction in the amount of conservation dentistry being done and, in adults, prosthetic services. Political steps to remove water fluoridation were taken in 1976, 1982, 1989, and 1993, but have not been successful. Water fluoridation has resulted in the expected benefit and continues to exist beside salt fluoridation used in the other cantons of Switzerland.

Factors that affect neurological outcome are not clear. A questionnaire was sent throughout Japan to each pediatrician treating any of the 42 MSUD patients. Necessary information was available for 13 patients through the questionnaire, and through a publication for one patient. In nine of the 14 patients episodes of metabolic decompensation developed in the neonatal period. In the other five, the onset of disease was delayed until infancy or later. In the nine patients with neonatal onset, a pretreatment level of plasma leucine greater than 40 mg/100 mL or a duration of altered level of alertness longer than 10 days was associated with a poor neurological outcome. The therapeutic measures employed included intravenous infusion of glucose and electrolyte solution or hypertonic glucose and electrolyte solution, exchange transfusion, peritoneal dialysis, a large dose of thiamine and intravenous hyperalimentation. All patients had survived the episodes and were alive at the time of the survey. Five of the nine patients with neonatal onset have developed neurological sequelae to varying degrees. Episodes of metabolic decompensation in infancy or thereafter did not affect, or only minimally affected, the neurological outcome.

Salivary pH was measured just prior to giving the solutions and then every five minutes for 60 minutes. The critical pH was defined at 5.5, below which dental demineralization occurs. In this population, valproic acid decreased salivary pH to below the critical pH for an extended period of time (mean = 4.32 at 20 minutes) when compared to mean salivary pH after administration of distilled water (7.11 at 20 minutes) and a 10% sucrose solution (5.96 at 20 minutes). Recovery from this low pH to above the critical level did not occur until after 50 minutes and furthermore did not recover to baseline, neutral levels, for the duration of this study (60 minutes).

Areas with a low CRQIS and areas with a high GP had a relatively high incidence of thyroid cancer. Regression models showed that a low CRQIS and a high GP in children aged 8-10 years (both reflecting iodine deficiency status) play a substantial role in thyroid cancer incidence in both males and females. Additionally, living in coastal areas and having a high annual income may also increase the risk of thyroid cancer.

Measurements of urine iodine excretion in 663 schoolchildren of both sexes, aged 9-16 years, from Zagreb, Rude, Bednja, Osijek, Dakovo, Rijeka, Pazin and Dubrovnik showed that from 77.9% to 94.8% of subjects have had urinary iodine above 5 microg/dl. Also from 41.2% to 70.8% of children have had urinary iodine excretion above 10 microg/dl. Before introduction of a new law mostly borderline values of urinary iodine excretion were recorded; therefore recent values present significant positive shift and actually they are the best signs of almost adequate iodine intake in Croatian youth. Nevertheless, further measures for improvement of iodine intake are recommendable because still 31% of controlled table-salt samples from households and 15.7% of imported salt samples have had KI level below 20 mg/kg of NaCl. Salt produced in Croatia was (Pag and Nin salt plants) completely in accordance with iodination regulations.

At age 46 they participated in clinical examination including measurements of glucose, lipids, and IR and answered a questionnaire including information about their nutrition and physical activity. The information on parental SMI was obtained from the Hospital Discharge Register. Parents with SMI were those who had been treated in hospital for any psychiatric disorder during 1969-1982 (ICD-8 codes 290-315). The final study group included 334 (7.3 %) offspring who had a parent with SMI and 4249 (92.7 %) offspring in the comparison group. We did not find increased risk for disturbances in lipid levels, insulin levels, or IR levels between the study group (offspring of either parent with SMI) compared with the comparison group. All offspring, especially female offspring of either parent with SMI, had an increased risk for higher glucose levels and waist circumference. The results remained the same after excluding offspring with SMI.

Recently, several studies have reported the effect of alterations in the spermidine pool on metabolic pathways. It has been shown that activation of spermidine/spermine N-1-acetyl-transferase (SSAT), the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine catabolism, improved glucose and lipid metabolism. In addition, spermidine supplementation has been shown to protect against diet-induced obesity in animal models. However, some clinical studies demonstrated that polyamine levels are increased in childhood obesity and metabolic syndrome patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), while polyamine-rich food is associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

In severe cases bilateral nephrectomies are considered but may be associated with significant neurological complications and life-threatening hypotension. We describe a case of a 17 months old boy with genetically confirmed ARPKD who underwent sequential bilateral nephrectomies at the age of 4 and 10 months. Following the second nephrectomy the boy was started on continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis with blood pressure on the lower range. At the age of 12 months after a few days of poor feeding at home the boy experienced a severe episode of hypotension and coma of Glasgow Come Scale of three. Brain magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) showed signs of hemorrhage, cytotoxic cerebral edema and diffuse cerebral atrophy. During the subsequent 72 h he developed seizures requiring anti-epileptic drug therapy, gradually regained consciousness but remained significantly hypotensive after discontinuation of vasopressors. Thus, he received high doses of sodium chloride orally and intraperitoneally as well as midodrine hydrochloride. His ultrafiltration (UF) was targeted to keep him in mild-to-moderate fluid overload. After two months of stable condition the patient started to develop hypertension requiring four antihypertensive medications. After optimizing peritoneal dialysis to avoid fluid overload and discontinuation of sodium chloride the antihypertensives were discontinued, but hyponatremia with hypotensive episodes reoccurred. Sodium chloride was reintroduced resulting in recurrent salt-dependent hypertension. Our case report illustrates an unusual course of blood pressure changes following bilateral nephrectomies in an infant with ARPKD and the particular importance of tight regulation of sodium chloride supplementation. The case adds to the scarce literature about clinical sequences of bilateral nephrectomies in infants, and as well highlights the challenge of managing blood pressure in these patients.

According to the World Health Organization, a median UIC in the range 100-199 μg/L indicates adequate and 200-299 μg/L more than adequate intake. Thyroglobulin (Tg) may be a promising functional biomarker of both iodine deficiency and excess. Using a standardized dried blood spots-Tg assay in children, we evaluated the Tg response to both low- and high-iodine intake and estimated the population cutoff point for iodine deficiency or excess. Also, we compared thyroid functions within the UIC ranges of 100-199 vs 200-299 μg/L. We conducted a cross-sectional study in primary schools in 12 countries. SUBJECTS were 6 to 12 years old (n = 2512). We measured UIC, TSH, total T4, Tg, and thyroid antibodies. Over a range of iodine intakes from severely deficient to excessive, Tg concentrations showed a clear U-shaped curve. Compared with iodine-sufficient children, there was a significantly higher prevalence of elevated Tg values in children with iodine deficiency (UIC <100 μg/L) and iodine excess (UIC >300 μg/L). There was no significant change in the prevalence of elevated Tg, TSH, T4, or thyroid antibodies comparing children within the UIC ranges of 100-199 vs 200-299 μg/L. In school-aged children, 1) Tg is a sensitive indicator of both low and excess iodine intake; 2) a median Tg of <13 μg/L and/or <3% of Tg values >40 μg/L indicates iodine sufficiency in the population; 3) the acceptable range of median UIC in monitoring iodized salt programs could be widened to a single category of sufficient iodine intake from 100 to 299 μg/L.

Usually investigators have used biopsy or a dual sugar absorption test to assess environmental enteropathy. Such tests are time and resource intensive, restricting their utility as screening methods. Serum endotoxin core antibody (EndoCab) concentration is a potential indicator of intestinal inflammation and integrity, and thus may be useful to predict environmental enteropathy. We analyzed the association of serum EndoCab levels versus linear growth and lactulose-mannitol assay results in 2-5 year old rural Malawian children. This was an observational study of 388 rural, asymptomatic Malawian children who had anthropometric measurements taken at least every 3 months since birth.

With poor infrastructure and inadequate personnel, over 80% of children with dental caries remain untreated. To reduce this burden of disease, one key goal is to promote good oral health and address oral diseases through prevention, screening, and treatment among children. While all policies have been proven to be effective in the control and prevention of dental caries, it is unclear which of those strategies provide value for money. This study evaluated five caries preventative strategies in terms of the cost and benefits among South African school children. The study uses a hypothetical South African population of school aged learners aged 5-15. The context and insights of the strategies utilized at the schools were informed by data from both grey and published literature. Using Markov modeling techniques, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of Acidulated Phosphate Fluoride (APF) application, atraumatic restorative treatment (ART), sugar-reduction and fissure sealants. Markov model was used to depict the movement of a hypothetical patient cohort between different health states over time. We assessed both health outcomes and costs of various interventions. The health outcome metric was measured as the number of Decayed, Missing, Filled Tooth (DMFT). The net monetary benefit was then used to determine which intervention was most cost-effective. The results showed that school-based caries prevention strategies are cost-effective compared to the status quo of doing nothing. The average cost per learner over the 10-year period ranged from ZAR4380 to approx. ZAR7300 for the interventions considered. The total costs (including screening) associated with the interventions and health outcome (DMFT averted) were: sugar reduction (ZAR91,380, DFMT: 63,762), APF-Gel (ZAR54 million, DMFT: 42,010), tooth brushing (ZAR72.8 million, DMFT: 74,018), fissure sealant (ZAR44.63 million, DMFT: 100,024), and ART (ZAR45 million, DMFT: 144,035). The net monetary benefits achieved for APF-Gel, sugar reduction, tooth brushing, fissure sealant and ART programs were ZAR1.56, ZAR2.45, ZAR2.78, ZAR3.81, and ZAR5.55 billion, respectively. Based on the net monetary benefit, ART, fissure sealant and sugar-reduction appear to be the most cost-effective strategies for preventing caries in South Africa.

670,670,33342436,"Oral rehydration solution (ORS) is a simple intervention that can prevent childhood deaths from severe diarrhea and dehydration. In a previous study, we mapped the use of ORS treatment subnationally and found that ORS coverage increased over time, while the use of home-made alternatives or recommended home fluids (RHF) decreased, in many countries. These patterns were particularly striking within Senegal, Mali, and Sierra Leone. It was unclear, however, whether ORS replaced RHF in these locations or if children were left untreated, and if these patterns were associated with health policy changes. We used a Bayesian geostatistical model and data from household surveys to map the percentage of children with diarrhea that received (1) any ORS, (2) only RHF, or (3) no oral rehydration treatment between 2000 and 2018. This approach allowed examination of whether RHF was replaced with ORS before and after interventions, policies, and external events that may have impacted healthcare access. We found that RHF was replaced with ORS in most Sierra Leone districts, except those most impacted by the Ebola outbreak. In addition, RHF was replaced in northern but not in southern Mali, and RHF was not replaced anywhere in Senegal. In Senegal, there was no statistical evidence that a national policy promoting ORS use was associated with increases in coverage. In Sierra Leone, ORS coverage increased following a national policy change that abolished health costs for children. Children in parts of Mali and Senegal have been left behind during ORS scale-up.

Treatments assessed were toothbrushing with fluoride toothpaste, fluoride varnish, and xylitol in food for children, and xylitol gum and chlorhexidine rinse for mothers. The interview assessment included presentation of illustrated cards with verbal description of treatment, photograph/video clip, and treatment samples. Parents rated the acceptability of each treatment (1-5 scale) and treatment preferences within each of 10 possible pairs.

A narrative review of the potential positive and negative effects of lactose in the treatment of undernourished children. Searches were conducted using PUBMED and Web of Science up to July 2015. Relevant references in the retrieved articles were included. Lactose may exhibit several health benefits in young children, including a prebiotic effect on the gut microbiota and a positive effect on mineral absorption. Studies in piglets suggest there might also be a stimulating effect on growth, relative to other carbohydrates. Lactose intolerance is a potential concern for undernourished children. Most undernourished children seem to tolerate the currently recommended (low lactose level) therapeutic foods well. However, a subgroup of severely undernourished children with secondary lactase deficiency due to severe diarrhea or severe enteropathy may benefit from products with even more restricted lactose content. At limited extra costs, lactose or lactose-containing milk ingredients may have beneficial effects if added to food products for undernourished children.

679,679,36528009,"There is considerable clinical evidence that topiramate (TPM) has a high potential in the treatment of refractory and super-refractory status epilepticus (RSE, SRSE). Because TPM is only approved for oral administration, it is applied as suspension via a nasogastric tube for SE treatment. However, this route of administration is impractical in an emergency setting and leads to variable absorption with unpredictable plasma levels and time to peak concentration. Thus, the development of an intravenous (i.v.) solution for TPM is highly desirable. Here we present data on two parenteral formulations of TPM that are currently being developed. One of these solutions is using sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin (SBE-β-CD; Captisol®) as an excipient. A 1% solution of TPM in 10% Captisol® has been reported to be well tolerated in safety studies in healthy volunteers and patients with epilepsy or migraine, but efficacy data are not available. The other solution uses the FDA- and EMA-approved excipient amino sugar meglumine. Meglumine is much more effective to dissolve TPM in water than Captisol®. A 1% solution of TPM can be achieved with 0.5-1% of meglumine. While the use of Captisol®-containing solutions is restricted in children and patients with renal impairment, such restrictions do not apply to meglumine. Recently, first-in-human data were reported for a meglumine-based solution of TPM, indicating safety and efficacy when used as a replacement for oral administration in a woman with epilepsy. Based on the multiple mechanisms of action of TPM that directly target the molecular neuronal alterations that are thought to underlie the loss of efficacy of benzodiazepines and other anti-seizure medications during prolonged SE and its rapid brain penetration after i.v. administration, we suggest that parenteral (i.v.) TPM is ideally suited for the treatment of RSE and SRSE. This paper was presented at the 8th London-Innsbruck Colloquium on Status Epilepticus and Acute Seizures held in September 2022.

The use of iodated salt in relation to anthropometric data was examined from recent survey data. After potential confounding factors had been controlled for, significant associations were seen in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. The use of iodated salt was related to increased weight-for-age and mid-upper-arm circumference, most strongly in the second year of life, mainly affecting soft tissue (thinness). The relation with weight-for-age was greater among children of mothers with lower body mass index. The use of iodated salt was related to birthweight in Sri Lanka and in the Philippines, where iodized oil capsules given during pregnancy had a negative effect when used with high levels of iodine in salt. The associations generally were concentrated in large geographic areas, possibly because of interactions with other environmental factors (e.g., selenium and arsenic).

Bactericidal antimicrobials were effective for systemic anthrax; addition of a protein synthesis inhibitor(s) (PSI) to a bactericidal antimicrobial(s) did not improve survival. Likewise, addition of antitoxin/antiserum to antimicrobials did not improve survival. Mannitol improved survival for meningitis patients, but steroids did not. PEPAbx reduced risk of anthrax following exposure to B. anthracis. Combination therapy appeared to be superior to monotherapy for inhalation anthrax without meningitis.

689,689,29337718,"Physical activity (PA) is important in the prevention and treatment of impaired glucose metabolism. However, association of physical inactivity during the transition between childhood and adulthood with glucose metabolism is unknown. Therefore, we studied the association of persistent physical inactivity since childhood with glucose metabolism in adulthood. Data were drawn from the ongoing, Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study with repeated follow-ups between 1980 and 2011 (baseline age, 3-18 yr; n = 3596). Impaired glucose metabolism was defined as having impaired fasting glucose (6.1-6.9 mmol·L) or type 2 diabetes in adulthood. Leisure-time PA habits were repeatedly collected with a standardized questionnaire and expressed as a PA Index. Using PA Index, four groups were formed (n = 2000): 1) persistently low PA, 2) decreasingly active, 3) increasingly active, and 4) persistently active subjects. Poisson regression model was used to examine the association between PA groups and impaired glucose metabolism. The proportion of the sample with impaired glucose metabolism was 16.1% in individuals with persistently low PA, 14.5% in decreasingly active, 6.8% in increasingly active, and 11.1% in persistently active. Compared with individuals with persistently low PA, age and sex-adjusted risk for impaired glucose metabolism were lower in those who increased PA (relative risk [RR], 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29-0.76) and in those who were persistently active (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51-0.97), but similar in those who decreased PA (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.66-1.36). Persistently physically inactive lifestyle from youth to adulthood is associated with increased risk of impaired glucose metabolism in adulthood. Importantly, a moderate increase in PA lowered the risk. The results highlight the importance of avoiding physically inactive lifestyle at all stages of life.

We compared the saliva microbiota profiles in children with and without caries. The study consisted of 617 children aged 9-12 years from the Finnish Health in Teens (Fin-HIT) study with available register data on oral health. Caries status was summarised based on Decayed, Missing, and Filled Teeth (DMFT) index in permanent dentition. The children were then classified into the following two groups: DMFT value ≥ 1 was considered as cavitated caries lesions (hereafter called 'caries') (n = 208) and DMFT = 0 as 'cavity free' (n = 409). Bacterial 16S rRNA gene (V3-V4 regions) was amplified using PCR and sequenced by Illumina HiSeq. The mean age (SD) of the children was 11.7 (0.4) years and 56% were girls. The children had relatively good dental health with mean DMFT of 0.86 (1.97). Since sex was the key determinant of microbiota composition (p = 0.014), we focused on sex-stratified analysis. Alpha diversity indexes did not differ between caries and cavity free groups in either sexes (Shannon: p = 0.40 and 0.58; Inverse Simpson: p = 0.51 and 0.60, in boys and girls, respectively); neither did the composition differ between the groups (p = 0.070 for boys and p = 0.230 for girls). At the genus level, Paludibacter and Labrenzia had higher abundances in the caries group compared to cavity free group in both sexes (p < 0.001). Taken together, there were minor differences in saliva microbiota between children with and without caries. Potential biomarkers of caries were the sugar metabolisers Paludibacter and Labrenzia. These bacteria presumably enhance salivary acidification, which contributes to progression of dental caries. The clinical relevance of our findings warrants further studies.

Prospective randomized simulation-based study. Single pediatric tertiary medical referral center. Pediatric nurses and adult or pediatric pharmacists. Subjects were randomized to prepare medication doses for one of four medication sequences and stratified by one of three weight categories representative of a neonate/infant, child, or adult-sized adolescent: 4, 20, and 50 kg. Using provided supplies and dosing references, subjects prepared doses of calcium chloride, calcium gluconate, sodium bicarbonate, and regular insulin with dextrose. Because insulin and dextrose are traditionally prepared and delivered together, they were analyzed as one drug. Subjects preparing medications were video-recorded for the purpose of extracting timing data. A total of 12 nurses and 12 pharmacists were enrolled. The median (interquartile range) total preparation time for the three drugs was 9.5 minutes (6.4-13.7 min). Drugs were prepared significantly faster for larger children (50 kg, 6.8 min [5.6-9.1 min] vs 20 kg, 9.5 min [8.6-13.0 min] vs 4 kg, 16.3 min [12.7-18.9 min]; p = 0.001).

Islets were isolated from 5 infants/toddlers (11-36 month-old) and perifused to characterize their dynamics of insulin secretion when subjected to various stimuli and inhibitors. Their insulin responses were compared to those previously reported for similarly treated adult islets. Qualitatively, infant islets responded like adult islets to stimulation by glucose, tolbutamide, forskolin (to increase cAMP), arginine and the combination of leucine and glutamine, and to inhibition by diazoxide and CaCl2 omission. This similarity included the concentration-dependency and biphasic pattern of glucose-induced insulin secretion, the dynamics of the responses to non-glucose stimuli and metabolic amplification of these responses. The insulin content was not different, but fractional insulin secretion rates were lower in infant than adult islets irrespective of the stimulus. However, the stimulation index was similar because basal secretion rates were also lower in infant islets. In conclusion, human β-cells are functionally mature by the age of one year, before expansion of their mass is complete. Their responsiveness (stimulation index) to all stimuli is not smaller than that of adult β-cells. Yet, under basal and stimulated conditions, they secrete smaller proportions of their insulin stores in keeping with smaller in vivo insulin needs during infancy.

700,700,27314045,"Background. The use of miRNAs as biomarkers for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) risk is attractive as T1D is usually diagnosed in front of acute symptoms. As miR-375 is highly expressed in the endocrine pancreas, we postulated that its circulating level might reflect beta cell alterations and might be altered in the blood of T1D patients recently diagnosed. Methods. Sera were obtained from 22 T1D children at onset of the disease, before subcutaneous insulin treatment, and from 10 nondiabetic pediatric controls. MiR-375 seric level was quantified by stem-loop RT-PCR-based assay. MiRNAs regulations in isolated human islets in response to high glucose concentrations were determined by TaqMan Low-Density Array. Results. The abundance of miR-375, among the 410 miRNAs detected in human islets, mirrored its well-established role in rodent islet biology. Upregulated miRNAs targeted genes involved in islet homeostasis and regulation of beta cell mass. Downregulated miRNAs, including miR-375, were involved in pancreas secretion and protein turnover. Seric level of miR-375 was lower in T1D children versus age-matched controls, without any correlations with HbA1c, glycaemia, and number of autoantibodies. Conclusion. Altered circulating level of miR-375 at onset of T1D might be a general biomarker of metabolic alterations and inflammation associated with the disease.

In this regard, human infant umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are an emerging tool. However, long-term clinical relevance to in vivo markers of metabolic disease is unknown. In a cohort of 124 mother/child dyads, this study tested the hypothesis that triglyceride content (TG) of infant MSCs undergoing adipogenesis in vitro (MSC-TG) is associated with in vivo adiposity (percent fat mass) from birth to early childhood and with fasting glucose and insulin in early childhood. MSC-TG was positively associated with in vivo child adiposity at birth, age 4 to 6 months, and age 4 to 6 years. MSC-TG was associated with fasting glucose, but not insulin, at 4 to 6 years. Importantly, MSC-TG explained an additional 13% variance in child adiposity at 4 to 6 years, after accounting for other established birth predictors (weight and percent fat mass at birth) and other established covariates related to child adiposity (e.g., breastfeeding exposure, physical activity).

Lonapegsomatropin is a prodrug consisting of unmodified GH transiently conjugated to methoxypolyethylene glycol which enables time-release of GH with a half-life of ~25 hours allowing for once-weekly administration. Clinical trials of lonapegsomatropin have demonstrated positive efficacy results in children (phase 2 and 3) and adults (phase 2) with GHD. The phase 3 trial in children with GHD established non-inferiority and statistical superiority of height velocity with lonapegsomatropin (11.2 cm/yr) compared to daily GH (10.3 cm/yr), with no concerning side effects with lonapegsomatropin. Similar growth responses have been reported in other LAGH products in phase 2 (somapacitan) and phase 3 (somatrogon) trials. Lonapegsomatropin is distributed in temperature-stable, prefilled cartridges at 9 different doses that can be prescribed based upon specific weight brackets designed to deliver approximately 0.24 mg/kg/wk. An electronic delivery device is required to combine the powdered medication with the diluent and deliver the medication subcutaneously through a small gauge needle to the recipient. The pharmacodynamic data from the clinical trials of lonapegsomatropin has been used to develop models to estimate an average IGF-1 value drawn at any time during the weekly injection interval. This average IGF-1 value may be used to for safety monitoring and/or to guide dose adjustment. New LAGH products, including lonapegsomatropin, may potentially improve patient adherence, quality of life and clinical outcomes, particularly in patients with poor adherence to daily GH injections in the future. With the availability of new LAGH products, clinicians will need to identify the best candidates for LAGH therapy and understand how to monitor and adjust therapy. Long-term surveillance studies are needed to demonstrate adherence, efficacy, cost-effectiveness and safety of LAGH preparations.

It impairs cerebral perfusion and may cause death due to global ischaemia and intracranial herniation. Osmotic agents are widely used to control ICP. In children, guidelines for their use are mainly guided by adult studies. We conducted this review to determine the current evidence of the effectiveness of osmotic agents and their effect on resolution of coma and outcome in children with acute encephalopathy. We searched several databases for published and unpublished studies in English and French languages, between January 1966 and March 2009. We considered studies on the use of osmotic agents in children aged between 0 and 16 years with acute encephalopathies. We examined reduction in intracranial pressure, time to resolution of coma, and occurrence of neurological sequelae and death. We identified four randomized controlled trials, three prospective studies, two retrospective studies and one case report. Hypertonic saline (HS) achieved greater reduction in intracranial pressure (ICP) compared to mannitol and other fluids; normal saline or ringer's lactate. This effect was sustained for longer when it was given as continuous infusion. Boluses of glycerol and mannitol achieved transient reduction in ICP. Oral glycerol was associated with lower mortality and neurological sequelae when compared to placebo in children with acute bacterial meningitis. HS was associated with lower mortality when compared to mannitol in children with non-traumatic encephalopathies. HS appears to achieve a greater reduction in ICP than other osmotic agents. Oral glycerol seems to improve outcome among children with acute bacterial meningitis.

SPM analysis demonstrated extensive glucose hypometabolism in the aggressive group bilaterally in the temporal and prefrontal cortex compared with that in normal adult controls. A focal area of medial prefrontal glucose hypometabolism was defined in the aggressive children as compared with the nonaggressive pediatric group with SPM, whereas ROI comparison of these groups confirmed prefrontal hypometabolism and also showed glucose hypometabolism of the temporal neocortex in the aggressive children. Severity of aggression correlated inversely with glucose metabolism of the left temporal as well as bilateral medial prefrontal cortex. Bilateral prefrontal and temporal neocortical brain glucose hypometabolism in children with epilepsy and aggressive behavior may indicate a widespread dysfunction of cortical regions, which normally exert an inhibitory effect on subcortical aggressive impulses.

To gain traction as an effective health communication tool, SAS videos must demonstrate their potential to engage a diverse and global audience. In this study, we evaluate engagement with a SAS video about the consumption of added sugars, which is narrated by a child (a nonthreatening character), a mother (a neutral layperson), or a physician (a medical expert). This study aims to (1) assess whether engagement with the sugar intervention video differs by narrator type (child, mother, physician) and trait proneness to reactance and (2) assess whether the demographic characteristics of the participants (age, gender, education status) are associated with different engagement profiles with the sugar intervention video. In December 2020, after 4013 participants from the United Kingdom completed our randomized controlled trial, we offered participants assigned to the placebo arms (n=1591, 39.65%) the choice to watch the sugar intervention video (without additional compensation) as posttrial access to treatment. We measured engagement as the time that participants chose to watch the 3.42-minute video and collected data on age, gender, education status, and trait reactance proneness. Using ordinary least squares regression, we quantified the association of the demographic characteristics and trait reactance proneness with the sugar video view time. Overall, 66.43% (n=1047) of the 1576 participants in the 2 placebo arms voluntarily watched the sugar intervention video. The mean view time was 116.35 (52.4%) of 222 seconds. Results show that view times did not differ by narrator (child, mother, physician) and that older participants (aged 25-59 years, mean = 125.2 seconds) watched the sugar video longer than younger adults (aged 18-25 years, mean = 83.4 seconds). View time remained consistent across education levels. Participants with low trait reactance (mean = 119.3 seconds) watched the intervention video longer than high-trait-reactance participants (mean = 95.3 seconds), although this association did not differ by narrator type.

Although the administration of octreotide is considered effective in patients that remain hypoglycaemic despite glucose administration, experience in children is limited. A retrospective chart review of the clinical features of all children following sulfonylurea ingestion presenting between April 2001 and November 2008 at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. Ten children were identified with sulfonylurea exposure; six were classified as suspected ingestion and four had confirmed signs of sulfonylurea overdoses (mean age: 8.2 years; range 1.5 - 15). All four patients with confirmed ingestion were exposed to glyburide and developed severe hypoglycaemia; two were toddlers and two teenagers. Ingestion was accidental in the case of the toddlers, and suicidal attempts in the case of the adolescents. All patients were initially treated with glucose infusions. Both toddlers also received octreotide with favourable response and no rebound hypoglyacemia. The two teenagers were treated only with prolonged glucose infusions; in both cases rebound hypoglycaemia and increased glucose requirements were observed. Glyburide-induced hypoglycaemia was pronounced in all patients identified. Treatment with octreotide proved effective in the 2 infants treated, agreeing with the limited experience reported to date in the literature, and suggesting that octreotide should be considered the treatment of choice in children.

This study aimed to clarify the effect of neutral PDS in preventing morphological changes by assessing peritoneal damage and comparing morphological alterations between PD patients treated with neutral PDS and acidic PDS. Sixty-one patients participated from seven hospitals. All patients were treated with neutral PDS excluding icodextrin, during their entire PD treatment, and experienced no episode of peritonitis. The thickness of submesothelial compact (SMC) zone and the presence of vasculopathy in the anterior parietal abdominal peritoneum were assessed. The impact of icodextrin, hybrid therapy, and peritoneal rest and lavage in morphological alterations were determined. There was no significant difference in the average SMC thickness between neutral and acidic PDS. The vessel patency in patients using neutral PDS was significantly higher compared to that in acidic PDS at any time during PD. There were no significant suppressive effects from interventions or use of icodextrin with respect to peritoneal morphological injury.

Using data from the Swedish pediatric registry for diabetes (SweDiabKids) and the registry for adults (NDR), all individuals with T1D with a duration of diabetes of less than 10 years between 1998 and 2017 were included. We calculated the crude incidence rates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and used multivariable Cox regression to estimate crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for two cohorts: retinopathy cohort or kidney disease cohort, stratified by eGDR categories: < 4, 4 to 5.99, 6 to 7.99, and ≥ 8 mg/kg/min (reference). A total of 22 146 (10 289 retinopathy cohort, and 11 857 kidney disease cohort with an overlapping of 9575) children and adults with T1D (median age 21 years, female 42% and diabetes duration of 6 and 7 years, respectively for the cohorts) were studied. During a median follow-up of 4.8 years (IQR 2.6-7.7) there were 5040 (24.7%), 1909 (48.1%), 504 (52.3%) and 179 (57.6%) events for retinopathy in individuals with an eGDR ≥ 8, 7.99 to 6, 5.99 to 4, and < 4 mg/kg/min, respectively. Corresponding numbers for kidney disease was 1321 (6.5%), 526 (13.3%), 255 (26.8%) and 145 (46.6%). After multiple adjustments for different covariates, individuals with an eGDR 7.99 to 6, 5.99 to 4 and < 4 mg/kg/min, had an increased risk of retinopathy compared to those with an eGDR ≥ 8 mg/kg/min (adjusted HRs, 95% CIs) 1.29 (1.20 to 1.40); 1.50 (1.31 to 1.71) and 1.74 (1.41 to 2.14).

724,724,37802200,"Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a distinctive form of diabetes that first presents in pregnancy. While most women return to normoglycemia after delivery, they are nearly ten times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than women with uncomplicated pregnancies. Current prevention strategies remain limited due to our incomplete understanding of the early underpinnings of progression. To comprehensively characterize the postpartum profiles of women shortly after a GDM pregnancy and identify key mechanisms responsible for the progression to overt type 2 diabetes using multi-dimensional approaches. We conducted a nested case-control study of 200 women from the Study of Women, Infant Feeding and Type 2 Diabetes After GDM Pregnancy (SWIFT) to examine biochemical, proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic profiles at 6-9 weeks postpartum (baseline) after a GDM pregnancy. At baseline and annually up to two years, SWIFT administered research 2-hour 75-gram oral glucose tolerance tests. Women who developed incident type 2 diabetes within four years of delivery (incident case group, n = 100) were pair-matched by age, race, and pre-pregnancy body mass index to those who remained free of diabetes for at least 8 years (control group, n = 100). Correlation analyses were used to assess and integrate relationships across profiling platforms. At baseline, all 200 women were free of diabetes. The case group was more likely to present with dysglycemia (e.g., impaired fasting glucose levels, glucose tolerance, or both). We also detected differences between groups across all omic platforms. Notably, protein profiles revealed an underlying inflammatory response with perturbations in protease inhibitors, coagulation components, extracellular matrix components, and lipoproteins, whereas metabolite and lipid profiles implicated disturbances in amino acids and triglycerides at individual and class levels with future progression. We identified significant correlations between profile features and fasting plasma insulin levels, but not with fasting glucose levels. Additionally, specific cross-omic relationships, particularly among proteins and lipids, were accentuated or activated in the case group but not the control group. Overall, we applied orthogonal, complementary profiling techniques to uncover an inflammatory response linked to elevated triglyceride levels shortly after a GDM pregnancy, which is more pronounced in women who progress to overt diabetes.

Group 1 included 11 children with thyroid volumes greater than the 97th percentile according to age and sex criteria suggested by the World Health Organization International Council for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders and urinary iodine level lower than 100 microg/l. Group 2 included 30 children with thyroid volumes greater than the 97th percentile and urinary iodine level equal to or higher than 100 microg/l. The control group included 25 children who had normal thyroid volume and urinary iodine level. All children were examined by thyroid duplex sonography. Peak systolic velocity (PSV) and resistance index (RI) were measured in the inferior thyroid artery bilaterally. PSV in group 1 was significantly higher than in group 2 and in the control group (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). There was no significant difference between the PSV of group 2 and the control group. The RI in groups 1 and 2 was significantly lower than in the control group (P < 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively).

728,728,36706218,"In pediatric patients being transported for management of diabetic ketoacidosis, laboratory tests will frequently be trended throughout transportation and subsequently immediately repeated upon arrival to a particular institution. These laboratory tests may not add value to a patient's care trajectory and therefore may be unnecessary. This study examines differences between pH, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, and glucose levels drawn during transportation and those drawn at our home institution immediately upon arrival to determine if repeating those laboratory tests upon arrival to the emergency department serves any purpose in adding to patient care. This study compares pH, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, and glucose levels drawn during transport and at our home institution. Box and whisker plots between transport and institution laboratory values were constructed. A Wilcoxon signed rank test was performed to determine differences between pH, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, and glucose levels, as these value sets were not normally distributed. A paired t test was performed to determine differences between transport and institution chloride values given that these value sets were normally distributed. Savings were then calculated based on charges to the patient to determine overall cost savings by not immediately repeating these laboratory tests upon presentation. Box and whisker plots showed marked similarity between laboratory tests drawn in transport and those immediately upon arrival to our ED. Paired t test did not demonstrate a statistical difference between transport and ED chloride levels ( P = 0.5699); therefore, we failed to reject the null hypothesis. Wilcoxon signed rank test did not demonstrate a statistical difference between transport and ED pH ( P = 0.1294) and potassium ( P = 0.4523) values; therefore, we failed to reject the null hypothesis. However, Wilcoxon signed rank test did demonstrate a statistically significant difference between uncorrected sodium ( P = 0.0006), corrected sodium ( P = 0.0075), bicarbonate ( P = <0.0001), and glucose levels ( P = 0.0086). Although there were some statistically significant differences between the laboratory value sets, it is arguable whether there are any clinically significant differences between them.Based on our failure to show a clinically significant difference between laboratory values drawn during transportation and those drawn immediately upon presentation to the institution, repeating laboratory draws after transportation do not add value to a patient's care trajectory.

In this study of 103 children ages 7-11 years old, we investigated whether dietary fructose intake was related to alterations in hippocampal volume and connectivity in humans. To examine if these associations were specific to fructose or were related to dietary sugars intake in general, we explored relationships between dietary intake of added sugars and the monosaccharide, glucose, on the same brain measures. We found that increased dietary intake of fructose, measured as a percentage of total calories, was associated with both an increase in the volume of the CA2/3 subfield of the right hippocampus and increased axial, radial, and mean diffusivity in the prefrontal connections of the right cingulum. These findings are consistent with the idea that increased fructose consumption during childhood may be associated with an inflammatory process, and/or decreases or delays in myelination and/or pruning. Increased habitual consumption of glucose or added sugar in general were associated with an increased volume of right CA2/3, but not with any changes in the connectivity of the hippocampus.

Experimental and observational studies involving children or adolescents between 0 and 18 years of age were included. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed by pooling data across all studies, separately for experimental and observational studies, and restricting to studies with sodium intake and blood pressure measurement methods of high quality. Subgroup meta-analyses, sensitivity analyses and meta-regressions were conducted to investigate sources of heterogeneity and confounding. The dose-response relationship was also investigated.

Our study was conducted in Tikamgarh district of Madhya Pradesh, an iodine deficiency disorders-endemic district, with the objective to estimate total goitre rate and iodine nutrition status. A cross-sectional study with 30 cluster sampling was conducted between June to July 2016 among school-going children in the age group of 6-12 years. Ninety children from each school (30x90=2700) were selected for the assessment of Goitre. Total 540 salt samples and 270 urine samples were collected to estimate salt iodine content from their house-hold and urine iodine excretion (UIE) respectively. A total of 150 households and 30 shopkeepers were interviewed to understand the awareness level for salt iodization. Goitre rate in Tikamgarh district was 1.9% with prevalence of grade I & II was 1.7% and 0.2% respectively. The median UIE level was 200 mcg/L. The 20% the population had iodine deficiency, 28.9% population had adequate iodine nutrition and 51.1% population had either more than adequate level of iodine. The 72.4% of the population consume adequately iodized salt (>=15 ppm). Our study concludes that Tikamgarh district is non-endemic for IDDs against the earlier classification as an IDD-endemic district. About 20% population has 'iodine deficiency' and approximately 51.1% population has 'more than adequate iodine intake'. We recommend stringent programme monitoring, undertake periodic assessment of IDD and explore manifestations of excess iodine intake (>=300 mcg/L) such as Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism in future.

740,740,10626552,"To determine the effect of puberty on insulin action, we used the euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp technique in combination with stable isotopes and indirect calorimetry in lean pre-adolescents, adolescents and adults. These studies indicated that the insulin resistance induced by normal puberty alters glucose metabolism but is insufficient to adversely affect insulin-stimulated protein metabolism or to inhibit lipolysis. Using the hyperglycaemic clamp technique, we evaluated the impact of the insulin resistance on insulin secretion in pre-adolescents, adolescents and young adults. These studies revealed that the insulin and C-peptide responses to a standardized intravenous hyperglycaemic stimulus were two- to threefold greater in adolescents than in pre-adolescent children and adults. As growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and insulin levels normally peak during puberty, we examined the influence of insulin on IGF-I regulation by measuring basal GH, total and free IGF-I, and IGF binding protein (IGFBP) levels in lean adolescents and young adults. During the clamp studies, the adolescents exhibited low levels of IGFBP-1 and -2 as well as a reduced insulin-induced suppression of IGFBP-1, compared with lean adults. Thus, we postulate that the insulin resistance of puberty induces compensatory hyperinsulinaemia, which in turn suppresses circulating levels of IGFBP-1, which in turn leads to increased levels of free IGF-1.

However, little is known about glucose metabolism and how early its dysregulation can develop in α-thalassemia hemoglobin H (Hb H) disease, which is one of the most common types of NTDT worldwide. We prospectively calculated glucose metabolism index in 40 patients (aged 10-25 years) with Hb H disease. Glucose metabolism data were compared between patients with deletional versus nondeletional Hb H, and between patients with normal versus abnormal insulin secretion/sensitivity. Despite normal glucose tolerance in all patients, 52.5% had abnormal insulinogenic index indicating decreased β-cell insulin secretion. Patients with functional hemoglobin < 8 g/dL had significantly higher percentages of abnormal insulinogenic index. There was no significant difference in abnormal insulinogenic index between deletional and nondeletional Hb H. Decreased β-cell insulin secretion is highly prevalent among children and adolescents with Hb H disease, and it is associated with levels of functional anemia at baseline, but not with the type of Hb H disease.

742,742,8475677,"Austria is an iodine deficient area as are most parts of Europe. Goiters were always a natural phenomenon. In 1924 goiter prevalence in school children was 45 to 47% and a first attempt was made with iodized salt. This iodized salt (5 mg NaI/kg salt) was not used widely and goiter prevalence remained unchanged for decades. Therefore, in 1963, salt iodized with 10 mg KI/kg was introduced by law in a semi-mandatory way: Non-iodized salt was allowed to be sold only by special request. Consequently, in 1982, 68% of the total salt sold was iodized salt, goiter prevalence dropped to 1.5% in first graders, hypothyroidism in newborns was 1:4,600 and cretinism disappeared. However, in 18 years old females, goiter prevalence was still 13%, and in adults up to 30%. Investigations in various regions of Austria showed that iodine supplementation was insufficient with a mean urinary excretion of 42 to 75 micrograms I/g Cr. Therefore the Austrian Society of Nuclear Medicine (ONG) demanded the raise of the iodine content of salt to 20 mg KI/kg. Finally, in 1990 a new law was issued by the Government following this proposal. In 1992, investigations were done in various regions of Austria demonstrating a normalized iodine excretion of 129 to 177 micrograms I/g Cr.

Besides clinical investigations, many research projects used rodent islets to study various facets of β-cell pathophysiology. Their important contributions laid the foundations of steadily increasing numbers of experimental studies resorting to isolated human islets. This review, based on an analysis of data published over 60 years of clinical investigations and results of more recent studies in isolated islets, addresses a question of translational nature. Does the information obtained in vitro with human islets fit with our knowledge of insulin secretion in man? The aims are not to discuss specificities of pathways controlling secretion but to compare qualitative and quantitative features of glucose-induced insulin secretion in isolated human islets and in living human subjects. Much of the information gathered in vitro can reliably be translated to the in vivo situation. There is a fairly good, though not complete, qualitative and quantitative coherence between insulin secretion rates measured in vivo and in vitro during stimulation with physiological glucose concentrations, but the concordance fades out under extreme conditions. Perplexing discrepancies also exist between insulin secretion in subjects with Type 2 diabetes and their islets studied in vitro, in particular concerning the kinetics.

We aimed to investigate the association between maternal GDM and allergic diseases in children and the interaction between glucose metabolism and PUFAs on allergic outcomes. This prospective cohort study included 706 mother-child dyads from Guangzhou, China.

752,752,38612973,"Worldwide, childhood obesity cases continue to rise, and its prevalence is known to increase the risk of non-communicable diseases typically found in adults, such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Thus, comprehending its multiple causes to build healthier approaches and revert this scenario is urgent. Obesity development is strongly associated with high fructose intake since the excessive consumption of this highly lipogenic sugar leads to white fat accumulation and causes white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation, oxidative stress, and dysregulated adipokine release. Unfortunately, the global consumption of fructose has increased dramatically in recent years, which is associated with the fact that fructose is not always evident to consumers, as it is commonly added as a sweetener in food and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB). Therefore, here, we discuss the impact of excessive fructose intake on adipose tissue biology, its contribution to childhood obesity, and current strategies for reducing high fructose and/or free sugar intake. To achieve such reductions, we conclude that it is important that the population has access to reliable information about food ingredients via food labels.

753,753,19636251,"Breath hydrogen testing after lactulose administration may yield findings of clinical value, but whether it should be a routine part of breath testing has not been evaluated. We examined the contribution of breath testing after lactulose administration to the conduct and interpretation of breath hydrogen responses after fructose and lactose administration. Two hundred consecutive patients were given lactulose, fructose or lactose on separate days (at least 2 days apart); breath hydrogen was monitored every 15 min after the administration of each sugar. Peak breath hydrogen levels after lactulose administration correlated with those after fructose (r = 0.26; P = 0.03) and lactose (r = 0.44; P = 0.004). Of the patients with a reduced response to lactulose, 51% had definite or borderline evidence of fructose malabsorption (FM); similarly, 23% of patients had definite or borderline lactose malabsorption. After lactulose administration, an increase in breath hydrogen levels occurred after the same amount of time or longer than after the administration of fructose or lactose (>120 min). The earlier the first rise in breath hydrogen levels after lactulose administration, the more frequently FM occurred, indicating an association between FM and rapid transit and/or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Routine breath hydrogen testing with lactulose administration before other sugars cannot be used to define non-hydrogen producers, but might, by indicating the vigour of hydrogen production in the individual, allow more rational interpretation of results after testing with other sugars. It permits the duration of testing to be judged and provides information on possible mechanisms of FM.

754,754,38475734,"Prior studies reported that elevated asprosin level was associated with obesity in adults and animal models. However, the relationship between asprosin level and children with obeisty remains controversial. The aim of our analysis was to systematically review available literatures linking asprosin and children with obesity for a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between circulating asprosin level and obesity in children. Eight databases were gleaned for studies published up to January 2024. Standard mean difference with 95% confidence interval (CI) and Fisher's Z transformation was calculated to evaluate the relationship between asprosin level and children with obesity using the Review Manager 5.4 Software. Other indicators were measured via mean difference with 95% CI. Six observational studies were included both in systematic review and meta-analysis. The current evidence indicated that no significant difference was observed in the level of circulating asprosin between the children with and without obesity (SMD = 0.37; 95% CI:-0.22-0.95, p = 0.22). However, Fisher's Z transformation suggested the positive association of circulating asprosin levels and clinical index measuring the degree of obesity: total cholesterol (Fisher's Z: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.02-0.20, p = 0.02). Circulating asprosin level was not independently related to childhood obesity currently. More rigorous longitudinal researches were required to disentangle the causations. However, the positive association of asprosin levels and total cholesterol indicated that asprosin might get involved in the lipid-metabolism of childhood obesity, asprosin might be a prospective bio-index and targeted treatment of total cholesterol metabolism besides the role of glucogenic and orexigenic.

The aim of this study was to examine the associations between perceived self-efficacy and oral health behaviours among adolescents. A convenience sample of adolescents aged 12 to 18 years old was recruited from the University of Alberta dental clinic. Demographics, oral health behaviours, self-rated oral health and task-specific and general self-efficacy were assessed using a questionnaire with three sections. For the comparisons of outcomes across different categories, Student t-test, multivariate regression and chi-squared tests were used. A total of 252 adolescents with average (SD) age of 14 (1.7) years participated in the study; 60% were girls; 81% were born in Canada; 56% were White; and 61% had dental coverage. Demographic characteristics had no significant correlation with general self-efficacy. However, correlation coefficients indicated that younger adolescents had higher dietary self-efficacy (negative correlation), girls had higher toothbrushing and dental visit self-efficacy, and those with dental coverage had higher dental visit self-efficacy. A significant association was found between toothbrushing, dietary habits and dental visits self-efficacy (subscales of task-specific self-efficacy) and their respective outcomes (frequency of toothbrushing, sugar intake and regular dentist visits). General self-efficacy was significantly associated with frequency of toothbrushing and participant's self-rated oral health. Higher task-specific and general self-efficacy correlated with better oral health behaviours among adolescents. Therefore, behavioural interventions should be designed to enhance self-efficacy among adolescents in order to improve their oral health outcomes.

Our previous study (School-based Education programme to reduce Salt(School-EduSalt)) demonstrated that educating schoolchildren, who then instructed their families to reduce the amount of salt used at home, is effective in lowering salt intake in both children and adults. Our team also developed an app called 'KnowSalt', which could help individuals to estimate their salt intake and the major sources of salt in the diet. Building on School-EduSalt and KnowSalt, we propose to develop a new app (AppSalt) focusing on salt reduction through education, target setting, monitoring, evaluation, decision support and management to achieve a progressive lower salt intake for long term. To evaluate the effectiveness of the AppSalt programme, we will carry out a cluster randomised controlled trial. We will recruit 54 primary schools from urban and rural areas of three provinces in China. A total of 594 children aged 8-9 years and 1188 adult family members will be randomly selected for evaluation. After baseline assessment, schools will be randomly allocated to either the intervention or control group. Children in the intervention group will be taught, with support of AppSalt, about salt reduction and assigned homework to get the whole family involved in the activities to reduce salt consumption. The duration of the intervention is two school terms (ie, 1 year). The primary outcome is the difference between the intervention and control group in the change of salt intake as measured by 24-hour urinary sodium.

We conducted a randomized clinical trial to determine 1) whether low-income parents could safely mix and administer cereal-based ORS (CBORS) both from ingredients commonly found in the home and from a premixed packet; 2) whether these CBORS were as effective in maintaining hydration as commercial glucose-based ORS; and 3) whether CBORS were more effective in reducing severity and duration of illness. Children 4 to 36 months of age discharged from emergency departments and health centers with acute diarrheal disease were randomized to receive either homemade CBORS, reconstituted packet CBORS, or Pedialyte. A study nurse saw the child at home each day until the illness resolved, and obtained capillary blood for serum sodium at enrollment and at 24 to 48 hours; a sample of CBORS for sodium concentration; stool for pathogen analysis; and daily fluid intake, stool frequency, and weight. A total of 232 children were enrolled, of whom 203 (88%) completed the study. Two parents (3%) in the homemade CBORS group and one parent (1%) in the packet CBORS group made mixing errors resulting in a high sodium concentration (>100 mEq/L); their children refused the solution and had normal serum sodium values. Mean CBORS sodium concentration for the remainder of the homemade CBORS group was 60 +/- 10 mEq/L, and for the packet CBORS group, 54 +/- 13. Eighteen children (11%) had abnormal serum sodium values at presentation, which returned to normal in all groups in most cases. Three children (4.5%) in the homemade CBORS group, 4 (6%) in the packet CBORS group, and 1 child (1.4%) in the Pedialyte group failed therapy. Children refused to take homemade CBORS and packet CBORS (43% and 32%, respectively) more often than Pedialyte (9%), and those in the CBORS groups tended to take less ORS and total fluids. There were no significant differences among the three groups in incidence of daily vomiting or stooling, duration of diarrhea, or weight gain.

Vaping e-liquids expose the user to several potentially harmful chemicals, including diacetyl, a flavouring compound known to cause bronchiolitis obliterans with inhalational exposure (""popcorn worker's lung""). We report the case of a 17-year-old male who presented with intractable cough, progressive dyspnea and malaise after vaping flavoured e-liquids and tetrahydrocannabinol intensively. Initial physical examination showed fever, tachycardia, hypoxemia, and bibasilar inspiratory crackles on lung auscultation. Computed tomography of the chest showed diffuse centrilobular ""tree-inbud"" nodularity, consistent with acute bronchiolitis. Multiple cultures, including from 2 bronchoalveolar lavage samples, and biopsy stains, were negative for infection. He required intubation, invasive mechanical ventilation and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for refractory hypercapnia. The patient's condition improved with high-dose corticosteroids. He was weaned off ECMO and mechanical ventilation, and discharged home after 47 days in hospital. Several months after hospital discharge, his exercise tolerance remained limited and pulmonary function tests showed persistent, fixed airflow obstruction with gas trapping. The patient's clinical picture was suggestive of possible bronchiolitis obliterans, thought to be secondary to inhalation of flavouring agents in the e-liquids, although the exact mechanism of injury and causative agent are unknown. This case of severe acute bronchiolitis, causing near-fatal hypercapnic respiratory failure and chronic airflow obstruction in a previously healthy Canadian youth, may represent vaping-associated bronchiolitis obliterans. This novel pattern of pulmonary disease associated with vaping appears distinct from the type of alveolar injury predominantly reported in the recent outbreak of cases of vaping-associated pulmonary illness in the United States, underscoring the need for further research into all potentially toxic components of e-liquids and tighter regulation of e-cigarettes.

This study aims to investigate the association between intestinal mucosal permeability and cefaclor-associated SSLR in children. A total of 82 pediatric patients with upper respiratory tract infection following the cefaclor therapy was divided into cefaclor-associated SSLR positive group and negative group based on the presence or absence of SSLR after taking cefaclor, and 30 healthy volunteers served as control group. Urinary lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratios and serum diamine oxidase (DAO) levels were determined in all cases on days 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 after oral administration of cefaclor. The children in the control group were given the same measurements after enrollment in this study. From days 7 to 13, the urinary L/M ratio of children with cefaclor SSLR gradually increased and reached to the highest level of 0.38 ± 0.14 on day 13. Compared with the cefaclor-associated SSLR negative group and control group, urinary L/M ratios increased significantly in the cefaclor SSLR positive group on days 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 after taking cefaclor, and serum levels of DAO following the treatment of cefaclor increased significantly in children with cefaclor SSLR on days 9, 11, 13, and 15. No significant difference in urinary L/M ratios and serum levels of DAO between SSLR negative group and control group through the entire experiment was observed. In conclusion, administration of cefaclor may induce SSLR in children by increasing the intestinal mucosal permeability and/or affecting the integrity of the intestinal mucosa. Determinations of urinary L/M ratios and serum DAO levels may be helpful for observing or predicting the occurrence of SSLR after administration of cefaclor, which will encourage physicians to proceed with extreme caution when prescribing cefaclor for pediatric patients.

763,763,33582780,"The addition of iodine to edible salt has been one of the most important public health successes of the past half century, enabling most countries to achieve optimal iodine intake and protect the brains of unborn children from the adverse consequences of iodine deficiency. Salt has been an ideal vehicle for this effort because of its near universal and narrow range of consumption, relative ease of technology for salt iodization, and capacity for virtually all salt producers to add iodine. As a result of the success of salt iodization, there has been growing interest in using salt as a vehicle for other important micronutrients, particularly the addition of iron to iodized salt to produce double-fortified salt (DFS), to combat the persistent problem of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia. Because of this growing interest in DFS and the need for a comprehensive review of evidence to support the viability of this intervention, the Iodine Global Network (IGN) initiated a global consultation to gather all available data on different aspects of DFS. IGN identified 4 key areas considered essential to understand for a successful fortification intervention: 1) efficacy and effectiveness, or how well DFS produces a health impact in controlled and real-life settings; 2) technical considerations for production, or what are the minimum requirements to manufacture DFS; 3) program implementation to describe experiences thus far with the delivery of DFS across multiple platforms; and 4) comparison of DFS with other iron fortification efforts to determine the comparative advantage of DFS to improve iron intake and prevent iron deficiency anemia.

The sexual development stage of all subjects was in Tanner I. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were done, and body mass index (BMI), serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) level and insulin resistance by homeostasis model (HOMA-IR) were measured at the time of diagnosis and every 3 months after rhGH therapy. Continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) was applied for two cases with hyperglycemia. (1) Fasting glucose and IGF-1 levels increased since 3 months of treatment and did not decrease since then. The levels of fasting glucose and IGF-1 at every time points of rhGH therapy were higher than the levels at the time of diagnosis (F = 6.81, P < 0.01; F = 7.31, P < 0.01, respectively). HOMA-IR and fasting insulin levels were increased since 3 and 9 months of treatment (P = 0.001 and P = 0.021, respectively). They decreased after 12 months of therapy and the levels at 18 months of therapy were similar to that at diagnosis. (2) Pearson correlation analysis showed that HOMA-IR was positively correlated with BMI, IGF-1 and the duration of treatment (r = 0.251, 0.437, 0.281, P < 0.01, respectively). The curve between HOMA-IR and duration of therapy was similar with parabola and the quadratic equation obtained was as follows: HOMA-IR = 1.5048 + 0.2177 x duration of therapy (months)-0.0103 x duration of therapy (months)(2) (r(2) = 0.147, F = 14.16, P < 0.01).

OGTT and CGMS showed that their plasma glucose levels were normal after rhGH therapy was applied again. The children who underwent rhGH therapy may be at increased risk of insulin resistance (especially during the first year) and the therapy may even induce transitory glucose metabolic disorder in a very small proportion of patients. Circulating IGF-1 may participate in the control of insulin sensitivity and play an important role in the hormonal balance between GH and insulin.

We investigated the steroid effect on linear growth and weight gain as well as the prevalence of different metabolic components and dysglycemia in children with NS with multiple relapses for 5 years in relation to the cumulative dose of steroids. Study population and sample size: Data of 30 children with NS were analyzed retrospectively. They received prednisolone treatment as advised by international guidelines. The cumulative dose of prednisolone (CDP) over the 5 years was calculated for each child. Their growth and different metabolic criteria, including impaired fasting glucose (IFG), high LDL and cholesterol, lower HDL, and high blood pressure studied over this period and compared with the data for 66 age-matched obese non-nephrotic children.

768,768,16849408,"To prevent goiter and nodular hyperthyroidism, iodine fortification (IF) of salt was introduced in Denmark in 1998. We prospectively registered all new cases of overt hyperthyroidism in two areas of Denmark before and for the first 6 yr after iodine fortification. We used a computer-based register of all new cases of hyperthyroidism in two population subcohorts with moderate iodine deficiency (Aalborg, n = 310,124) and mild iodine deficiency (Copenhagen, n = 225,707), respectively. Data were obtained 1) before IF (1997-1998); 2) during voluntary IF (1999-2000); 3) during the early (2001-2002) period of mandatory IF; and 4) during the late (2003-2004) period with mandatory IF. The overall incidence rate of hyperthyroidism increased [baseline, 102.8/100,000/year; voluntary IF, 122.8; early mandatory IF, 140.7; late mandatory IF, 138.7 (P for trend <0.001)]. Hyperthyroidism increased in both sexes (P < 0.001) and in all age groups: 0-19, 20-39, 40-59, and 60+ yr (P for trend <0.001). The increase was relatively highest in young adults aged 20-39 yr: late mandatory IF (percent increase from baseline), age 20-39, 160%, P < 0.001; age 40-59, 29%, P < 0.01; age 60+ yr, 13%, P = not significant. Even a cautious iodization of salt results in an increase in the incidence rate of hyperthyroidism.

To better understand the mechanisms of these effects, we analyzed longitudinal relationships between sex, lung physiology, and asthma in the Childhood Origins of ASThma birth cohort study. Childhood Origins of ASThma birth cohort study children were followed prospectively from birth and assessed annually. Results of spirometry, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (Feno), mannitol provocation testing, and (3)He gas magnetic resonance imaging were assessed by sex using multivariate models including age, asthma diagnosis, and wheezing histories. Girls had higher prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 0.5 seconds/forced vital capacity values than did boys (mean difference, 0.017; 95% CI, 0.000-0.034; P = .05) of equivalent age. Postbronchodilator findings were more pronounced, with boys demonstrating reduced forced expiratory volume in 0.5 seconds/forced vital capacity values than did girls of equivalent age (mean difference, 0.032; 95% CI, 0.014-0.049; P = .0005). Conversely, girls were noted to have higher ventilation defects on (3)He magnetic resonance imaging than did boys (P = .01). No differences were noted in the rate of positive responses to mannitol provocation or Feno measurements. Lower airflow values are present by spirometry for prepubertal boys than for age-matched girls; however, greater (3)He ventilation defects were noted in girls. This could represent a greater degree of subclinical air trapping in prepubertal girls because residual volumes are not detected on standard spirometric readings. No differences were noted between the 2 sexes with airway hyperresponsiveness (mannitol provocation testing) or inflammation (Feno).

In 70 patients with histologically proven malignant primary bone tumours (32 osteosarcomas, 38 Ewing's sarcomas), 118 FDG-PET examinations were evaluated. FDG-PET scans were analysed with regard to osseous metastases in comparison with bone scintigraphy. The reference methods for both imaging modalities were histopathological analysis, morphological imaging [additional conventional radiography, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] and/or clinical follow-up over 6-64 months (median 20 months). In 21 examinations (18%) reference methods revealed 54 osseous metastases (49 from Ewing's sarcomas, five from osteosarcomas). FDG-PET had a sensitivity of 0.90, a specificity of 0.96 and an accuracy of 0.95 on an examination-based analysis. Comparable values for bone scintigraphy were 0.71, 0.92 and 0.88. On a lesion-based analysis the sensitivity of FDG-PET and bone scintigraphy was 0.80 and 0.72, respectively. Analysing only Ewing's sarcoma patients, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of FDG-PET and bone scan were 1.00, 0.96 and 0.97 and 0.68, 0.87 and 0.82, respectively (examination-based analysis). None of the five osseous metastases from osteosarcoma were detected by FDG-PET, but all of them were true-positive using bone scintigraphy. In conclusion, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of FDG-PET in the detection of osseous metastases from Ewing's sarcomas are superior to those of bone scintigraphy.

This study determined if mannitol could identify children with active asthma and responsive to methacholine, and whether mannitol challenge was faster to complete than methacholine challenge. Twenty-five children (aged 6-13 years) responsive to methacholine and 10 nonasthmatic children unresponsive to methacholine were studied. The methacholine challenge (Cockcroft protocol) was followed by a mannitol challenge on separate days. Twenty-one asthmatic children were positive to mannitol. Three taking inhaled corticosteroids with borderline methacholine responsiveness did not respond to mannitol, and one could not complete the mannitol challenge due to cough. The geometric mean (GM) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for PD(15) for mannitol was 39 mg (19, 78), and PC(20) for methacholine was 0.6 mg/mL (0.35-1.02) (r(p) = 0.75, p < 0.001, n = 21). Responses to mannitol were repeatable: GM PD(15) for the first challenge was 29 mg (CI: 17,50), and for the second challenge, 33 mg (CI: 20, 55) (P = 0.44, n = 9). Mannitol was faster to administer than methacholine (median (range)) 14 min (5-32) vs. 29 min (19-49), respectively (P < 0.001). Time to recover to baseline FEV(1) spontaneously and after bronchodilator administration was similar for both challenges. There were no significant falls in arterial oxygen saturations. During mannitol challenge, the mean (SD) fall in FEV(1) in nonasthmatic children was 3.1% (2.9).

A recent study showed that in the case of adequate Ca intake, a higher level of physical activity may contribute to bone mass accumulation. However, the combined effect between Ca intake and physical activity on caries experience is unclear. Herein, we aimed to explore the above combined effect on dental caries in children and adolescents. Data of 5,917 children and adolescents were extracted from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) database in 2015-2020 in this cross-sectional study. The NHANES assessed the dietary Ca intake through the 24-hour dietary recalls, and the physical activity level was self-reported using the questionnaires. Also, the dental caries was diagnosed according to the Decayed, Missing and Filled Teeth/Surfaces (DMFT/S) index. Weighted univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were utilized to screen the covariates and to investigate the associations of dietary Ca intake and physical activity with dental caries, respectively, and assess the combined effect between dietary Ca intake and physical activity on dental caries. The evaluation indexes were odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analyses of age, obesity, and total sugar intake were also performed. Among the eligible participants, 2,687 had caries experience. After adjusting for the covariates, we found that children and adolescents who not reach the recommendation level of Ca intake combined with physical activity less than 7 time in 1 week seemed to have higher odds of dental caries [OR = 1.77, 95%CI: (1.38-2.27)], compared with those who reached the standards. In addition, this potential combined effect was also found in age < 12 years old [OR = 1.62, 95%CI: (1.23-2.14)], non-obesity [OR = 1.88, 95%CI: (1.49-2.35)], and total sugar intake (all P < 0.05) subgroups.

774,774,17217453,"Fructose is found widely in the diet as a free hexose, as the disaccharide, sucrose and in a polymerized form (fructans). Free fructose has limited absorption in the small intestine, with up to one half of the population unable to completely absorb a load of 25 g. Average daily intake of fructose varies from 11 to 54 g around the world. Fructans are not hydrolysed or absorbed in the small intestine. The physiological consequences of their malabsorption include increasing osmotic load, providing substrate for rapid bacterial fermentation, changing gastrointestinal motility, promoting mucosal biofilm and altering the profile of bacteria. These effects are additive with other short-chain poorly absorbed carbohydrates such as sorbitol. The clinical significance of these events depends upon the response of the bowel to such changes; they have a higher chance of inducing symptoms in patients with functional gut disorders than asymptomatic subjects. Restricting dietary intake of free fructose and/or fructans may have durable symptomatic benefits in a high proportion of patients with functional gut disorders, but high quality evidence is lacking. It is proposed that confusion over the clinical relevance of fructose malabsorption may be reduced by regarding it not as an abnormality but as a physiological process offering an opportunity to improve functional gastrointestinal symptoms by dietary change.

The molecular processes underlying these developmental changes are poorly characterized. The objectives of this study were to determine developmental trajectories of gene expression and to examine the evolutionary history of genes differentially expressed as a function of age. We used microarrays to determine age-related patterns of mRNA expression in human cerebral cortical samples ranging from infancy to adulthood. In contrast to previous developmental gene expression studies of human neocortex that relied on postmortem tissue, we measured mRNA expression from the nondiseased margins of surgically resected tissue. We used regression models designed to identify transcripts that followed significant linear or curvilinear functions of age and used population genetics techniques to examine the evolution of these genes. We identified 40 transcripts with significant age-related trajectories in expression. Ten genes have documented roles in nervous system development and energy metabolism, others are novel candidates in brain development. Sixteen transcripts showed similar patterns of expression, characterized by decreasing expression during childhood. Comparative genomic analyses revealed that the regulatory regions of three genes have evidence of adaptive evolution in recent human evolution. These findings provide evidence that a subset of genes expressed in the human cerebral cortex broadly mirror developmental patterns of cortical glucose consumption.

Among patients with infantile spasms, PET studies with 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) suggest that the spasms are the result of secondary generalization from cortical foci and that maturational factors result in the recruitment of basal ganglia and brainstem serotonin mechanisms that lead to secondary generalization and the unique semiology of the spasms. Attempts to develop an animal model of infantile spasms have not been successful. Glucose utilization studies in the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome also indicate cortical lesions and further suggest that the electroencephalographic pattern of 1 to 2.5 Hz spike-wave activity (slow spike-wave pattern) is an interictal phenomenon. There is a remarkable consistency between 14C-2-deoxyglucose autoradiographic findings and PET observations of glucose utilization performed for patients in the ictal, interictal, and postictal states. Although three patterns of ictal glucose hypermetabolism have been described, hypermetabolism also can be seen in the postictal and interictal clinical states and in various animal models.

780,780,35721755,"Recurrent and profound hypoglycemia is a leading cause of neonatal brain injury. Small-for-gestational-age infants are at risk of hypoglycemia due to substrate deficiency and hyperinsulinism. Inappropriate insulin secretion by the β-cells of the pancreas results in hypoglycemia, neuronal energy deprivation, and parieto-occipital brain injury. Hypoglycemic neuronal injury is increasingly being identified as a trigger for infantile spasms, even though the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain elusive. A term, small-for-gestational-age male infant developed severe symptomatic hypoglycemia on day 3 of life. He required a high glucose infusion rate (14 mg/kg/min) to maintain normoglycemia. Critical blood samples showed inappropriate insulin levels while hypoglycemic and hypoketonemic, consistent with a diagnosis of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Blood glucose levels normalized with a diazoxide dose of 5 mg/kg/day. Gradually, glucose infusion was weaned with increasing oral feeds while maintaining prefeed capillary blood glucose levels. While at home, his glucose profile remained stable on the self-weaning dose of diazoxide. He passed a resolution fasting study at 4 months of age after weaning off diazoxide. He developed left gaze preference at 2.5 months of age while on treatment for hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia but developed infantile spasms at 5 months that was confirmed with an electroencephalogram (EEG).

We specifically include the following AEDs: lamotrigine (Lamictal), topiramate (Topamax), zonisamide (Zonegran), levetiracetam (Keppra), and oxcarbazepine (Trileptal). All of these AEDs have a broad spectrum of action in the treatment of partial and generalized seizures, except Oxcarbazepine, which is effective only in partial seizures. It is unclear whether or not monotherapy with the new AEDs offers higher efficacy and/or lower side effects compared to classic AEDs (phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, or valproate) thereby significantly improving the quality of life in children with epilepsy.

782,782,37284808,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in children. Like adults, children can develop the progressive form of NAFLD, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is characterized by hepatic inflammation, often in the presence of fibrosis. Children with NAFLD are at higher risk of liver-related complications, metabolic dysfunction, and cardiovascular disease in adulthood. Many factors contribute to the escalating prevalence of NAFLD in the pediatric population, among which are an array of dietary patterns such as overnutrition, poor diet quality, and heavy consumption of fat and sugar, including fructose. Findings from an increasing number of epidemiological studies support a connection between high habitual sugar consumption and NAFLD, especially within the context of obesity, but these studies are not able to demonstrate whether sugar is a contributing factor or instead an indicator of an overall poor diet (or lifestyle) quality. To date, only four randomized controlled dietary interventions assessing the effects of sucrose/fructose restriction on hepatic fat fraction in youth with obesity have been published. The objectives of this review are to summarize the key findings from these dietary interventions to achieve a better understanding of the strength of the relationship between dietary sugar restriction and liver fat reduction, despite their inherent limitations, and to discuss the potential impact of weight loss and fat mass reduction on improvement in hepatic steatosis.

783,783,37715520,"Hyperglycaemia in Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from an absolute insulin deficiency. However, insulin resistance (IR) may exacerbate glycaemic instability in T1D and contribute to long-term cardiovascular complications. We previously showed that IR in teenagers with obesity is associated with sex-dependent derangements in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and fatty acids. Here we hypothesized that byproducts of BCAA and fatty acid metabolism may serve as biomarkers or determinants of glycaemic control and IR in prepubertal or early pubertal children with T1D. Metabolites, hormones and cytokines from fasting blood samples were analysed in 28 children (15 females, 13 males; age 6-11 years) with T1D. Principal components analysis (PCA) and multiple linear regression models were used to correlate metabolites of interest with glycaemic control, total daily insulin dose (TDD, units/kg/d), adiponectin and the triglyceride (TG) to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio. Males and females were comparable in age, BMI-z, insulin sensitivity, glycaemic control, inflammatory markers, BCAAs and C2/C3/C5-acylcarnitines. The majority of components retained in PCA were related to fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and BCAA catabolism. HbA1c correlated positively with Factor 2 (acylcarnitines, incomplete FAO) and Factor 9 (fasting glucose). TDD correlated negatively with C3 and C5 and Factor 10 (BCAA catabolism) and positively with the ratio of C2 to C3 + C5 and Factor 9 (fasting glucose). These findings suggest that glucose intolerance in prepubertal or early pubertal children with T1D is accompanied by incomplete FAO while TDD is associated with preferential catabolism of fats relative to amino acids.

At the time of this study, subjects had received continuous glucose therapy for a total duration of 13.9+/-5.0 years. Uncooked cornstarch was used as the method of providing glucose continuously for 10.2+/-3.2 years. Subjects were admitted to the Clinical Research Center and followed their usual home dietary regimens, which included cornstarch supplements at 2- to 4-hour intervals during the day and at 4- to 8-hour intervals during the night. Plasma glucose, blood lactate, and glucoregulatory hormones were measured hourly for 24 hours. During a 24-hour period of biochemical monitoring, mean hourly plasma glucose concentrations for the group of 17 subjects ranged from 76+/-17 (SD) mg/dl (4.2+/-0.9 mmol/l) to 108+/-16 mg/dl (6.0+/-0.9 mmol/l), and blood lactate concentrations ranged from 2.1+/-1.2 mmol/l to 3.8+/-2.8 mmol/l.

785,785,31316102,"Aging is a physiological process in which multifactorial processes determine a progressive decline. Several alterations contribute to the aging process, including telomere shortening, oxidative stress, deregulated autophagy and epigenetic modifications. In some cases, these alterations are so linked with the aging process that it is possible predict the age of a person on the basis of the modification of one specific pathway, as proposed by Horwath and his aging clock based on DNA methylation. Because the energy metabolism changes are involved in the aging process, in this work, we propose a new aging clock based on the modifications of glucose catabolism. The biochemical analyses were performed on mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood, obtained from a healthy population with an age between 5 and 106 years. In particular, we have evaluated the oxidative phosphorylation function and efficiency, the ATP/AMP ratio, the lactate dehydrogenase activity and the malondialdehyde content. Further, based on these biochemical markers, we developed a machine learning-based mathematical model able to predict the age of an individual with a mean absolute error of approximately 9.7 years. This mathematical model represents a new non-invasive tool to evaluate and define the age of individuals and could be used to evaluate the effects of drugs or other treatments on the early aging or the rejuvenation.

786,786,28444233,"Retail marketing surveillance research highlights concerns about lower priced cigarettes in neighborhoods with a higher proportion of racial/ethnic minorities but focuses almost exclusively on premium brands. To remedy this gap in the literature, the current study examines neighborhood variation in prices for the cheapest cigarettes and a popular brand of cigarillos in a large statewide sample of licensed tobacco retailers in a low-tax state. All 61 local health departments in California trained data collectors to conduct observations in a census of eligible licensed tobacco retailers in randomly selected zip codes (n = 7393 stores, completion rate=91%). Data were collected in 2013, when California had a low and stagnant tobacco tax. Two prices were requested: the cheapest cigarette pack regardless of brand and a single, flavored Swisher Sweets cigarillo. Multilevel models (stores clustered in tracts) examined prices (before sales tax) as a function of neighborhood race/ethnicity and proportion of school-age youth (aged 5-17). Models adjusted for store type and median household income. Approximately 84% of stores sold cigarettes for less than $5 and a Swisher Sweets cigarillo was available for less than $1 in 74% of stores that sold the brand. The cheapest cigarettes cost even less in neighborhoods with a higher proportion of school-age residents and Asian/Pacific Islanders. Neighborhood disparities in the price of the cheapest combustible tobacco products are a public health threat. Policy changes that make all tobacco products, especially combustible products, less available and more costly may reduce disparities in their use and protect public health. Much of what is known about neighborhood variation in the price of combustible tobacco products focuses on premium brand cigarettes. The current study extends this literature in two ways, by studying prices for the cheapest cigarette pack regardless of brand and a popular brand of flavored cigarillos and by reporting data from the largest statewide sample of licensed tobacco retailers. Significantly lower prices in neighborhoods with a higher proportion of youth and of racial/ethnic groups with higher smoking prevalence are a cause of concern. The study results underscore the need for policies that reduce availability and increase price of combustible tobacco products, particularly in states with low, stagnant tobacco taxes.

Residual β-cell function is often assessed with serial mixed-meal tolerance tests, but these tests do not correlate well with clinical outcomes. Herein, we instead use β-cell glucose sensitivity (βGS) to assess changes in β-cell function, incorporating insulin secretion for a given serum glucose into the assessment of β-cell function. We evaluated changes in βGS in individuals enrolled in the placebo arm of 10 T1D trials performed at diabetes onset. We found that βGS showed a more rapid decline in children, as compared with adolescents and adults. Individuals in the top quartile of βGS baseline distribution had a slower rate in loss of glycemic control time over time. Notably, half of this group were children and adolescents. Finally, to identify predictors of glycemic control throughout follow-up, we ran multivariate Cox models and found that incorporating βGS significantly improved the overall model. Taken together, these data suggest that βGS may be of great utility in predicting those more likely to have a more robust clinical remission and may be of use in design of new-onset diabetes clinical trials and in evaluating response to therapies. We undertook this study to better predict β-cell loss following type 1 diabetes diagnosis. We set out to answer whether β-cell glucose sensitivity (βGS) improves means to evaluate β-cell function postdiagnosis and whether βGS correlates with clinical outcomes. We found that βGS declines faster in children, subjects in the top baseline quartile of βGS exhibit slower β-cell decline (half are children), and incorporating βGS into multivariate Cox models for glycemic improves the model. The implications of our findings are that βGS predicts those likely to have robust clinical remissions and may help with clinical trials design.

Recently, various studies in critically ill patients indicated that increased pulmonary glucose levels with airway/blood glucose threshold over 150 mg/dl lead to an overwhelming growth of bacteria in the broncho-pulmonary system, subsequently resulting in an increased risk of pulmonary infections. The aim of the present study was to determine whether a similar cutoff value exists for severely burned pediatric patients. One-hundred six severely burned pediatric patients were enrolled in the study. Patients were divided in two groups: high (H) defined as daily average glucose levels >75% of LOS >150 mg/dl), and low (L) with daily average glucose levels >75% of the LOS <150 mg/dl). Incidences of pneumonia, atelectasis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were assessed. Incidence of infections, sepsis, and respiratory parameters were recorded. Blood was analyzed for glucose and insulin levels. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test and chi-square test. Significance was set at p<0.05.

In the past, the village was well-known area of severe iodine deficiency disorders (IDD). In 1952', distinguished Croatian endocrinologist Professor Josip Matovinović carried out detailed village survey. Goiter prevalence in school-age children was 85.0% (with 2.3% of cretins in the village). In 1953, the first regulation on compulsory salt iodination with 10 mg of KI/kg of salt was established in former Yugoslavia. Ten years later a dramatic decrease in goiter prevalence was recorded in all endangered areas of the country and no new cretins appeared. However, at the beginning of 1990' mild to moderate iodine deficiency still persisted in Croatia. In 1991, the village of Rude survey demonstrated goiter prevalence in school-age children of 35.0% and median of urinary iodine excretion (UIE) of 7.4 microg/dL. In 1996, the new obligatory regulation with 25 mg of KI/kg of salt was established in Croatia. The study aim was to monitor IDD status in the village after the new law on compulsory salt iodination. Measurements of UIE and thyroid volumes (Tvol) by ultrasound were performed in 7-11-y-old schoolchildren living in the village of Rude.

797,797,21480889,"To investigate clinical correlates and longitudinal course of interictal focal cortical glucose hypermetabolism in children with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans of 60 children (age range 3 months to 15.2 years) with Sturge-Weber syndrome and epilepsy were assessed prospectively and serially for focal hypo- or hypermetabolism. Thirty-two patients had two or more consecutive PET scans. Age, seizure variables, and the occurrence of epilepsy surgery were compared between patients with and without focal hypermetabolism. The severity of focal hypermetabolism was also assessed and correlated with seizure variables. Interictal cortical glucose hypermetabolism, ipsilateral to the angioma, was seen in nine patients, with the most common location in the frontal lobe. Age was lower in patients with hypermetabolism than in those without (p=0.022). In addition, time difference between the onset of first seizure and the first PET scan was much shorter in children with increased glucose metabolism than in those without (mean: 1.0 vs. 3.6 years; p=0.019). Increased metabolism was transient and switched to hypometabolism in all five children where follow-up scans were available. Focal glucose hypermetabolism occurred in 28% of children younger than the age of 2 years. Children with transient hypermetabolism had a higher rate of subsequent epilepsy surgery as compared to those without hypermetabolism (p=0.039). Interictal glucose hypermetabolism in young children with SWS is most often seen within a short time before or after the onset of first clinical seizures, that is, the presumed period of epileptogenesis. Increased glucose metabolism detected by PET predicts future demise of the affected cortex based on a progressive loss of metabolism and may be an imaging marker of the most malignant cases of intractable epilepsy requiring surgery in SWS.

798,798,25441004,"As of 2000, more adults than children are alive with congenital heart disease. Each year, more of these adults with congenital heart disease undergo surgery. Adults with congenital heart disease require lifelong surveillance, follow-up imaging, and clinical decision making by appropriately trained and familiar physicians and extenders. Three common challenges facing adults with congenital heart disease are the neglected patient, weak programmatic infrastructure, and the planning and management of pregnancy in the adult with congenital heart disease. Many challenges must be overcome in order to establish and maintain a comprehensive medical and surgical program for adults with congenital heart disease. Three common and challenging groups of adults with congenital heart disease who may require surgery are adults requiring tricuspid valve surgery for Ebstein's malformation, those requiring reoperation for failing Fontan circulation, and those requiring pulmonary valve replacement (PVR). Surgery for Ebstein's anomaly is now offered to older patients at low risk and with good late outcome. The operation includes tricuspid valve repair or replacement and frequent concomitant procedures such as atrial septal defect closure, arrhythmia surgery (the Maze procedure), and coronary artery bypass grafting. Patients undergoing previous iterations of the Fontan operation are especially prone to arrhythmia and failing circulation. Fontan conversion with arrhythmia surgery and pacemaker therapy was developed by Constantine Mavroudis, Barbara Deal, and Carl Backer to treat these challenging patients, with the first such operation performed in 1994. Fontan conversion involves: (1) conversion of the previously created atriopulmonary connection to a total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC), extracardiac Fontan; (2) arrhythmia surgery, typically with a modified biatrial Maze procedure along with placement of an antitachycardia, dual-chamber pacemaker with steroid-eluting epicardial leads in all patients; and (3) concomitant procedures to treat associated lesions. The need for pulmonary valve replacement is increasing for many adults with congenital heart disease. In the past, chronic pulmonary regurgitation following repair of tetralogy of Fallot was considered benign. Current evidence demonstrates that chronic pulmonary regurgitation causes significant morbidity by producing right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction, exercise intolerance, arrhythmias, and sudden death. Multiple options exist for pulmonary valve replacement including several recent developments such as pulmonary valve replacement with a hand-sewn polytetrafluoroethylene bicuspid valve and percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement. Reoperative cardiac surgery is common in adults with congenital heart disease. Although a history of previous cardiac surgery does not independently confer a significant incremental risk of operative mortality, patients with the greatest number of previous surgeries appear to be a higher risk group. Multi-institutional data about adults with congenital heart disease from The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database can be used to estimate prognosis and council patients and their families. The six manuscripts reviewed in this article have been selected to give a flavor of the state of the art in the domain of caring for adults with congenital heart disease and to provide important information about the long term management of patients undergoing successful pediatric cardiac surgery.

799,799,36107617,"Puberty is associated with transient insulin resistance that normally recedes at the end of puberty; however, in overweight children, insulin resistance persists, leading to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The mechanisms whereby pancreatic β cells adapt to pubertal insulin resistance, and how they are affected by the metabolic status, have not been investigated. Here, we show that puberty is associated with a transient increase in β cell proliferation in rats and humans of both sexes. In rats, β cell proliferation correlated with a rise in growth hormone (GH) levels. Serum from pubertal rats and humans promoted β cell proliferation, suggesting the implication of a circulating factor. In pubertal rat islets, expression of genes of the GH/serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) pathway underwent changes consistent with a proliferative effect. Inhibition of the pro-proliferative 5-HT receptor isoform HTR2B blocked the increase in β cell proliferation in pubertal islets ex vivo and in vivo. Peripubertal metabolic stress blunted β cell proliferation during puberty and led to altered glucose homeostasis later in life. This study identifies a role of GH/GH receptor/5-HT/HTR2B signaling in the control of β cell mass expansion during puberty and identifies a mechanistic link between pubertal obesity and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

802,802,6600035,"To study renal tubular reabsorption and tubulo-glomerular balance in diabetic children, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and tubular reabsorption rates of sodium, glucose, ultrafilterable calcium, and phosphate were measured during fasting in 26 ambulatory type I (insulin-dependent) diabetic children without clinical signs of microangiopathy (age 7-14 yr; duration of diabetes 3-14 yr). Similar measurements were made in 28 healthy school children (age 8-14 yr). Mean GFR in the diabetic children was significantly higher than in the normal children (138 versus 109 ml/min/1.73 m2, P less than 0.01). Mean tubular reabsorption rates of sodium, glucose, and calcium were significantly increased in the diabetic subjects (P less than 0.001).

The renal threshold concentration of phosphate (TmPO4/GFR) was suppressed in the diabetic compared with the healthy subjects (1.23 versus 1.73 mmol/L, P less than 0.001). TmPO4/GFR was unrelated to circulating parathyroid and growth hormone concentrations but correlated inversely with the reabsorption rate of glucose (r = -0.53, P less than 0.01).

Investigate response prediction using pretreatment transcriptome in children with GH deficiency (GHD) treated with once-weekly somapacitan, a novel long-acting GH. REAL4 is a randomized, multinational, open-label, active-controlled parallel group phase 3 trial, comprising a 52-week main phase and an ongoing 3-year safety extension (NCT03811535). A total of 128/200 treatment-naïve prepubertal children with GHD consented to baseline blood transcriptome profiling. They were randomized 2:1 to subcutaneous somapacitan (0.16 mg/kg/week) or daily GH (0.034 mg/kg/day). Differential RNA-seq analysis and machine learning were used to predict therapy response. 121/128 samples passed quality control. Children treated with somapacitan (n = 76) or daily GH (n = 45) were categorized based on fastest and slowest growing quartiles at week 52. Prediction of height velocity (HV; cm/year) was excellent for both treatments (out of bag [OOB] area under curve [AUC]: 0.98-0.99; validation AUC: 0.83-0.84), as was prediction of secondary markers of growth response: HV standard deviation score (SDS) (0.99-1.0; 0.75-0.78), change from baseline height SDS (ΔHSDS) (0.98-1.0; 0.61-0.75), and change from baseline insulin-like growth factor-I SDS (ΔIGF-I SDS) (0.96-1.0; 0.85-0.88).

805,805,8065664,"This report describes the breastfeeding and weaning practices of rural women in two Mexican towns and the cultural beliefs upon which these practices are based. Interviews and focus group discussions were used to collect information. Women thought breastfeeding preferable to bottle-feeding. Eighty percent initiated breastfeeding and 69% gave colostrum. Breastfeeding was discontinued early (mean age 4 months). The mean age at which children were introduced to other liquids was 2 months (range 0-5 months) and to solids, 4 months (range 1-8 months). Women's decisions regarding infant feeding were influenced most by custom and advice from doctors and family members. In some instances medical advice conflicted with traditional practices. These findings suggest important avenues for intervention in hospital practices, education for health care workers, and in the development of health promotion services. The impact of culture and community factors on breast feeding and weaning practices is examined by means of interviews among 35 rural women aged 16-43 years from Jalisco, Mexico, and by means of focus group discussions. Breast feeding practices are gleaned from information provided by mothers on their youngest child aged 2 weeks to 17 months for a 24 hour period prior to the interview. All study infants were given breast milk, supplements of water, and other liquids from birth. Fresh or powdered cow's milk was the usual supplement, except for 5 infants who received commercial formula. Boiled water was used in rehydrating powdered milk. Breast milk substitution was a bottle or cup given 2-4 times daily. The introduction of solid foods was made at 1 month to 8 months of age. Foods ranged from beans, tortillas, bread, pasta, fruit, chicken soup, flavored gelatin, to soft drinks. Between 9 months and 23 months, toddlers were fed the same foods in addition to vegetables, beef, fish, egg, cookies, and prepackaged cold cereal. The reasons given for not breast feeding were illness of the mother, a breast problem, insufficient milk, or an ill child. Colostrum was given for the following reasons: doctor's advice, the best interests of the baby, a woman's preference, custom, and no reason. Colostrum was not given for a variety of reasons including, for example, when the doctor advised against it or when a woman was ill or had a breast problem. In the three focus groups (27 persons), breast feeding was mentioned as preferable because of the added protection given the baby, the convenience of the mother, and the exchange between mother and infant. Other important factors were the improved health of the baby, the absence of cleanliness problems, and the milk was the right temperature. Exclusive breast feeding was recommended for a duration of 3-9 months. Breast feeding was withheld for 4-5 hours if a child had vomiting or diarrhea, or had been in the sun too long. Weaning was considered appropriate anytime between 2 months and 12 months of age. Weaning occurred when the mother was unable to continue or the child wanted to stop or had teeth. There was disagreement about how quickly to complete the process of weaning. Food was introduced at 2 to 6 months of age when milk was not enough to satisfy the child's hunger.

810,810,21511247,"Despite potential benefits of histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution as a cardioplegic solution, it can cause hyponatremia, especially in pediatric patients. Fluctuations in the sodium concentration during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) can adversely affect the central nervous system. We evaluated the relationship between the cardioplegic solution, the fluctuation of sodium concentration, and the incidence of postoperative seizure in pediatric cardiac patients. The medical records of 628 patients were reviewed for the occurrence of a postoperative seizure, type of cardioplegic solution (HTK or del Nido solution), and intraoperative data. A change of sodium concentration exceeding 15 mmol/L (ΔNa>15) during CPB was defined as a significant fluctuation of sodium concentration. Postoperative seizures were detected in 18 patients (2.9%). The ΔNa>15 was detected in 63 of 189 patients (33.3%) who received the HTK solution and in 14 of 439 patients (3.2%) who received the del Nido solution (p<0.001). The incidence of ΔNa>15 was strongly associated with postoperative seizure (odds ratio, 6.3; 95% confidence interval, 2.4 to 16.4, p=0.001). After adjusting for potential confounders, the ΔNa>15 remained significantly associated with postoperative seizure (odds ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 12.3, p=0.018). Histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution during CPB frequently causes fluctuations of sodium concentration, usually combined with hyponatremia, which is associated with postoperative seizure.

812,812,12644717,"Bronchial provocation tests that use stimuli that act indirectly to cause airway narrowing have a high specificity for identifying people with active asthma who have the potential to respond to treatment with antiinflammatory drugs. The first test to be developed was exercise and it was used to assess the efficacy of drugs such as sodium cromoglycate. Eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea was developed later, as a surrogate test for exercise. Hypertonic aerosols were introduced to mimic the dehydrating effects of evaporative water loss that occurs during hyperpnea. A wet aerosol of 4.5% saline or a dry powder formulation of mannitol is used. At present the indirect challenge tests are becoming increasingly recognised as appropriate for monitoring treatment with inhaled steroids. Indirect tests identify those with potential for exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, an important problem for some occupations, such as the defence forces, fire fighters and the police force and for some athletic activities. The advantage in using an indirect challenges, over a direct challenge with a single pharmacological agonist, is that a positive response indicates that inflammatory cells and their mediators (prostaglandins, leukotrienes and histamine) are present in the airways in sufficient numbers and concentration to indicate that asthma is active at the time of testing. The corollary to this is that a negative test in a known asthmatic indicates good control or mild disease. Another advantage is that healthy subjects do not have significant airway narrowing to indirect challenge tests. The protocols used for challenge with indirectly acting stimuli are presented in detail.

A total of 130 patients with functional gastrointestinal symptoms underwent a lactose hydrogen breath and tolerance test (LBTT) allowing for a diagnosis of malabsorption (M+) and lactose sensitivity (S+). HoS indicative of lactose-induced symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, flatulence, diarrhoea) in the 4 weeks preceding the test was determined using a validated questionnaire. The pCPQ was used to score lactose-induced symptoms. The LBTT revealed 41 children (31.5%) with lactose malabsorption (M+), 56 (43.1%) with lactose sensitivity (S+) and 24 (18.5%) were M+/S+.

826,826,31033623,"Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) impairs zinc absorption from food, and zinc deficiency may contribute to the poor growth associated with EED. We examined zinc absorption from a standardized aqueous zinc dose, and habitual daily endogenous fecal zinc excretion (EFZ) and compared these outcomes between children grouped by the lactulose to mannitol ratio (L:M). Bangladeshi toddlers (18-24 months) with low (<0.09) and high (≥0.09) L:M were administered isotope-labeled 3 mg aqueous zinc in the fasted state. Fractional absorption of zinc (FAZ) and EFZ were measured by dual stable isotope tracer method and an isotope dilution method, respectively. Secondary aims included examining relationships of biomarkers of systemic and intestinal inflammation and gut function with FAZ and EFZ. Forty children completed the study; nearly all had evidence of EED. No differences in zinc homeostasis measurements (mean ± SD) were observed between high and low L:M groups: FAZ was 0.38 ± 0.19 and 0.31 ± 0.19, respectively; both figures were within estimated reference range. Means of EFZ were 0.73 ± 0.27 and 0.76 ± 0.20 mg/day for high and low L:M, respectively, and were 10% to 15% above estimated reference range. Regression analyses indicated that biomarkers of systemic inflammation were directly associated with increasing FAZ, consistent with increased gut permeability. Biomarkers of intestinal inflammation were negatively associated with EFZ, consistent with low-zinc intake and chronic deficiency. In these children at risk of EED, endogenous zinc losses were not markedly increased. Results suggest that efforts to improve zinc status in EED should focus on substantially improving zinc intakes.

The suspected risk factors include increased exposure to ionizing radiation during childhood, environmental pollutants, possible iodine deficiency, and excessive iodine exposure. To analyze the thyroid cancer incidence between 1980 and 2013 in Bulgaria and to determine the incidence rate before and after the introduction of universal salt iodization in 1994 in regions with different iodine deficiency levels. Retrospective cohort. The study was a retrospective analysis of the total number of thyroid cancer cases with all histological types in Bulgaria (thyroid cancer, ICD10 code C73), diagnosed between 01/01/1980 and 31/12/2013, and retrieved from the anonymous cancer registry database of the Bulgarian National Cancer Registry. Age-standardized rates of thyroid cancer per 100,000 persons were calculated for each year of the periods mentioned below by sex and age, utilizing the WHO world reference populations with a special statistical module of the Bulgarian National Cancer Registry’s software CancerRegBG, 2011. Incidence rates were reported by age, sex, and period of diagnosis (1980-86, 1987-93, 1994-99, 2000-2006, 2007-2013). Trends among males and females were analyzed separately, as well as by age category: 0-19, 20-44, 45-64, and 65+. Annual percentage changes of age-standardized incidence rates were analyzed by Joinpoint regression to determine trends using the Joinpoint statistical software SEER* Stat Software, Version 4.1.1, 2014. The age-standardized rates of thyroid cancer in Bulgaria has been increasing since 1990, being higher among women compared to men (4.68 vs 2.81). The highest age-standardized rates of thyroid cancer was observed in women in the 2007-2013 period. The only significant joinpoint was recorded in 1990 for females and in 1991 for males. The highest incidence rates was in the Smolyan district, a region with historically existing iodine deficiency and relatively high post-Chernobyl radiation exposure. Our results showed that, in different regions, the age-standardized thyroid cancer rates between endemic and non-endemic differ greatly depending on the radiation dose from the Chernobyl accident. The role of iodine intake in thyroid cancer remains uncertain, but iodine deficiency could be a contributing factor to the increased risk of thyroid cancer.

However, after such learning, it is unknown which brain regions or circuits are activated to retrieve the stored memory and whether this memory undergoes reconsolidation that depends on protein synthesis after its reactivation through retrieval. In the present study, using a conditioned-flavor-preference paradigm by associating flavors with intra-gastric infusion of glucose to minimize the evaluation of the taste of food, we show that retrieval of the post-ingestive nutrient-conditioned flavor memory stimulates multiple brain regions in mice, including the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). Moreover, memory retrieval activated the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in the CeA, while site-specific or systemic inhibition of mTORC1 immediately after retrieval prevented the subsequent expression of the post-ingestive nutrient-associated flavor memory, leading to a long-lasting suppression of reinstatement. Taken together, our findings suggest that the reconsolidation process of a post-ingestive nutrient memory modulates food preferences.

843,843,27352462,"The discovery during the first half of the 20th century of the link between natural fluoride, adjusted fluoride levels in drinking water and reduced dental caries prevalence proved to be a stimulus for worldwide on-going research into the role of fluoride in improving oral health. Epidemiological studies of fluoridation programmes have confirmed their safety and their effectiveness in controlling dental caries. Major advances in our knowledge of how fluoride impacts the caries process have led to the development, assessment of effectiveness and promotion of other fluoride vehicles including salt, milk, tablets, toothpaste, gels and varnishes. In 1993, the World Health Organization convened an Expert Committee to provide authoritative information on the role of fluorides in the promotion of oral health throughout the world (WHO TRS 846, 1994). This present publication is a revision of the original 1994 document, again using the expertise of researchers from the extensive fields of knowledge required to successfully implement complex interventions such as the use of fluorides to improve dental and oral health. Financial support for research into the development of these new fluoride strategies has come from many sources including government health departments as well as international and national grant agencies. In addition, the unique role which industry has played in the development, formulation, assessment of effectiveness and promotion of the various fluoride vehicles and strategies is noteworthy. This updated version of 'Fluoride and Oral Health' has adopted an evidence-based approach to its commentary on the different fluoride vehicles and strategies and also to its recommendations. In this regard, full account is taken of the many recent systematic reviews published in peer reviewed literature.

845,845,34037975,"The efficacy of oral sweet solutions to decrease pain in infants during painful procedures remains uncertain. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of an oral sucrose solution versus placebo in reducing pain during bladder catheterization in infants in the Emergency Department (ED). A randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted in a pediatric university-affiliated hospital ED. Infants 1-3 months old were recruited and randomly allocated to receive 2 ml of sucrose or placebo, 2 min before bladder catheterization. The primary outcome measure was the difference in pain scores as assessed by the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability (FLACC) Pain Scale during procedure. Secondary outcome measures were the difference in pain scores using the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS), crying time, variations in heart rate and adverse events. Eighty-three participants were recruited and completed the study, 41 and 42 in the sucrose and placebo groups, respectively. The mean difference in FLACC scores compared to baseline was 5.3 in the sucrose group vs. 6.4 in the placebo group during catheterization. There were no differences in FLACC scores or NIPS scores measured at 1, 3 and 5 min post procedure. Mean crying times were similar: 97 vs. 110 s. No significant difference was found in participants' heart rate variations. No adverse events were reported. In infants undergoing bladder catheterization in the ED, administration of an oral sweet solution was not associated with lower pain as measured by the FLACC and NIPS scales. Participants' heart rate variations and crying times did not change when sucrose was provided. RéSUMé: OBJECTIF: L'efficacité des solutions sucrées orales pour diminuer la douleur chez les nourrissons pendant les procédures douloureuses reste incertaine. Cette étude visait à comparer l'efficacité d'une solution de saccharose orale par rapport à un placebo pour réduire la douleur pendant le cathétérisme vésical chez les nourrissons dans le service d’urgence. MéTHODES: Un essai clinique randomisé en double aveugle a été mené dans les urgences d'un hôpital universitaire pédiatrique. Des nourrissons âgés de 1 à 3 mois ont été recrutés et répartis au hasard pour recevoir 2 ml de sucrose ou de placebo, 2 minutes avant le cathétérisme vésical. La principale mesure des résultats était la différence dans les scores de douleur évalués par l'échelle de douleur FLACC (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability) pendant la procédure. Les mesures de résultats secondaires étaient la différence des scores de douleur en utilisant l'échelle de douleur du nourrisson néonatal (NIPS), la durée des pleurs, les variations de la fréquence cardiaque et les événements indésirables. RéSULTATS: Quatre-vingt-trois participants ont été recrutés et ont terminé l'étude, 41 et 42 dans les groupes sucrose et placebo, respectivement. La différence moyenne des scores FLACC par rapport à la ligne de base était de 5,3 dans le groupe sucrose contre 6,4 dans le groupe placebo pendant le cathétérisme. Il n’y avait aucune différence dans les scores FLACC ou NIPS mesurés à 1, 3 et 5 minutes après la procédure. La durée moyenne des pleurs était similaire : 97 contre 110 secondes. Aucune différence significative n'a été constatée dans les variations de la fréquence cardiaque des participants. Aucun événement indésirable n'a été signalé. CONCLUSIONS: Chez les nourrissons soumis à un cathétérisme vésical aux urgences, l'administration d'une solution sucrée orale n'était pas associée à une douleur moindre, telle que mesurée par les échelles FLACC et NIPS. Les variations de la fréquence cardiaque et les temps de pleurs des participants ne changeaient pas lorsque du saccharose était administré.

Mean FPG levels increased significantly after 2 years in both groups (P < 0.001, for both), albeit significantly higher among patients than the controls (P = 0.002). The increases in HbA1c and FPG levels were significantly higher among patients with PS than without PS, in the adenoma group (p < 0.001, P = 0.00, respectively).

Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) are useful imaging techniques for the presurgical evaluation of patients with intractable epilepsy.

We performed SPECT and PET for nine patients with HME, which was defined as a whole or part of affected hemisphere enlargement (three males, six females; age range 0.5-20 years). The ictal and interictal states were determined based on the presence or absence of clinical seizures during all PET examinations and majority of SPECT examinations. The perfusion pattern in the malformed hemisphere was increased or equal, despite the reduced glucose metabolism in six out of nine patients. Five of the six patients who underwent early surgical treatment showed this kind of perfusion/metabolism discrepancy. Importantly, even the non-affected hemisphere in early infantile cases already lacked the normal hypoperfusion and hypometabolism patterns of immature frontal lobes, which was most prominent in case with poor surgical prognosis. In all six surgical patients, epileptic seizures appeared before 4 months of age. By contrast, none of the non-surgical patients had seizures before 4 months of age. In conclusion, although the number of patients examined is small and the result is still preliminary, the perfusion/metabolism discrepancy found in this study may show potential characteristic aspect of HME and further study with simultaneous EEG recording will make clear if this finding can be useful indicator for early surgical treatment in HME.

Blood samples were obtained at 0 (fasting baseline, right before glucose ingestion), 30, 60, and 120 min during the OGTT. Seventy-eight metabolic measures were analysed at each time point for a discovery cohort of 4745 middle-aged Finnish individuals and a replication cohort of 595 senior Finnish participants. We assessed the metabolic changes in response to glucose ingestion (percentage change in relative to fasting baseline) across the four time points and further compared the response profile between five groups with different levels of IR and glucose intolerance. Further, the differences were tested for covariate adjustment, including gender, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, fasting, and 2-h glucose levels. The groups were defined as insulin sensitive with normal glucose (IS-NGT), insulin resistant with normal glucose (IR-NGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and new diabetes (NDM). IS-NGT and IR-NGT were defined as the first and fourth quartile of fasting insulin in NGT individuals. Glucose ingestion induced multiple metabolic responses, including increased glycolysis intermediates and decreased branched-chain amino acids, ketone bodies, glycerol, and triglycerides. The IR-NGT subgroup showed smaller responses for these measures (mean + 23%, interquartile 9-34% at 120 min) compared to IS-NGT (34%, 23-44%, P < 0.0006 for difference, corrected for multiple testing). Notably, the three groups with glucose abnormality (IFG, IGT, and NDM) showed similar metabolic dysregulations as those of IR-NGT. The difference between the IS-NGT and the other subgroups was largely explained by fasting insulin, but not fasting or 2 h glucose. The findings were consistent after covariate adjustment and between the discovery and replication cohort. Insulin-resistant non-diabetic individuals are exposed to a similar adverse postprandial metabolic milieu, and analogous cardiometabolic risk, as those with type 2 diabetes. The wide range of metabolic abnormalities associated with IR highlights the necessity of diabetes diagnostics and clinical care beyond glucose management.

High and low electrolyte concentrations were added to each total nutrient admixture before storage at 4 degrees C for 48 hours then at 20-22 degrees C for 24 hours. Stability studies were also performed on total nutrient admixtures containing higher concentrations of fat emulsion and total nutrient admixtures with added cysteine hydrochloride and carnitine. High electrolyte concentrations only were added to these total nutrient admixtures before being stored refrigerated for 24 hours then at room temperature for 24 hours. Visual assessment, pH determination, and particle size analysis were performed immediately after compounding and after refrigerated and room temperature storage. Particle size was assessed by measuring the mean diameter of the fat emulsion and the percent of oil volume in particles greater than 5 microns. Repeated-measures analyses of variance were used to determine significance of type or concentration of fat emulsion, electrolyte concentrations, or time on mean diameter or percent particles greater than 5 microns. There were minimal changes in pH values over time. Creaming was observed in all total nutrient admixtures at all sampling times except time zero. This was reversible upon agitation. Results of particle size analysis over time indicated little change in mean diameter or percent particles greater than 5 microns. These minimal changes did not seem to be clinically significant.

Children (9-18 years old; n = 41) had all meals provided for 9 days with the same energy and macronutrient composition as their standard diet, but with starch substituted for sugar, yielding a final fructose content of 4% of total kilocalories. Metabolic assessments were performed before and after fructose restriction. Liver fat, VAT, and subcutaneous fat were determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging. The fractional DNL area under the curve value was measured using stable isotope tracers and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Insulin kinetics were calculated from oral glucose tolerance tests.

The physicochemical parameters of PLMs can have a deleterious effect on tooth structure. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the erosive and cariogenic effect of widespread PLMs on the surface roughness and structure of primary tooth enamel. The erosive potential of 8 common PLMs used in Egypt was assessed by measuring their inherent pH, using a digital pH electrode meter. The total sugar content was measured according to the Fehling method. The erosive effect of each liquid medicine on the enamel surface of primary teeth was assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis for calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) content. Most PLMs revealed an acidic nature, with pH values ranging between 3.47 and 6.92. About 93.8% of analgesics had pH values ≤5.5, critical for enamel demineralization, whereas most antitussives and 1 antibiotic (Augmentin®) had pH values ≥6.2. Sucrose was present in all the samples studied. The SEM analysis revealed observable differences in the tooth enamel in the experimental groups, with different degrees of surface roughness and erosion.

Although the factors that increase mortality risk are known, an index predicting long-term survival has yet to be established. Two hundred sixty patients who were hospitalized during the first month of their life were screened, and 94 patients diagnosed with IMDs were included in the study. Clinical and laboratory data were assessed to identify any independent prognostic factors for overall survival. Among the 38 patients with IMDs in the exitus group, the presence of dysmorphism, extremity abnormalities, respiratory distress, cyanosis, elevated transaminases, elevated INR, hypoglycemia, hypoalbuminemia, metabolic acidosis, electrolyte imbalance and anemia were associated with poorer survival.

865,865,11893791,"Childhood obesity, epidemic in the United States, has been accompanied by an increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes among children and adolescents. We determined the prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance in a multiethnic cohort of 167 obese children and adolescents. All subjects underwent a two-hour oral glucose-tolerance test (1.75 g [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] of glucose per kilogram of body weight), and glucose, insulin, and C-peptide levels were measured. Fasting levels of proinsulin were obtained, and the ratio of proinsulin to insulin was calculated. Insulin resistance was estimated by homeostatic model assessment, and beta-cell function was estimated by calculating the ratio between the changes in the insulin level and the glucose level during the first 30 minutes after the ingestion of glucose. Impaired glucose tolerance was detected in 25 percent of the 55 obese children (4 to 10 years of age) and 21 percent of the 112 obese adolescents (11 to 18 years of age); silent type 2 diabetes was identified in 4 percent of the obese adolescents. Insulin and C-peptide levels were markedly elevated after the glucose-tolerance test in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance but not in adolescents with diabetes, who had a reduced ratio of the 30-minute change in the insulin level to the 30-minute change in the glucose level. After the body-mass index had been controlled for, insulin resistance was greater in the affected cohort and was the best predictor of impaired glucose tolerance. Impaired glucose tolerance is highly prevalent among children and adolescents with severe obesity, irrespective of ethnic group. Impaired oral glucose tolerance was associated with insulin resistance while beta-cell function was still relatively preserved. Overt type 2 diabetes was linked to beta-cell failure.

868,868,30568042,"Excessive insulin secretion may lead to glucose dysregulation. Our aim was to identify primary (independent of insulin resistance) insulin hypersecretion in subjects with normal glucose tolerance and its role in the progression of dysglycemia. In 1,168 adults, insulin secretion rate (ISR) and β cell function were estimated by C-peptide modeling during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and an i.v. glucose tolerance test. Whole-body insulin sensitivity was measured by a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. After regressing ISR on insulin sensitivity, subjects in the upper tertile of the distribution of residuals were defined as primary hypersecretors. This approach was applied to a biethnic cohort of 182 obese adolescents, who received an OGTT, a hyperglycemic, and a euglycemic clamp. Adult hypersecretors showed older age, more familial diabetes, sedentary lifestyle, increased fat mass, and worse lipid profile compared with the rest of the cohort, despite virtually identical BMI and insulin sensitivity. Insulin secretion was increased by 53% due to enhanced (+23%) β cell glucose sensitivity. Despite the resulting hyperinsulinemia, glucose tolerance was worse in hypersecretors among both adults and adolescents, coupled with higher indices of liver insulin resistance and increased availability of gluconeogenic substrates. At the 3-year follow-up, adult hypersecretors had increased incidence of impaired glucose tolerance/type 2 diabetes. Primary insulin hypersecretion, independent of insulin resistance, is associated with a worse clinical and metabolic phenotype in adults and adolescents and predicts deterioration of glucose control over time.

A school-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February 21 to March 31, 2016. A total of 735 school children were included in the study. A stratified multistage sampling followed by systematic sampling technique was employed to select the study participants. Thyroid physical examination was done and classified according to the World Health Organization recommendations as grade 0, grade 1, and grade 2. The level of salt iodine content was determined using the rapid field test kit. The value 0 parts per million (PPM), <15 PPM and ≥15 PPM with the corresponding color chart on the rapid test kit were used to classify the level of iodine in the sampled salt. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was employed to identify factors associated with goiter. Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) was calculated to show the strength of association. In multivariable analysis, variables with a P-value of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

In the present study, we have measured tumor tryptophan uptake in 40 patients with primary brain tumors using AMT PET and standard uptake values (SUV). Tryptophan metabolism was further quantified in 23 patients using blood input data. Estimates of the volume of distribution (VD') and the metabolic rate constant (k(3)') were calculated and related to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histology findings. All grade II to IV gliomas and glioneuronal tumors showed increased AMT SUV, including all recurrent/residual tumors. Gadolinium enhancement on MRI was associated with high VD' values, suggesting impaired blood-brain barrier, while k(3)' values were not related to contrast enhancement. Low-grade astrocytic gliomas showed increased tryptophan metabolism, as measured by k(3)'. In contrast, oligodendrogliomas showed high VD' values but lower k(3)' as compared with normal cortex. In astrocytic tumors, low grade was associated with high k(3)' and lower VD', while high-grade tumors showed the reverse pattern. The findings show high AMT uptake in primary and residual/recurrent gliomas and glioneuronal tumors. Increased AMT uptake can be due to increased metabolism of tryptophan and/or high volume of distribution, depending on tumor type and grade. High tryptophan metabolic rates in low-grade tumors may indicate activation of the kynurenine pathway, a mechanism regulating tumor cell growth. AMT PET might be a useful molecular imaging method to guide therapeutic approaches aimed at controlling tumor cell proliferation by acting on tryptophan metabolism.

Adolescents who consumed excess free fructose beverages at least 5 times per week or 1 to 4 times per week had about fivefold greater odds of presence of allergic symptoms than did those who seldom consumed these beverages (OR = 5.164; 95% CI, 1.866-14.297 and OR = 4.112; 95% CI, 1.857-9.107, respectively). Adolescents who consumed apple juice at least 5 times per week had a twofold greater odds of presence of allergic sensitization than did the seldom consumers (OR = 2.215; 95% CI, 1.178-4.164). These findings provide some support for the hypothesis of a link between intake of excess free fructose beverages and allergic symptoms or allergic sensitization in children and adolescents.

We performed a prospective cohort study involving 528 neonates with a gestational age of at least 35 weeks who were considered to be at risk for hypoglycemia; all were treated to maintain a blood glucose concentration of at least 47 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter). We intermittently measured blood glucose for up to 7 days. We continuously monitored interstitial glucose concentrations, which were masked to clinical staff. Assessment at 2 years included Bayley Scales of Infant Development III and tests of executive and visual function. Of 614 children, 528 were eligible, and 404 (77% of eligible children) were assessed; 216 children (53%) had neonatal hypoglycemia (blood glucose concentration, <47 mg per deciliter). Hypoglycemia, when treated to maintain a blood glucose concentration of at least 47 mg per deciliter, was not associated with an increased risk of the primary outcomes of neurosensory impairment (risk ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 1.20; P=0.67) and processing difficulty, defined as an executive-function score or motion coherence threshold that was more than 1.5 SD from the mean (risk ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.51; P=0.74). Risks were not increased among children with unrecognized hypoglycemia (a low interstitial glucose concentration only). The lowest blood glucose concentration, number of hypoglycemic episodes and events, and negative interstitial increment (area above the interstitial glucose concentration curve and below 47 mg per deciliter) also did not predict the outcome. In this cohort, neonatal hypoglycemia was not associated with an adverse neurologic outcome when treatment was provided to maintain a blood glucose concentration of at least 47 mg per deciliter.

873,873,25573384,"Combustible tobacco use remains the number one preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in the United States. Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), which include e-cigarettes, are devices capable of delivering nicotine in an aerosolized form. ENDS use by both adults and youth has increased rapidly, and some have advocated these products could serve as harm-reduction devices and smoking cessation aids. ENDS may be beneficial if they reduce smoking rates or prevent or reduce the known adverse health effects of smoking. However, ENDS may also be harmful, particularly to youth, if they increase the likelihood that nonsmokers or formers smokers will use combustible tobacco products or if they discourage smokers from quitting. The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recognize the potential ENDS have to alter patterns of tobacco use and affect the public's health; however, definitive data are lacking. AACR and ASCO recommend additional research on these devices, including assessing the health impacts of ENDS, understanding patterns of ENDS use, and determining what role ENDS have in cessation. Key policy recommendations include supporting federal, state, and local regulation of ENDS; requiring manufacturers to register with the FDA and report all product ingredients, requiring childproof caps on ENDS liquids, and including warning labels on products and their advertisements; prohibiting youth-oriented marketing and sales; prohibiting child-friendly ENDS flavors; and prohibiting ENDS use in places where cigarette smoking is prohibited.

There is an ongoing discussion whether there is a linear relationship between degree of overweight and deterioration of CVRFs justifying body mass index (BMI) cut-offs for treatment decisions. We studied the impact of BMI-SDS on blood pressure, lipids, and glucose metabolism in 76,660 children (aged 5-25 years) subdivided in five groups: overweight (BMI-SDS 1.3 to <1.8), obesity class I (BMI-SDS 1.8 to <2.3), class II (BMI-SDS 2.3-2.8), class III (BMI-SDS > 2.8-3.3), and class IV (BMI-SDS > 3.3). Analyses were stratified by age and sex. We found a relationship between BMI-SDS and blood pressure, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, liver enzymes, and the triglycerides-HDL-cholesterol ratio at any age and sex. Many of these associations lost significance when comparing children with obesity classes III and IV: In females < 14 years and males < 12 years triglycerides and glucose parameters did not differ significantly between classes IV and III obesity. Prevalence of dyslipidemia was significantly higher in class IV compared to class III obesity only in females ≥ 14 years and males ≥ 12 years but not in younger children. In girls < 14 years and in boys of any age, the prevalences of type 2 diabetes mellitus did not differ between classes III and IV obesity. Since a BMI above the highest BMI cut-off was not associated consistently with dyslipidemia and disturbed glucose metabolism in every age group both in boys and girls, measurements of CVRFs instead of BMI cut-off seem preferable to guide different treatment approaches in obesity such as medications or bariatric surgery.

Identifying the disease outcomes, short and long-term sequelae may help to establish an evidence-based prevention and education policy for sick days management and DKA prevention. This work aims to describe clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, adolescents, and young adults with established type 1 diabetes (T1D) and explore the effects of COVID-19 on glycemic control and disease course. An observational study was conducted at 3 pediatric diabetes clinics in Israel between mid-March 2020 and mid-March 2021. Included were young people with established T1D, age younger than 30 years, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction). Data were collected from medical files, diabetes devices, and COVID-19 questionnaire. Outcome measures were analyzed by the presence/absence of clinical symptoms (symptomatic/asymptomatic) and by age group (pediatric, < 19 years/young adults, 19-30 years). Of 132 patients, mean age 16.9 ± 5.3years, with COVID-19-confirmed infection, 103 (78%) had related symptoms; the most common were headaches, fatigue, fever, and loss of sense of smell. All had a mild disease course, but 4 required hospitalization and 2 cases were directly related to COVID-19 infection (pleuropneumonia in a patient with immunodeficiency syndrome, 1 case of diabetic ketoacidosis).

We investigated the effects of valproic acid (VPA) and topiramate (TPM) on the blood levels of interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α in children with idiopathic generalized and partial epilepsy. Forty prepubertal children aged 6-12 (mean 8.3±1.7) years, 19/40 (47.5%) female and 21/40 (52.5%) male, with idiopathic generalized or partial epilepsy diagnosed in the child neurology outpatient clinic were included. The patients were divided into two treatment groups: 20 were treated with VPA and 20 with TPM. The plasma levels of IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α were measured using ELISA method before the initiation of treatment and at the 6th and 12th months of the treatment. The Chi-square test was used to compare qualitative data. To compare the periods, recurrence measurements were done using variance analysis and Freidman 2-sided variance analysis. p<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. In the VPA group, the levels of IL-1α significantly increased at 12 months while the levels of IL-10 decreased at 6 months of treatment compared to values before treatment (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α (p>0.05). In the TPM group, lower levels of IL-10 were observed at 6th and 12th months compared to the onset of treatment (p<0.05). The results of this study demonstrated that VPA and TPM might lead to changes in the levels of cytokines in epileptic patients.

This study aimed to describe outcomes of home-managed pediatric sulfonylurea exposures and characteristics of ingestions that are appropriate for home monitoring. This is a retrospective chart review of pediatric (≤5 years) sulfonylurea ingestions in a single poison center over a 19-year period (2002-2020). We reviewed 491 individual cases for age, ingestion quantity, witnessed or unwitnessed ingestions, hypoglycemia (<60 mg/dL), disposition, and severe events (seizures or coma). We excluded cases in which missing pills were later found or another agent was identified. Of 474 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 135 (28%) were initially managed at home.

884,884,38219798,"Severe obesity is a complex, chronic disease affecting nearly 9% of adolescents in the U.S. Although the current mainstay of treatment is lifestyle therapy, pediatric clinical practice guidelines recommend the addition of adjunct anti-obesity medication (AOM), such as phentermine and topiramate. However, guidance regarding when adjunct AOM should be started and how AOM should be used is unclear. Furthermore, an inherent limitation of current treatment guidelines is their ""one-size-fits-all"" approach, which does not account for the heterogeneous nature of obesity and high degree of patient variability in response to all interventions. This paper describes the study design and methods of a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART), ""SMART Use of Medications for the Treatment of Adolescent Severe Obesity."" The trial will examine 1) when to start AOM (specifically phentermine) in adolescents who are not responding to lifestyle therapy and 2) how to modify AOM when there is a sub-optimal response to the initial pharmacological intervention (specifically, for phentermine non-responders, is it better to add topiramate to phentermine or switch to topiramate monotherapy). Critically, participant characteristics that may differentially affect response to treatment will be assessed and evaluated as potential moderators of intervention efficacy. Data from this study will be used to inform the development of an adaptive intervention for the treatment of adolescent severe obesity that includes empirically-derived decision rules regarding when and how to use AOM.

In vitro studies using IMKC and J774.1 cells demonstrated decreased viability when exposed to fructose. Additionally, fructose increased Gpnmb, Tnfa, Mmp12, Il1rn, and Rsad2 in unpolarized IMKC. By mass spectrometry, C13 fructose tracing detected fructose metabolites in glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP).

Calcium and vitamin D supplementation increase bone mineral content and they are justified in children, during pregnancy and lactation, and in postmenopausal women. The intake of milk and milk products could increase the risk of ovarian carcinoma. CC genotype of the lactase gene increased the risk of colorectal carcinoma in Finns; no such effect was observed in British, Spanish and Italian patients. Even small quantities of lactose in drugs (10-750 mg) could elicit intolerance symptoms due to individual susceptibility. In spite of public knowledge and advertising, controlled studies did not prove the beneficial effect of either a lactose-free diet, enzyme supplementation or probiotics in an evidence-based manner. While accepted guidelines are lacking, a personalised therapy is mandatory. In spite of increasing public interest in lactose intolerance, many unknown factors must still be studied.

We prospectively identified all new cases of overt hypothyroidism in two areas of Denmark before and for the first 7 yr after IF had been introduced. A computer-based register was used to identify continuously all new cases of overt hypothyroidism in two subcohorts with previous moderate and mild iodine deficiency (ID), respectively (Aalborg, n = 310,124, urinary iodine = 45 microg/liter; and Copenhagen, n = 225,707, urinary iodine = 61 microg/liter). Data were obtained 1) before IF (1997-1998), 2) during voluntary IF (1999-2000), 3) during early (2001-2002) and 4) during late (2003-2005) period with mandatory IF. The overall incidence rate of hypothyroidism increased during the study period: baseline, 38.3/100,000.yr; voluntary IF, 43.7 (not significant vs. baseline); early mandatory IF, 48.7 [vs. baseline, rate ratio (RR) = 1.27; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10-1.47]; and late mandatory IF, 47.2 (vs. baseline, RR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.07-1.42).

890,890,33212947,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently the most common form of liver disease in both adults and children, becoming the leading cause for liver transplant in many countries. Its prevalence has increased considerably in recent years, mainly due to the explosive increase in pediatric obesity rates. NAFLD is strongly associated with central obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, and it has been considered as the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. Its complex pathophysiology involves a series of metabolic, inflammatory and oxidative stress processes, among others. Given the sharp increase in the prevalence of NAFLD and the lack of an appropriate pharmacological approach, it is crucial to consider the prevention/management of the disease based on lifestyle modifications such as the adoption of a healthy nutrition pattern. Herein, we review the literature and discuss the role of three key nutrients involved in pediatric NAFLD: fructose and its participation in metabolism, Omega-3 fatty acids and its anti-inflammatory effects and vitamin E and its action on oxidative stress.

891,891,7556586,"The respiratory burst is dependent on a source of glucose. We wished to investigate the effect of glucose on the superoxide production of circulating neutrophils. Superoxide production of neutrophils was significantly enhanced by glucose concentration of from 1 to 50 mmole/liter in the medium. The neutrophils from asthmatics in both the acute and remission phases showed greater production of superoxide than those of controls. When the neutrophils were made to undergo the respiratory burst, initially in the absence of glucose, and thereafter in the presence of 5 and 20 mmole/liter glucose, the rate of superoxide formation with higher glucose medium was decreased in the control cells but significantly increased in the cells of the acute asthmatics in remission. It is concluded that glucose as an energy source is potentially critical in determining the rate of the respiratory burst and that the neutrophils from asthmatic subjects in some way have an enhanced uptake or metabolism of this substrate. Glycemic status may then have some role in determining the amount of superoxide production, and therefore airway inflammation, in asthma.

In three of the eight subjects, interictal PET revealed unilateral diffuse hypometabolism; following cerebral hemispherectomy in these three patients, all seizures ceased and there were no adverse effects. In one child, ictal PET showed hypermetabolism in the left frontal cortex, left striatum, and right cerebellum; a partial left cerebral hemispherectomy guided by intraoperative electrocorticography was performed, following which all seizures ceased. One infant had relative hypermetabolism in the right temporal and occipital lobes, right thalamus, and left frontal lobe on ictal PET, and EEG telemetry revealed a right occipitotemporal epileptic focus; this infant died from anesthetic complications following right occipitotemporal cortical resection. Of the three unoperated patients, one is a potential candidate for right frontal lobectomy, but the other two were not considered to be surgical candidates due to bilateral epileptogenicity.

The TyG index had a positive correlation with fasting glucose (r = 0.519, p < 0.001), HOMA-IR (r = 0.189, p < 0.017), HbA1c (r = 0.429, p < 0.001), total cholesterol (TC) (r = 0.257, p = 0.001), TG (r = 0.759, p < 0.001), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)(r = 0.152, p < 0.001), and a negative correlation with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)(r = -0.107, p < 0.001) after controlling for sex, age and BMI standard deviation scores (SDS). In multiple regression analyses, 91.8% of the variance in TyG index was explained by age, glucose, HOMA-IR, TG, LDL-C, and HDL-C (p < 0.001). In the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the TyG index [area under the curve (AUC) 0.839)] showed a better performance compared to HOMA-IR (AUC 0.645) in identifying patients with T2DM (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the TyG index had significant association with insulin resistance in T2DM and was superior to HOMA-IR in predicting T2DM in children and adolescents.

In adolescence, visceral obesity, hypertension, hyperinsulinism and insulin resistance are reported. To date, systematic studies of glucose profiles in this age group with CAH are lacking. This was a monocentric, prospective, observational study to determine the glucose profiles under different treatment regimens in a cohort of young patients with CAH. The continuous glucose monitoring device used was the latest generation FreeStyle Libre 3 The cohort consisted of 10 children/adolescents with a mean age of 11 years. Three patients exhibited morning fasting hyperglycaemia. Overall, 6 out of 10 patients had unacceptably few total values in the desired range of 70-120 mg/dL. Tissue glucose values above 140-180 mg/dL were found in 5 of 10 patients. The mean value for glycosylated haemoglobin for the cohort was of 5.8%. All pubertal adolescents with reverse circadian regimens had significantly higher glucose levels at night. Two adolescents showed asymptomatic nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Most of the patients exhibited abnormalities in glucose metabolism. Two-thirds had elevated total 24h glucose values outside the age-appropriate reference values. Thus, this aspect may need to be addressed early in life by adjusting the doses, treatment regimen or dietary measures. Consequently, reverse circadian therapy regimens should be critically indicated and closely monitored due to the potential metabolic risk.

Adolescents (n=144 black, 84 white) and their parents completed a cross-sectional survey in an urban adolescent health clinic. The adolescent survey included screening measures for fruit, vegetable, and fat intake and items on frequency of eating meals with family, while watching television, and at three types of restaurants. Parents provided information on home availability of foods. Correlates of fruit, vegetable, and fat consumption. Spearman correlations for associations among variables, t tests for mean comparisons, and multiple stepwise regression conducted separately for black and white adolescents. In multiple regression, home availability was not significantly associated with fruit, vegetable, or fat intake except for fruit intake among white adolescents only. Use of non-fast-food restaurants was the strongest positive predictor of vegetable intake. For both black and white adolescents, fast-food and buffet restaurant use and eating while watching television were the strongest predictors of fat intake. Compared with restaurant use and eating while watching television, home availability had a relatively small impact on fruit, vegetable, and fat consumption for both black and white adolescents.

The significance of periostin as a biomarker of TH 2-induced airway inflammation, and (importantly) as a measure of the response to TH 2-targeted therapy, has recently been emphasized. We explored the relationship between periostin and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in asthmatic children. The study included 83 children aged 6-15 years in an asthmatic group (n = 54) and healthy controls (n = 29). We measured the periostin levels in serum and performed methacholine and mannitol provocation challenges. The responses to mannitol were expressed as the provocative dose causing a 15% fall in the FEV1 (the PD15 dose). Of the 54 subjects with asthma, all had positive methacholine bronchial provocation test (BPT) results and 38 had positive mannitol BPT results. Children with asthma had significantly higher periostin levels than controls [76.0 (65.0-91.8) vs 71.0 (57.5-80.0) ng/mL; P = 0.017]. Periostin levels were significantly correlated with both the methacholine PC20 and mannitol PD15 values.

907,907,17882917,"Despite the importance of the sense of smell for establishing the flavor of foods and beverages, as well as protecting against environmental dangers, this primary sensory system is commonly ignored by the rhinologist. In this article basic issues related to practical measurement of olfactory function in the clinic are described and examples of the application of the two most common paradigms for such measurement--odor identification and detection--are presented. A listing is made of the 27 olfactory tests currently used clinically, along with their strengths and weaknesses. A brief review of common nasosinus-related disorders for which quantitative olfactory testing has been performed is provided. Although many psychophysical tests are available for quantifying olfactory loss, it is apparent that a number are limited in terms of practicality, sensitivity, and reliability. In general, sensitivity and reliability are positively correlated with test length. Given the strengths of the more reliable forced-choice pyschophysical tests and the limitations of electrophysiological tests, the common distinction between ""subjective"" and ""objective"" tests is misleading and should not be used. Complete recovery of olfactory function, as measured quantitatively, rarely follows surgical or medical interventions in patients with rhinosinusitis. Given the availability of practical clinical olfactory tests, the modern rhinologist can easily quantify cranial nerve (CN) I function. The application of such tests has led to a new understanding of the effects of nasal disease on olfactory function. Except in cases of total or near-total nasal obstruction, olfactory and airway patency measures usually are unrelated, in accord with the concept that rhinosinusitis primarily influences olfactory function by apoptotic pathological changes within the olfactory neuroepithelium.

908,908,25351912,"This clinical practice guideline for treatment of DSM-5 feeding and eating disorders was conducted as part of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) Project 2013-2014. The CPG was developed in accordance with best practice according to the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia. Literature of evidence for treatments of anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED), other specified and unspecified eating disorders and avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) was sourced from the previous RANZCP CPG reviews (dated to 2009) and updated with a systematic review (dated 2008-2013). A multidisciplinary working group wrote the draft CPG, which then underwent expert, community and stakeholder consultation, during which process additional evidence was identified. In AN the CPG recommends treatment as an outpatient or day patient in most instances (i.e. in the least restrictive environment), with hospital admission for those at risk of medical and/or psychological compromise. A multi-axial and collaborative approach is recommended, including consideration of nutritional, medical and psychological aspects, the use of family based therapies in younger people and specialist therapist-led manualised based psychological therapies in all age groups and that include longer-term follow-up. A harm minimisation approach is recommended in chronic AN. In BN and BED the CPG recommends an individual psychological therapy for which the best evidence is for therapist-led cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). There is also a role for CBT adapted for internet delivery, or CBT in a non-specialist guided self-help form. Medications that may be helpful either as an adjunctive or alternative treatment option include an antidepressant, topiramate, or orlistat (the last for people with comorbid obesity). No specific treatment is recommended for ARFID as there are no trials to guide practice. Specific evidence based psychological and pharmacological treatments are recommended for most eating disorders but more trials are needed for specific therapies in AN, and research is urgently needed for all aspects of ARFID assessment and management.

Evidence of the beneficial impact of early nephron-protective strategies and lifestyle modifications on ADPKD prognosis is accumulating. Recent studies have described the association of overweight and obesity with rapid disease progression in adults with ADPKD. Moreover, defective glucose metabolism and metabolic reprogramming have been reported in distinct ADPKD models highlighting these pathways as potential therapeutic targets in ADPKD. Several ""metabolic"" approaches are currently under evaluation in adults, including ketogenic diet, food restriction, and metformin therapy. No data are available on the impact of these approaches in childhood thus far. Yet, according to World Health Organization (WHO), we are currently facing a childhood obesity crisis with an increased prevalence of overweight/obesity in the pediatric population associated with a cardio-metabolic risk profile.

Assessment of intestinal permeability was repeated on 100 infected children after treatment and on a cohort of 68 uninfected children. Infected and uninfected groups were compared with respect to baseline lactulose/mannitol ratio (L/M1) and change in lactulose/mannitol ratio between assessments (delta L/M). The correlations between baseline intensity of infection and L/M1, and between fall in intensity and delta L/M, were evaluated.

PET identified 3 groups of abnormal myocardial segments: segments with hypoperfusion without increased FDG uptake, those with hypoperfusion and increased FDG uptake, and those with normal perfusion and increased FDG uptake. Almost all the segments with persistent or transient abnormal Q waves had abnormal PET findings. PET demonstrated evidence of metabolic activity in 57% of segments with persistent abnormal Q waves and 67% of those with transient abnormal Q waves. Regional wall motion, scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (dyskinesia), was not significantly different between segments with persistent and transient abnormal Q waves (2.3 +/- 1.3 vs 2.2 +/- 1.2). The persistence of abnormal Q waves on serial electrocardiograms was significantly shorter in metabolically active than in inactive segments (19 +/- 17 vs 92 +/- 27 months). In conclusion, in patients with Kawasaki disease, the new appearance of abnormal Q waves is a reliable clue to the presence of ischemic myocardial injury and a high proportion of them are associated with metabolically active myocardial regions. The disappearance of abnormal Q waves does not necessarily mean the normalization of regional myocardial perfusion, metabolism or function, and their early disappearance may imply ""viability"" in the associated myocardial region.

The records of hospitalized infants aged 1-12 months with community-acquired acute gastroenteritis between January 2017 and March 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Factors associated with dysnatremia at presentation were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression analysis. Subsequent sodium levels 4-24 h after intravenous fluid treatments, which were categorized into 2 groups, were determined in the subgroup of infants with normal sodium levels at presentation. A total of 347 infants with a median age of 8.0 (5.0-10.0) months were included. The frequency of dysnatremia at presentation was 14% (hyponatremia 12% and hypernatremia 2.0%). Severe dehydration was associated with dysnatremia at presentation (p = 0.048). Among 68 infants with normal sodium levels at presentation, the median sodium change was highest in the 5% dextrose in saline group, with changes of + 3 (0.5-5) and + 1 (- 2 to 2) mmol/L in infants who received 5% dextrose in saline and 5% dextrose in 1/3-1/2 saline, respectively (p = 0.001). Four out of 47 infants (8.5%) developed hyponatremia while receiving 5% dextrose in 1/3-1/2 saline.

This descriptive study was carried out in a multi-specialty tertiary care hospital. Three hundred nonrepeat E. coli isolates from inpatients were studied. Isolates were differentiated as LF and NLF on the basis of colony characteristics on MacConkey's agar. Possession of virulence and drug resistance genes was determined by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Phylogenetic analysis was performed by triplex PCR methods. Antibiotic sensitivity testing was performed by disk diffusion method. Of 300 isolates 39 (13%) were NLF isolates. Maximum number of NLF isolates belonged to phylogroups B2 and D when compared with LF isolates. The incidence of iutA, hlyA, and neuC genes were significantly higher in NLF isolates. The presence of drug resistance genes such as AmpC gene, SHV, and CTXM were higher in LF isolates. LF isolates demonstrated a higher antimicrobial resistance and NLF isolates possessed higher virulence properties.

Frequent consequences of antiblastic treatments, used to eradicate malignancies, are the partial loss of ovarian function, which in children and young women can result in permanent sterility. Ovarian tissue cryopreservation implemented before the beginning of treatment may potentially restore fertility. However, the physical effects of cryopreservation can damage oocyte survival and decrease follicular cell integrity and stromal preservation. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of different concentrations of 1,2-propanediol (PROH) and sucrose as cryoprotectants and human serum as protein support. Particular concentrations tested were 1.26, 1.5 and 1.08 mol/l PROH, 0.175, 0.2, 0.224 and 0.3 mol/l of sucrose and 20%, 30% and 40% human serum in the freezing solutions and normal or raised sucrose concentrations in the dilution solutions. Ovarian cortical slices from 13 patients, aged 5-38 years, were cryopreserved using slow freezing-rapid thawing. Tests were conducted using light and transmission electron microscopy. Cryo-damage occurred predominantly in the stromal and follicular cells.

Additionally, 15 SNPs derived from Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChips were analyzed. Measured genotype analysis tested associations between SNPs and obesity and diabetes-related traits. Bayesian quantitative trait nucleotide analysis was used to statistically infer the most likely functional polymorphisms. A total of 140 SNPs were identified with minor allele frequencies (MAF) ranging from 0.001 to 0.47. Forty-two of the 70 coding SNPs result in nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions relative to the consensus sequence; 28 SNPs were detected in the promoter, 12 in introns, 28 in the 3'-UTR, and 2 in the 5'-UTR.

Fifty-four healthy adult subjects and twenty-three pseudo-healthy children underwent [(18) F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography at rest. Using statistical parametric mapping (SPM8), age and age squared were first used as covariate of interest to identify linear and non-linear age effects on the regional distribution of glucose metabolism throughout the brain. Then, by selecting voxels of interest (VOI) within the regions showing significant age-related metabolic changes, a psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis was used to search for age-induced changes in the contribution of VOIs to the metabolic activity in other brain areas. Significant linear or non-linear age-related changes in regional glucose metabolism were found in prefrontal cortices (DMPFC/ACC), cerebellar lobules, and thalamo-hippocampal areas bilaterally. Decreases were found in the contribution of thalamic, hippocampal, and cerebellar regions to DMPFC/ACC metabolic activity as well as in the contribution of hippocampi to preSMA and right IFG metabolic activities. Increases were found in the contribution of the right hippocampus to insular cortex and of the cerebellar lobule IX to superior parietal cortex metabolic activities. This study evidences significant linear or non-linear age-related changes in regional glucose metabolism of mesial prefrontal, thalamic, mesiotemporal, and cerebellar areas, associated with significant modifications in neurometabolic connectivity involving fronto-thalamic, fronto-hippocampal, and fronto-cerebellar networks.

932,932,29073303,"In the recent years, alterations in the carbohydrate metabolism, including insulin resistance, are considered as risk factors in the development of hypertension and its complications in young age. Hypertension is associated with significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The onset of pathology responsible for the development of hypertension, as well as levels of biomarkers specific for early stages of atherosclerosis are poorly understood. To compare a group of children whose parents have a history of hypertension (study group) with a group of children with normotensive parents (reference group), with consideration of typical risk factors for atherosclerosis, parameters of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, anthropometric data and new biomarkers of early cardiovascular disease (hsCRP, adiponectin, sICAM-1). The study population consists of 84 children. Of these, 40 children (mean age 13.6±2.7 years) had a parental history of hypertension, and 44 aged 13.1±3.7 yrs were children of normotensive parents. Anthropometric measurements were taken, and measurements of blood pressure, lipid profile, glucose and insulin levels were carried out. The insulin resistance index (HOMA IR) was calculated. Levels of hsCRP, soluble cell adhesion molecules (sICAM) and adiponectin were measured. There were no statistically significant differences in anthropometric parameters (body mass, SDS BMI, skin folds) between groups. Values of systolic blood pressure were statistically significantly higher in the study group (Me 108 vs. 100 mmHg, p= 0.031), as were glycaemia (Me 80 vs. 67 mg/dl p<0.001) and insulinaemia levels (Me 8.89 vs. 5.34 µIU/ml, p=0.024). Higher, statistically significant values of HOMA IR were found in the study group (children of hypertensive parents) (Me 1.68 vs. 0.80 mmol/l × mU/l, p=0.007). Lower adiponectin levels (Me 13959.45 vs. 16822 ng/ml, p=0.020) were found in children with a family history of hypertension. No significant differences were found in the levels of sICAM, hsCRP, and parameters of lipid metabolism.

Nine NAFLD (89% Hispanic, mean age 14.3 years, mean body mass index [BMI] 35.3 kg m(-2)), six obese controls (67% Hispanic, mean age 12.7 years, mean BMI 31.0 kg m(-2)) and nine lean controls (44% Hispanic, mean age 14.3 years, mean BMI 19.4 kg m(-2)) were enrolled. Following fructose ingestion, NAFLD vs. lean controls had elevated serum glucose, insulin and uric acid (P < 0.05), higher urine uric acid (P = 0.001), but lower fructose excretion (P = 0.002) and lower breath hydrogen 180-min AUC (P = 0.04). NAFLD vs. obese controls had similar post-fructose serum glucose, insulin, urine uric acid and breath hydrogen, but elevated serum uric acid (P < 0.05) and lower urine fructose excretion (P = 0.02). Children with NAFLD absorb and metabolize fructose more effectively than lean subjects, associated with an exacerbated metabolic profile following fructose ingestion.

937,937,31948188,"Iodine deficiency (ID) continues to be a problem around the world. This study investigated the prevalence of ID and goiter among school-age children in the city center of Antalya, Turkey. The aim was to investigate the effect of an iodization program, which had been running for sixteen years, on nutritional iodine status in this population. A total of 1,594 school children, aged 6-14 years, were included in this cross-sectional study. ID was evaluated based on median [interquartile range (IQR)] urine iodine/creatine (UI/Cr) (μg/g) ratio and median (IQR) UI concentrations (UIC) (μg/L). UICs were measured using the Sandell-Kolthoff method. Goiter was determined by palpation and staged according to World Health Organization classification. Median (IQR) UIC was found to be 174.69 (119.17-242.83) μg/L, and UIC was found to be lower than 50 μg/L in 6.5% of the population. The median UI/Cr ratio increased from 62.3 to 163.3 μg/g and goiter rates had decreased from 34% to 0.3% over the 16 years of the program. However, 19% were still classified as ID (mild, moderate or severe) and, furthermore, 11.5% were classified as excessive iodine intake. Comparison of two cross-sectional studies, carried out 16-years apart, showed that Antalya is no longer an ID region. However, surveillance should be continued and the percentage of ID and iodine excess individuals in the population should be monitored to avoid emerging problems.

938,938,2972152,"The effects of an oral water load and iv administration of isotonic glucose, hypertonic saline, mannitol and furosemide on release of human atrial natriuretic peptide (hANP) were examined in normal subjects to determine the main factors causing its release. In addition, the influence of age on hANP secretion was investigated. The mean plasma hANP level in normal subjects, 0-89 years old, was 20.6 +/- 1.1 ng/l (mean +/- SEM) and showed age-related change. The plasma hANP level did not change significantly after a water load or infusion of isotonic glucose, but rose significantly from 11.4 +/- 1.4 to 15.6 +/- 3.2 ng/l after infusion of hypertonic saline and from 10.9 +/- 1.6 to 17.8 +/- 4.1 ng/l after infusion of 20% mannitol in parallel with the increase in plasma volume. The plasma hANP level decreased from 17.3 +/- 2.5 to 9.0 +/- 2.5 ng/l after injection of 40 mg of furosemide. A positive correlation was found between change in the plasma hANP level and percent change in the plasma volume (P less than 0.001) on these treatments. The response of plasma hANP to hypertonic saline infusion was greater in older than in young men. These results indicate that 1) the secretion of hANP shows an age-related change and 2) increase in the circulating plasma volume is an important factor regulating hANP secretion.

939,939,9002327,"Previously we reported that standard oral rehydration salts (ORS) solution is not as effective as a reduced-osmolarity glucose-based ORS for the treatment of children with acute noncholera diarrhoea: with standard ORS the diarrhoea lasts longer, stool output is greater, serum sodium is higher, and there is more need for supplemental intravenous infusion. We studied a reduced-osmolarity maltodextrin (MD)-based ORS to determine whether it had similar benefits, and also the effect of sugar malabsorption on the efficacy of standard and MD-based ORS. A total of 90 boys aged 3-24 months with acute noncholera diarrhoea and moderate dehydration were randomly assigned to either standard ORS (glucose 20 g/l, osmolarity 311 mmol/l) or MD-ORS (MD 50 g/l, osmolarity 227 mmol/l). There were no differences in treatment results. Some 46% of subjects had a high total stool output (> 300 g/kg), which was unrelated to the type of ORS given. High stool output was significantly associated with a longer duration of diarrhoea (33 vs. 15 hours; P < 0.001), a persistently elevated serum sodium (149 vs. 144 mmol/l at 24 h; P < 0.02), the need for intravenous infusion (11/41 vs. 0/48; P < 0.002), and an increase in faecal reducing substances (10.8 vs. 3.4 g/l at 24 h; P < 0.001). We conclude that some children given standard ORS develop osmotic diarrhoea owing to the combined effect of transient sugar malabsorption and slight hypertonicity of the ORS. Earlier studies show that this adverse outcome can largely be avoided when extra water is given in reduced-osmolarity glucose-based ORS. Reduced osmolarity has no benefit, however, when glucose is replaced by maltodextrin, probably because the sugars released by hydrolysis of MD, when malabsorbed, raise the intraluminal osmolarity to equal or exceed that of standard ORS. Thus, reduced-osmolarity glucose-based ORS is superior to both standard ORS and reduced-osmolarity solutions based on maltodextrin and probably other complex carbohydrates. Studies are in progress to define the optimal formulation of reduced-osmolarity glucose-based ORS. At the Diarrhoeal Disease Research and Rehydration Centre of Bab El-Sha'reya Hospital in Cairo, Egypt, clinical researchers randomly assigned 90 fully weaned boys aged 3-24 months with non-cholera diarrhea and signs of moderate dehydration to either the treatment group receiving the standard glucose-based oral rehydration solution (ORS) or the group receiving a reduced-osmolarity ORS with minimally hydrolyzed maltodextrins (MD) (50 g/l) in place of glucose (20 g/l). They wanted to determine whether the reduced-osmolarity, MD-based ORS yielded similar benefits as the glucose-based ORS and to examine the effect of sugar malabsorption on the efficacy of both solutions. The osmolarity of the MD-based ORS was 227 mmol/l compared to 311 mmol/l for the standard ORS. There were no significant differences in the clinical outcomes (duration of diarrhea, stool output, ORS intake, serum sodium level, and weight gain at discharge) for each treatment group. High stool output had a significant positive association with longer duration of diarrhea (33 vs. 15 hours for low stool output; p 0.01), a persistently elevated serum sodium concentration (149 vs. 144 mmol/l for low stool output; p 0.02), the need for intravenous infusion (11/41 vs. 0/48 for low stool output; p 0.002), and an increase in substances that reduce feces (10.8 vs. 3.4 g/l for low stool output; p 0.001). Based on these findings, the researchers hypothesized that, like the standard ORS, the reduced osmolarity ORS, in which glucose is replaced with MD, also caused sugar malabsorption. The sugar malabsorption, in turn, increased the effective intraluminal osmolarity to equal or exceed that of the standard ORS. Both sugar malabsorption and intraluminal hypertonicity were responsible for a net flow of water from extracellular fluid into the gut, an increased serum sodium concentration, increased thirst leading to greater intake of ORS, ORS treatment failure, an increase in stool output, and an increase in duration of diarrhea. In conclusion, reduced-osmolarity, glucose-based ORS is superior to the standard glucose-based ORS and reduced-osmolarity, MD-based ORS.

940,940,15329075,"Intractable focal epilepsy is commonly associated with cortical glucose hypometabolism on interictal 2-deoxy-2[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). However, subcortical brain structures also may show hypometabolism on PET and volume changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, and these are less well understood in terms of their pathophysiology and clinical significance. In the present study, we analyzed alterations of glucose metabolism in subcortical nuclei and hippocampus by using FDG-PET in young patients with intractable epilepsy. Thirty-seven patients (mean age, 7.5 years; age range, 1-27 years) with intractable frontal (n = 23) and temporal (n = 14) lobe epilepsy underwent FDG-PET scanning as part of their presurgical evaluation. Normalized glucose metabolism was measured in the thalamus and caudate and lentiform nuclei, as well as in hippocampus, both ipsi- and contralateral to the epileptic focus, and correlated with duration and age at onset of epilepsy, presence or absence of secondary generalization, location of the epileptic focus, and extent of cortical glucose hypometabolism. Long duration of epilepsy was associated with lower glucose metabolism in the ipsilateral thalamus and hippocampus. Duration of epilepsy was a significant predictor of ipsilateral thalamic glucose metabolism in both temporal and frontal lobe epilepsy. Presence of secondarily generalized seizures also was associated with lower normalized metabolism in the ipsilateral thalamus and hippocampus. Extent of cortical hypometabolism did not correlate with subcortical metabolism, and glucose metabolism in the caudate and lentiform nuclei did not show any correlation with the clinical variables. The findings suggest that metabolic dysfunction of the thalamus ipsilateral to the seizure focus may become more severe with long-standing temporal and frontal lobe epilepsy, and also with secondary generalization of seizures.

This study investigated the effects on the intelligence quotient (IQ) of children born to mothers with different levels of iodine supplementation, with or without the administration of levothyroxine (LT4), prior to and during pregnancy. This pilot, prospective, observational study included four study groups, each comprising 15 mother-child pairs, identified on the basis of maternal histories of iodized salt consumption and LT4 treatment prior to and during pregnancy. The groups were labeled as follows: iodine (I), no iodine (no-I), iodine + LT4 (I + T4), and no iodine + LT4 (no-I + T4). IQ tests were administered to children at 6-12 years of age with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-3rd Edition (WISC-III), with full-scale IQ (FSIQ), verbal IQ (VIQ), and performance IQ (PIQ) being evaluated. Children of I and I + T4 mothers had similar verbal, performance, and FSIQs, which were 14, 10, and 13 points higher, respectively, than children born to no-I and no-I + T4 mothers. A positive association was found between VIQ and maternal urinary iodine (β = 1.023 [confidence interval (CI) 1.003-1.043]; p = 0.028), but not with maternal free thyroxine concentrations at any stage of pregnancy. Overall, the prevalence of borderline or defective cognitive function was more than threefold higher in the children of mothers not using iodized salt than of those mothers using it (76.9% vs. 23.1%, odds ratio 7.667 [CI 2.365-24.856], χ2 = 12.65; p = 0.0001). Neuro-intellectual outcomes in children appear to be more dependent on their mothers' nutritional iodine status than on maternal thyroid function.

Children with overweight or obesity aged 8 to 11 years were eligible, and the study was performed in an out-of-school context. The exercise program included 3 to 5 sessions/wk (90 min/session) of aerobic plus resistance training for 20 weeks. The wait-list control group continued with their usual routines. Cardiometabolic outcomes as specified in the trial protocol included body composition (fat mass, fat-free mass, and visceral adipose tissue), physical fitness (cardiorespiratory, speed-agility, and muscular), and traditional risk factors (waist circumference, blood lipid levels, glucose levels, insulin levels, and blood pressure). Cardiometabolic risk score (z score) was calculated based on age and sex reference values for levels of triglycerides, inverted high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose, the mean of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and waist circumference. An additional cardiometabolic risk score also included cardiorespiratory fitness. Mental health outcomes included an array of psychological well-being and ill-being indicators. The 92 participants included in the per-protocol analyses (36 girls [39%] and 56 boys [61%]) had a mean (SD) age of 10.0 (1.1) years. The exercise program reduced the cardiometabolic risk score by approximately 0.38 (95% CI, -0.74 to -0.02) SDs; decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level by -7.00 (95% CI, -14.27 to 0.37) mg/dL (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259), body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) by -0.59 (95% CI, -1.06 to -0.12), fat mass index by -0.67 (95% CI, -1.01 to -0.33), and visceral adipose tissue by -31.44 (95% CI, -58.99 to -3.90) g; and improved cardiorespiratory fitness by 2.75 (95% CI, 0.22-5.28) laps in the exercise group compared with the control group. No effects were observed on mental health outcomes. In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, an aerobic plus resistance exercise program improved cardiometabolic health in children with overweight or obesity but had no effect on mental health.

The most frequent side-effects of topiramate include dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, and ataxia. Paraesthesia, metabolic acidosis, kidney stones, hypohidrosis, cognitive impairment and eye symptoms have also been reported. We report on a girl affected by epileptic seizures treated with levetiracetam for five years. Due to worsening of the seizures, the dosage of this drug was increased and afterwards lowdosage topiramate was initiated. After 12 days from the introduction of topiramate, the girl began to present neurologic signs including limbs rigidity, pain, incoordination and flexed fingers. Gradual withdrawn of the topiramate resulted in progressive resolution of the symptomatology.

952,952,38550917,"Childhood obesity is increasing worldwide and presents as a global health issue due to multiple metabolic comorbidities. About 1% of adolescents with obesity develop type 2 diabetes (T2D); however, little is known about the genetic and pathophysiological background at young age. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of impaired glucose regulation (IGR) in a large cohort of children and adolescents with obesity and to characterize insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. We also wanted to investigate adolescents with insulin secretion disorder more closely and analyze possible candidate genes of diabetes in a subcohort. We included children and adolescents with obesity who completed an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT, glucose + insulin) in the outpatient clinic. We calculated Matsuda index, the area under the curve (AUC (Ins/Glu)), and an oral disposition index (ISSI-2) to estimate insulin resistance and beta-cell function. We identified patients with IGR and low insulin secretion (maximum insulin during OGTT < 200 mU/l) and tested a subgroup using next generation sequencing to identify possible mutations in 103 candidate genes. The total group consisted of 903 children and adolescents with obesity. 4.5% showed impaired fasting glucose, 9.4% impaired glucose tolerance, and 1.2% T2D. Matsuda index and Total AUC (Ins/Glu) showed a hyperbolic relationship. Out of 39 patients with low insulin secretion, we performed genetic testing on 12 patients. We found five monogenetic defects (ABCC8 ( Using surrogate parameters of beta-cell function and insulin resistance can help identify patients with insulin secretion disorder. A prevalence of 40% mutations of known diabetes genes in the subgroup with low insulin secretion suggests that at least 1.7% of patients with adolescent obesity have monogenic diabetes.

The present study is a three-dimensional brain surface analysis designed to demonstrate the functional relation between glucose PET abnormalities and epileptogenic cortical regions. Twelve young patients (mean age, 10.8 years) with intractable epilepsy of neocortical origin underwent chronic intracranial electroencephalographic monitoring. The exact location of the subdural electrodes was determined on high-resolution three-dimensional reconstructed magnetic resonance imaging scan volumes. The electrodes were classified according to their locations over cortical areas, which were defined as hypometabolic, normometabolic, or at the border between hypometabolic and normal cortex (metabolic ""border zones"") based on interictal glucose PET. Electrodes with seizure onset were located over metabolic border zones significantly more frequently than over hypometabolic or normometabolic regions. Seizure spread electrodes also more frequently overlay metabolic border zones than hypometabolic regions. These findings suggest that cortical areas with hypometabolism should be interpreted as regions mostly not involved in seizure activity, although epileptic activity commonly occurs in the surrounding cortex. This feature of hypometabolic cortex is remarkably similar to that of structural brain lesions surrounded by epileptogenic cortex. Cortical areas bordering hypometabolic regions can be highly epileptogenic and should be carefully assessed in presurgical evaluations.

969,969,31323889,"The inhabitants of Lazio, similarly to those of other Italian regions, have been historically exposed to the detrimental effects of an inadequate intake of iodine. The latter is a micronutrient essential for the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones (TH). Iodine deficiency is responsible for a number of adverse effects on human health known as iodine deficiency disorders (IDD), the most common of which worldwide are goiter and hypothyroidism. In order to reduce IDD, a national salt iodination program was started in Italy in 2005. In this article we reviewed the available data regarding iodine intake in the Lazio population before and after the introduction of the national salt iodination program, in order to evaluate its efficacy and the eventual problem(s) limiting its success. On the whole, the information acquired indicates that, following the introduction of the program, the dietary iodine intake in the Lazio population is improved. There is, however, still much work ahead to ameliorate the iodine prophylaxis in this region. In fact, although a generally adequate iodine intake in school-age children has been observed, there are still areas where a mild iodine insufficiency is present. Moreover, two independent epidemiological surveys on pregnant women evidenced a low urinary iodine concentration with respect to the reference range conceived by the World Health Organization. These findings demonstrate the need for greater attention to the iodine prophylaxis by health care providers (i.e., obstetricians, gynecologists, pediatricians, etc.), and the implementation of effective advertising campaigns aimed at increasing the knowledge and awareness of the favorable effects of iodine supplementation on population health.

During a 6-month period, all patients (n=90; 33 males, median age 45 years, range 10-81; 57 females, median age 47 years, range 15-71) who consecutively presented for H2 exhalation tests were evaluated. In addition to the test results, data were obtained from the referring physicians and from the family doctors responsible for the patients' long-term treatment regarding the role of the test results in the treatment of the patients. Finally, the patients were also asked whether any improvement in their symptoms had followed from the test results. Lactulose tests were normal in only 63% of the patients. As with the other sugars, at least one form of malabsorption was detected in 47 patients (52%). The malabsorption rate was 34% after lactose, 61% after fructose, and 91% after the intake of sorbitol. The referring physicians evaluated the test results as having been important in 52% of the patients, while the family doctors considered that there was some benefit for the patients in 77% of the cases. The patients themselves reported an improvement in 75% of cases. These data again show that carbohydrate malabsorption is an important differential diagnosis in patients with nonspecific abdominal complaints.

In many developing countries, where traditional dietary patterns have changed to include sugar-containing foods and beverages, caries prevalence has increased and will continue to do so in the immediate future. Accordingly, it would be a serious mistake to be complacent about caries prevention. In future industrialized countries will see computers playing a significant role in cariology, finding applications not only in research and practice administration but directly in clinical practice as well. They will be used in every operatory in the assessment of caries risk, the recording of caries prevalence, the direct storing of radiographic information, and the restoration of carious teeth, assisted by computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacture (CAD/CAM) technology. Fluoride therapy, both systemic and topical, will continue to be the basis of caries prevention. Dental sealants, which are highly effective in protecting pits and fissures when applied soon after the teeth erupt, will be more widely used in the future when insurance plans will pay for prevention. Substitution of sucrose and syrups by non-fermentable sweetening agents can also reduce caries increments, but most agents are more expensive than sucrose and require consumer education to pay for the additional cost.

973,973,28178991,"This article reports on the use of domestic or table salt for its perceived health effects and healing properties in a Latino farmworker community. It explores how contemporary salt usage beliefs can be seen to have roots in long-standing humoral theories of medicine and health. This qualitative investigation comprised 30 in-depth individual interviews and five focus groups conducted in Spanish with Mexican and Central American immigrants in one small city in California's Central Valley (N = 61 total participants). Interviews and focus groups were audiotaped, translated into English and transcribed. Several researchers independently and iteratively read transcripts, developed and applied codes, and engaged in thematic analysis. Strongly emergent themes identified the importance of balance in health, and beliefs about the effects on salt on health. Valued for its culinary role, for bringing out the flavors in food, and used by people of all ages, salt use is part of a robust set of cultural practices. Salt was regularly mixed with foods in different combinations and ingested to restore balance, prevent disequilibrium or reduce vulnerability to diverse illnesses, promote rehydration, and address symptoms of exposure to extremes of temperature or physical or emotional stress. Statements made and practices engaged in by participants were highly suggestive of health and healing beliefs common to humoral belief systems based primarily on a hot-cold dichotomy in classifications of foods and healing behaviors. We evaluate these statements and practices in the context of the existing literature on historical and contemporary humoral beliefs in Latin American communities, in Mexico and Central America, and in the United States. Humoral theory is a useful framework for understanding contemporary rural Latino migrant farmworkers' perceptions of the importance of salt for their health.

We aimed to identify potential serum metabolic alterations associated with hypertension in adolescents. A 1:1 age- and sex-matched case-control study including 30 hypertensive adolescents aged 12-17 years and 30 normotensive adolescents for the training set and 14 hypertensive adolescents and 14 normotensive adolescents for the test set was performed, which came from one cross-sectional study in Ningxia, China. Hypertension was defined based on blood pressure (BP) values measured on three different occasions according to the BP reference of Chinese children and adolescents. Untargeted ultra-high-performance liquid tandem chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry was used to identify differential metabolites between hypertensive and normotensive adolescents. A total of 77 metabolites in positive mode and 101 in negative mode were identified (VIP > 1.0 and P < 0.05). After adjustment for the false discovery rate, 4 differential metabolites in positive mode and 10 in negative mode were found (Q value < 0.05). The logistic regression model adjusted for body mass index and lipid profile selected four significant metabolites (4-hydroxybutanoic acid, L-serine, acetone, and pterostilbene). The main metabolic pathways of amino acid metabolism, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, fructose and mannose metabolism, and linoleic acid metabolism may contribute to the development of hypertension in Chinese adolescents. Based on the receiver operating characteristic plot, 4-hydroxybutanoic acid, L-serine, acetone, and pterostilbene may preliminarily help distinguish hypertension from normal BP in adolescents, with AUC values of 0.857 in the training set and 0.934 in the test set.

We performed a single-blinded, cross-sectional survey of 60 healthy children (5-14 years), adults (15-54 years) and older adults (≥55 years) to determine palatability and overall acceptability of five oral rehydration solutions (ORS) and a positive control drink (Sprite Zero®) in Ghana. Quantitative data were described and differences between our control drink and the others across age groups were visually examined with Likert plots. Qualitative responses were analyzed using a content analysis framework. Twenty participants in each age group completed the study. Participants were as young as 5 years and as old as 84 years. Nearly two thirds of the sample identified as male (n = 38, 63% of all participants). The positive control was reported to taste 'good or 'very good' by the majority of participants (89%) followed by lemon-flavored ORS (78%) and orange-flavored ORS (78%). Conversely, homemade and low-osmolarity ORS were reported to taste 'good' or 'very good' by only 20% and 15% of participants, respectively. There were no major taste differences across the age groups. However, children more frequently reported positively (i.e., tastes 'good' or 'very good') about flavored and sweet drinks than did adults and older adults. When faced with the hypothetical situation of being critically injured and needing resuscitation, participants tended to be more agreeable to consuming all the drinks, even low-osmolarity and homemade ORS. These findings can be used to support the development of protocols that may be more acceptable among patients undergoing enterally based resuscitation, thus improving the effectiveness of the treatment. Specifically, enterally based resuscitation should likely include citrus-flavored ORS when available, given superior palatability and the fact that different flavor additives for patients of different ages do not seem necessary.

The flow velocity of tricuspid regurgitation was measured with continuous-wave Doppler of the right ventricular inflow view or left parasternal or apical four-chamber view before and after injection of two types of contrast medium (hand-agitated 5% glucose or sonicated albumin). The systolic pressure of the pulmonary artery was assessed as the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (albumin method) minus the peak pressure gradient across the pulmonary valve (nonenhanced Doppler method). After injection of hand-agitated 5% glucose and sonicated albumin, trivial tricuspid regurgitation signals were enhanced in 25 of 28 patients (89%). In two patients, spectral envelopes were well defined enough to obtain the peak systolic velocity of the tricuspid regurgitation jet without contrast medium injection. Peak velocity was not altered by injection of contrast medium in these patients. There was significant correlation between the estimation by contrast-enhanced Doppler using hand-agitated 5% glucose and the cardiac catheterization measurement of the transtricuspid pressure gradient (r = 0.88). The transtricuspid pressure gradients obtained by continuous-wave Doppler during sonicated albumin enhancement corresponded closely to those measured by cardiac catheterization (r = 0.95). Pulmonary arterial and right ventricular systolic pressures measured by Doppler using sonicated albumin and those obtained by cardiac catheterization were highly correlated (right ventricle, r = 0.96; pulmonary artery, r = 0.95). In conclusion, this technique may be a valuable noninvasive method for determining accurate right ventricular and pulmonary arterial systolic pressures.

983,983,8374690,"Growth retardation is a common feature in children with end-stage renal failure (ESRF). Medical management of renal insufficiency rarely normalizes growth and optimistic reports on the effect of rhGH treatment on growth velocity may presage more extensive use of rhGH in pediatric nephrology. Ample evidence has shown beneficial effects of GH replacement therapy in both childhood and adolescent hypopituitarism. However, the remarkably few side effects of treatment reported in these conditions cannot necessarily be extrapolated to children with ESRF. Uremia is associated with a wide range of metabolic and hormonal derangements including decreased glucose tolerance. This is mainly due to impaired insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in peripheral tissues and insufficient insulin-induced suppression of hepatic glucose production. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle in ESRF is reduced by 30-50% as compared to that in healthy subjects, and a reduction may be detected even in subjects with a more moderate reduction in renal function (GFR around 25 ml/min). Dialysis therapy improves the disturbed insulin action significantly. The cause of the insulin resistance in ESRF is multifactorial. Impaired physical fitness, accumulation of uremic toxins, raised levels of GH and glucagon, metabolic acidosis, dyslipidemia and the medication applied may all contribute. If exogenous GH administration is added to the already marked uremic insulin resistance, insulin action may be severely disturbed and the secondary hyperinsulinism further magnified. However, frank diabetes mellitus does not develop unless the beta cells fail to meet the enhanced demands. This will probably occur only in patients with a beta-cell genotype pivotal for the phenotypic expression of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) ",1983,Glucose metabolism in chronic renal failure with reference to GH treatment of uremic children,"Schmitz O, Orskov L, Lund S, Møller N, Christiansen JS, Orskov H.",J Pediatr Endocrinol. 1993 Jan-Mar;6(1):53-9. doi: 10.1515/jpem.1993.6.1.53.,Schmitz O,J Pediatr Endocrinol,1993,1993/01/01,,,10.1515/jpem.1993.6.1.53

We sought to determine if overweight Hispanic adolescents with PCOS are more likely to be insulin resistant and glucose intolerant than those without PCOS. A retrospective chart review of 101 subjects with PCOS and 40 without PCOS was conducted. Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI), and fasting glucose/insulin ratio (FGIR) values were calculated by using fasting glucose and insulin levels. Insulin resistance (IR) was defined as a fasting insulin level of >15 microU/mL, a 2-hour insulin level of >75 microU/mL, a HOMA-IR value of >3.16, a QUICKI value of <0.357, and/or a FGIR value of <7. Of the 101 overweight subjects with PCOS (BMI: 33.2 +/- 5.9 kg/m(2)), 4 had IGT and 2 had DM versus none of the 40 subjects without PCOS (BMI: 32.4 +/- 5.3 kg/m(2)). IR was more frequent in the overweight PCOS than in the overweight non-PCOS group (QUICKI: 68.4% vs 14.3%, P = .014) and FGIR (47.4% vs 0%, P = .024). Of the 6 subjects with glucose intolerance, only the QUICKI value was abnormal in all. This retrospective study demonstrated that overweight Hispanic adolescents with PCOS had more IR, IGT and DM than their non-PCOS counterparts.

989,989,22516881,"Autism is a developmental disorder with a possible connection between dietary components and triggering or worsening of symptoms. An altered intestinal permeability might allow absorption of incompletely digested peptides (gluten and casein) that could produce opioid-like activity on the brain, causing significant changes in behavior. To assess the intestinal permeability and nutritional status of participants with developmental disorders to determine if changes in the intestinal mucosal barrier and/or injury to the intercellular junctions have occurred that might justify application of further dietary modifications. To assess intestinal permeability, the research team analyzed participants urine under fasting conditions, using gas chromatography to determine chromatographic peaks. To assess nutritional status, the team determined participants heights and weights and performed a bioelectric bioimpedance examination at least 4 hours after their most recent meal. In addition, the team determined food intake using three diet diaries. They asked participants and caregivers to register each food consumed during 2 nonconsecutive weekdays and 1 weekend day. The study occurred at the Ribeirao Preto School of Medicine, Sao Paulo University. Seven participants aged 9 to 23 years with developmental disorders (the developmental group, DG) completed the study. The research team recruited them through the Association of Friends of the Autistic Persons of Ribeirao Preto in Ribeirao Preto, Brazil. The control group (CG) consisted of nonsmoking healthy volunteers in the general population who were similar in age to the experimental group and did not suffer from diseases that potentially could influence nutritional status and intestinal function. To assess intestinal permeability, participants ingested 150 mL of an isosmolar solution of the sugars mannitol (2 g) and lactulose (7.5 g) under fasting conditions and the researchers collected all voided urine over a period of 5 hours. Using chromatographic peaks, the research team quantified the mannitol and lactulose in participants urine by calculating the percentage excreted in relation to the ingested amounts of sugar. This calculation gave them the lactulose-to-mannitol ratio (L/M). To evaluate nutritional status, they used data regarding bioimpedance resistance, heights, and weights to estimate lean mass and body water (in liters). They classified adults and adolescents using the body mass index (BMI). For children (2-10 y), they classified participants height-to-age and weight-to-height ratios. The research team used food intake to examine the macronutrient interval, the mean added sugar consumption, and the quantity of protein, in g/kg weight. Participants with developmental disorders (n = 7) were more likely to be overweight. Their usual diet revealed a high intake of lipids (%) and proteins (g/kg) (compared to reference values) and a high intake of calories (kcal) and carbohydrates (%) (compared to CG) as well as a high intake of food sources that are important contributors of casein and gluten. The DGs (n = 7) mean mannitol excretion was lower, and their L/M higher than the CGs (n = 7) (P < .05). Their increased L/M may indicate atrophy of the intestinal-mucosa surface and/or injury to the intercellular junctions or the effect of some other abnormality. The small number of participants, however, prevented more complex statistical analysis.

Usually this test involves a time consuming procedure of about 5 hour's urine collection, which makes the test incompatible to some extent. As the results are expressed as the ratio of lactulose and mannitol recovered in urine within certain time, it may be possible to get similar result despite the reduced urine collection time of 2 hours. Moreover, different laboratories do the test by different methods, which make the results incomparable between laboratories. Here, we are also trying to find the correlation between results from most commonly used methods: HPAE-PAD and LC-MSMS.

Median age of the children was 15.0 months (range 6.9 to 25.8 months) and their mean weight-for-age z-score was -0.92. A higher percentage of lactulose and mannitol recovery was found in 5 hours urine collection than in the corresponding 2 hours by both HPAE-PAD and LC-MSMS method, but when results were expressed as lactulose to mannitol ratio (LMR) there was no significant difference between 2 and 5 hours urine collection in both HPAE-PAD (P = 0.138) and LC-MSMS (P = 0.099) method.

In the two regions (SNNP and Benshangul-Gumuz) among three where cassava is cultivated, those who consume cassava frequently were significantly (p < 0.001) affected by goitre than those consuming rarely or not. In the last thirty years cassava consumption has been increasing with the concomitant increase in goitre rate and other associated health problems. Acute cyanide intoxication in children from cassava meal was reported. In Amhara region, goitre rate was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in high altitudes than in low both for children and mothers. This was due to significantly (p < 0.01) low level of iodine intake in high lands than in low as indicated by UIE. Due to stigma, parents do not send goitrous children to schools and goitrous girls are not wanted for marriage. Besides low level of iodine intake, cassava consumption and living in high altitude were responsible for the observed variation and severity in goitre rates.

Only 14 children (14 percent) had persisting neurologic sequelae: sensorineural hearing loss in 11 (unilateral in 6 and bilateral in 5), seizure disorder in 2, and hemiplegia and mental retardation in 1. Although the total sample of index children scored slightly below the siblings in reading ability, the 56 children without acute-phase neurologic complications (58 percent) were indistinguishable from their siblings on all measures. The differences between the groups were small even for the 41 pairs in which the index child had had an acute neurologic complication (mean full-scale IQ, 102 for the index children vs. 109 for the siblings). Sequelae were also associated with lower socioeconomic status and a lower ratio of glucose in cerebrospinal fluid to that in blood at the time of the meningitis. Behavioral problems were more prominent in index boys than index girls and in those who were older at the time of testing, but sex and age were not related to cognitive or academic sequelae.

Unintentional or intentional ingestion of hand sanitisers in children under the age of 12 years may occur because of the colour, smell and flavour added to it. Consumption of alcohol in children may result in hypoglycaemia, apnoea and acidosis. This allows the invasion of other bacterial and viral infections. Children may also rub their eyes with sanitised hands and cause ocular injury. Therefore, the use of hand sanitisers in general needs to be revised in both children and adults. Other interventions on lowering the risk of adverse events because of misuse of hand sanitiser should be practised more often.

997,997,31067006,"There are no known methods to easily evaluate the dietary salt intake of children. We hypothesized that the salt check sheet, for which validity has been confirmed in both hypertensive outpatients and in the general population, can be used to assess dietary salt intake in children. We enrolled 188 healthy schoolchildren (mean age 11.2 ± 1.1 years, 53.2% boys) and asked them to answer both the salt check sheet and a brief self-administered dietary history questionnaire for Japanese schoolchildren aged 6-18 years (BDHQ15y). The mean total salt check-sheet score was 12.7 ± 4.0 points (range: 4-24 points), and the estimated daily salt intake from the BDHQ15y was 12.1 ± 3.7 g (range: 4.7-27.2 g). The total check-sheet score was significantly positively correlated with the estimated daily salt intake from the BDHQ15y (r = 0.408, P < 0.001). Thirty-one study participants were assigned to the ""low"" salt group (total score on the salt check sheet was 0-8 points), 78 participants to the ""medium"" salt group (9-13 points), and 79 participants to the ""high and very high"" salt group (≥14 points), and a comparison estimating daily salt intake from the BDHQ15y among the three groups was performed. Daily salt-intake levels tended to increase as the group of total check-sheet scores increased: ""low"" vs ""medium"" vs ""high and very high"" salt group levels were 9.5 ± 3.1 vs 11.6 vs 13.5 ± 3.9, respectively (P < 0.001). This demonstrates that the salt check sheet is a useful tool to easily assess dietary salt intake in children.

998,998,37032457,"To investigate the relationship between ultra-processed food (UPF) consumption and dental caries in adolescents. Data from 996 adolescents aged 12-13 years who participated in an oral health sub-study of the 2004 Pelotas Birth Cohort in southern Brazil were analysed. The main exposure was daily UPF consumption at age 10-11 years, measured by a food frequency questionnaire containing 24 UPF items defined based on the NOVA system. UPF consumption was calculated in frequency, grams and calories, in general and for six types of food (biscuits, savoury snacks and sugar-sweetened cereals; ultra-processed meats and fats; sweets; fast food and instant noodles; soft drinks and artificially flavoured drinks; and sweetened milk and powdered chocolate). The outcome was dental caries, measured according to the decayed, missing and filled indexes (DMFS and dmfs) at age 12-13 years. Poisson regression models were used to analyse the association between UPF consumption and dental caries, adjusting for socioeconomic and demographic variables, dental visits and oral hygiene. Overall, the daily UPF consumption in frequency, grams and calories was associated with caries. The findings were consistent for UPF consumption for all six food groups. The higher the UPF consumption, the higher the probability of having caries in adolescence. The associations between ultra-processed meats and fats, and fast food and instant noodles intake with dental caries alert to the cariogenic potential of such UPF foods. Ultra-processed food consumption was associated with greater caries burdens in young adolescents. The findings reinforce the need for interventions and public policies to reduce UPF consumption in adolescence.

999,999,37296332,"To examine the associations between exposure to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and maternal glycemic markers during pregnancy and offspring behaviors at 3 and 5 years. We hypothesized that exposure to maternal hyperglycemia would be associated with more behavioral problems in offspring. We included 548 mother-child pairs from the prospective pre-birth Gen3G cohort (Canada). Glycemic markers were measured during a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in the second trimester of pregnancy. Based on OGTT, we classified 59 women (10.8%) as having GDM according to international diagnostic criteria. Mothers reported offspring behavior using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) at 3 and 5 years, and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at 5 years. We used linear mixed models and multivariate regression to assess the associations between GDM or glycemic markers and children's behavior, adjusted for child sex and age, and maternal demographic factors, body mass index and family history of diabetes. Exposure to GDM was associated with higher SDQ externalizing scores at 3 and 5 years [B = 1.12, 95% CI (0.14, 2.10)] in fully adjusted linear mixed models. These results were supported by the CBCL at 5 years. Higher levels of maternal glucose at 1 h and 2 h during OGTT were associated with greater SDQ externalizing scores. Fasting glucose levels were not associated with child behavior scores. We did not observe associations between glycemic markers and internalizing behaviors. Exposure to higher levels of maternal glycemia during pregnancy was associated with more externalizing behaviors in children at 3 and 5 years. What is already known on this subject? Prenatal exposure to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has been linked to a higher risk of long-term consequences in offspring including metabolic problems and cognitive difficulties. However, prior studies examining associations between GDM and behavior in children reported mixed results. What this study adds? We reported associations between exposure to maternal GDM and post-OGTT hyperglycemia during pregnancy and greater levels of externalizing behaviors in children at 3 and 5 years of age. Our results underscore the importance of early detection of behavioral problems in children.
