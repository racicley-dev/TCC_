0,0,30810544,"Electronic cigarettes, handheld devices that generate an aerosol that may contain nicotine by heating a solution or e-liquid, have been increasingly used especially in the young population. The aerosol's composition is determined by temperature, and by the substances contained in the heated liquid: glycerin, propylene glycol, nicotine in variable concentrations, flavoring agents, and other non-nicotine compounds. >80 compounds (including known toxics, e.g., formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, metallic nanoparticles, and acrolein) have been found in e-liquid and aerosols. Airway irritation, mucus hypersecretion, and inflammatory response, including systemic changes, have been observed after the exposure to e-cigarettes, leading to an increase in respiratory symptoms and changes in respiratory function and the host defense mechanisms. E-cigarette has been linked with an increase of symptoms in individuals with asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. One of the major concerns in public health is the rise in e-cigarette experimentation among never-smokers, especially children and adolescents, which leads to nicotine addiction and increases the chances of becoming with time a conventional smoker. There is an urgent need to regulate e-cigarettes and electronic nicotine delivery systems, at least with the same restrictions to those applied to tobacco products, and not to consider them as harmless products.

1,1,19961353,"Studies revealed that Stevia has been used throughout the world since ancient times for various purposes; for example, as a sweetener and a medicine. We conducted a systematic literature review to summarize and quantify the past and current evidence for Stevia. We searched relevant papers up to 2007 in various databases. As we know that the leaves of Stevia plants have functional and sensory properties superior to those of many other high-potency sweeteners, Stevia is likely to become a major source of high-potency sweetener for the growing natural food market in the future. Although Stevia can be helpful to anyone, there are certain groups who are more likely to benefit from its remarkable sweetening potential. These include diabetic patients, those interested in decreasing caloric intake, and children. Stevia is a small perennial shrub that has been used for centuries as a bio-sweetener and for other medicinal uses such as to lower blood sugar. Its white crystalline compound (stevioside) is the natural herbal sweetener with no calories and is over 100-300 times sweeter than table sugar.

2,2,28922262,"The consumption of sugars, particularly sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs; beverages or drinks that contain added caloric sweeteners (ie, sucrose, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice concentrates), in European children and adolescents exceeds current recommendations. This is of concern because there is no nutritional requirement for free sugars, and infants have an innate preference for sweet taste, which may be modified and reinforced by pre- and postnatal exposures. Sugar-containing beverages/free sugars increase the risk for overweight/obesity and dental caries, can result in poor nutrient supply and reduced dietary diversity, and may be associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular risk, and other health effects. The term ""free sugars,"" includes all monosaccharides/disaccharides added to foods/beverages by the manufacturer/cook/consumer, plus sugars naturally present in honey/syrups/unsweetened fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates. Sugar naturally present in intact fruits and lactose in amounts naturally present in human milk or infant formula, cow/goat milk, and unsweetened milk products is not free sugar. Intake of free sugars should be reduced and minimised with a desirable goal of <5% energy intake in children and adolescents aged ≥2 to 18 years. Intake should probably be even lower in infants and toddlers <2 years. Healthy approaches to beverage and dietary consumption should be established in infancy, with the aim of preventing negative health effects in later childhood and adulthood. Sugar should preferably be consumed as part of a main meal and in a natural form as human milk, milk, unsweetened dairy products, and fresh fruits, rather than as SSBs, fruit juices, smoothies, and/or sweetened milk products. Free sugars in liquid form should be replaced by water or unsweetened milk drinks. National Authorities should adopt policies aimed at reducing the intake of free sugars in infants, children and adolescents.

3,3,32715837,"In this review, we examine the known and suspected toxicity of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) in adolescents and young adults, to improve awareness of risks and identification of complications of their use. The use of e-cigarettes, or ""vaping,"" is exploding among the pediatric population. E-cigarettes heat a solution containing a psychoactive compound, most commonly nicotine or tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), along with flavorings and other additives to a vapor, which users inhale. Since their introduction in the early 2000s, e-cigarette use is now prolific among youth, per the Monitoring the Future survey, with over 40% of high school seniors reporting use within the past year. Adolescents are vulnerable to the risks of e-cigarettes, as they are targeted as new consumers with advertisements and flavoring compounds, and are not utilizing them as a means to smoking cessation. The pulmonary risks of vaping are rapidly emerging, with the most immediately alarming being the condition electronic-cigarette/vaping associated lung injury (EVALI). Additionally, there have been more recent studies showing extrapulmonary effects including cardiovascular, immunologic and neuro-developmental effects. Many of these effects are likely dose-dependent. Public health efforts are urgently needed to decrease or eliminate new e-cigarette initiation, and support should be established to assist current e-cigarette users with cessation. We strongly advocate for the elimination of e-cigarette flavorings and advertising directed at adolescents, and call for physicians to be cognizant of this expanding epidemic.

4,4,31463564,"Tobacco continues to kill about 0.48 million Americans per year and there are currently 34.3 million smokers in the USA. As a consequence of the First Surgeon General's Report on Tobacco in 1964, tobacco control interventions on part of the government led to a significant decline in conventional tobacco product usage over the last few decades. However, more recently, a new entity in the form of electronic cigarettes has risen rapidly and has exposed a younger population to a plethora of dangerous consequences. Looking at e-cigarettes from the perspective of tobacco control however raises a lot of challenges. There is little doubt that existing smokers of combustible cigarettes who switch to e-cigarettes will be switching to a less harmful product. However, if the younger generation begins using e-cigarettes as a result of targeted marketing, appealing flavors and 'safer alternative' perception, decades of progress made in conventional tobacco control will be negated. Governments at the federal, state, and local levels have a mandate to once again implement new public health policies to ensure that non-conventional tobacco products like e-cigarettes are available as smoking cessation tools for existing smokers but at the same time do not play a role in ruining the health of future generations through addiction and disease. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the present scenario of regulations and policies impacting public health with respect to electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) with the objective of providing a meaningful and balanced view of the challenges at hand with plausible recommendations. RECENT FINDINGS: Nicotine in tobacco is known to cause addiction and dependence. It is particularly potent in children and young adults. E-cigarettes can deliver high concentrations of nicotine, and these concentrations can vary depending on the numerous constituents within the e-cigarette which vary greatly from one another. Use of e-cigarettes is implicated as a risk factor for future cigarette use in young adults. Moreover, e-cigarette usage patterns also depend on several sociodemographic factors. Banning tobacco products has shown to reduce smoking risk in youth and as such, strong e-cigarette regulation measures are needed for prevention. Effective regulation of ENDS faces a multitude of challenges. One such challenge is to prevent youth and non-smokers from getting habituated to nicotine through e-cigarettes. The intention of tobacco companies to sustain sales through harmful marketing strategies that tone down the risks and highlight e-cigarettes as a ""much safer alternative"" while promoting flavors appealing to children should be immediately prohibited. Another hazard is the endorsement of ENDS as devices meant for enhancing social interaction which opens a path for youth to make erroneous choices under peer pressure. On the other hand, several studies have reported that e-cigarettes significantly reduce an existing smoker's risk of being exposed to toxic tobacco smoke constituents that are normally present in cigarette smoke. This leads to the conclusions that e-cigarettes can be a tool for smoking cessation for current smokers. Public policy must take a multi-dimensional approach to balance these two extremes.

5,5,26376619,"The impact of sugar consumption on health continues to be a controversial topic. The objective of this review is to discuss the evidence and lack of evidence that allows the controversy to continue, and why resolution of the controversy is important. There are plausible mechanisms and research evidence that supports the suggestion that consumption of excess sugar promotes the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) both directly and indirectly. The direct pathway involves the unregulated hepatic uptake and metabolism of fructose, leading to liver lipid accumulation, dyslipidemia, decreased insulin sensitivity and increased uric acid levels. The epidemiological data suggest that these direct effects of fructose are pertinent to the consumption of the fructose-containing sugars, sucrose and high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which are the predominant added sugars. Consumption of added sugar is associated with development and/or prevalence of fatty liver, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hyperuricemia, CVD and T2DM, often independent of body weight gain or total energy intake. There are diet intervention studies in which human subjects exhibited increased circulating lipids and decreased insulin sensitivity when consuming high sugar compared with control diets. Most recently, our group has reported that supplementing the ad libitum diets of young adults with beverages containing 0%, 10%, 17.5% or 25% of daily energy requirement (Ereq) as HFCS increased lipid/lipoprotein risk factors for CVD and uric acid in a dose-response manner. However, un-confounded studies conducted in healthy humans under a controlled, energy-balanced diet protocol that enables determination of the effects of sugar with diets that do not allow for body weight gain are lacking. Furthermore, recent reports conclude that there are no adverse effects of consuming beverages containing up to 30% Ereq sucrose or HFCS, and the conclusions from several meta-analyses suggest that fructose has no specific adverse effects relative to any other carbohydrate. Consumption of excess sugar may also promote the development of CVD and T2DM indirectly by causing increased body weight and fat gain, but this is also a topic of controversy. Mechanistically, it is plausible that fructose consumption causes increased energy intake and reduced energy expenditure due to its failure to stimulate leptin production. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain demonstrates that the brain responds differently to fructose or fructose-containing sugars compared with glucose or aspartame. Some epidemiological studies show that sugar consumption is associated with body weight gain, and there are intervention studies in which consumption of ad libitum high-sugar diets promoted increased body weight gain compared with consumption of ad libitum low- sugar diets. However, there are no studies in which energy intake and weight gain were compared in subjects consuming high or low sugar, blinded, ad libitum diets formulated to ensure both groups consumed a comparable macronutrient distribution and the same amounts of fiber. There is also little data to determine whether the form in which added sugar is consumed, as beverage or as solid food, affects its potential to promote weight gain. It will be very challenging to obtain the funding to conduct the clinical diet studies needed to address these evidence gaps, especially at the levels of added sugar that are commonly consumed. Yet, filling these evidence gaps may be necessary for supporting the policy changes that will help to turn the food environment into one that does not promote the development of obesity and metabolic disease.

6,6,29671076,"Obesity has grown at an alarming rate in children and adolescents. Concurrently, consumption on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) also rose significantly. This review provides an overview of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) related to SSBs and current policies restricting SSBs in schools, school-based interventions, and taxation on reducing SSB intake and obesity. We also discuss challenges of and future steps for these initiatives. Clinical and epidemiological studies suggest a strong association between SSB intake and obesity and T2DM. School food policies have been initiated at federal, state, and local levels. School-based interventions have shown positive effects on SSB intake and obesity reduction. Taxation on SSBs is promising in combating obesity and in generating revenue. Challenges towards compliance and implementation of the policies and programs exist. The relationship between SSB and obesity and T2DM is a complex problem which requires comprehensive solutions. Continued efforts in restricting SSBs in schools are needed. Intervention programs should be tailored to age, gender, language, and culture and involve participation from families and local communities. Taxation can reduce SSB consumption by direct economic incentive, earmarking revenues to support healthy foods, and sending negative message. However, a higher tax rate may be necessary to have a measurable effect on weight.

8,8,31327370,"Oral diseases are a major global public health problem affecting over 3·5 billion people. However, dentistry has so far been unable to tackle this problem. A fundamentally different approach is now needed. In this second of two papers in a Series on oral health, we present a critique of dentistry, highlighting its key limitations and the urgent need for system reform. In high-income countries, the current treatment-dominated, increasingly high-technology, interventionist, and specialised approach is not tackling the underlying causes of disease and is not addressing inequalities in oral health. In low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), the limitations of so-called westernised dentistry are at their most acute; dentistry is often unavailable, unaffordable, and inappropriate for the majority of these populations, but particularly the rural poor. Rather than being isolated and separated from the mainstream health-care system, dentistry needs to be more integrated, in particular with primary care services. The global drive for universal health coverage provides an ideal opportunity for this integration. Dental care systems should focus more on promoting and maintaining oral health and achieving greater oral health equity. Sugar, alcohol, and tobacco consumption, and their underlying social and commercial determinants, are common risk factors shared with a range of other non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Coherent and comprehensive regulation and legislation are needed to tackle these shared risk factors. In this Series paper, we focus on the need to reduce sugar consumption and describe how this can be achieved through the adoption of a range of upstream policies designed to combat the corporate strategies used by the global sugar industry to promote sugar consumption and profits. At present, the sugar industry is influencing dental research, oral health policy, and professional organisations through its well developed corporate strategies. The development of clearer and more transparent conflict of interest policies and procedures to limit and clarify the influence of the sugar industry on research, policy, and practice is needed. Combating the commercial determinants of oral diseases and other NCDs should be a major policy priority.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the evidence in children and adults.

Separate meta-analyses were conducted in children and adults and for cohorts and RCTs by using random- and fixed-effects models.

Sensitivity analyses of RCTs in children showed more pronounced benefits in preventing weight gain in SSB substitution trials (compared with school-based educational programs) and among overweight children (compared with normal-weight children).

11,11,26856717,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a liver manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Overconsumption of high-fat diet (HFD) and increased intake of sugar-sweetened beverages are major risk factors for development of NAFLD. Today the most commonly consumed sugar is high fructose corn syrup. Hepatic lipids may be derived from dietary intake, esterification of plasma free fatty acids (FFA) or hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL). A central abnormality in NAFLD is enhanced DNL. Hepatic DNL is increased in individuals with NAFLD, while the contribution of dietary fat and plasma FFA to hepatic lipids is not significantly altered. The importance of DNL in NAFLD is further established in mouse studies with knockout of genes involved in this process. Dietary fructose increases levels of enzymes involved in DNL even more strongly than HFD. Several properties of fructose metabolism make it particularly lipogenic. Fructose is absorbed via portal vein and delivered to the liver in much higher concentrations as compared to other tissues. Fructose increases protein levels of all DNL enzymes during its conversion into triglycerides. Additionally, fructose supports lipogenesis in the setting of insulin resistance as fructose does not require insulin for its metabolism, and it directly stimulates SREBP1c, a major transcriptional regulator of DNL. Fructose also leads to ATP depletion and suppression of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, resulting in increased production of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, fructose promotes ER stress and uric acid formation, additional insulin independent pathways leading to DNL. In summary, fructose metabolism supports DNL more strongly than HFD and hepatic DNL is a central abnormality in NAFLD. Disrupting fructose metabolism in the liver may provide a new therapeutic option for the treatment of NAFLD.

The aim of this study was to examine associations of pregnancy and offspring sugar consumption (sucrose, fructose) with child cognition. Additionally, associations of maternal and child consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), other beverages (diet soda, juice), and fruit with child cognition were examined. Among 1,234 mother-child pairs enrolled 1999-2002 in Project Viva, a pre-birth cohort, in 2017 diet was assessed during pregnancy and early childhood, and cognitive outcomes in early and mid-childhood (median ages 3.3 and 7.7 years). Analyses used linear regression models adjusted for maternal and child characteristics. Maternal sucrose consumption (mean 49.8 grams/day [SD=12.9]) was inversely associated with mid-childhood Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (KBIT-II) non-verbal scores (-1.5 points per 15 grams/day, 95% CI= -2.8, -0.2). Additionally, maternal SSB consumption was inversely associated with mid-childhood cognition, and diet soda was inversely associated with early and mid-childhood cognition scores. Early childhood consumption of SSBs was inversely associated with mid-childhood KBIT-II verbal scores (-2.4 points per serving/day, 95% CI= -4.3, -0.5) while fruit consumption was associated with higher cognitive scores in early and mid-childhood. Maternal and child fructose and juice consumption were not associated with cognition. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, the association between maternal diet soda consumption and mid-childhood KBIT-II verbal scores remained significant.

A single, outpatient, general pediatric practice. One hundred five children aged 2 to 18 years with upper respiratory tract infections, nocturnal symptoms, and illness duration of 7 days or less. A single dose of buckwheat honey, honey-flavored DM, or no treatment administered 30 minutes prior to bedtime. Cough frequency, cough severity, bothersome nature of cough, and child and parent sleep quality. Significant differences in symptom improvement were detected between treatment groups, with honey consistently scoring the best and no treatment scoring the worst. In paired comparisons, honey was significantly superior to no treatment for cough frequency and the combined score, but DM was not better than no treatment for any outcome. Comparison of honey with DM revealed no significant differences. In a comparison of honey, DM, and no treatment, parents rated honey most favorably for symptomatic relief of their child's nocturnal cough and sleep difficulty due to upper respiratory tract infection. Honey may be a preferable treatment for the cough and sleep difficulty associated with childhood upper respiratory tract infection. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00127686.

The use of reduced-sodium salt (a salt substitute) may achieve sodium reduction, but its effectiveness may be associated with the context of its use. To identify factors associated with the use of salt substitutes in rural populations in China within the Salt Substitute and Stroke Study, a large-scale cluster randomized trial. This sequential mixed-methods qualitative evaluation, conducted from July 2 to August 28, 2018, in rural communities across 3 provinces in China, included a quantitative survey, collection of 24-hour urine samples, and face-to-face interviews. A random subsample of trial participants, selected from the 3 provinces, completed the quantitative survey (n = 1170) and provided urine samples (n = 1025). Interview respondents were purposively selected from the intervention group based on their different ranges of urinary sodium excretion levels. Statistical analysis was performed from September 18, 2018, to February 22, 2019. The intervention group of the Salt Substitute and Stroke Study was provided with the free salt substitute while the control group continued to use regular salt. Knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding the use of the salt substitute were measured using quantitative surveys, and urinary sodium levels were measured using 24-hour urine samples. Contextual factors were explored through semistructured interviews and integrated findings from surveys and interviews. A total of 1170 individuals participated in the quantitative survey. Among the 1025 participants with successful urine samples, the mean (SD) age was 67.4 (7.5) years, and 502 (49.0%) were female. The estimated salt intake of participants who believed that high salt intake was good for health was higher; however, it was not significantly different (0.84 g/d [95% CI, -0.04 to 1.72 g/d]) from those who believed that high salt intake was bad for health. Thirty individuals participated in the qualitative interviews (18 women [60.0%]; mean [SD] age, 70.3 [6.0] years). Quantitative and qualitative data indicated high acceptability of and adherence to the salt substitute. Contextual factors negatively associated with the use of the salt substitute included a lack of knowledge about the benefits associated with salt reduction and consumption of high-sodium pickled foods. In addition, reduced antihypertensive medication was reported by a few participants using the salt substitute. This study suggests that lack of comprehensive understanding of sodium reduction and salt substitutes and habitual consumption of high-sodium foods (such as pickled foods) were the main barriers to the use of salt substitutes to reduce sodium intake.

Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNSs) offer a potential solution to reduce sugar intake, yet their metabolic safety remains debated. This study aimed to systematically assess the long-term metabolic effects of commonly used NNSs under both normal and obesogenic conditions. To ensure consistent sweetness level and controlling for the acceptable daily intake (ADI), eight weeks old C57BL/6 male mice were administered with acesulfame K (ace K, 535.25 mg/L), aspartame (411.75 mg/L), sucralose (179.5 mg/L), saccharin (80 mg/L), or steviol glycoside (Reb M, 536.25 mg/L) in the drinking water, on the background of either regular or high-fat diets (in high fat diet 60% of calories from fat). Water or fructose-sweetened water (82.3.gr/L), were used as controls. Anthropometric and metabolic parameters, as well as microbiome composition, were analyzed following 20-weeks of exposure. Under a regular chow diet, chronic NNS consumption did not significantly affect body weight, fat mass, or glucose metabolism as compared to water consumption, with aspartame demonstrating decreased glucose tolerance. In diet-induced obesity, NNS exposure did not increase body weight or alter food intake. Exposure to sucralose and Reb M led to improved insulin sensitivity and decreased weight gain. Reb M specifically was associated with increased prevalence of colonic Lachnospiracea bacteria. Long-term consumption of commonly used NNSs does not induce adverse metabolic effects, with Reb M demonstrating a mild improvement in metabolic abnormalities. These findings provide valuable insights into the metabolic impact of different NNSs, aiding in the development of strategies to combat obesity and related metabolic disorders.

They have thus been found useful in minimizing the dietary sugar content of diabetics and the dietary energy content of individuals attempting to lose or maintain body weight. Their usefulness in weight reduction has recently been questioned, however, based on the notion that they can actually increase hunger and food intake and thereby promote weight gain. The evidence offered in support of this idea comes principally from the fields of taste physiology, metabolic endocrinology, human behavior, and epidemiology. This review evaluates this evidence and does not find it compelling.

The purpose of this study is to compare three approaches to managing missing data, the pairwise (n = 1386 children), the partial or modified pairwise (n = 1019) and the listwise (n = 546), to characterize the trajectories of children's free sugars intake (FSI) across early childhood. By applying the Group-based Trajectory Model Technique to three waves of data collected from a prospective cohort study of South Australian children, this study examined the three approaches in managing missing data to validate and discuss children's FSI trajectories. Each approach identified three distinct trajectories of child's FSI from 1 to 5 years of age: (1) 'low and fast increasing', (2) 'moderate and increasing' and (3) 'high and increasing'. The trajectory memberships were consistent across the three approaches, and were for the pairwise scenario (1) 15.1%, (2) 68.3% and (3) 16.6%; the partial or modified pairwise (1) 15.9%, (2) 64.1% and (3) 20.0%; and the listwise (1) 14.9%, (2) 64.9% and (3) 20.2% of children. Given the comparability of the findings across the analytical approaches and the samples' characteristics between baseline and across different data collection waves, it is recommended that the pairwise approach be used in future analyses to optimize the sample size and statistical power when examining the relationship between FSI in the first years of life and health outcome such as dental caries.

The recommendations of the 4 working groups will form the basis for the development of a blueprint to guide future research efforts. The pediatric-specific problems identified include the heterogeneity of the population, the small size of the pediatric drug market, the limited number of new formulations for the large number of off-patent and unlabeled drugs, and the lack of universal agreement on how to define appropriate formulations for different ages and stages of development. There was consensus on the need to develop a universal technology platform for flexible pediatric dosage forms, transforming an empirical process into a science-based platform.

The Planetary Health Diet Index (PHDI) was adapted to better reflect children's and adolescents' nutritional requirements. The adapted index (PHDI-C) comprises 16 components with a maximum score of 150 points. PHDI-C was piloted among a sample of 958 Chilean children (3-6 years) using dietary data collected in 2016 through single 24-h recalls. A decision tree and food disaggregation methodology were developed to guide the calculation of scores. Scores obtained using the original and adapted versions of the index were compared. Linear regression models adjusted by child's gender and age were fitted to explore associations between total PHDI-C score, dietary recall characteristics and nutritional composition of children's diets. PHDI accounted for 75.7% of children's total caloric intake, whereas PHDI-C accounted for 99.6%. PHDI & PHCI-C scores were low among this sample of children; however, mean total score was lower when using PHDI compared to PHDI-C [40.7(12.1) vs 50.1(14.6)]. Children's scores were very low for nuts & peanuts, legumes, dark green vegetables, whole cereals, tubers & potatoes, and added sugars components across both indices, but were higher for dairy products and eggs & white meats components when using the PHDI-C due to adjustments made to ensure nutritional adequacy. Mean total PHDI-C score was significantly lower on weekends and special occasions, and significantly higher when children reported having a special diet (e.g., vegetarian). Total PHDI-C score was negatively associated with total sugars, saturated fats, trans fats, and animal-based protein intake, and positively associated with total protein, plant-based protein, total carbohydrates, and total fibre intake.

E-cigarette use frequency (number of puffs per day, collected from the device) and serum cotinine levels were obtained at each of three study visits over 3 weeks. The correlation of cotinine and e-cigarette use over the preceding week was calculated at each study visit. Correlation of nicotine intake, as measured by serum cotinine, and puff time, as measured by puffs count and duration from the e-cigarette device, as an indicator of study protocol compliance, substantially declined after the first week of the study and were no longer correlated in the remaining study weeks (R2 = 0.53 and p ≤ .01 in week 1, R2 < 0.5 and p > .05 for remaining weeks). There is an emerging need for controlled e-cigarette exposures studies, but low compliance in the use of assigned devices and e-liquids may be a limitation that needs to be mitigated in future studies. This study is the first to analyze compliance with instructions to use a standardized e-cigarette device with puff time and duration tracking (controlled e-cigarette) across all subjects and an assigned e-liquid flavor over a 3-week period. We find that protocol compliance, as measured by correlations between e-cigarette use measures and cotinine levels, was only achieved in the first week of the study and declined thereafter. These findings indicate that the assignment of a study device and instruction to only use the study device with assigned e-liquid flavor may not be sufficient to ensure participant compliance with the study protocol. We suggest that additional measures, including behavioral and biological markers, are needed to ensure sole use of the study e-cigarette and e-liquid and to be able to interpret results from controlled e-cigarette studies.

34,34,19108800,"Active pharmaceutical ingredients that taste bitter and/or irritate the mouth and throat are aversive to children as well as many adults. Effective methods of avoiding unpleasant tastes for adults (eg, encapsulating the medicine in pill, capsule, or tablet form) are problematic because many children cannot or will not swallow these. The unpalatable flavor of the medicine can thwart the benefits of even the most powerful of drugs. Failure to consume medication may do the child harm and can even be life-threatening. This article provides an overview of the current knowledge of the sensory capabilities and preferences of children as it relates to flavor, defined here as the combined input of taste, smell, and chemical irritation. The methods used to evaluate flavor perception in children are reviewed. Recent scientific advances are summarized that shed light on why the bitter taste of oral pharmaceuticals is an ongoing formulation problem and how discoveries of novel flavor molecules and modulators of bitter tastes hold considerable promise for the future. Alternative methods for evaluation of the palatability of medicines are described. The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development sponsored a Pediatric Formulation Initiative workshop on December 6 and 7, 2005, in Bethesda, Maryland. Information for this article was gathered from literature reviews that were then discussed during this workshop as well as during several conference calls with the Taste and Flavor Working Group members. Terms for the MEDLINE search (1970-2007) included infant, children, taste, olfaction/smell, flavor, chemical senses, palatability, sensory testing, pharmaceutical, and medicines. Children have well-developed sensory systems for detecting tastes, smells, and chemical irritants, and their rejection of unpalatable medications is a reflection of their basic biology. Sugars, salt, and other substances reportedly reduce the bitterness of several pharmaceuticals. Adding pleasant flavor volatiles such as bubble gum may help induce children to consume a medicine, but such volatile compounds are not effective in suppressing the strong bitter tastes associated with some medications. Also, because individual experiences and culture mainly determine which odors are attractive, a universally appealing volatile flavoring agent may be difficult to identify. Sensory panelists who are sensitive to the pediatric palate, which is different from adults, and new techniques involving animal models, isolated parts of the receptor cells, and even electronic devices that detect taste and flavor are among the tools that may be used to evaluate the palatability of medications and predict compliance among pediatric populations. Although there are no easy solutions to this dilemma, children's acceptance of many medicines can be improved by applying the knowledge gleaned from basic research in the chemical senses. Further development and validation of sensory methods will provide a better understanding of the sensory world of the child. This understanding, combined with new technologies and results of animal model studies, will enhance drug acceptance and compliance in pediatric populations. A better understanding of the scientific basis for distaste and how to ameliorate it is a public health priority.

35,35,38324166,"In recent years, the continuous development of innovative nanopharmaceuticals is expanding their biomedical and clinical applications. Nanomedicines are being revolutionized to circumvent the limitations of unbound therapeutic agents as well as overcome barriers posed by biological interfaces at the cellular, organ, system, and microenvironment levels. In many ways, the use of nanoconfigured delivery systems has eased challenges associated with patient differences, and in our opinion, this forms the foundation for their potential usefulness in developing innovative medicines and diagnostics for special patient populations. Here, we present a comprehensive review of nanomedicines specifically designed and evaluated for disease management in the pediatric population. Typically, the pediatric population has distinguishing needs relative to those of adults majorly because of their constantly growing bodies and age-related physiological changes, which often need specialized drug formulation interventions to provide desirable therapeutic effects and outcomes. Besides, child-centric drug carriers have unique delivery routes, dosing flexibility, organoleptic properties (e.g., taste, flavor), and caregiver requirements that are often not met by traditional formulations and can impact adherence to therapy. Engineering pediatric medicines as nanoconfigured structures can potentially resolve these limitations stemming from traditional drug carriers because of their unique capabilities. Consequently, researchers from different specialties relentlessly and creatively investigate the usefulness of nanomedicines for pediatric disease management as extensively captured in this compilation. Some examples of nanomedicines covered include nanoparticles, liposomes, and nanomicelles for cancer; solid lipid and lipid-based nanostructured carriers for hypertension; self-nanoemulsifying lipid-based systems and niosomes for infections; and nanocapsules for asthma pharmacotherapy.

36,36,28903112,"During the first years of life, the sweetness of sugars has a capacity to hinder or to help in laying a strong nutritional foundation for food preferences that often extend over a lifetime. Aside from supplying 4 g/kcal of energy, sugars are non-nutritive. However, sugars have a powerful attribute, sweetness, which strongly influences human food preference. A child's first relationship with sweet taste begins even before birth and continues to evolve throughout complementary feeding. The sweetness of breastmilk encourages consumption and soothes the neonate. Conversely, inappropriate introduction of non-milk solids and beverages that are sweet at 0-4 months of age raises the newborn's risk for later obesity and may discourage the acceptance of other bitter or sour foods. Although cereals, fruits, 100% fruit juices, and some grains have naturally occurring sugars that impart sweet flavor notes, there is no clear role for added sugars between 6 and 12 months of age. Yet, 60% of infants are introduced to foods and beverages containing added sugars, threatening diet quality. Pairing foods with naturally occurring sugars, such as fruits, with foods that tend to be resisted initially, such as vegetables, can mask bitterness and promote acceptance. Utilizing the infants' extraordinary capacity for sensory-motor exploration is another strategy to expose them repeatedly to challenging tastes and flavors. The transitional year, as breast milk and infant formula are withdrawn, is a time when nutritional needs are high and diet quality often precarious. Rapid growth, along with brain and cognitive development, demand high-quality nutrition. Snacks are necessary both for energy and valuable nutrients. However, the selection of snack foods often exposes toddlers to items that offer concentrated energy with low nutrient value. Recent trends suggest a rapid fall in added sugars among infants and toddlers. Parenting practices that use small amounts of sugars to promote nutrient-rich foods from all 5 food groups can enhance rather than hinder their child's emerging dietary pattern.

37,37,36294032,"Additives are defined as substances added to food with the aim of preserving and improving safety, freshness, taste, texture, or appearance. While indirect additives can be found in traces in food and come from materials used for packaging, storage, and technological processing of food, direct additives are added to food with a special purpose (canning). The use of additives is justified if it is in accordance with legal regulations and does not pose a health or danger to consumers in the prescribed concentration. However, due to the specificity of the child's metabolic system, there is a greater risk that the negative effects of the additive will manifest. Considering the importance of the potential negative impact of additives on children's health and the increased interest in the control and monitoring of additives in food for children, we have reviewed the latest available literature available through PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Expert data were taken from publicly available documents published from January 2010 to April 2022 by internationally recognized professional organizations. It was found that the most frequently present additives in the food consumed by children are bisphenols, phthalates, perfluoroalkyl chemicals, perchlorates, pesticides, nitrates and nitrites, artificial food colors, monosodium glutamate, and aspartame. Increasing literacy about the presence and potential risk through continuous education of parents and young people as well as active monitoring of newly registered additives and harmonization of existing legal regulations by competent authorities can significantly prevent the unwanted effects of additives on children's health.

39,39,37432196,"The prevalence of obesity is increasing, and the origins of obesity and metabolic dysfunction may be traced back to fetal life. Currently, overweight pregnant women are advised to substitute sugar-sweetened beverages with diet drinks containing artificial sweeteners. Recent evidence suggests that the consumption of artificial sweeteners during pregnancy increases the risk of obesity in the child, but the mechanism is unknown. We hypothesized the transportation of artificial sweeteners across the placenta into the fetal circulation and the amniotic fluid. We included 19 pregnant women who were given an oral dose of acesulfame, cyclamate, saccharin, and sucralose immediately before a planned caesarean section. Nine women were included as controls, and they refrained from an intake of artificial sweeteners. The maternal and fetal blood and amniotic fluid were collected during the caesarean section, and concentrations of artificial sweeteners were measured using mass spectrometry. We found a linear relationship between the fetal plasma concentrations of artificial sweeteners and the maternal plasma concentrations, with adjusted coefficients of 0.49 (95% CI: 0.28-0.70) for acesulfame, 0.72 (95% CI: 0.48-0.95) for cyclamate, 0.51 (95% CI: 0.38-0.67) for saccharin, and 0.44 (95% CI: 0.33-0.55) for sucralose. We found no linear relationship between amniotic fluid and fetal plasma concentrations, but there were positive ratios for all four sweeteners.

The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between foods with on-pack M2K and excessive free sugars contents (≥ 10% calories from free sugars) and the potential for a 5% total sugars DV threshold to restrict M2K on these products. Cross-sectional analysis of the University of Toronto's Food Label Information Program (FLIP) 2013 database (n = 15,259, after exclusions). Odds ratios were used to determine the association between excess free sugars contents and presence of M2K, stratified by major food category. The proportion of products with excessive free sugars levels, or with M2K, that would be restricted from M2K if a 5% DV threshold for total sugars was implemented was also determined. 77.8% of foods with M2K had excess free sugars levels compared with 38.4% without M2K. M2K was more likely to be present on foods with excess free sugars levels in 8 of 14 food categories that contained products with M2K. A 5% DV threshold for total sugars would restrict M2K on 83% of foods with excess free sugars levels and on 75% of current foods that had M2K. Findings demonstrate that foods with M2K are less healthy, particularly in regard to free sugars levels. This highlights the importance of ensuring policies aimed at supporting healthy dietary habits among children carefully consider free sugars levels. En 2016, des mesures législatives ont été proposées au Canada pour limiter le marketing destiné aux enfants (MDE) d’aliments et de boissons (« aliments ») jugés « malsains » (c.-à-d. les aliments qui dépassent de 5 à 10 % la valeur quotidienne (VQ) totale pour les sucres, le sodium ou les graisses saturées). L’objectif de la présente étude était d’examiner la relation entre les aliments comportant de la publicité destinée aux enfants sur l’emballage et les aliments ayant une teneur excessive en sucres libres (≥ 10 % des calories provenant de sucres libres) et d’envisager l’imposition d’un seuil de 5 % de la VQ totale pour les sucres afin de limiter le MDE de tels produits. Analyse transversale des données de 2013 de la base de données du programme FLIP (Food Label Information Program) de l’Université de Toronto ( 77,8 % des aliments comportant du MDE avaient des niveaux de sucres libres excessifs, contre 38,4 % des aliments sans MDE. Le MDE était plus susceptible d’être présent pour les aliments ayant des niveaux de sucres libres excessifs dans 8 des 14 catégories alimentaires contenant des produits commercialisés auprès des enfants. Un seuil de 5 % de la VQ totale pour les sucres limiterait le MDE pour 83 % des aliments ayant des niveaux de sucres libres excessifs et pour 75 % des aliments actuellement commercialisés auprès des enfants. Nos résultats montrent que les aliments commercialisés auprès des enfants sont moins sains, surtout en ce qui a trait à leurs niveaux de sucres libres.

46,46,24452237,"Health initiatives address childhood obesity in part by encouraging good nutrition early in life. This review highlights the science that shows that children naturally prefer higher levels of sweet and salty tastes and reject lower levels of bitter tastes than do adults. Thus, their basic biology does not predispose them to favor the recommended low-sugar, low-sodium, vegetable-rich diets and makes them especially vulnerable to our current food environment of foods high in salt and refined sugars. The good news is that sensory experiences, beginning early in life, can shape preferences. Mothers who consume diets rich in healthy foods can get children off to a good start because flavors are transmitted from the maternal diet to amniotic fluid and mother's milk, and breastfed infants are more accepting of these flavors. In contrast, infants fed formula learn to prefer its unique flavor profile and may have more difficulty initially accepting flavors not found in formula, such as those of fruit and vegetables. Regardless of early feeding mode, infants can learn through repeated exposure and dietary variety if caregivers focus on the child's willingness to consume a food and not just the facial expressions made during feeding. In addition, providing complementary foods low in salt and sugars may help protect the developing child from excess intake later in life. Early-life experiences with healthy tastes and flavors may go a long way toward promoting healthy eating, which could have a significant impact in addressing the many chronic illnesses associated with poor food choice.

Sucrose is the primary form of sugar, and is strongly correlated with dental caries. Artificial sweeteners are chemically synthesized sugar substitutes that are generally regarded as being low-calorie. This review examines the current evidence in the literature for the need for artificial sweeteners and outlines its implications for the health of children. We briefly outline its adverse effects, and concerns regarding their safety. Artificial sweeteners are a widely used food additive. Six main artificial sweeteners are approved by the food and drug administration (FDA). The conflicting results and divergent regulatory norms of each sweetener are a constant cause of concern and debate. However, most studies have spotlighted the beneficial effects of artificial sweeteners. Dental caries diminish with the increase in sweetener intake. An increase in appetite and eventually weight gain is observed in individuals consuming artificial sweeteners. Artificial sweeteners are indeed a bane according to present studies, although more research on recently discovered non-nutritive artificial sweeteners is required. It also has a positive effect on overall health disorders. If one curbs the onset of dental caries, then the eventual rise is highly unlikely. Artificial sweeteners' effect on lowering dental caries will help to reduce the caries index in general. Oral hygiene is maintained, and the growth of oral bacterium is depressed. Research on novel sweeteners will help to compare their efficacy in caries prevention compared to existing ones.

49,49,36041179,"A strong body of evidence links young children's intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) with myriad negative outcomes. Our research provides insight into whether and to what extent potential intervention strategies can reduce young children's consumption of SSBs. We built an agent-based model (ABM) of SSB consumption representing participants in the Project Viva longitudinal study between ages 2 and 7 y. In addition to extensive data from Project Viva, our model used nationally representative data as well as recent, high-quality literature. We tested the explanatory power of the model through comparison to consumption patterns observed in the Project Viva cohort. Then, we applied the model to simulate the potential impact of interventions that would reduce SSB availability in 1 or more settings or affect how families receive and respond to pediatrician advice. Our model produced age-stratified trends in beverage consumption that closely match those observed in Project Viva cohort data. Among the potential interventions we simulated, reducing availability in the home-where young children spend the greatest amount of time-resulted in the largest consumption decrease. Removing access to all SSBs in the home resulted in them consuming 1.23 (95% CI: 1.21, 1.24) fewer servings of SSBs per week on average between the ages of 2 and 7 y, a reduction of ∼60%. By comparison, removing all SSB availability outside of the home (i.e., in schools and childcare) had a smaller impact (0.77; CI: 0.75, 0.78), a reduction of ∼40%. These results suggest that interventions reducing SSB availability in the home would have the strongest effects on SSB consumption.

51,51,25022739,"Children differ from adults in many aspects of pharmacotherapy, including capabilities for drug administration, medicine-related toxicity, and taste preferences. It is essential that pediatric medicines are formulated to best suit a child's age, size, physiologic condition, and treatment requirements. To ensure adequate treatment of all children, different routes of administration, dosage forms, and strengths may be required. Many existing formulations are not suitable for children, which often leads to off-label and unlicensed use of adult medicines. New regulations, additional funding opportunities, and innovative collaborative research initiatives have resulted in some recent progress in the development of pediatric formulations. These advances include a paradigm shift toward oral solid formulations and a focus on novel preparations, including flexible, dispersible, and multiparticulate oral solid dosage forms. Such developments have enabled greater dose flexibility, easier administration, and better acceptance of drug formulations in children. However, new pediatric formulations address only a small part of all therapeutic needs in children; moreover, they are not always available. Five key issues need to be addressed to stimulate the further development of better medicines for children: (1) the continued prioritization of unmet formulation needs, particularly drug delivery in neonates and treatment gaps in pediatric cancers and childhood diseases in developing countries; (2) a better use of existing data to facilitate pediatric formulation development; (3) innovative technologies in adults that can be used to develop new pediatric formulations; (4) clinical feedback and practice-based evidence on the impact of novel formulations; and (5) improved access to new pediatric formulations.

52,52,25713277,"Concern over childhood obesity has generated a decade-long reformation of school nutrition policies. Food is available in school in 3 venues: federally sponsored school meal programs; items sold in competition to school meals, such as a la carte, vending machines, and school stores; and foods available in myriad informal settings, including packed meals and snacks, bake sales, fundraisers, sports booster sales, in-class parties, or other school celebrations. High-energy, low-nutrient beverages, in particular, contribute substantial calories, but little nutrient content, to a student's diet. In 2004, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that sweetened drinks be replaced in school by water, white and flavored milks, or 100% fruit and vegetable beverages. Since then, school nutrition has undergone a significant transformation. Federal, state, and local regulations and policies, along with alternative products developed by industry, have helped decrease the availability of nutrient-poor foods and beverages in school. However, regular access to foods of high energy and low quality remains a school issue, much of it attributable to students, parents, and staff. Pediatricians, aligning with experts on child nutrition, are in a position to offer a perspective promoting nutrient-rich foods within calorie guidelines to improve those foods brought into or sold in schools. A positive emphasis on nutritional value, variety, appropriate portion, and encouragement for a steady improvement in quality will be a more effective approach for improving nutrition and health than simply advocating for the elimination of added sugars.

54,54,15948931,"The development of age-adapted dosage forms and taste-masking of bitter-tasting drugs administered orally for children, are formidable challenges for formulation scientists. Childhood is a period of maturation requiring knowledge of developmental pharmacology to establish dose but the ability of the child to manage different dosage forms and devices also changes. Paediatric formulations must allow accurate administration of the dose to children of widely varying age and weight. Whilst the oral route will be preferred for long term use and the intravenous route for the acutely ill, many of the dosage forms designed for adults, such as oro-dispersible tablets, buccal gels and transdermal patches, would also benefit children if they contained an appropriate paediatric dose. The age at which children can swallow conventional tablets is of great importance for their safety. Liquid medicines are usually recommended for infants and younger children so the ability to mask unpleasant taste with sweeteners and flavours is crucial. More sophisticated formulations such as granules and oro-dispersible tablets may be required but there will be limitations on choice and concentration of excipients. There are many gaps in our knowledge about paediatric formulations and many challenges for the industry if suitable preparations are to be available for all ranges.

55,55,18257948,"The present paper is a review of available data on effects of parental feeding attitudes and styles on child nutritional behaviour. Food preferences develop from genetically determined predispositions to like sweet and salty flavours and to dislike bitter and sour tastes. There is evidence for existence of some innate, automatic mechanism that regulate appetite. However, from birth genetic predispositions are modified by experience. There are mechanisms of taste development: mere exposure, medicine effect, flavour learning, flavour nutrient learning. Parents play a pivotal role in the development of their child's food preferences and energy intake, with research indicating that certain child feeding practices, such as exerting excessive control over what and how much children eat, may contribute to childhood overweight. Mothers are of particular interest on children's eating behaviour, as they have been shown to spend significantly more time than fathers in direct interactions with their children across several familial situations.A recent paper describes two primary aspects of control: restriction, which involves restricting children's access to junk foods and restricting the total amount of food, and pressure, which involves pressuring children to eat healthy foods (usually fruits and vegetables) and pressuring to eat more in general. The results showed significant correlations between parent and child for reported nutritional behaviour like food intake, eating motivations, and body dis- and satisfaction. Parents create environments for children that may foster the development of healthy eating behaviours and weight, or that may promote overweight and aspects of disordered eating. In conclusion positive parental role model may be a better method for improving a child's diet than attempts at dietary control.

The purpose of this study was to investigate changes and tracking of intakes of fruit, vegetables and SSB, and association between maternal education and dietary tracking, from 18 months to 7 years of age. Longitudinal data from the nation-wide Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health were used, including 9025 children participating at three time points (18 months, 36 months and 7 years). Frequencies of fruit, vegetables and SSB were assessed by questionnaire. Slightly different questions were used at each time point to collect information about intake. Maternal education was categorized into ≤ 12 years, 13-16 years, ≥ 17 years. Cross-tabulation, Spearman's rho and multinomial logistic regression were used for assessing change, tracking and differences by maternal education. Analyses by gender indicated largest changes for intake of fruit and SSB from age 18 months to 7 years. Fair to moderate tracking coefficients (Spearman's rho = 0.23-0.46) for intake of fruit, vegetables and SSB were found and children assigned to low, medium and high frequency of consumption at 18 months continued to be in the same group at age 36 months and 7 years. Children of mothers with low education consumed fruit and vegetables less often and SSB more often compared to children of mothers with high education at 18 months of age. Children with higher educated mothers had lower odds for increasing fruit intake or decreasing SSB intake, compared to children with lower educated mothers showing a stable intake. The tracking coefficients for intakes were fair to moderate and differences in intakes according to maternal education were found already at age 18 months. This suggests that promotion of healthy dietary behaviours at an early age is important to prevent unfavourable dietary behaviours later in childhood. Moreover, it seems important to target mothers in nutrition interventions for improving dietary habits among children.

61,61,36321429,"The objective of this paper is to review the global effort to eliminate iodine deficiency and its impact on public health. Iodine is an essential component of hormones produced by the thyroid gland. Iodine deficiency has multiple adverse effects in humans due to inadequate thyroid hormone production that are termed the iodine deficiency disorders. The major adverse effect is impaired cognition in children. The WHO's first estimate of the global prevalence of goitre in 1960 suggested that 20-60 % of the world's population was affected, with most of the burden in low- and middle-income countries. Iodine deficiency was identified as a key global risk factor for impaired child development where the need for intervention was urgent. This spurred a worldwide effort to eliminate iodine deficiency led by a coalition of international organisations working closely with national governments and the salt industry. In most countries, the best strategy to control iodine deficiency is carefully monitored iodisation of salt. The reach of current iodised salt programmes is remarkable: in 2018, 88 % of the global population used iodised salt. The number of countries with adequate iodine intake has nearly doubled over the past 20 years from 67 in 2003 to 118 in 2020. The resulting improvement in cognitive development and future earnings suggests a potential global economic benefit of nearly $33 billion. Iodine programmes are appealing for national governments because the health and economic consequences are high and can be easily averted by salt iodisation, a low-cost and sustainable intervention.

Among the earliest English 18th century records, that contain the patient's age, are those found at the Northampton General Hospital within an archive dating from its foundation as the Northampton Infirmary in 1744. They afford a fascinating glimpse into both inpatient and outpatient child health. Although there are no medical notes as such, the hospital archive has recently rediscovered 1743 statutes, contemporary patient literature entitled Some Friendly Advice to a Patient (written by the Northampton Infirmary's founding physician Dr (later Sir) James Stonhouse), minute books, contemporary engravings of the outside and inside of the hospital and inpatient menus. Thus we can speculate with a high degree of certainty as to what would be the then current infirmary environment and treatments for illustrative examples of the children seen in the period 1744-45 (two inpatients and two outpatients). Interestingly one of the inpatient cases, Elizabeth Ager, a child with fever, was admitted against the infirmary regulations, suggesting already a stretching of boundaries in favour of paediatric admissions.

63,63,23886820,"Many active pharmaceutical ingredients taste bitter and thus are aversive to children as well as many adults. Encapsulation of the medicine in pill or tablet form, an effective method for adults to avoid the unpleasant taste, is problematic for children. Many children cannot or will not swallow solid dose forms. This review highlights basic principles of gustatory function, with a special focus on the science of bitter taste, derived from studies of animal models and human psychophysics. We focus on the set of genes that encode the proteins that function as bitter receptors as well as the cascade of events that leads to multidimensional aspects of taste function, highlighting the role that animal models played in these discoveries. We also summarize psychophysical approaches to studying bitter taste in adult and pediatric populations, highlighting evidence of the similarities and differences in bitter taste perception and acceptance between adults and children and drawing on useful strategies from animal models. Medicine often tastes bitter, and because children are more bitter-sensitive than are adults, this creates problems with compliance. Bitter arises from stimulating receptors in taste receptor cells, with signals processed in the taste bud and relayed to the brain. However, there are many gaps in our understanding of how best to measure bitterness and how to ameliorate it, including whether it is more efficiently addressed at the level of receptor and sensory signaling, at the level of central processing, or by masking techniques. All methods of measuring responsiveness to bitter ligands-in animal models through human psychophysics or with ""electronic tongues""-have limitations. Better-tasting medications may enhance pediatric adherence to drug therapy. Sugars, acids, salt, and other substances reduce perceived bitterness of several pharmaceuticals, and although pleasant flavorings may help children consume some medicines, they often are not effective in suppressing bitter tastes. Further development of psychophysical tools for children will help us better understand their sensory worlds. Multiple testing strategies will help us refine methods to assess acceptance and compliance by various pediatric populations. Research involving animal models, in which the gustatory system can be more invasively manipulated, can elucidate mechanisms, ultimately providing potential targets. These approaches, combined with new technologies and guided by findings from clinical studies, will potentially lead to effective ways to enhance drug acceptance and compliance in pediatric populations.

We conducted a systematic review of comparative studies on taste additives used to improve activated charcoal's palatability. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, and CINAHL. We included controlled trials and observational studies that evaluate the effect of at least one taste additive, compared with activated charcoal alone. Our primary outcome was palatability. Our secondary outcomes included treatment adherence, adsorption efficacy, and adverse events. The risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. Among 38 eligible articles, seven observational studies and three crossover clinical trials met our inclusion criteria. The risk of bias was found to be high for seven studies and intermediate for three others. The preferred flavoring agents were cola and chocolate milk for children, and sweetening agents for adults. All taste additives studied seemed to improve activated charcoal's palatability, except for yogurt (n = 1). The addition of bentonite, sorbitol, carboxymethylcellulose, or yogurt showed no impact on the in-vivo adsorption capacity of activated charcoal, whereas the results were inconclusive for chocolate. No meta-analysis was performed due to insufficient data. Strategies to improve activated charcoal's palatability seem to enhance the taste. Descriptive data are in favor of a limited impact on activated charcoal's adsorption capacity when adding binding agents or sweeteners. This review is registered as PROSPERO CRD42019135092.

Dietary sugar has particular effects on those whose capacity to metabolize fructose is limited. If intolerance to carbohydrates is a frequent finding in children, inborn errors of carbohydrate metabolism are rare conditions. Three inborn errors are known in the pathway of fructose metabolism; (1) essential or benign fructosuria due to fructokinase deficiency; (2) hereditary fructose intolerance; and (3) fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase deficiency. In this review the focus is set on the description of the clinical symptoms and biochemical anomalies in the three inborn errors of metabolism. The potential toxic effects of fructose in healthy humans also are discussed. Studies conducted in patients with inborn errors of fructose metabolism helped to understand fructose metabolism and its potential toxicity in healthy human. Influence of fructose on the glycolytic pathway and on purine catabolism is the cause of hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis and hyperuricemia. The discovery that fructose-mediated generation of uric acid may have a causal role in diabetes and obesity provided new understandings into pathogenesis for these frequent diseases.

70,70,38848942,"Precocious puberty (PP) may lead to many adverse outcomes. Recent evidence suggests that PP is a gut-brain disease. On the other hand, the use of glycyrrhizin, a natural sweetener, has become popular in the past decade. Glycyrrhizin possesses various health benefits, but its impact on PP has yet to be investigated. We aimed to explore the protective effects of glycyrrhizin against PP in both humans (observational) and animals (interventional). In the human cohort, we investigated the association between glycyrrhizin consumption and risk of PP. In the animal experiment, we observed puberty onset after feeding danazol-induced PP rats with glycyrrizin. Blood, fecal, and hypothalamic samples were harvested to evaluate potential mechanistic pathways. We also performed a fecal microbiota transplantation to confirm to causal relationship between glycyrrhizin and PP risk. Glycyrrhizin exhibited a protective effect against PP in children (OR 0.60, 95%CI: 0.39-0.89, p = 0.013), primarily driven by its significance in girls, while no significant effect was observed in boys. This effect was consistent with findings in rodents. These benefits were achieved through the modulation of the gut microbiome, which functionally suppressed the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and prevented PP progression. A fecal microbiota transplantation indicated that the causal correlation between glycyrrhizin intake and PP is mediated by the gut microbiome alterations. Our findings suggest that glycyrrhizin can protect against PP by altering the gut microbiome. Long term use of glycyrrhizin is safe and tolerable. Therefore, glycyrrhizin can serve as a safe and affordable complementary therapy for PP.

74,74,31023397,"The term 'sweeteners' encompasses both nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners, which when added to food/beverages, can enhance the flavour and other functional properties of food/beverage products. This review considers how dietary biomarker approaches may enhance current understanding of nutritive sweetener (namely free sugars) and non-nutritive or low-energy sweetener (LES) intakes and how these may impact health. Recent public health strategies to reduce free sugar consumption will help contribute to challenging sugar intake targets. Robust evaluation is needed to determine the effectiveness of these approaches to reducing free sugar consumption. LES provides a sweet taste without the addition of appreciable energy and can help maintain the palatability of reformulated products. All LES undergo rigorous safety evaluations prior to approval for use. Whilst intervention data suggest LES can be beneficial for health (relating to weight status and glycaemic control), debate persists on their use and findings from population-based research are mixed, in part because of potential contributing factors such as reverse causality. Additionally, assessments often consider only certain sources of LES (e.g. LES-beverages) and/or LES as a homogeneous group despite differing biological fates, thus not adequately capturing intakes of individual LES or allowing for reliable estimation of overall intakes. Urinary biomarker approaches developed/investigated for sweetener consumption have the potential to overcome existing limitations of dietary data by providing more objective intake data, thereby enhancing population-based research. In conclusion, such biomarker approaches to the concomitant study of free sugars and LES intakes are timely and represent interesting developments in an area of significant public health interest.

We hypothesized that SSB consumption in infancy would be associated with poor quality of later food and nutrient intake patterns among Japanese young children. The study subjects were 493 Japanese mother-child pairs from a prospective birth cohort study. Dietary data on children were collected from the mothers using self-administered questionnaires when the children were aged 16-24 months and 41-49 months. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to examine the relationships between SSB consumption frequency in infancy and later intake of foods and nutrients. At 16-24 months of age, more than half of the children (56.4%) consumed SSBs less than once a week, whereas 11.6% consumed SSBs at least once daily. More frequent consumption of SSBs in infancy was associated with higher intake of confectionaries and SSBs and lower intake of fruits and vegetables at 41-49 months of age. These associations were still evident after adjustment for maternal SSB consumption and socioeconomic status. At the nutrient level, SSB consumption frequency was positively associated with energy intake and inversely associated with intake of many nutrients, such as protein, dietary fiber, and most of the micronutrients examined.

This trend carries serious risk of children developing obesity-related diseases including Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) are used as substitution for table sugar as a way to prevent weight gain. Their consumption is ubiquitous in adults and children; however the long-term health outcomes of chronic NNS consumption in children are unclear. Conflicting observational studies suggest that children consuming NNS are at risk of obesity and development of type 2 diabetes, while others concluded some benefits in weight reduction. Here, we review the physiological mechanisms that can contribute to the negative metabolic effects of NNS. We will focus on how NNS alters the sweet perception leading to increase caloric consumption, how NNs alters the gut microbiota, and how NNS may disrupt glucose homeostasis and initiate a vicious cycle of pancreatic endocrine dysfunction. Studies focused on the pediatric population are limited but necessary to determine whether the potential weight loss benefits outweigh the potential negative metabolic outcomes during this critical development period.

90,90,33773688,"The rapid increase in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) has been related to the rise in sugar-added foods and sweetened beverages consumption. An interesting approach has been to replace sugar with alternative sweeteners (AS), due to their impact on public health. Preclinical and clinical studies, which analyze the safety of AS intake, are still limited. Major pathogenic mechanisms of these substances include ROS and AGEs formation. Indeed, endothelial dysfunction involving in the pathogenesis of micro- and macro-vascular diseases is mitochondrial dysfunction dependent. Hyperglycemia and endoplasmic reticulum stress together produce ROS, contributing to the development and progression of cardiovascular complications during type 2 diabetes (T2D), thus causing oxidative changes and direct damage of lipids, proteins, and DNA. Epidemiological studies in healthy subjects have suggested that the consumption of artificial AS can promote CV complications, such as glucose intolerance and predisposition to the onset of T2D, whereas natural AS could reduce hyperglycemia, improve lipid metabolism and have antioxidant effects.

91,91,31317242,"In paediatric nuclear medicine, the majority of the scans require intravenous (IV) access to deliver the radiotracers. Children and parents often cite procedural pain as the most distressing part of their child's hospitalization. In our department, various pain management strategies including physical and psychological distraction methods and pharmacological intervention have been implemented to reduce procedural pain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare different pain reduction strategies used in our paediatric nuclear medicine department. The charts of 196 children (114 female) were reviewed retrospectively (median age: 8 months; interquartile range [IQR]: 33.1). Children were categorized into five groups: (1) Maxilene (topical liposomal lidocaine; n=50), (2) Pain Ease (vapocoolant; n=69), (3) oral sucrose (n=48), (4) Maxilene and Pain Ease combined (n=10), and (5) no pharmacological/adjuvant intervention (n=19). Physical and psychological distraction were used in all patients. Therefore, Group 5 only received physical and psychological strategies. Physical methods included supportive positioning, deep breathing, temperature considerations, massage pressure or vibration and neonatal development strategies (e.g., non-nutritive sucking, facilitated tucking, swaddling, rocking). Psychological strategies included education, distraction with movies, books or storytelling, and relaxation techniques. The pain perceived by the children after the IV access was compared in these five groups. Two types of pain assessment were used in this study: self-reporting pain scale and behavioural observational pain rating scale. Pain was reported on a scale of 1 to 10. The average pain score was also compared between patients who had one or two attempts for IV access and those who had more than two attempts. The average pain score was 2.8 (mean±standard error [SE]=0.4) in Maxilene, 2.1 (SE=0.3) in Pain Ease, 2.7 (SE=0.3) in sucrose, 1.6 (SE=0.5) in combined Maxilene and Pain Ease and 3.4 (SE=0.6) in ""no pharmacology/adjuvant"" groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the four pharmacology groups of Maxilene, Pain Ease, sucrose and no pharmacology/adjuvant intervention group. However, the pain score was significantly reduced in patients who received both Maxilene and Pain Ease combined compared with the patients who didn't have any pharmacological/adjuvant intervention (P=0.041). The average pain was 2.2 (SE=0.1) with one attempt at IV access, 3.0 (SE=0.5) with two attempts and 5.1 (SE=0.9) with three attempts. A combination of two pharmacological/adjuvant interventions may be more effective in reducing procedural pain compared with a single intervention. A comprehensive pain management program should consider all available interventions - pharmacological, adjuvant, physical and psychological. Further randomized clinical trials are needed to evaluate if a combination of two or more methods of pharmacological and adjuvant interventions are more effective to reduce procedural pain compared with only one method.

94,94,33824185,"Children have difficulty swallowing capsules. Yet, when presented with liquid formulations, children often reject oral medications due to their intense bitterness. Presently, effective strategies to identify methods, reagents, and tools to block bitterness remain elusive. For a specific bitter-tasting drug, identification of the responsible bitter receptors and discovery of antagonists for those receptors can provide a method to block perceived bitterness. We have identified a compound (6-methylflavone) that can block responses to an intensely bitter-tasting anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug, tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), using a primary human taste bud epithelial cell culture as a screening platform. Specifically, TAS2R39 and TAS2R1 are the main type 2 taste receptors responding to TAF observed via heterologously expressing specific TAS2R receptors into HEK293 cells. In this assay, 6-methylflavone blocked the responses of TAS2R39 to TAF. In human sensory testing, 8 of 16 subjects showed reduction in perceived bitterness of TAF after pretreating (or ""prerinsing"") with 6-methylflavone and mixing 6-methylflavone with TAF. Bitterness was completely and reliably blocked in two of these subjects. These data demonstrate that a combined approach of human taste cell culture-based screening, receptor-specific assays, and human psychophysical testing can successfully discover molecules for blocking perceived bitterness of pharmaceuticals, such as the HIV therapeutic TAF. Our hope is to use bitter taste blockers to increase medical compliance with these vital medicines.

Summary statistics were created for sugar and sodium; the products' per-serving sodium levels were assessed in light of the US Institute of Medicine's dietary reference intakes while the products' sugar levels were evaluated in light of American Heart Association recommendations. Fifty-eight percent of the products assessed either have a high level of sodium or >20% of calories from sugar. Sodium levels in toddler foods were of concern in certain product categories (i.e., toddler entrées) and 15% of toddler foods exceeded the 'moderate level' recommended for sodium. Sugar levels were high in 45% of the products coded, and over half of those products - 56% - were designed for babies. More than one in six products had sugar as the first or second ingredient. Baby and toddler foods are not, by definition, 'healthy' foods and some exceed normal expectations for sugar and sodium. A policy opportunity exists to consider placing limits on the allowable levels of sugar and sodium in these packaged food products.

104,104,24103026,"Mexico's obesity prevalence is one of the world's highest. In 2006, academics, and federal and state government agencies initiated efforts to design a national policy for obesity prevention. The Ministry of Health (MOH) established an expert panel to develop recommendations on beverage intake for a healthy life in 2008. Subsequently, the MOH, with support from academia, initiated the development of the National Agreement for Healthy Nutrition (ANSA). ANSA was signed by all relevant sectoral actors in 2010 and led to initiatives banning sodas and regulating unhealthy food in schools and the design of other yet to be implemented initiatives, such as a front-of-package labeling system. A main challenge of the ANSA has been the lack of harmonization between industry interests and public health objectives and effective accountability and monitoring mechanisms to assess implementation across government sectors. Bold strategies currently under consideration include taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages, improvement of norms for healthy food in schools, regulation of food and beverage marketing to children and implementation of a national front-of-pack labeling system. Strong civil society organizations have embraced the prevention of obesity as their goal and have used evidence from academia to position obesity prevention in the public debate and in the government agenda.

Whilst advertising legislation and broadcasting regulation protect children from alcohol and HFSS imagery, the 2018 FIFA World Cup, which attracted a global audience, was sponsored and partnered by alcohol and HFSS brands. This study investigated the exposure of viewers to HFSS and alcohol imagery in a selection of group matches, and the final match, of the FIFA 2018 World Cup. The frequency and duration of appearances (to the nearest second) of branding from two sponsors (McDonald's and Budweiser), one official partner (Coca-Cola) and the official sports drink (Powerade) were recorded during all active play in live coverage of a sample of 13 matches (Six in Group A, which included the host nation, Russia, which has stringent alcohol promotion regulations in place; six in Group G, which featured England; and the final) broadcast in the UK. We used census and viewing data to calculate gross and per capita impressions generated by this imagery in the UK population. The 13 matches included 1262 min of active play and a total of 1806 appearances of alcohol and HFSS food advertisements, delivering approximately 7.5 billion branded HFSS impressions, including 759 million to children (age < 16 years), and 3.3 billion alcohol impressions, including 385 million to children, in the UK. Appearances of HFSS and alcohol brands were not statistically different between the games in either group.

On the other hand, there is no evidence that the small amount of sugar in medicines has been responsible for any dental problems. A recent British Heart Foundation survey found that nearly one in three UK children are eating sweets, chocolate and crisps three or more times a day. Hence it is futile administering sugar-free medicine to a child consuming lot of sweets. Moreover, sugar in medicines makes them palatable and bitter medicines inevitably affect compliance with the prescribed treatment. Poor compliance leads to inadequate treatment of illness and consequently increases the risk of complications from illness.

This study investigated use, preferences and perceptions of WPT flavours in pregnant WPT users, and the impact of flavour preferences on preconception/prenatal WPT use and exposure biomarkers. 58 pregnant WPT users (mean age=27 years) completed a detailed interview regarding their WPT flavours use, preferences and perceptions. Biomarkers of nicotine and carcinogen exposure (eg, cotinine, benzene, butadiene) were also collected. 55% of participants were dual/poly WPT users (ie, reported use of one or more other tobacco products in addition to WPT). Pregnant WPT users reported nearly exclusive use of flavoured WPT, with greater use of menthol/mint (68%) followed by fruit flavours (48%) (p<0.001), and greater preferences for fruit followed by menthol/mint flavours (ps<0.05). Harm perceptions did not differ among flavours. Compared with dual/poly WPT users, WPT-only users reported more total WPT use events, greater use of and preference for menthol/mint flavoured WPT (ps<0.001), and decreased exposure biomarkers (ps≤0.040). Preference for menthol/mint and fruit flavours predicted more flavoured WPT use events during preconception and pregnancy; preference for menthol/mint predicted detectable cotinine and benzene levels but not butadiene.

The questionnaires also included questions about the mothers' background (age, education) and health-related behaviours (consumption of sweets, tooth brushing frequency and smoking habits). The children were categorised by age, and Chi-squared tests, Fischer's exact test, ANOVA and correlation coefficient served for the statistical analyses. Of those under 6 months, almost half (44%) received SSBs, and 45% of them more than once a week. Their use gradually increased by age such that by 19-24 months, all received SSBs at least sometimes, and 56%, frequently.

115,115,19108797,"The Pediatric Formulation Initiative (PFI) is a project of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). The PFI was established to address the issue of the lack of appropriate formulations in children and to use this activity as a means to improve pediatric formulations, as mandated by the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act of 2002 and 2007. The PFI began in 2005 with the formation of 3 working groups-Scientific, Economics, and Taste and Flavor. These groups began the process of identifying issues, gathering needed information, and considering possible ways to overcome barriers to the development of pediatric drug formulations. The purpose of this supplement was to provide details of the working groups' activities through presentation of full-length articles. Also presented is an article that discusses the 2007 European Union (EU) regulation on medicinal products for pediatric use. Information for this article was gathered from the proceedings of a PFI workshop, sponsored by the NICHD, that was held in Bethesda, Maryland, on December 6 and 7, 2005, as well as postworkshop discussions of the different working groups. The increased awareness that the majority of medications used today have not been labeled for use in children, and have not been tested to define safety, efficacy, and appropriate dosing, has led to the passage of legislation in the United States and in the EU to create incentives to stimulate the testing of drugs in this special population. It is imperative that the problems associated with the compounding and use of extemporaneous formulations as described in this supplement be addressed. Regulatory barriers to the availability of commercially developed pediatric formulations in different countries will need to be minimized or removed. New drug delivery systems will need to be tested and made available to pediatric patients. Further research in the mediators of bitter taste and study of taste blockers, as well as newer methods for taste testing in pediatrics, should be encouraged. An overarching goal for the future is addressing the economic barriers to develop appropriate pediatric dosage forms for drugs with limited market penetration. The lack of appropriate formulations is part of a larger problem that includes limited development and manufacture of medicines tailored for pediatric patients (particularly those affected by neglected diseases), insufficient investment in drug trials, and limited research on drug disposition in various pediatric populations worldwide. The solution to these issues will require alignment of vision and commitment as a global priority of policy makers, regulators, scientists, pharmaceutical sponsors, academic institutions, governments, and research foundations.

Previously rising SSB consumption rates have declined recently, but continue to contribute added sugars beyond the limit advised by the American Heart Association. A recent meta-analysis concluded that SSBs likely increase body weight and recent long-term studies support the previous findings of increased risk of diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Beverage companies have played an active role in some SSB reduction efforts by reducing the sale of SSBs in schools, limiting television advertising to children, and increasing the availability of smaller portion-size options. Industry has opposed efforts to restrict the availability of large portion sizes and implement an excise tax. Current industry efforts include the promotion of alternative beverages perceived to be healthier as well as SSBs through Internet and social media. Continuing high SSB consumption and associated health risks highlight the need for further public health action.

121,121,24930595,"Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are widely available, discounted and promoted, and despite recommendations to the contrary, frequently consumed by children. They provide few nutritional benefits, and their consumption is implicated in a number of poor health outcomes. This study examined the nature of the beverages that sport-playing New Zealand (NZ) children associate with sport. It assessed how well the beverages aligned with nutrition guidelines and relevant regulations, and their likely impacts on health. Eighty-two children (38 girls and 44 boys) aged 10-12 years were purposively selected from netball, rugby and football clubs in low and high socioeconomic neighbourhoods, in Wellington, New Zealand (NZ). Children photographed beverages they associated with sport. The beverages were then purchased and analysed in accordance with NZ nutrition guidelines, and relevant content and labelling regulations, by: package and serving size; energy, sugar, sodium and caffeine content; pH; and advisory statements. The beverages the children associated with sport overwhelmingly had characteristics which do not support children in adhering to NZ nutrition guidelines. Implementing public health mechanisms, such as healthy food and beverage policies, widely promoting water as the beverage of choice in sport, and implementing healthy eating and drinking campaigns in sports clubs, would assist children who play organised sport to select beverages that are in keeping with children's nutrition guidelines. As part of a comprehensive public health approach they would also reduce the substantial, unnecessary and potentially harmful contribution sugar-sweetened beverages make to their diet.

Rapid evidence assessment and narrative synthesis. 9 electronic bibliographic databases, reference lists of relevant studies and searches of the internet. A total of 410 studies were located, with 46 meeting the inclusion criteria. The majority employed a cross-sectional design, involved participants aged 11-18 years, and were conducted in North America or Europe. Consumption of energy drinks by children and young people was found to be patterned by gender, with boys consuming more than girls, and also by activity levels, with the highest consumption observed in the most and least sedentary individuals. Several studies identified a strong, positive association between the use of energy drinks and higher odds of health-damaging behaviours, as well as physical health symptoms such as headaches, stomach aches, hyperactivity and insomnia. There was some evidence of a dose-response effect. 2 experimental studies involving small numbers of junior athletes demonstrated a positive impact on limited aspects of sports performance. 3 themes emerged from the qualitative studies: reasons for use; influences on use; and perceived efficacy and impact. Taste and energy-seeking were identified as key drivers, and branding and marketing were highlighted as major influences on young people's consumption choices. Awareness of possible negative effects was low. There is growing evidence that consumption of energy drinks is associated with a range of adverse outcomes and risk behaviours in terms of children's health and well-being. However, taste, brand loyalty and perceived positive effects combine to ensure their popularity with young consumers. More research is needed to explore the short-term and long-term impacts in all spheres, including health, behaviour and education. CRD42014010192.

124,124,24555673,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a rampant epidemic worldwide. Causative factors and predisposition is postulated to be multi-factorial in origin and include changing life styles and diet. This paper examines the relationship between per capita sugar consumption and diabetes prevalence worldwide and with regard to territorial, economic and geographical regions. Data from 165 countries were extracted for analysis. Associations between the population prevalence of diabetes mellitus and per capita sugar consumption (PCSC) were examined using Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) and multivariate linear regression analysis with, infant mortality rates (IMR, as an general index maternal and child care), low birth weight (LBW, as an index of biological programming) and obesity prevalence included in the model as confounders. Despite the estimates for PCSC being relatively crude, a strong positive correlation coefficient (0.599 with p < 0.001) was observed between prevalence of diabetes mellitus and per capita sugar consumption using data from all 165 countries. Asia had the highest correlation coefficient with a PCC of 0.660 (p < 0.001) with strongest correlation noted in Central (PCC = 0.968; p < 0.001), South (PCC = 0.684; p = 0.050) and South East Asia (PCC = 0.916; p < 0.001). Per capita sugar consumption (p < 0.001; Beta = 0.360) remained significant at the last stage as associations of DM prevalence (R2 = 0.458) in the multivariate backward linear regression model. The linear regression model was repeated with the data grouped according to the continent. Sugar was noted to be an independent association with DM only with regard to Asia (p < 0.001 Beta = 0.707) and South America (p = 0.010 Beta 0.550). When countries were categorized based on income PCS and DM demonstrated significant association only for upper middle income countries (p < 0.001 Beta 0.656). These results indicate independent associations between DM prevalence rates and per capita sugar consumption both worldwide and with special regard to the Asian region.

127,127,36203148,"Alcohol use is a serious public health challenge worldwide. Japan has no government regulations or legal penalties against advertising alcoholic beverages on television (TV). Instead, advertisements depend on the Japanese alcohol industry's self-regulation on airtime (no advertisements from 5 am to 6 pm) and the content of alcoholic beverages, which must not tempt minors. However, many adolescents (10 to 19 years old) watch TV from 6 pm to 11 pm. The aim of this study was to describe the pattern in the advertising of alcoholic beverages and alcohol-flavoured non-alcoholic beverages (AFNAB) in Japan during the popular TV viewing time for adolescents. A secondary analysis of advertising airtime data from five free-to-air Japanese TV networks in the Greater Tokyo area that aired between 12 August and 3 November 2019, was performed. During the study period, 5215 advertisements for alcoholic beverages and AFNABs aired (1451.75 min). In total, 2303 advertisements (44.2%) were beer, low-malt beer, or beer-taste beverages, 277 (5.3%) were whisky, 2334 (44.8%) were local alcoholic beverages (shochu and seishu), and 301 (5.8%) were AFNAB. On average, more advertisements aired on weekends (67.6 advertisements) than on weekdays (59.3 advertisements) per day. Approximately 30% of advertisements for AFNABs were aired during the time restricted for alcohol advertising, although AFNABs are considered alcohol according to industry guidelines. During the popular television viewing time for young adolescents, about two to three times more advertisements were aired per hour than during the rest of the day, on both weekdays and weekends (p < 0.001). The number of alcohol advertisements aired at times when adolescents often watch TV is 2 to 3.2 times higher than that at other times of the day. Furthermore, despite the industry's self-imposed regulations, some alcoholic beverages are still advertised. Therefore, other methods to protect children and adolescents from exposure to advertisements for alcoholic beverages should be investigated and implemented.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effect of fructose on postprandial triglycerides. Relevant studies were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases (through September 3, 2013). Relevant clinical trials of ≥ 7-days were included in the analysis. Two independent reviewers extracted relevant data with disagreements reconciled by consensus. The Heyland Methodological Quality Score (MQS) assessed study quality. Data were pooled by the generic inverse variance method using random effects models and expressed as standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed (Cochran Q statistic) and quantified (I(2) statistic). Eligibility criteria were met by 14 isocaloric trials (n = 290), in which fructose was exchanged isocalorically for other carbohydrate in the diet, and two hypercaloric trials (n = 33), in which fructose supplemented the background diet with excess energy from high-dose fructose compared with the background diet alone (without the excess energy). There was no significant effect in the isocaloric trials (SMD: 0.14 [95% CI: -0.02, 0.30]) with evidence of considerable heterogeneity explained by a single trial. Hypercaloric trials, however, showed a significant postprandial triglyceride raising-effect of fructose (SMD: 0.65 [95% CI: 0.30, 1.01]). Most of the available trials were small, short, and of poor quality. Interpretation of the isocaloric trials is complicated by the large influence of a single trial.

To discuss concerns regarding the use of the existing definition of the MS (as defined in adults) in children and adolescents, analyzing the scientific evidence needed to detect a clustering of cardiovascular risk-factors. Finally, we propose a new methodological approach for estimating metabolic risk-factor clustering in children and adolescents. Major concerns were the lack of information on the background derived from a child's family and personal history; the lack of consensus on insulin levels, lipid parameters, markers of inflammation or steato-hepatitis; the lack of an additive relevant effect of the MS definition to obesity per se. We propose the adoption of 10 evidence-based items from which to quantify metabolic risk-factor clustering, collected in a multilevel Metabolic Individual Risk-factor And CLustering Estimation (MIRACLE) approach, and thus avoiding the use of the current MS term in children. Pediatricians should consider a novel and specific approach to assessing children/adolescents and should not simply derive or adapt definitions from adults. Evaluation of insulin and lipid levels should be included only when specific references for the relation of age, gender, pubertal status and ethnic origin to health risk become available. This new approach could be useful for improving the overall quality of patient evaluation and for optimizing the use of the limited resources available facing to the obesity epidemic.

They analyzed the current status of scientific knowledge on low- and no-calorie sweeteners (LNCS) and developed a consensus Decalogue on their use; this constitutes the Chinchón Declaration. Sweeteners, including sugar, represent a subject of undeniable interest and are currently a popular topic, although areas relating to their safety and benefits remain unknown to segments of academia and the general public. The nature of LNCS makes them vulnerable to biased and even contradictory information. They are food additives that are broadly used as sugar substitutes to sweeten foods, medicines and food supplements when non-nutritional or non-caloric alternatives are needed. The Chinchón Decalogue is the outcome of a meeting for reflection and consensus by a group of experts with backgrounds in different scientific disciplines (toxicology, clinical nutrition, community nutrition, physiology, food science, public health, pediatrics, endocrinology and nutrition, nursing, pharmaceutical care and food legislation). The Decalogue includes different aspects of LNCS related to regulation, use, benefits and safety. In general, benefits of LNCS have been traditionally neglected in comparison with the tendency for emphasising unexisting or unproven possible risks. The need to strengthen research on LNCS in Spain was emphasized, as well as the need to educate both professionals and the public. Expertos de carácter multidisciplinar de las áreas de conocimiento de la nutrición y la salud reunidos en Chinchón, Madrid, los días 25 y 26 de noviembre de 2013 , bajo los auspicios de la Fundación para la Investigación Nutricional y con la colaboración de la Consejería de Sanidad del Gobierno de la Comunidad de Madrid, la International Sweeteners Association y el CIBER de Fisiopatología de la Obesidad y la Nutrición del Instituto de Salud Carlos III, analizaron el estado actual del conocimiento científico en torno a los Edulcorantes sin y bajos en calorías (ESBC) y desarrollaron un Decálogo sobre su uso que constituye la Declaración de Chinchón. Los edulcorantes, incluido el azúcar, constituyen un elemento de indudable interés y actualidad, aunque no exento de desconocimiento por algunos sectores tanto académicos como de la población en general. La propia naturaleza de los ESBC los hace susceptibles de informaciones tergiversadas e incluso contradictorias. Son aditivos alimentarios ampliamente utilizados como sustitutivos del azúcar para endulzar alimentos, medicamentos y complementos alimenticios cuando se persiguen fines no nutritivos. El Decálogo de Chinchón es fruto de una reunión de reflexión y consenso por parte de un grupo de expertos procedentes de distintas disciplinas científicas (toxicología, nutrición clínica, nutrición comunitaria, fisiología, bromatología, salud pública, atención primaria, pediatría, endocrinología y nutrición, enfermería, atención farmacéutica y legislación alimentaria). El decálogo incluye diferentes aspectos de los EBSC relacionados con la legislación, uso, beneficios y seguridad. En general, los beneficios de los EBSC han sido tradicionalmente desatendidos en comparación con la tendencia de destacar posibles riesgos inexistentes o que no han sido probados.

Of the women who had ever used hookah (62%), most (82%) used hookah sweetened with fruit flavors. Preferences for hookah flavors were statistically different between flavors such that women overall preferred sweet flavors (fruits, candy or other sweets, chocolate) versus other flavors (menthol/mint, clove/spice, alcohol, other beverages, tobacco/unflavored). Perceptions of general or pregnancy-related harmfulness did not differ between flavors. Sweet flavors (fruits, candy or other sweets, chocolate) were perceived to be less harsh than tobacco/unflavored hookah among women who had ever used hookah. Flavor preferences (but not perceptions of harmfulness or harshness) predicted intentions to use flavored HT in the future. Sweet flavored tobacco is preferred and used by reproductive-age women.

142,142,26238447,"High salt intake is the major cause of raised blood pressure and accordingly leads to cardiovascular diseases. Recently, it has been shown that high salt intake is associated with an increased risk of obesity through sugar-sweetened beverage consumption. Increasing evidence also suggests a direct link. Our study aimed to determine whether there was a direct association between salt intake and obesity independent of energy intake. We analyzed the data from the rolling cross-sectional study-the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey 2008/2009 to 2011/2012. We included 458 children (52% boys; age, 10±4 years) and 785 adults (47% men; age, 49±17 years) who had complete 24-hour urine collections. Energy intake was calculated from 4-day diary and misreporting was assessed by Goldberg method. The results showed that salt intake as measured by 24-hour urinary sodium was higher in overweight and obese individuals. A 1-g/d increase in salt intake was associated with an increase in the risk of obesity by 28% (odds ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.45; P=0.0002) in children and 26% (odds ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.37; P<0.0001) in adults, after adjusting for age, sex, ethnic group, household income, physical activity, energy intake, and diet misreporting, and in adults with additional adjustment for education, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Higher salt intake was also significantly related to higher body fat mass in both children (P=0.001) and adults (P=0.001) after adjusting for age, sex, ethnic group, and energy intake. These results suggest that salt intake is a potential risk factor for obesity independent of energy intake.

These maturational patterns have been well-characterized for bacteria, but limited descriptions exist for other microbiota members, such as fungi. Further, our current understanding of the prevalence of different patterns of bacterial and fungal microbiome maturation and how inter-kingdom dynamics influence early-life microbiome establishment is limited. We examined individual shifts in bacterial and fungal alpha diversity from 3 to 12 months of age in 100 infants from the CHILD Cohort Study. We identified divergent patterns of gut bacterial or fungal microbiome maturation in over 40% of infants, which were characterized by differences in community composition, inter-kingdom dynamics, and microbe-derived metabolites in urine, suggestive of alterations in the timing of ecosystem transitions. Known microbiome-modifying factors, such as formula feeding and delivery by C-section, were associated with atypical bacterial, but not fungal, microbiome maturation patterns. Instead, fungal microbiome maturation was influenced by prenatal exposure to artificially sweetened beverages and the bacterial microbiome, emphasizing the importance of inter-kingdom dynamics in early-life colonization patterns. These findings highlight the ecological and environmental factors underlying atypical patterns of microbiome maturation in infants, and the need to incorporate multi-kingdom and individual-level perspectives in microbiome research to improve our understandings of gut microbiome maturation patterns in early life and how they relate to host health.

The aim of our study was to explore the extent and context of preschoolers' sweets consumption and to identify high-risk groups. The baseline cross-sectional data used originated from a nutritional intervention study encompassing 879 parental surveys, which were obtained in 52 kindergartens in Baden-Württemberg-the third largest federal state in Germany-between September and March 2009. Our outcome variable ""sweets consumption"" was operationalized using food-frequency items and analyzed by testing the influence of sociodemographic, educational, cultural, and family context covariates. Most preschoolers consumed sweets every day-on average 9.7 ± 6.2 times per week. Most popular were cookies, gummy bears, and chocolate. Sweets consumption did not correlate significantly with sociodemographic factors like age and sex but rather was associated with cultural and contextual factors such as immigrant background, parental education, specific nutritional knowledge levels, and access arrangements in the home. The consumption patterns identified are a result of high availability and parental influence (factors such as parents' knowledge levels, interest in, and habits regarding their child's nutrition). Dental practitioners should place more emphasis on gathering information from young patients regarding excessive and frequent consumption of sweets and consequently on trying to educate the children and their parents on oral health risks associated with such consumption. Particular attention is to be paid to children of Turkish and Arabic decent, as they have been shown to consume above-average amounts of sweets.

The conceptual model performed well for each component of eating behavior, indicating acceptable goodness-of-fit for both the measurement and structural models. Models for vegetable intake and unhealthy snacking showed significant and direct effects of individual factors (perceived benefits). For breakfast and sugary drink consumption, there was a direct and positive association with socio-environmental factors (school support and parental permissiveness). Access to healthy food was associated indirectly with all eating behaviors (except for sugary drink intake) and this effect operated through socio-environmental (parental permissiveness and school support) and individual factors (perceived benefits).

Some observational studies suggest that children consuming NNS are at increased risk for obesity-related outcomes; however, others find no association or provide evidence of confounding. Fewer studies have examined prenatal NNS exposure, with mixed results from different analytical approaches.

152,152,17977293,"To investigate existing caries risk factors in preschool children and to illustrate their caries risk profiles graphically with aid of a computer-based program. All 2-year-old children from a small town in northern Sweden were invited and 87% (n = 125) accepted to participate. Data was collected with a questionnaire concerning the child's normal diet and sugar consumption. Special care was taken to note the intake of sweet drinks and sugary between-meal products. Questions on general health and medication, toothbrushing frequency with parental help and use of fluorides were also included. The caries prevalence was recorded with mirror and probe and the level of oral mutans streptococci was enumerated with a chair-side technique. The obtained data were computerised in a risk assessment program (Cariogram) and a graphical profile of each child was constructed. The caries prevalence was 6%, and 18% had detectable levels of oral mutans streptococci. The sugar consumption was strikingly high with 82% and 97% having ice cream and sweets once a week or more often. In 22% of the families, toothbrushing with parental help was not a daily routine. Of the children, 51% displayed a low chance (0-20%) of avoiding caries in the future. The frequency of sugar consumption was the most pertinent factor in the children's caries risk profiles. Half of the subjects exhibited a low chance of avoiding caries in the near future and the strongest single factor was frequent sugar consumption. Thus efforts to limit and reduce the sugar intake in young children are important measures for primary caries prevention.

To assess whether this association holds for the fructose-containing sugars they contain, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library (through June 2016). We included prospective cohort studies that assessed the relation of fructose-containing sugars with incident type 2 diabetes. Two independent reviewers extracted relevant data and assessed risk of bias. We pooled risk ratios (RRs) using random effects meta-analyses. The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Fiffeen prospective cohort studies (251 261 unique participants, 16 416 cases) met the eligibility criteria, comparing the highest intake (median 137, 35.2 and 78 g/d) with the lowest intake (median 65, 9.7 and 25.8 g/d) of total sugars, fructose and sucrose, respectively. Although there was no association of total sugars (RR 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-1.09) or fructose (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84-1.29) with type 2 diabetes, sucrose was associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.98). Our confidence in the estimates was limited by evidence of serious inconsistency between studies for total sugars and fructose, and serious imprecision in the pooled estimates for all 3 sugar categories.

Excessive consumption may be considered as a proxy of poor diet quality. However, no previous studies evaluated the association between the habit of adding sugars to ""healthy"" foods, such as plain milk and fresh fruit, and indicators of adiposity and/or dietary quality in children. To answer to these research questions, we Panalysed the European cohort of children participating in the IDEFICS study. Anthropometric variables, frequency of consumption of sugars added to milk and fruit (SAMF), and scores of adherence to healthy dietary pattern (HDAS) were assessed at baseline in 9829 children stratified according to age and sex. From this cohort, 6929 children were investigated again after two years follow-up. At baseline, a direct association between SAMF categories and adiposity indexes was observed only in children aged 6⁻<10 years, while the lower frequency of SAMF consumption was significantly associated with a higher HDAS. At the two year follow-up, children with higher baseline SAMF consumption showed significantly higher increases in all the anthropometric variables measured, with the exception of girls 6⁻<10 years old. The inverse association between SAMF categories and HDAS was still present at the two years follow-up in all age and sex groups.

Fruit, vegetable, and added sugar intake were measured via a short food frequency questionnaire, and sleep time and screen time were measured using 7-day logs. A linear mixed effects model examined the intervention's effect on post-intervention changes in PA, intake of fruit, vegetable, and added sugar, sleep time, and screen time from baseline to post-intervention. A total of 325 parents participated in the study (CBI n = 101; CBI + HBI n = 101; and control n = 123). Compared to control children, CBI and CBI + HBI parents reported decreases in children's intake of added sugar from sugar-sweetened beverages. Both CBI and CBI + HBI parents also reported smaller increases in children's average weekday screen time relative to controls. In addition, CBI + HBI parents reported CBI + HBI parents reported increases in children's adult-facilitated PA, fruit and vegetable intake, and daily sleep time during weekdays (excluding weekends) and the total week from baseline to post-intervention, while children in the CBI increased sleep time over the total week compared to the children in the control group. Parent engagement strengthened the improvement in parent-reported EBRBs at home in young children participating in an evidence-based obesity prevention program in a childcare setting. Future studies should investigate equity-related contextual factors that influence the impact of obesity prevention in health-disparity populations. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03590834.

168,168,8610757,"Our purpose was to assess to what extent disturbances in antepartum maternal metabolism and perinatal complications and morbidities contribute to poorer psychomotor development in offspring of diabetic mothers. One hundred ninety-six pregnant women and their singleton offspring participated in this prospective cohort-analytic study. Ninety-five women had pregestational diabetes mellitus, and 101 women had gestational diabetes mellitus. Serial estimates of circulating maternal fuels were obtained throughout each index pregnancy along with detailed records of the perinatal course and outcome. Offspring were administered the psychomotor development index of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development at age 2 years and the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test Of Motor Proficiency at ages 6, 8, and 9 years. Tests were performed blinded to the mother's antepartum metabolic status, and perinatal history, and the child's previous test scores. Partial correlations and analyses of covariance were used to control for other influences and confounds, such as family socioeconomic status, racial or ethnic origin, patient group (i.e., pregestational or gestational diabetes mellitus), and sex of child. Children's average score on the Bruininks-Oseretsky test at ages 6 to 9 years correlated significantly with maternal second (p < 0.02) and third trimester (p < 0.001) beta-hydroxybutyrate. There was also a borderline association between the children's scores on the psychomotor development index at age 2 years and maternal third-trimester beta-hydroxybutyrate levels (p = 0.06). No other correlations approached significance. Intrauterine metabolic experiences continue to influence the neurodevelopmental course in offspring of diabetic mothers.

169,169,32366959,"Obesity often originates in early life, and is linked to excess sugar intake. Nonnutritive sweeteners (NNS) are widely consumed as ""healthier"" alternatives to sugar, yet recent evidence suggests NNS may adversely influence weight gain and metabolic health. The impact of NNS during critical periods of early development has rarely been studied. We investigated the effect of prenatal NNS exposure on postnatal adiposity and adipocyte development. In the CHILD birth cohort (N = 2298), we assessed maternal NNS beverage intake during pregnancy and child body composition at 3 years, controlling for maternal BMI and other potential confounders. To investigate causal mechanisms, we fed NNS to pregnant C57BL6J mice at doses relevant to human consumption (42 mg/kg/day aspartame or 6.3 mg/kg/day sucralose), and assessed offspring until 12 weeks of age for: body weight, adiposity, adipose tissue morphology and gene expression, glucose and insulin tolerance. We also studied the effect of sucralose on lipid accumulation and gene expression in cultured 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte cells. In the CHILD cohort, children born to mothers who regularly consumed NNS beverages had elevated body mass index (mean z-score difference +0.23, 95% CI 0.05-0.42 for daily vs. no consumption, adjusted for maternal BMI). In mice, maternal NNS caused elevated body weight, adiposity, and insulin resistance in offspring, especially in males (e.g., 47% and 15% increase in body fat for aspartame and sucralose vs. controls, p < 0.001). In cultured adipocytes, sucralose exposure at early stages of differentiation caused increased lipid accumulation and expression of adipocyte differentiation genes (e.g., C/EBP-α, FABP4, and FASN). These genes were also upregulated in adipose tissue of male mouse offspring born to sucralose-fed dams. By triangulating evidence from humans, mice, and cultured adipocytes, this study provides new evidence that maternal NNS consumption during pregnancy may program obesity risk in offspring through effects on adiposity and adipocyte differentiation.

This project presents an evidence-based review of the current research literature from 2001 to 2009 to examine the association between SSBs and children's BMI. An analysis of nine primary research studies is reported and eight of nine studies support that a decrease or reduction in SSBs by our youth can have a positive impact on their BMI.

Children's nutrition knowledge was analysed in a time-restricted cohort of 70 seven-y-old (34 boys) intervention children and 70 control children (40 boys) with a picture identification test.

176,176,26365102,"By reducing energy density, low-energy sweeteners (LES) might be expected to reduce energy intake (EI) and body weight (BW). To assess the totality of the evidence testing the null hypothesis that LES exposure (versus sugars or unsweetened alternatives) has no effect on EI or BW, we conducted a systematic review of relevant studies in animals and humans consuming LES with ad libitum access to food energy. In 62 of 90 animal studies exposure to LES did not affect or decreased BW. Of 28 reporting increased BW, 19 compared LES with glucose exposure using a specific 'learning' paradigm. Twelve prospective cohort studies in humans reported inconsistent associations between LES use and body mass index (-0.002 kg m(-)(2) per year, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.009 to 0.005). Meta-analysis of short-term randomized controlled trials (129 comparisons) showed reduced total EI for LES versus sugar-sweetened food or beverage consumption before an ad libitum meal (-94 kcal, 95% CI -122 to -66), with no difference versus water (-2 kcal, 95% CI -30 to 26). This was consistent with EI results from sustained intervention randomized controlled trials (10 comparisons). Meta-analysis of sustained intervention randomized controlled trials (4 weeks to 40 months) showed that consumption of LES versus sugar led to relatively reduced BW (nine comparisons; -1.35 kg, 95% CI -2.28 to -0.42), and a similar relative reduction in BW versus water (three comparisons; -1.24 kg, 95% CI -2.22 to -0.26). Most animal studies did not mimic LES consumption by humans, and reverse causation may influence the results of prospective cohort studies. The preponderance of evidence from all human randomized controlled trials indicates that LES do not increase EI or BW, whether compared with caloric or non-caloric (for example, water) control conditions. Overall, the balance of evidence indicates that use of LES in place of sugar, in children and adults, leads to reduced EI and BW, and possibly also when compared with water.

177,177,36266753,"The property theory is a unique principle instructing traditional Chinese doctors to prescribe proper medicines against diseases. As an essential part of it, the five-flavor theory catalogs various Chinese materia medicas (CMMs) into five flavors (sweet, bitter, sour, salty, and pungent) based on their taste and medical functions. Although CMM has been successfully applied in China for thousands of years, it is still a big challenge to interpret CMM flavor via modern biomarkers, further deepening its elusiveness. Herein, to identify the correlation between gut microbiota and CMM flavor, we selected 14 CMMs with different flavors to prepare their aqueous extracts, quantified the contained major chemical components, and then performed full-length 16S rRNA sequencing to analyze the gut microbiota of C57BL/6 mice administrated with CMM extracts. We found that flavones, alkaloids, and saponins were the richest components for sweet-, bitter-, and pungent-flavored CMMs, respectively. Medicines with merged flavors (bitter-pungent and sweet-pungent) displayed mixed profiles of components. According to gut microbial analysis, modulation of CMMs belonging to the same flavor on the taxonomic classification was inconsistent to an extent, while the functional sets of gut microbiota, co-abundance gene groups (CAGs), strongly and differentially responded to distinct flavors. Moreover, these correlations were in line with their pharmacological actions. Therefore, the gut microbial functional sets (CAGs) could act as the possible indicator to reflect CMM flavor, rather than the composition of microbial community.

183,183,25294406,"Studies have identified prenatal flavour exposure as a determinant of taste preferences in infants; however, these studies have focused on relatively small samples and limited flavours. As many parents struggle with getting children to accept a variety of nutritious foods, a study of the factors influencing food acceptance is warranted. The objective of this study was to determine whether exposure to a wider variety of fruit and vegetables and overall higher diet quality in utero results in acceptance of a greater variety of these foods and better diet quality for offspring during childhood. This study is a secondary data analysis of pregnant women (n = 52) and their resulting offspring recruited for the Women and Their Children's Health study in NSW, Australia. Dietary intake of mothers and children was measured using food frequency questionnaires. Diet quality and vegetable and fruit variety were calculated using the Australian Recommended Food Score and the Australian Child and Adolescent Recommended Food Score. Associations between maternal and child diet quality and variety were assessed using Pearson's correlations and the total effect of in utero maternal pregnancy diet on childhood diet was decomposed into direct and indirect effect using mediation analysis. Maternal pregnancy and post-natal diet were both correlated with child diet for overall diet quality and fruit and vegetable variety (P < 0.001). Mediation analyses showed that the indirect effect of maternal pregnancy diet on child diet was mediated through maternal post-natal diet, particularly for fruit (P = 0.045) and vegetables (P = 0.055). Nutrition intervention should therefore be aimed at improving diet quality and variety in mothers with young children, in order to subsequently improve eating habits of offspring.

As advocated by the World Health Organization, solid oral formulations with excellent shelf-life, taste masking and dose adjustment are attracting attention as appropriate pediatric oral antimicrobial formulations, but liquid formulations remain the most common worldwide. Apparently unique to Japan, the most common formulations of oral antimicrobials for pediatric use are dispensed as a powder with most being flavored powders. Powdered formulations are packaged in single doses, which eliminates the need for parents to weigh them before administration and may reduce the possibility of dosage errors. On the other hand, there are some formulations that require large doses of powder due to inappropriate concentrations, granular formulations that have a rough texture that affects palatability, and some formulations that require flavoring agents to mask the bitter taste of the main drug. Such inappropriate formulations have a significant impact on adherence to antimicrobial therapy. It remains unclear whether solid oral dosage forms might be as acceptable worldwide as in Japan. To ensure that appropriate antimicrobials are delivered to children worldwide, a direction for the development of appropriate dosage forms in children needs to be established.

However, the effect of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) compared with sucrose in pediatric NAFLD has not been investigated. We tested whether the isocaloric substitution of dietary sucrose by HFCS would increase the severity of NAFLD in juvenile pigs, and whether this effect would be associated with changes in gut histology, SCFA production, and microbial diversity. Iberian pigs, 53-d-old and pair-housed in pens balanced for weight and sex, were randomly assigned to receive a mash diet top-dressed with increasing amounts of sucrose (SUC; n = 3 pens; 281.6-486.8 g/kg diet) or HFCS (n = 4; 444.3-724.8 g/kg diet) during 16 wk. Diets exceeded the animal's energy requirements by providing sugars in excess, but met the requirements for all other nutrients. Animals were killed at 165 d of age after blood sampling, and liver, muscle, and gut were collected for histology, metabolome, and microbiome analyses. Data were analyzed by multivariate and univariate statistics. Compared with SUC, HFCS increased subcutaneous fat, triacylglycerides in plasma, and butyrate in colon (P ≤ 0.05). In addition, HFCS decreased UMP and short-chain acyl carnitines in liver, and urea nitrogen and creatinine in serum (P ≤ 0.05). Microbiome analysis showed a 24.8% average dissimilarity between HFCS and SUC associated with changes in SCFA-producing bacteria. Body weight gain, intramuscular fat, histological and serum markers of liver injury, and circulating hormones, glucose, and proinflammatory cytokines did not differ between diets. Fructose consumption derived from HFCS promoted butyrate synthesis, triglyceridemia, and subcutaneous lipid deposition in juvenile Iberian pigs, but did not increase serum and histological markers of NAFLD compared with a sucrose-enriched diet. Longer studies could be needed to observe differences in liver injury among sugar types.

All youth consumed SSBs regularly and lived in a home where SSBs were available. We used qualitative methods to examine key themes around beliefs about SSBs and water, facilitators of SSB and water consumption, and barriers to reducing SSB consumption. A few parents and youth believed that sports drinks are healthy. Although nearly all thought that water is healthy, most parents and about half of youth thought that tap water is unsafe. About half of parent-child dyads had discordant beliefs regarding their perceptions of tap water. About half of parents believed that homemade culturally relevant drinks (eg, aguas frescas), which typically contain sugar, fruit, and water, were healthy because of their ""natural"" ingredients. Participants cited home availability as a key factor in SSB consumption. About half of parents set no rules about SSB consumption at home. Among those with rules, most parent-child pairs differed on their beliefs about the content of the rules, and youth reported few consequences for breaking rules. Obesity programs for Latino youth should address misconceptions around water and should discuss culturally relevant drinks and sports drinks as potential sources of weight gain.

As a potential means to help slow the obesity epidemic, low-calorie sweeteners (LCS) have gained attention as dietary tools to assist in adherence to weight loss plans or prevention of excess weight gain. Observational studies tend to show positive correlations between LCS consumption and weight gain in children and adolescents. Although the data are intriguing, these epidemiologic studies do not establish that LCS cause weight gain, because there are likely many lifestyle and genetic differences between children and families who choose to consume LCS and those who do not. Short-term randomized controlled trials have shown LCS use to be BMI neutral or to have modest weight-reducing effects in overweight and obese adolescents. The long-term effects of LCS in children and adolescents are unknown. Some compelling research is currently underway and may provide needed insight into the potential role of LCS in weight management.

190,190,25628346,"Is sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption associated with age at menarche? More frequent SSB consumption was associated with earlier menarche in a population of US girls. SSB consumption is associated with metabolic changes that could potentially impact menarcheal timing, but direct associations with age at menarche have yet to be investigated. The Growing up Today Study, a prospective cohort study of 16 875 children of Nurses' Health Study II participants residing in all 50 US states. This analysis followed 5583 girls, aged 9-14 years and premenarcheal at baseline, between 1996 and 2001. During 10 555 person-years of follow-up, 94% (n = 5227) of girls reported their age at menarche, and 3% (n = 159) remained premenarcheal in 2001; 4% (n = 197) of eligible girls were censored, primarily for missing age at menarche. Cumulative updated SSB consumption (composed of non-carbonated fruit drinks, sugar-sweetened soda and iced tea) was calculated using annual Youth/Adolescent Food Frequency Questionnaires from 1996 to 1998. Age at menarche was self-reported annually. The association between SSB consumption and age at menarche was assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression. More frequent SSB consumption predicted earlier menarche. At any given age between 9 and 18.5 years, premenarcheal girls who reported consuming >1.5 servings of SSBs per day were, on average, 24% more likely [95% confidence interval (CI): 13, 36%; P-trend: <0.001] to attain menarche in the next month relative to girls consuming ≤2 servings of SSBs weekly, adjusting for potential confounders including height, but not BMI (considered an intermediate). Correspondingly, girls consuming >1.5 SSBs daily had an estimated 2.7-month earlier menarche (95% CI: -4.1, -1.3 months) relative to those consuming ≤2 SSBs weekly. The frequency of non-carbonated fruit drink (P-trend: 0.03) and sugar-sweetened soda (P-trend: 0.001), but not iced tea (P-trend: 0.49), consumption also predicted earlier menarche. The effect of SSB consumption on age at menarche was observed in every tertile of baseline BMI. Diet soda and fruit juice consumption were not associated with age at menarche. Although we adjusted for a variety of suspected confounders, residual confounding is possible. We did not measure SSB consumption during early childhood, which may be an important window of exposure. More frequent SSB consumption may predict earlier menarche through mechanisms other than increased BMI. Our findings provide further support for public health efforts to reduce SSB consumption.

Multinomial logit regression models evaluated the influence of these attributes on waterpipe smoking choices. Across all four samples (n = 1859), participants preferred fruit-flavored varieties to tobacco flavor, lower nicotine content and lower prices. Exposure to the health warning did not significantly predict likelihood to opt-out. Flavor accounted for 81.4% of waterpipe smoking decisions.

Compared with nondrinkers, boys who consumed >500 mL/day (high quantity) of SSBs exhibited 10.3-fold (95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.2-90.2) and 5.1-fold (95% CIs: 1.01-25.5) risks of contracting MetS, as defined by the IDF and Cook criteria for MetS, respectively. In girls, the risk estimates for the same comparison were not significant by the IDF criteria (6.5-fold risk, 95% CIs: 0.9-∞) or Cook criteria (5.9-fold risk, 95% CIs: 0.8-43.8) for MetS. High SSB consumption was also linked to 1.9-fold (95% CIs: 1.1-3.1) and 2.7-fold (95% CIs: 1.3-5.7) higher risks of being at a greater overall metabolic risk in girls and boys, respectively. In conclusion, a high SSB intake is associated with adolescent MetS among boys but not girls in Taiwan.

Global, with emphasis on marked differences in both national sugar intake and fluoride use and preferably where one factor such as sugar intake changed progressively without changes in other factors over a decade or more. Children aged 6 years or more and adults. Caries occurred in both resistant and susceptible teeth of children when sugar intakes were only 2-3 % of energy intake, provided that the teeth had been exposed to sugars for >3 years. Despite increased enamel resistance after tooth eruption, there was a progressive linear increase in caries throughout life, explaining the higher rates of caries in adults than in children. Fluoride affects progression of caries development but there still is a pandemic prevalence of caries in populations worldwide. Previous analyses based on children have misled public health analyses on sugars. The recommendation that sugar intakes should be ≤10 % of energy intake is no longer acceptable. The much greater adult burden of dental caries highlights the need for very low sugar intakes throughout life, e.g. 2-3 % of energy intake, whether or not fluoride intake is optimum.

Mean frequency intake of raw vegetable was lower in boys (p = 0.022 in young and p = 0.020 in old) and older girls (p = 0.026) with high hs-CRP concentration, while in younger girls (p = 0.008) the same occurred with the cooked vegetables. The probability of having higher hs-CRP concentration was significantly associated with having low consumption frequency of vegetables (p = 0.004 in older boys, raw vegetables; and p = 0.0032 in younger girls, cooked vegetables). Also, honey/jam intake decreased the probability of having higher concentration of hs-CRP, whereas soft drinks with sugar, mayonnaise and cereals milled increased this probability. Out of all food items associated with hs-CRP, frequency intake of vegetables presented more associations across all the analysis. Findings suggest that a high-frequency intake of vegetables is inversely related to an inflammatory status in children.

In addition to the recommendations and usual care to their patients, dental surgeons also have to inform them on a dietetic level. Chewing sugar-free chewing gum after any light meal when it is not followed by a brushing presents a real interest. The authors describe the different polyols and their respective uses. Polyols are widely found in foodstuffs (sweets, chewing-gum, biscuits, cooked meals for diabetic), pharmaceutical products (syrups, pastilles to be sucked, various medicines), non-pharmaceutical chemists (toothpastes, mouth-washes...). By the light of the most recent published works, the particular properties of xylitol are described. Polyols are more particularly indicated for sugar-eater or sick children (syrups), and for those carrying a hight risk of developing caries (progressive polycaries, hyposialie...).

A retrospective study was performed on Saudi children and adolescents with confirmed T1DM who were followed at the Pediatric Endocrinology Clinic of the Maternity and Children Hospital, Jeddah, from 2000 to 2014. Data collection included all possible factors that may be associated with uncontrolled T1DM. Patients were classified according to American Diabetes Association guidelines for target HbA1c levels per age group. Comparisons were made between well-controlled (WC) patients, HG patients, and DKA patients. Calculation of odds ratios and logistic regression allowed for estimation of the role of each risk factor in uncontrolled T1DM. Only 31.2 % of children and adolescents with T1DM were well controlled.

203,203,29343247,"In Norway, social inequalities in health and health-related behaviors have been reported despite the well-developed welfare state. The objective of the present study was to analyze; (i) the development in frequency of consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) and artificially sweetened beverages (ASB) from childhood to adulthood; (ii) socioeconomic inequalities in the consumption of SSB and ASB using different indicators of socioeconomic status (SES); (iii) time trends in potential disparities in SSB and ASB consumption among different socioeconomic groups to assess the development in socioeconomic inequality from childhood to adulthood. This study uses data from the Fruits and Vegetables Make the Marks (FVMM) longitudinal cohort, including participants (n = 437) from 20 random schools from two Norwegian counties. Data from the first survey in 2001 (mean age 11.8) and follow-up surveys in 2005 (mean age 15.5) and 2016 (mean age 26.5) were used. Consumption of SSB and ASB were measured using a food frequency questionnaire, which the participants completed at school in 2001 and 2005, and online in 2016. Various indicators of SES were included; in 2001, parental education and income were measured, in 2005, participants' educational intentions in adolescence were measured, and in 2016, participants' own education and income were measured. The main analyses conducted were linear mixed effects analysis of the repeated measures. Between 2001 and 2016, a decrease in frequency of consumption of SSB (2.8 v 1.3 times/week; p = < 0.001) and an increase in frequency of consumption of ASB (1.1 v 1.6 times/week; p = 0.002) were observed. Participants with a higher educational level in adulthood and higher educational intentions in adolescence had a significantly lower frequency of consumption of SSB at all time points (2001, 2005 and 2016). No significant widening (or narrowing) of inequalities were observed from childhood to adulthood. A decrease in consumption of SSB and an increase in consumption of ASB from childhood to adulthood were found.

204,204,33450094,"The prevalence of obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in children is dramatically increasing at the same time as consumption of foods with a high sugar content. Intake of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is a possible aetiology as it is thought to be more lipogenic than glucose. In a mouse model, HFCS intake during adolescence increased fat mass and hepatic lipid levels in male and female mice. However, only males showed impaired glucose tolerance. Multiple metabolites including lipids, bile acids, carbohydrates and amino acids were altered in liver in a sex-specific manner at 6 weeks of age. Some of these changes were also present in adulthood even though HFCS exposure ended at 6 weeks. HFCS significantly altered the gut microbiome, which was associated with changes in key microbial metabolites. These results suggest that HFCS intake during adolescence has profound metabolic changes that are linked to changes in the microbiome and these changes are sex-specific. The rapid increase in obesity, diabetes and fatty liver disease in children over the past 20 years has been linked to increased consumption of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), making it essential to determine the short- and long-term effects of HFCS during this vulnerable developmental window. We hypothesized that HFCS exposure during adolescence significantly impairs hepatic metabolic signalling pathways and alters gut microbial composition, contributing to changes in energy metabolism with sex-specific effects. C57bl/6J mice with free access to HFCS during adolescence (3-6 weeks of age) underwent glucose tolerance and body composition testing and hepatic metabolomics, gene expression and triglyceride content analysis at 6 and 30 weeks of age (n = 6-8 per sex). At 6 weeks HFCS-exposed mice had significant increases in fat mass, glucose intolerance, hepatic triglycerides (females) and de novo lipogenesis gene expression (ACC, DGAT, FAS, ChREBP, SCD, SREBP, CPT and PPARα) with sex-specific effects. At 30 weeks, HFCS-exposed mice also had abnormalities in glucose tolerance (males) and fat mass (females). HFCS exposure enriched carbohydrate, amino acid, long chain fatty acid and secondary bile acid metabolism at 6 weeks with changes in secondary bile metabolism at 6 and 30 weeks. Microbiome studies performed immediately before and after HFCS exposure identified profound shifts of microbial species in male mice only. In summary, short-term HFCS exposure during adolescence induces fatty liver, alters important metabolic pathways, some of which continue to be altered in adulthood, and changes the microbiome in a sex-specific manner.

Frequencies were compared by meal occasion (lunch vs. snack) using the Fisher exact test. Most (60%) directors reported serving 2% milk to children ≥3 years; 31% served whole milk. Menu analysis demonstrated the composition of lunches differed from snacks (p<0.0001) in all food categories.

The study used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and 12,942 children were included. The main outcome measure was behavioural problems, measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). SDQ scores were available at 81 and 97 months of age. Child-based dietary data were collected at 81 months by food frequency questionnaire; from this a 'junk food' score was derived, and mean weekly non-milk extrinsic sugar (NMES) intake estimated. Statistical analyses examined the associations between dietary exposures at 81 months and SDQ outcomes at 97 months. Children with SDQ scores suggesting behavioural problems at baseline were excluded in order to identify new cases. Adjustments were made for potential confounders such as socioeconomic status. Unadjusted analyses suggested associations between the 'junk food' score at 81 months and both total difficulties and pro-social behaviour at 97 months. However, adjustment for baseline SDQ scores attenuated these associations, with confidence intervals including the null for both total difficulties (OR (95% CI): 1.05 (0.92, 1.21); P=0.45) and pro-social behaviour (1.13 (1.00, 1.26); P=0.04).

211,211,22192774,"High consumption of sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) has been linked to unhealthy weight gain and nutrition related chronic disease. Intake of SSB among children remains high in spite of public health efforts to reduce consumption, including restrictions on marketing to children and limitations on the sale of these products in many schools. Much extant literature on Australian SSB consumption is out-dated and lacks information on several key issues. We sought to address this using a contemporary Australian dataset to examine purchase source, consumption pattern, dietary factors, and demographic profile of SSB consumption in children. Data were from the 2007 Australian National Children's Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey, a representative random sample of 4,834 Australian children aged 2-16 years. Mean SSB intake by type, location and source was calculated and logistic regression models were fitted to determine factors associated with different levels of consumption. SSB consumption was high and age-associated differences in patterns of consumption were evident. Over 77% of SSB consumed was purchased via supermarkets and 60% of all SSB was consumed in the home environment. Less than 17% of SSB was sourced from school canteens and fast food establishments. Children whose parents had lower levels of education consumed more SSB on average, while children whose parents had higher education levels were more likely to favour sweetened juices and flavoured milks. SSB intake by Australian children remains high and warrants continued public health attention. Evidence based and age-targeted interventions, which also recognise supermarkets as the primary source of SSB, are recommended to reduce SSB consumption among children. Additionally, education of parents and children regarding the health consequences of high consumption of both carbonated and non-carbonated SSBs is required.

212,212,15003136,"It is debated whether the intake of added sugar displaces micronutrient-rich foods and dilutes the nutrient density of the diet, and whether there is a link between sugar and the increased rate of obesity. The objectives of this study were to examine the effect of added sugar on the intakes of energy, micronutrients, fruit and vegetables, and to examine the association between intake of added sugar and age, sex, body mass index, physical activity, inactivity and parents' education. Participants recorded their food intake in pre-coded food diaries for 4 days and filled in a questionnaire about physical activity, watching television (TV)/using a personal computer (PC) and parents' education. Three hundred and ninety-one 4-year-olds, 810 students in the 4th grade (9 years old) and 1005 in the 8th grade (13 years old) were included in the study. The intakes of all nutrients, except alpha-tocopherol among 4-year-olds and vitamin C among 4-year-olds and 4th graders, decreased with increasing content of added sugar in the diet. Moreover, high consumers of added sugar had a 30-40% lower intake of fruit and vegetables than did low consumers. A negative association was observed between consumption of added sugar and body mass index among girls in the 8th grade (P=0.013), whereas a positive association was observed among 4-year-old boys (P=0.055). Associations between physical activity, hours spent watching TV/using a PC, parents' education and the energy intake from added sugar varied in the different age groups. This study showed a negative association between the intake of added sugar and intakes of micronutrients, fruit and vegetables. The negative association between sugar intake and intake of fruit and vegetables is important from a public health perspective, since one of the main health messages today is to increase current intake of fruit and vegetables.

Given the increased use of flavored tobacco products, it is vital to understand if flavored products are associated with dual and poly tobacco product use. Data were obtained from the 2017 National Youth Tobacco Survey. Participants were 2042 adolescent past 30-day tobacco users. Multivariable multinomial logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between flavored tobacco use and past 30-day single, dual, and poly (three or more) tobacco product use. Two analyses were conducted using different categories as referent groups to allow for a comprehensive examination of the relationship between all groups. Covariates included sex, grade level, race/ethnicity and exposure to tobacco marketing. Approximately half of all adolescent tobacco users (45.7%) reported use of more than one product. The majority of adolescent tobacco users reported using flavors (69.4%). Flavored tobacco use was significantly correlated with a greater risk of dual (RRR: 2.09) and poly (RRR: 5.54) tobacco use, relative to single product use, controlling for covariates. Similarly, flavored tobacco use was significantly correlated with a greater risk of poly (RRR: 2.66) tobacco use, relative to dual tobacco use, controlling for covariates. A positive relationship was observed for flavored tobacco use and multiple tobacco product use. Findings suggest the need to consider stronger regulations of flavored tobacco products.

215,215,23763695,"Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are the single largest source of added sugar and the top source of energy intake in the U.S. diet. In this review, we evaluate whether there is sufficient scientific evidence that decreasing SSB consumption will reduce the prevalence of obesity and its related diseases. Because prospective cohort studies address dietary determinants of long-term weight gain and chronic diseases, whereas randomized clinical trials (RCTs) typically evaluate short-term effects of specific interventions on weight change, both types of evidence are critical in evaluating causality. Findings from well-powered prospective cohorts have consistently shown a significant association, established temporality and demonstrated a direct dose-response relationship between SSB consumption and long-term weight gain and risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). A recently published meta-analysis of RCTs commissioned by the World Health Organization found that decreased intake of added sugars significantly reduced body weight (0.80 kg, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39-1.21; P < 0.001), whereas increased sugar intake led to a comparable weight increase (0.75 kg, 0.30-1.19; P = 0.001). A parallel meta-analysis of cohort studies also found that higher intake of SSBs among children was associated with 55% (95% CI 32-82%) higher risk of being overweight or obese compared with those with lower intake. Another meta-analysis of eight prospective cohort studies found that one to two servings per day of SSB intake was associated with a 26% (95% CI 12-41%) greater risk of developing T2D compared with occasional intake (less than one serving per month). Recently, two large RCTs with a high degree of compliance provided convincing data that reducing consumption of SSBs significantly decreases weight gain and adiposity in children and adolescents. Taken together, the evidence that decreasing SSBs will decrease the risk of obesity and related diseases such as T2D is compelling. Several additional issues warrant further discussion. First, prevention of long-term weight gain through dietary changes such as limiting consumption of SSBs is more important than short-term weight loss in reducing the prevalence of obesity in the population. This is due to the fact that once an individual becomes obese, it is difficult to lose weight and keep it off. Second, we should consider the totality of evidence rather than selective pieces of evidence (e.g. from short-term RCTs only). Finally, while recognizing that the evidence of harm on health against SSBs is strong, we should avoid the trap of waiting for absolute proof before allowing public health action to be taken.

We examined the relationship between perceived ease of flavored e-cigarette use and e-cigarette use susceptibility and progression among a nationally representative sample of U.S. youth never tobacco users. The wave 1 (2013-2014) and wave 2 (2014-2015) surveys of PATH Study were used. Youth never tobacco users (ages 12-17) who reported whether flavored e-cigarettes were easier to use than unflavored e-cigarettes at wave 1 (n = 6,983) were included in the study. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to examine the associations between perceived ease of using flavored e-cigarettes (wave 1) and e-cigarette use outcomes including e-cigarette use susceptibility (wave 1) and e-cigarette initiation and past-30-day use (wave 2). Overall, 21.2% of the sample perceived flavored e-cigarettes easier to use than unflavored e-cigarettes; and 28.9% of the sample were susceptible to using e-cigarettes at wave 1, and 7.5% and 2.0% initiated e-cigarettes and used e-cigarettes in the past 30 days at wave 2, respectively. Among those who perceived flavored e-cigarettes easier to use, 41.0% were susceptible to using e-cigarettes at wave 1, and 10.6% and 3.4% initiated and used e-cigarettes in the past 30 days at wave 2, respectively.

In experiment 1, the treatment consisted of an ice slurry of strawberry Kool-Aid containing 1.75 g/kg of carbohydrate (polycose) plus either aspartame (34 mg/kg) or the equivalent sweetness as sodium cyclamate and amino acids as alanine. In experiment 2, the treatment consisted of a drink of cold unsweetened strawberry Kool-Aid, containing either 1.75 g/kg of sucrose or 9.7 mg/kg of aspartame. Measures of associative learning, arithmetic calculation, activity level, social interaction, and mood were unaffected by treatment in experiment 1. In experiment 2, the only significant treatment effect was that on the frequency of minor and gross motor behaviors, which were less frequent after the consumption of sucrose than after aspartame. Thus, the effect of aspartame on the short-term behavior of healthy 9- to 10-year-old children appears to be related to its absence of metabolic consequences rather than to its amino acid composition and putative neurochemical impact.

As part of the Victorian Child Health and Wellbeing study, a random sample of 4602 caregivers of children completed an interview during a single telephone interview in 2006. Caregivers reported on their child's consumption of three types of unhealthy foods and beverages, and responses were recoded into weekly consumption of potato crisps and chips, monthly consumption of takeaway foods, and daily consumption of sweet beverages. Family functioning included general functioning (α = 0.89) and parental psychological distress (α = 0.78). Consumption of potato crisps and chips occurred, on average, twice a week, while takeaway foods were consumed an average of three times per month. Consistently and controlling for other covariates, male caregivers had children who consumed takeaway foods more frequently and who drank more daily cups of sweet beverages. Caregiver education and living in a single-parent household were consistently associated with poorer eating habits. In all models, general family functioning and parental psychological distress were associated with poorer eating habits. In addition to traditional methods for improving diet, family-based interventions need to target more general aspects of the family's and caregiver's functioning to improve dietary intake.

Erythritol is a permeant of Plasmodium falciparum aquaglyceroporin (PfAQP) which is a multifunctional channel responsible for maintaining hydro-homeostasis. We show that erythritol effectively inhibited growth and progression of asexual blood stage malaria parasite, and effect invasion and egress processes. It also inhibited the liver stage (sporozoites) and transmission stage parasite (gametocytes) development. Interestingly, erythritol inhibited in vivo growth of malaria parasite in mouse experimental model. It was more effective in inhibiting parasite growth both in vivo and in vitro when tested together with a known anti-malarial 'artesunate'. Additionally, erythritol showed cytokine-modulating effect which suggests its direct effect on the host immune system. Ammonia detection assay demonstrated that erythritol uptake effects the amount of ammonia release across the parasite. Our functional complementation assays suggest that PfAQP expression in yeast mutant restores its growth in hyperosmotic conditions but showed reduced growth in the presence of erythritol. Osmotic lysis assay suggests that erythritol creates osmotic stress for killing the parasite. Overall, our data bestow erythritol as a promising lead compound with an attractive antimalarial profile and could possibly be combined with known drugs without losing its efficacy.

Exercise-driven effects on glucose metabolism depend strongly on duration and intensity of the activity, and are highly variable between patients. In-silico evaluation can support the development of improved treatment strategies, and can facilitate personalized treatment optimization. This requires models of the glucose-insulin system that capture relevant exercise-related processes. We developed a model of glucose-insulin regulation that describes changes in glucose metabolism for aerobic moderate- to high-intensity PA of short and prolonged duration. In particular, we incorporated the insulin-independent increase in glucose uptake and production, including glycogen depletion, and the prolonged rise in insulin sensitivity. The model further includes meal absorption and insulin kinetics, allowing simulation of everyday scenarios. The model accurately predicts glucose dynamics for varying PA scenarios in a range of independent validation data sets, and full-day simulations with PA of different timing, duration and intensity agree with clinical observations. We personalized the model on data from a multi-day free-living study of children with T1D by adjusting a small number of model parameters to each child. To assess the use of the personalized models for individual treatment evaluation, we compared subject-specific treatment options for PA management in replay simulations of the recorded data with altered meal, insulin and PA inputs.

Recommendations for limiting caries in these children include: where possible, taking the medicine in tablet form; brushing with toothpaste or chewing sugar-free gum after taking the medicine; home and dental-office fluoride applications; where possible, taking medicines at meal-times rather than between meals; avoiding ingestion of the medicine before bed; and seeking regular preventive dental care. Awareness of the danger posed by these medications should be promoted among prescribers, pharmacists, manufacturers, regulatory authorities, and the public in order to bring about increased availability and use of sugar-free liquid medicines.

226,226,36368682,"The consumption of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) has been increasing in recent decades, especially among children. Some reports suggest that children and adolescents are more sensitive to the adverse effects of fructose intake than adults. However, the underlying mechanism of the difference in vulnerability between adolescence and adulthood have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the different effects of HFCS intake at different growth stages in rats: childhood and adolescence (postnatal day (PD) 21-60), young adulthood (PD60-100), and adulthood (PD100-140). Since alterations in hepatic glucocorticoid (GC) metabolism can cause diseases including insulin resistance, we focused on GC metabolizing enzymes such as 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (Hsd11b1 and Hsd11b2) and steroid 5 alpha-reductase 1 (Srd5a1). Western blotting showed an increase in Hsd11b1 expression and a decrease in Hsd11b2 expression in childhood and adolescence but not in adulthood. We also observed changes in Hsd11b1 and Hsd11b2 activities only in childhood and adolescence, consistent with the results of mRNA and protein expression analysis. The effect of high-fructose intake with regards to GC metabolism may therefore vary with developmental stage. This study provides insight into the adverse effects of fructose on GC metabolism in children in the context of increasing rates of HFCS consumption.

The meeting was science-based but policy-oriented. The role and amount of healthy and unhealthy fats, with attention to the relative content of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, sugar, and particularly fructose in foods that may underlie the epidemics of non-communicable diseases (NCD's) worldwide were extensively discussed. The report concludes that sugar consumption, especially in the form of high energy fructose in soft drinks, poses a major and insidious health threat, especially in children, and most diets, although with regional differences, are deficient in omega-3 fatty acids and too high in omega-6 fatty acids. Gene-nutrient interactions in growth and development and in disease prevention are fundamental to health, therefore regional Centers on Genetics, Nutrition and Fitness for Health should be established worldwide. Heads of state and government must elevate, as a matter of urgency, Nutrition as a national priority, that access to a healthy diet should be considered a human right and that the lead responsibility for Nutrition should be placed in Ministries of Health rather than agriculture so that the health requirements drive agricultural priorities, not vice versa.

Prospective research on whether the intake of soft drinks containing caffeine, a modulator of the female reproductive axis, is associated with risk of early menarche is sparse. We examined the hypothesis that consumption of caffeinated soft drinks in childhood is associated with higher risk of early menarche. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Growth and Health Study recruited and enrolled 2379 (1213 African American, 1166 Caucasian) girls aged 9-10 y (from Richmond, CA; Cincinnati, OH; and Washington, DC) and followed them for 10 y. After exclusions were made, there were 1988 girls in whom we examined prospective associations between consumption of caffeinated and noncaffeinated sugar- and artificially sweetened soft drinks and early menarche (defined as menarche age <11 y). We also examined associations between intakes of caffeine, sucrose, fructose, and aspartame and early menarche. Incident early menarche occurred in 165 (8.3%) of the girls. After adjustment for confounders and premenarcheal percentage body fat, greater consumption of caffeinated soft drinks was associated with a higher risk of early menarche (RR for 1 serving/d increment: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.22, 1.79). Consumption of artificially sweetened soft drinks was also positively associated with risk of early menarche (RR for 1 serving/d increment: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.88). Consumption of noncaffeinated soft drinks was not significantly associated with early menarche (RR for 1 serving/d increment: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.62, 1.25); nor was consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks (RR for 1 serving/d increment: 1.15; 95% CI: 0.95, 1.39).

The objective was to assess the effects of BF and SSB intake on the prevalence of overweight and obesity in Hispanic toddlers. Nutrition data were collected via phone surveys with caregivers of 1483 Hispanic children (2-4 y of age) from the Los Angeles County Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program. BF history at 2-4 y of age was categorized as follows: no BF, >1 wk to <6 mo BF, 6 to <12 mo BF, and ≥12 mo BF. SSB intake at 2-4 y of age was categorized as follows: high SSB (≥2 SSBs/d), mid SSB (1 SSB/d), and no SSB. The height and weight of the children were measured by WIC staff and stored in the Integrated Statewide Information System. Binary logistic regressions assessed the effects of BF and SSB categories on overweight and obesity prevalence. In comparison with the no-BF participants, the odds of obesity were lower in the ≥12-mo-BF participants (OR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.83; P = 0.004).

Multivariable logistic regression explored the relationship between MCU, marijuana, and dependence. Linear and quadratic trends were assessed using logistic regression with orthogonal polynomials. Past month marijuana/MCU among cigarette smokers was 8.3% in 2013-2014. Overall, marijuana/MCU was significantly higher among blacks versus whites (20.8% vs. 5.8%, p < .0001), though among 12-25 year olds, prevalence was significantly higher among whites versus blacks (6.3% vs. 0.9% for 12-17-year-olds; 39.2% vs. 26.8% for 18-25-year-olds).

Added sugars intakes were estimated from CCHS data by categorizing the sugars content of food groups as either added or naturally occurring. Added sugars accounted for approximately half of total sugars consumed. Annual availability data were obtained from Statistics Canada CANSIM database. Estimates for added sugars were obtained by summing the availability of ""sugars and syrups"" with availability of ""soft drinks"" (proxy for high fructose corn syrup) and adjusting for waste. Analysis of both survey and availability data suggests that added sugars average 11%-13% of total energy intake.

When comparing meals, we found 42% of caloric compensation for breakfast, no caloric compensation for lunch and zero to 22% of caloric compensation for dinner, differing by household per capita income. In conclusion, SSB consumption contributed to higher energy intake due to weak caloric compensation. Discouraging the intake of SSB especially during lunch and dinner may help reduce excessive energy intake and lead to better weight management.

243,243,27876025,"The widespread use of in-store marketing strategies to induce unhealthy impulsive purchases has implications for shopping experience, food choice and possibly adverse health outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine consumer attitudes and evaluate sales effects of a healthy checkout supermarket intervention. The study was part of Project Sundhed & Lokalsamfund (Project SoL); a Danish participatory community-based health promotion intervention. Consumer attitudes towards unhealthy snack exposure in supermarkets were examined in a qualitative pre-intervention study (29 short in-store interviews, 11 semi-structured interviews and three focus group interviews). Findings were presented to food retailers and informed the decision to test a healthy checkout intervention. Sugar confectionery at one checkout counter was substituted with fruit and healthy snacking items in four stores for 4 weeks. The intervention was evaluated by 48 short exit interviews on consumer perceptions of the intervention and by linear mixed model analyses of supermarket sales data from the intervention area and a matched control area. The qualitative pre-intervention study identified consumer concern and annoyance with placement and promotion of unhealthy snacks in local stores. Store managers were willing to respond to local consumer concern and a healthy checkout intervention was therefore implemented. Exit interviews found positive attitudes towards the intervention, while intervention awareness was modest. Most participants believed that the intervention could help other consumers make healthier choices, while fewer expected to be influenced by the intervention themselves. Statistical analyses suggested an intervention effect on sales of carrot snack packs when compared with sales before the intervention in Bornholm control stores (P < 0.05). No significant intervention effect on sales of other intervention items or sugar confectionery was found. The present study finds that the healthy checkout intervention was positively evaluated by consumers and provided a 'responsible' branding opportunity for supermarkets, thus representing a win-win strategy for store managers and consumers in the short term. However, the intervention was too modest to draw conclusions on long-term sales and health implications of this initiative. More research is needed to assess whether retailer-researcher collaborations on health promotion can be a winning strategy for public health.

This study evaluated mediating and modifying effects of homeostatic model assessment-based IR (HOMA-IR) on the association between sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption and a constellation of adolescent cardiometabolic abnormalities. Comprehensive data on sociodemographics, diet, physical activity, and anthropometric and biochemical parameters for 1454 adolescents were obtained from a large-scale representative study for adolescent metabolic syndrome (MetS) conducted in Taiwan. The original (HOMA1-IR) and updated nonlinear (HOMA2-IR) HOMA-IR indicators were used as IR biomarkers. Principal component (PC) analysis was employed to create reduced groups of variables and risk scores for retained PCs. Higher SSB intake was associated with higher levels of HOMA1-IR and HOMA2-IR, and the two IR biomarkers were positively correlated with metabolic dysfunction clustering. Compared with SSB nondrinkers, adolescents who consumed >500 mL/day of hand-shaken high-fructose corn syrup beverages (HHB) had a 0.22 increase in the number of abnormal MetS components, and HOMA-IR mediation explained 33.9-37.9% of the effect. IR biomarkers accounted for 26.5-31.0% of the relationship between >500 mL/day of SSB consumption and bodyweight-enhanced PC scores.

247,247,24717340,"Hypertension and dyslipidemia have traditionally been associated with dietary sodium and fat intakes, respectively; however, they have recently been associated with the consumption of added sugars in adults and older adolescents, but there is no clear indication of how early in the life span this association manifests. This study explored the cross-sectional association between added sugar (sugars not naturally occurring in foods) consumption in children, blood pressure (BP), and fasting blood lipids [triglycerides and total, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol]. BP, blood lipids, and dietary intakes were obtained in a multiethnic pediatric sample aged 7-12 y of 122 European American (EA), 106 African American (AA), 84 Hispanic American (HA), and 8 mixed-race children participating in the Admixture Mapping of Ethnic and Racial Insulin Complex Outcomes (AMERICO) study-a cross-sectional study conducted in the Birmingham, AL, metro area investigating the effects of racial-ethnic differences on metabolic and health outcomes. Multiple regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relations of added sugars and sodium intakes with BP and of added sugars and dietary fat intakes with blood lipids. Models were controlled for sex, race-ethnicity, socioeconomic status, Tanner pubertal status, percentage body fat, physical activity, and total energy intake. Added sugars were positively associated with diastolic BP (P = 0.0462, β = 0.0206) and serum triglycerides (P = 0.0206, β = 0.1090). Sodium was not significantly associated with either measure of BP nor was dietary fat with blood lipids. HA children had higher triglycerides but lower added sugar consumption than did either the AA or EA children. The AA participants had higher BP and HDL but lower triglycerides than did either the EA or HA children. These data suggest that increased consumption of added sugars may be associated with adverse cardiovascular health factors in children, specifically elevated diastolic BP and triglycerides. Identification of dietary factors influencing cardiovascular health during childhood could serve as a tool to reduce cardiovascular disease risk.

However, the role of LCSs in diabetes management and cardiometabolic health is unclear. The Diabetes Research in Kids Study (DRINK-T1D) aims to investigate effects of LCS restriction on glycemic variability, visceral adiposity, lipid profiles, and systemic inflammation among children 6-12 years old with T1D. Children with T1D, who report habitual consumption of foods and beverages containing LCSs, are recruited from the Washington Nationals Diabetes Care Complex (DCC) at Children's National Hospital (CNH) in Washington, DC. Following a phone screening and two-week run-in period involving continuation of usual LCS intake, children are randomized to 12 weeks of LCS restriction (replacement of diet beverages with still or sparkling water and avoidance of other sources of LCSs) or continued usual LCS intake (control). The primary outcome is the difference in change in glycemic variability in the LCS restriction group versus the control group. Change in glycemic variability will be assessed as the difference in daily average time-in-range (TIR), measured using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) during two weeks at the end of the 12-week intervention, compared with during the two-week run-in period prior to randomization.

Analysis of variance adjusted for region was used to compare treatment groups. Pearson partial correlations controlling for the effects of region and treatment group were used to assess the strength of sugar and fat relationships. Three years after the low fat intervention, former intervention, control and unexposed schools lunches were similar in mean total sugars (25% of calories), and ""added"" sugars (e.g. sucrose, glucose, galactose, and maltose) at 15% of calories; and differed only in their lactose content.

Se realizaron entrevistas semiestructuradas a los pediatras del primer nivel de atención de Rosario. Se incluyeron tres ejes de indagación: ""relevancia del problema"", ""práctica clínica"" y ""representaciones sobre el suplemento con hierro"". El análisis consistió en sistematizar la información obtenida mediante la transcripción de entrevistas grabadas y anotaciones. Se realizaron 32 entrevistas. Todos los entrevistados pensaban que la anemia era un problema relevante. Actualmente, se la asocia con una alimentación de mala calidad. Los hallazgos llevan a considerar que la práctica pediátrica sigue las normativas nacionales. Hay acuerdo en que la baja adherencia es un obstáculo para el manejo clínico de la anemia ferropénica. Los pediatras expresaron ideas potencialmente beneficiosas para el contexto local, que incluían la organización de talleres sobre anemia y la distribución gratuita de preparados con hierro de mejor sabor. La anemia por déficit de hierro se consideró un problema grave. En atención primaria, las intervenciones destacadas fueron la organización de talleres y el acceso a preparados con hierro de sabor más agradable.

The Danish part of the European Youth Heart Studies (EYHS) I and II. Girls and boys at 8-10 and 14-16 years from EYHS I (n 651) and 8-10-year-olds from baseline followed up 6 years later in EYHS II (n 233). Among girls, a difference in dietary total sugar of 43 g/MJ was associated with a 1 sd difference of HOMA and a difference in dietary fibre of -8 g/MJ was associated with a 1 sd difference of HOMA, independent of age, maturity and other confounders (both P = 0.03). No baseline associations were found among boys and no prospective associations were found in either sex. Dietary intake of total sugar may play an adverse role and fibre may play a beneficial role in concurrent insulin resistance among girls but not boys. Sex differences may be due to differences in maturity, physical activity, food patterns and selective reporting behaviours.

A potential reason for this is that all prior studies examined childhood body mass index (BMI) at only one timepoint and at different ages. We examined the extent to which NNS intake during pregnancy is associated with offspring BMI z-score and body fat longitudinally from birth to 18 years. A total of 1683 children from Project Viva, a prospective pre-birth cohort, were recruited from 1999 to 2002 in Massachusetts. We assessed maternal NNS intake in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Our outcomes were offspring BMI z-score, (at birth, infancy (median 6.3 months), early childhood (3.2 years), mid-childhood (7.7 years), and early adolescence (12.9 years)), sum of skinfolds (SS), fat mass index (FMI) measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry, and BMI z-score trajectory from birth to 18 years. We adjusted models for maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, age, race/ethnicity, education, parity, pre-pregnancy physical activity, smoking, and paternal BMI and education.

Based on in vitro observations, it was hypothesized that oral bacteria may rapidly respond to this environmental change by increasing the activity or expression of alkali-generating pathways, such as the urease pathway. The objective of this exploratory in vivo study was to determine the short-term effect of a brief sucrose exposure on plaque and saliva urease activity and expression, and to relate this effect to caries experience. Urease activity levels were measured in plaque and saliva samples collected from 20 children during fasting conditions and 30 min after rinsing with a sucrose solution. Streptococcus salivarius ureC-specific mRNA in saliva was quantified using real-time RT-PCR. The impact of host-related factors, such as age, gender, sugar consumption, salivary mutans streptococci levels and caries status on urease activity was evaluated. Plaque urease activity under fasting conditions was higher in subjects with low caries and mutans streptococci levels. This difference was not observed after the sucrose exposure. The response of urease to sucrose in vivo did not depend on caries experience or salivary mutans levels. Significant increase in urease activity of plaque and saliva after exposure to sucrose was observed only in the subjects who had low urease levels at baseline. The findings of this exploratory study suggest that plaque urease activity may have an important long-term influence in caries development but not during a cariogenic challenge.

264,264,20569667,"Acute otitis media (AOM) is the main reason for physician visits and antibiotic prescriptions in children. Pediatricians (Peds) are gatekeepers for services and sources of information for families. The 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics/American Academy of Family Physicians (AAP/AAFP) Clinical Practice Guideline: Diagnosis and Management of Acute Otitis Media recommended preventative and management measures for Peds' practice. Treatments for AOM (antimicrobial therapy and surgery) sometimes have questionable effectiveness, risks, and high costs. Thus, Peds should consider using prophylactics for AOM that are easy to administer, cost-effective, and have minimal side effects. Xylitol, a naturally occurring sugar alcohol, is widely used to prevent AOM and for other health conditions in Europe, and as a dental caries prophylaxis in the United States. It would be helpful to know Peds' attitudes and practices to identify barriers to xylitol's use as a prophylaxis for AOM in the United States. To conduct a national survey of Peds in the United States to evaluate how closely they adhered to the AAP/AAFP guideline, and their knowledge and opinions about xylitol use. A randomized, national postal survey. A 48-item questionnaire developed for this study was mailed to a random sample of 506 Peds within the United States during spring 2009. It assessed Peds' demographics, adherence to the guideline, and knowledge and opinions about and use of xylitol as a prophylaxis for AOM in children. The questionnaire response rate was 22% (98 useable/506 mailed - 63 returned undeliverable). Participants were about equal for gender, and almost all were in private practice for over 10 yr. Most had pediatric patients with at least one bout of AOM annually. The majority adhered to the guideline (e.g., almost all routinely assessed and managed patients' pain for AOM and encouraged prevention by recommending that families reduce risk factors). Most used and were comfortable with otoscopy for diagnosing AOM, but not tympanometry. Almost all believed that conductive hearing loss could hinder speech-language and academic development, and AOM could reduce quality of life of children. They also believed that those under 6 mo of age with AOM should receive antibacterial therapy beginning with amoxicillin but did not use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Only about half knew about medical uses for xylitol, but of those, most were aware of its use in chewing gum to prevent AOM but had not used it with patients. They were not sure of xylitol's effectiveness or appropriate dosages but cited stomach cramping and diarrhea as possible side effects. Most would use xylitol if evidence supported it and wanted information about it via reprints or electronically. Few agreed that audiologists are important in diagnosing/managing AOM. Most of these Peds adhered to the AAP/AAFP guideline. They were not using CAMs like xylitol for preventing AOM in children. Future research should focus on prevention and the use of xylitol as a possible prophylaxis regimen for AOM in patients.

The purpose of the current study was to identify risk factors such as birth weight, breast-feeding, dietary patterns, family history of obesity and sedentary behaviours that are possibly associated with paediatric obesity. Two hundred and five overweight and obese children (OW/OB; group 1) aged 7-15 years from eight primary and secondary schools and a control group (group 2) of normal-weight children were matched for age and sex. Overweight and obesity were calculated based on the International Obesity Taskforce criteria. Lifestyle parameters as well as anthropometric data were collected in all children. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for obesity. Breast-feeding (> or =3 months) and leisure-time physical activity proved to be protector factors against obesity (OR = 0.21, 95 % CI 0.11, 0.79, P < 0.001 and OR = 0.87, 95 % CI 0.85, 0.89, P < 0.001 respectively).

One hundred thirty-five preschool-aged children, living in rural American Indian communities, provided diet and physical activity data before participating in a 2-year randomized healthy lifestyle intervention. Three 24-hour dietary recalls assessed nutrient and food and added sugar intake, which were compared to the National Academy of Science's Dietary Reference Intakes, the US Department of Agriculture's MyPyramid, and American Heart Association recommendations. Time watching television and moderate plus vigorous activity was compared to MyPyramid and American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations. Nutrient, food group, added sugar intake, and time watching television and in moderate or vigorous activity were compared to recommendations by computing the percent of recommendations met. Nonparametric tests identified differences in diet and physical activity among age groups and normal and overweight children (body mass index <85th and > or = 85th percentile). Average nutrient intakes met recommendations whereas food group intakes did not. Mean fruit and vegetable intakes for 2- to 3-year-olds were 0.36 c/day fruit and 0.45 c/day vegetables and, for 4- to 5-year-olds, 0.33 c/day fruit and 0.48 c/day vegetables.

A total of 1,944 children (still representative of the same-age children in this population) remaining at 4 to 5 years in 2002 participated in the nutrition study. Data were collected via 24-hour dietary recall interview. Frequency of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption between meals at age 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 years was recorded and children's height and weight were measured. Multivariate regression analysis was done with Statistical Analysis System software. Weighted data were adjusted for within-child variability and significance level was set at 5%. Overall, 6.9% of children who were nonconsumers of sugar-sweetened beverages between meals between the ages of 2.5 to 4.5 years were overweight at 4.5 years, compared to 15.4% of regular consumers (four to six times or more per week) at ages 2.5 years, 3.5 years, and 4.5 years. According to multivariate analysis, sugar-sweetened beverage consumption between meals more than doubles the odds of being overweight when other important factors are considered in multivariate analysis. Children from families with insufficient income who consume sugar-sweetened beverages regularly between the ages of 2.5 and 4.5 years are more than three times more likely to be overweight at age 4.5 years compared to nonconsuming children from sufficient income households. Regular sugar-sweetened beverage consumption between meals may put some young children at a greater risk for overweight. Parents should limit the quantity of sweetened beverages consumed during preschool years because it may increase propensity to gain weight.

275,275,38412182,"Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni water extracts have been used as a natural sweetener and customary medicine by the indigenous inhabitants of South America for several hundred years. This plant was sent to Europe in the 16th century and was described by Peter Jacob Esteve in Spain. Recently the food industry has started to employ S. rebaudiana as sweetener using its glycosides after purification. Advertisement claims that Stevia glycosides is good for controling body mass and reducing glycemia. This study's objective was to evaluate the effect of S. rebaudiana leaf extract on Wistar rats as animal model to prove its effectiveness on body mass control, glycemia reduction, and other biochemical parameters. Three groups were randomly formed with 24 males and 24 females: A blank group without any sweetener, a control group drinking water with 10% glucose, and the test group ingesting a 0.94% water extract of S. rebaudiana. Body mass measurements as well as food and drink consumption were daily performed. The experiment lasted 120 days after the specimens were weaned and got used to eating solid food. Euthanasia was done and blood serum was collected to evaluate the following biochemical parameters: Glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin, glucagon, leptin, ghrelin, and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, GIP. Results indicated that only female rats had statistical differences in body mass gain. No relevant effects either positive or negative were found in the biochemical parameters measured. The crude extracts of S. rebaudiana did not show any relevant changes in biochemical and hormonal profiles, changes nor body mass with respect to the blank and control groups of young and healthy rats in the age range of infancy to youth. According to the results obtained, the therapeutic properties that have been associated to S. rebaudiana consumption especially for body mass control and glycemia reduction, did not occur in young and healthy male and female rats in equivalent age to infants, young children, and youths.

In a pilot set-up, saliva samples were collected from 15 healthy adults and the uptake of xylitol was compared with a specific assay determining xylitol-sensitive MS. The main study consisted of 109 schoolchildren (mean age 9.9 years) who volunteered after informed consent. The children were randomly allocated to a test or control group. The control group was given two pellets containing sorbitol and maltitol 3 times daily for 4 weeks and the test group received identical pellets with xylitol as single sweetener (total dose 6.2 g/day). Saliva samples were collected at baseline, after 4 weeks and 6 months after the intervention. The outcome measures were MS and total viable counts, proportion of MS and salivary uptake of [14C]-xylitol. The pilot study disclosed a fair positive correlation (p < 0.05) between the assays. The proportions of MS and salivary xylitol uptake decreased significantly in the xylitol group by 60% and 30% respectively after 4 weeks compared to baseline which was in contrast to the sorbitol/maltitol group (p < 0.05). Six months after the intervention, the outcome measures did not differ significantly from baseline in any of the groups.

We examined the actions taken between 2010 and early 2016 - by civil society groups, the World Health Organization (WHO) and its regional offices, other United Nations (UN) organizations, philanthropic institutions and transnational industries - to help decrease the prevalence of obesity and diet-related noncommunicable diseases among young people. By providing relevant technical and policy guidance and tools to Member States, WHO and other UN organizations have helped protect young people from the marketing of branded food and beverage products that are high in fat, sugar and/or salt. The progress achieved by the other actors we investigated appears variable and generally less robust. We suggest that the progress being made towards the full implementation of Resolution WHA63.14 would be accelerated by further restrictions on the marketing of unhealthy food and beverage products and by investing in the promotion of nutrient-dense products. This should help young people meet government-recommended dietary targets. Any effective strategies and actions should align with the goal of WHO to reduce premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases by 25% by 2025 and the aim of the UN to ensure healthy lives for all by 2030.

Se examinaron las medidas tomadas entre 2010 y principios de 2016 por parte de grupos de la sociedad civil, la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) y sus sedes regionales, otras organizaciones de las Naciones Unidas, instituciones filantrópicas e industrias transnacionales para contribuir a la reducción de la prevalencia de la obesidad y enfermedades no contagiosas relacionadas con la alimentación entre los jóvenes. Mediante las directrices y herramientas políticas y técnicas correspondientes ofrecidas a los Estados Miembros, la OMS y otras organizaciones de las Naciones Unidas han ayudado a proteger a los jóvenes de la promoción de productos alimentarios y bebidas de marca con elevadas cantidades de grasa, azúcar y/o sal. Los progresos realizados por los otros participantes investigados parecen ser desiguales y, en general, menos sólidos. Nuestra sugerencia es que el progreso hacia la implementación completa de la Resolución WHA63.14 se acelere limitando aún más la promoción de productos alimentarios y bebidas insanos y se invierta en la promoción de productos altamente nutritivos. Esto debería ayudar a los jóvenes a alcanzar los objetivos nutricionales recomendados por los gobiernos.

281,281,21232693,"Waterpipe tobacco smoking is a centuries old practice, influenced by cultural tradition in Eastern Mediterranean countries, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It historically has been an activity enjoyed primarily by men. In the past 2 decades, however, this method of tobacco smoking has increased in popularity in other parts of the world, including the USA. Growing interest in this form of smoking can be traced, in part, to the advent of a flavored tobacco, called maassel. The combination of flavoring agents and the paraphernalia itself used in the smoking process, along with its mystic appeal, novelty, affordability, and the social atmosphere in which smoking often occurs, has made waterpipe smoking attractive to women as well as men, cigarette smokers and nonsmokers alike, and particular groups, including persons of college age and younger adolescents. Although waterpipe smoking is perceived by its new generation of users to be less addictive and hazardous to health than cigarette smoking, researchers draw diametrically opposed conclusions. Research demonstrates that numerous toxic agents, including carcinogens, heavy metals, other particulate matter, and high levels of nicotine, are efficiently delivered through waterpipes. Moreover, sidestream smoke exposes others in the vicinity of waterpipe smokers to the risk of respiratory diseases and other conditions. In addition, persons sharing waterpipe mouthpieces may share infectious agents as well. Waterpipe tobacco smoking has been declared a public health problem by the World Health Organization and other authorities. Recognition of the deleterious effects of waterpipe smoking has led to initial attempts to expand regulatory control. Because waterpipe tobacco is not directly burned in the smoking process, many existing control measures do not apply. Public health authorities should monitor waterpipe tobacco use carefully. Finally, pediatricians and other healthcare providers should discourage experimentation and continued use among their adolescent patients.

Data on the children's dietary pattern (frequency of sweet foods, fatty foods, snacks, fruit and vegetables) was collected with a food frequency questionnaire. Multilevel time modelling was used with adjustments for sex, age, body mass index, parental education and wake up time. Higher overall cortisol levels and a large cortisol awakening response (CAR) were associated with more frequent consumption of sweet foods. A steeper diurnal cortisol decline was associated with a higher sweet, fatty and snack food consumption frequency. No associations with fruit and vegetables consumption were found. High cortisol levels were linked to an unhealthier dietary pattern (more fatty food, snacks and especially sweet food).

This paper describes associations between patterns of television viewing, on one hand, and diet, taste preference and weight status, on the other, in European preschoolers and schoolchildren. The IDEFICS baseline survey was conducted at examination centers in Italy, Estonia, Cyprus, Belgium, Sweden, Germany, Hungary, and Spain. 15,144 children aged 2-9 completed the basic protocol, including anthropometry and parental questionnaires on their diets and television habits. A subsample of 1,696 schoolchildren underwent further sensory testing for fat and sweet taste preferences. Three dichotomous indicators described: children's habitual television exposure time; television viewing during meals; and having televisions in their bedrooms. Based on these variables we investigated television habits in relation to overweight (IOTF) and usual consumption of foods high in fat and sugar. A possible role of taste preference in the latter association was tested in the sensory subgroup. All television indicators were significantly associated with increased risk of overweight, with odds ratios ranging from 1.21 to 1.30, in fully adjusted models. Children's propensities to consume high-fat and high-sugar foods were positively and, in most analyses, monotonically associated with high-risk television behaviors. The associations between television and diet propensities were not explained by preference for added fat or sugar in test foods. To summarize, in addition to being more overweight, children with high-risk television behaviors may, independent of objectively measured taste preferences for fat and sugar, passively overconsume higher-fat and particularly higher-sugar diets.

Pearson's χ2 and 95 % CI were used to test differences across clusters. Data from the Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 2·2. Children aged 2-18 years with plausible energy intake and complete sociodemographic data (n 10 038) were grouped into the following categories: 2-5-year-old boys and girls, 6-11-year-old girls, 6-11-year-old boys, 12-18-year-old girls and 12-18-year-old boys. Five beverage clusters emerged for children aged 2-5 years, six clusters for children aged 6-11 years (both sexes) and four clusters for those aged 12-18 years (both sexes). Sweetened beverage clusters appeared in all age-sex groups. Intakes of sweetened beverages ranged from 553 to 1059 g/d and contributed between 2 % and 18 % of total energy intake. Girls 6-11 years of age in the 'soft drink' cluster had lower Ca intake compared with other clusters in that age-sex group. Age and ethnicity differed across clusters for most age-sex groups. Differences for household food security status and income were found; however, no pattern emerged. Patterns in beverage intake among Canadian children include beverages that are predominantly sugar sweetened. Public health nutrition professionals can use knowledge about beverage patterns among children, as well as the characteristics of these groups, in the development of nutritional programmes and policies.

This study was undertaken to further elicit the natural history of this condition and the presence of concomitant reactive airways disease through clinical profiling and pulmonary function testing. Twenty-one children diagnosed with TBM by bronchoscopy between 1998 and 2001 in Queensland were recruited in 2008. Parents completed a questionnaire detailing their child's respiratory symptoms over the previous 12 months. Children then undertook pulmonary function and flow-volume loop classification. Mannitol bronchial provocation testing or post-bronchodilator spirometry was performed to assess for the confounding presence of reactive airways disease. Data from 19 children (12 males) were able to be analyzed. The median age was 9.4 (range 7.6-14.3) years. 15 parents indicated their child's symptoms were unresolved. The mean FEV(1) was 81% predicted with 7 <80% predicted. This was significantly lower than the percent predicted population mean (P = 0.0005).

The purpose of this report is to review the current published evidence regarding the relationship between sugar substitutes and dental caries. A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE and EMBASE and included studies published from 1966 to 2001. Studies that included human subjects and were published in English were included in this review. A total of fourteen clinical studies were reviewed that evaluated the effect of sorbitol or xylitol or the combination of both sugar substitutes on the incidence of dental caries. Most of the reports were of studies conducted with children outside of the United States. These studies demonstrated a consistent decrease in dental caries, ranging from 30 to 60 percent, among subjects using sugar substitutes as compared to subjects in a control group. These caries rate reductions were observed in subjects using xylitol or sorbitol as the sugar substitute in chewing gum or toothpaste. The highest caries reductions were observed in subjects using xylitol. These findings suggest that the replacement of sucrose with sorbitol and xylitol may significantly decrease the incidence of dental caries.

294,294,16608525,"Sports sponsorship is a significant marketing tool. As such, it can promote products that pose risks to health (eg, high fat and high sugar foods) or it can promote health-supporting products (eg, sporting equipment and services). However, there is a lack of data on the proportion of sponsorship associated with ""unhealthy"" and ""healthy"" products and no methodology for systematically assessing it. This research aimed to explore this proportion with an Internet survey of sports sponsorship in the New Zealand setting. A search methodology was developed to identify Internet-based evidence of sports sponsorship at the national level and at the regional and club level in one specific region (Wellington). The top eight sports for 5-17-year-olds were selected and products and services of sponsors were classified in terms of potential public health impact (using a conservative approach). Sponsorship of these popular sports was common at the national, regional and club levels (640 sponsors listed on 107 websites overall). Sports sponsorship associated with sponsors' products classified as ""unhealthy"" (eg, food high in fat and sugar, gambling and alcohol) were over twice as common as sponsorship associated with sponsors' products classified as ""healthy"" (32.7% (95% CI = 29.1, 36.5) versus 15.5% (95% CI = 12.8, 18.6) respectively). ""Gambling"" was the most common specific type of sponsorship (18.8%) followed by alcohol (11.3%). There were significantly more ""alcohol"" sponsors for rugby, compared to all the other sports collectively (rate ratio (RR) = 2.47; 95% CI = 1.60, 3.79), and for top male sports compared to female (RR = 1.83; 95% CI = 1.05, 3.18). Also there was significantly more ""unhealthy food"" sponsorship for touch rugby and for ""junior"" teams/clubs compared to other sports collectively (RR = 6.54; 95% CI = 2.07, 20.69; and RR = 14.72, 95% CI = 6.22, 34.8; respectively). A validation study gave an inter-rater reliability for number of sponsors of 95% (n = 87 sponsors), and an inter-rater reliability of classification and categorisation of 100%. This study found that the sponsorship of popular sports for young people is dominated by ""unhealthy"" sponsorship (ie, predominantly gambling, alcohol and unhealthy food) relative to ""healthy"" sponsorship.

Reducing dietary energy density is an important strategy to address obesity, but few studies have examined the effect of nutrition policies on children's energy density. The study's objective was to assess the impact of the Texas Public School Nutrition Policy on children's energy density by using a pre- and post-policy evaluation. Analysis of variance/covariance and nonparametric tests compared energy density after the Texas policy change to intakes at baseline. Two years of lunch food records were collected from middle school students in Southeast Texas at three public middle schools: baseline (2001-2002) and 1 year after implementation of the Texas Policy (2005-2006). Students recorded the amount and source of foods consumed. The Texas Public School Nutrition Policy was designed to promote a healthy school environment by restricting portion sizes of high-fat and high-sugar snacks and sweetened beverages, fat content of foods, and serving of high-fat vegetables like french fries. Energy density (kcal/g): energy density-1 was the energy of foods only (no beverages) divided by the gram weight and has been previously associated with obesity and insulin resistance; energy density-2 included all food and beverages to give a complete assessment of all sources of calories. Following implementation of the Texas policy, students' energy density-1 significantly decreased from 2.80+/-1.08 kcal/g to 2.17+/-0.78 kcal/g (P<0.0001). Similarly, energy density-2 significantly decreased from 1.38+/-0.76 kcal/g to 1.29+/-0.53 kcal/g (P<0.0001). In conclusion, the Texas Public School Nutrition Policy was associated with desirable reductions in energy density, which suggests improved nutrient intake as a result of student school lunch consumption.

The present study aims to compare the effect of using different input variables on the patterns extracted using PCA on 3-d diet diary data collected from 7473 children, aged 10 years, in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Four options were examined: weight consumed of each food group (g/d), energy-adjusted weight, percentage contribution to energy of each food group and binary intake (consumed/not consumed). Four separate PCA were performed, one for each intake measurement. Three or four dietary patterns were obtained from each analysis, with at least one component that described 'more healthy' and 'less healthy' diets and one component that described a diet with high consumption of meat, potatoes and vegetables. There were no obvious differences between the patterns derived using percentage energy as a measurement and adjusting weight for total energy intake, compared to those derived using gram weights. Using binary input variables yielded a component that loaded positively on reduced fat and reduced sugar foods. The present results suggest that food intakes quantified by gram weights or as binary variables both resulted in meaningful dietary patterns and each method has distinct advantages: weight takes into account the amount of each food consumed and binary intake appears to describe general food preferences, which are potentially easier to modify and useful in public health settings.

301,301,26777597,"Sugar-sweetened beverages are a major source of free sugar intake in both children and adults, and are an important contributor to obesity and obesity-related diseases, including type 2 diabetes. We proposed an incremental and stepwise reduction in free sugars added to sugar-sweetened beverages by 40% over 5 years without the use of artificial sweeteners and assessed the effect of the proposed strategy on energy intake and weight status. In this modelling study, we used nationally representative data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey rolling programme (NDNS RP) from 2008-12 and British Soft Drinks Association annual reports to calculate sugar-sweetened beverage consumption (both with and without fruit juices) and its contribution to free sugar and energy intake in the UK population. We then estimated the predicted reduction in energy intake resulting from the proposed strategy at an individual level. We further predicted the reduction in steady-state bodyweight for each adult using a weight loss model. By scaling up the distribution of the predicted bodyweight in the NDNS RP to the UK adult population, we estimated reductions in the number of overweight and obese adults, and the number of adults with type 2 diabetes. A 40% reduction in free sugars added to sugar-sweetened beverages over 5 years would lead to an average reduction in energy intake of 38·4 kcal per day (95% CI 36·3-40·7) by the end of the fifth year. This would lead to an average reduction in steady-state bodyweight of 1·20 kg (1·12-1·28) in adults, resulting in a reduction in the prevalence in adults of overweight by 1·0 percentage point (from 35·5% to 34·5%) and obesity by 2·1 percentage points (from 27·8% to 25·7%). This reduction would lead to a reduction of roughly 0·5 million adults from being overweight and 1 million adults from being obese, which in turn would prevent about 274,000-309,000 incident cases of obesity-related type 2 diabetes over the two decades after the predicted reduction in bodyweight is achieved. If fruit juices were excluded from the category of sugar-sweetened beverages (because of potential challenges for reformulation), the corresponding reductions in energy intake and steady-state bodyweight would be 31·0 kcal per day (95% CI 28·6-33·7) and 0·96 kg (0·88-1·04), respectively. These reductions would result in a 0·7 percentage point (0·3 million) reduction in overweight and a 1·7 percentage point (0·8 million) reduction in obesity, which would in turn prevent about 221,000-250,000 cases of type 2 diabetes over two decades after the predicted reduction in bodyweight is achieved. The predicted effect was greater in adolescents, young adults, and individuals from low-income families (who consume more sugar-sweetened beverages). An incremental reduction in free sugars added to sugar-sweetened beverages without the use of artificial sweeteners is predicted to reduce the prevalence of overweight, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. The proposed strategy should be implemented immediately, and could be used in combination with other approaches, such as taxation policies, to produce a more powerful effect. None.

The study group consisted of 11 healthy children (10-15 years) with low caries risk and the experiment had a single-blind crossover (Latin square) design. After a 2-week run-in period with a daily 4.0 g xylitol intake, the children were subjected to single-dose exposures of chewing gums with (i) paraffin (CTR; no xylitol), (ii) low-dose xylitol (LX; 2.0 g xylitol), and (iii) high-dose xylitol (HX; 6.0 g xylitol) in a randomized order separated by a washout period of 1 week. Samples of chewing-stimulated whole saliva were collected prior to and after the experimental period for determination of bacterial counts. The outcome measures were in situ plaque-pH (micro-touch method) and area under the pH curve (AUC). The AUC was significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the HX group compared to the LX and control groups during the first 5 min after chewing.

Approximately 37% of immigrant mothers used dental floss, 25% used fluoride toothpaste, and only 13.5% of them regularly visited a dentist. Less that 40% of immigrant mothers brush their children's teeth before aged one year, 45% replaced child's toothbrush within 3 months, and only half of the mothers regularly took their child to the dentist. Immigrant mothers had lower level of caries-related knowledge and attitudes than native mothers (p < .001). Compared to native group, the immigrant mothers were less likely to use of dental floss ([Adjusted odds ratio (aOR) =0.35], fluoride toothpaste (aOR = 0.29), visit a dentist in the past 2 years (aOR = 0.26), and take their children to regular dental check-up (aOR = 0.38); whereas, they were more likely to not consume sweeten beverages (aOR = 3.13). The level of caries-related knowledge, attitudes and oral health behaviors were found lower in immigrant mothers than native ones. The findings suggested cross-cultural caries prevention programs aimed at reducing immigrant-native disparities in child oral health care must be developed for these immigrant minorities.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an intervention program, including fact sheets to parents and classroom components, on intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) and screen time. Further, to explore whether potential effects and parental involvement varied by adolescents' gender, weight status (WS) and parental educational level. In total, 1465 11-year-olds participated at the pre-test and the 8 month mid-way assessment of the HEIA study. Parents (n = 349) contributed with process evaluation data. Self-reported intake of SSB was collected from the 11-year-olds assessing frequency and amount, while time used on watching TV/DVD and computer/game-use (weekday and weekend day) were assed by frequency measures. Data on awareness of the intervention and dose received were collected from parents. Covariance analyses (ANCOVA) were conducted testing for effects by gender and for moderation by WS and parental education. Time spent on TV/DVD (week p = 0.001, weekend p = 0.03) and computer/game-use (week p = 0.004, weekend p <.001), and the intake of SSB during weekend days (p = 0.04), were significantly lower among girls in the intervention group compared to the control group girls after 8 months. Girls' WS did not moderate these findings. However, no significant effects of the intervention were found for boys, but moderation effects were found for WS (week days: TV/DVD, p = 0.03 and computer/games, p = 0.02). There were no moderating effects of parental education for neither boys nor girls with respect to intake of SSB, time used for watching TV/DVD and computer/game-use. Parental awareness of the intervention was significantly higher among the parents of girls, while the parents of boys were more satisfied with the fact sheets. The preventive initiatives appeared to change behaviour in girls only. This study suggests that exploration of potential beneficial or negative effects of intervention in subgroups is important. In formative evaluation of obesity prevention studies it seems warranted to include issues related to gender, WS and parental involvement in order to enhance the effectiveness of preventive initiatives.

Adolescents are attracted to flavours; yet, surprisingly, no quantitative study has explored adolescents' perceptions of these products. To characterise the appeal of FCVs for young adolescents in Mexico. In 2015, surveys were conducted with a representative sample of Mexican middle school students (n=10 124; ages 11-16 years; mean 12.4 years). Students viewed and rated packs for FCVs and non-FCVs from major brands (Marlboro, Camel, Pall Mall), with brand names removed. For each pack, students were asked to write the brand name (ie, brand recall), to evaluate pack attractiveness, and to indicate the pack they were most interested in trying (including a 'none' option). Logistic generalised estimating equation (GEE) models regressed brand recall, pack attractiveness and interest in trying on brand and FCV (yes vs no), controlling for sociodemographics and smoking risk factors. Marlboro regular, Camel regular, Camel light and Pall Mall FCVs were most often recalled (25%, 17%, 9%, 8%). Packs for Pall Mall FCVs and Camel FCVs were most often rated as very attractive (13%, 9%, respectively) and of interest for trial (22%, 13%) along with Marlboro regular (14%). In GEE models, FCVs were independently associated with greater attractiveness (adjusted OR (AOR)=1.83, 95% CI 1.72 to 1.94) and interest in trying (AOR=1.74, 95% CI 1.54 to 1.96). Perceived pack attractiveness was also independently associated with greater interest in trying (AOR=5.63, 95% CI 4.74 to 6.68).

Sixty-three per cent (n = 19) of children had dental caries experience, much of it untreated. Mean dmft/DMFT was 4.4. Sixty per cent (n = 18) of all children presented with active or untreated caries and the care index for those at/under age 5 years was low (10%). Unfavourable dental health behaviour included: consumption of nonmilk extrinsic sugars at night, use of sugar-based medications, low fluoride intake, late commencement of toothbrushing and poor dental attendance. Dental health was not considered a priority for many of these children. Parents did not necessarily disclose their child's HIV status on dental attendance. Caries prevalence was high, much of the disease untreated, and unfavourable dental health behaviour, including the use of sugar-based medicines was common.

Principal components analysis of dietary data (frequency of consumption of 57 foods/drinks) collected at age 4(1/2) by maternal report was used to generate a 'junk food' factor. Data on confounders were available from questionnaires. A one standard deviation increase in 'junk food' intake at age 4(1/2) years was associated with increased hyperactivity at age 7 (odds ratio: 1.19; 95% confidence interval: 1.10, 1.29). This persisted after adjustment for confounders including intelligence quotient score (odds ratio: 1.13; 95% confidence interval: 1.01, 1.15). There was little evidence to support an association between 'junk food' intake and overall behavioural difficulties or other sub-scales of the SDQ. Children eating a diet high in 'junk food' in early childhood were more likely to be in the top 33% on the SDQ hyperactivity sub-scale at age 7.

Children's consumption frequency of fatty and sweet foods and demographic variables were obtained from parental-reported questionnaires. Weight and height of the children were measured. Fat and sweet taste preferences varied substantially across survey centres. Independent of survey centre, age, sex, parental education and parental BMI, overweight including obesity was positively associated with fat preference and sweet preference. Fat preference associations were stronger in girls. Girls, but not boys, with a combined preference for fat and sweet had an especially high probability of being overweight or obese. Adjusted models with BMI z-score as the dependent variable were consistent with results of the analyses with BMI categories, but with significant results only for fat preference in girls. Frequent consumption of fatty foods was related to fat preference in bivariate analyses; however, adjusting for survey centre attenuated the association. Sweet preference was not related to consumption of sweet foods, either in crude or in adjusted analyses.

The Institute of Medicine's L.E.A.D. framework (Locate Evidence, Evaluate it, Assemble it, and Inform Decisions) was used to identify practices relevant to children's healthful eating in most OST settings: 1) locate and evaluate information from a national survey of children's perceptions of healthful-food access; published research, reports, policies and guidelines; and roundtables with OST organizations' administrators; 2) assemble information to prioritize actionable practices; and 3) inform programmatic direction. Three evidence-informed guiding principles for short-duration OST resulted: 1) drink right: choose water instead of sugar-sweetened beverages; 2) move more: boost movement and physical activity in all programs; and 3) snack smart: fuel up on fruits and vegetables.

The aim of this study was to explore the net energy expenditure (EE) after physical education (PE) class given the competition between water and SSB consumption for rehydration and explore environmental factors that may influence the net EE, e.g. PE duration, affordability of SSB and students' SSB preference. We built an agent-based model that simulates the behaviour of 13-year-old children in a PE class with nearby water fountains and SSB vending machines available. A longer PE class contributed to greater prevalence of dehydration and required more time for rehydration. The energy cost of a PE class with activity intensity equivalent to 45 min of jogging is about 300 kcal on average, i.e. 10-15% of average 13-year-old children's total daily EE. Adding an SSB vending machine could offset PE energy expenditure by as much as 90 kcal per child, which was associated with PE duration, students' pocket money and SSB preference. Sugar-sweetened beverage vending machines in school may offset some of the EE in PE classes.

Nutrient intake and food consumption were evaluated annually at ages 13 months through 9 years by using food records. Altogether, 543 children were divided into 3 groups according to mean sucrose intake: constantly high sucrose intake (highest 10%), constantly low sucrose intake (lowest 10%), and average sucrose intake (80%). Absolute and relative weights and heights were recorded at 7, 13, and 24 months of age and annually thereafter until 9 years old. The high sucrose-intake group exceeded the recommended sucrose intake (<10% of energy intake, World Health Organization) already at the age of 2 years. Energy and total fat intake did not differ between the sucrose-intake groups. Children with low and average sucrose intake consumed more protein and had a better dietary fat quality than children with high sucrose intake. They also tended to receive more vitamin E, niacin, calcium, iron, zinc, and dietary fiber than children who consumed a high sucrose diet. Children in the low sucrose-intake group consumed more grains, vegetables, and dairy products than the other children. Sugar intake had no direct association with obesity, but weight, height, and BMI of children differed between the sucrose-intake groups between 7 months and 9 years of age. In children aged 13 months to 9 years, long-term low sucrose intake is associated with better nutrient intake and growth than high sucrose intake.

The meeting was science based but policy oriented. The Bellagio Report concluded that: (1) sugar consumption, especially in the form of high-energy fructose in soft drinks, poses a major and insidious health threat, particularly for children; (2) current diets in most populations, albeit with regional differences, are deficient in omega-3 fatty acids but too high in omega-6 fatty acid intake, and (3) not all calories are the same since calories from different sources (i.e. glucose or fructose or omega-6 or omega-3 fatty acids) have different metabolic and neurohormonal effects. This paper summarizes the scientific progress and policy actions that have occurred in these three areas. Genetic variation in populations and gene-nutrient interactions are fundamental concepts that need to be taken into consideration in growth and development and in the prevention and management of chronic noncommunicable diseases since there is enormous variation in both the frequency of genetic variants and dietary composition worldwide. Furthermore, this paper updates the Bellagio Report in terms of the scientific and policy aspects, both of which have expanded over the past 2 years, and describes the progress made in establishing an International Network of Centers for Genetics, Nutrition and Fitness for Health.

Those who had ever used an e-cigarette (N = 614) were asked about reasons for use; additional data were collected on local jurisdiction tobacco sales policy, friends' attitudes toward e-cigarette use, e-cigarette characteristics (level of nicotine, flavorings), and history of tobacco use. Multivariate logistic regression models evaluated associations of each factor with reasons for e-cigarette use, adjusting for gender, ethnicity, highest parental education, tobacco use history and with a random effect of jurisdiction. The top reason for e-cigarette use was ""They come in flavors I like"" (56.6%). Using e-cigarettes to quit smoking was uncommon (12.8%). Participants in jurisdictions with weaker tobacco retail licensing ordinances were more likely to report use of e-cigarettes because they are less harmful than cigarettes (50.1% vs. 36.2%), more acceptable to non-tobacco users (38% vs. 25%), and because they can use e-cigarettes in places where smoking is prohibited (30.7% vs. 18.3%; all p < .05).

Worryingly, the estimated volume of sugary drinks purchased in the UK has more than doubled between 1975 and 2007, from 510 ml to 1140 ml per person per week. We aimed to estimate the potential impact of a duty on sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) at a local level in England, hypothesising that a duty could reduce obesity and related diseases. We modelled the potential impact of a 20% sugary drinks duty on local authorities in England between 2010 and 2030. We synthesised data obtained from the British National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS), drinks manufacturers, Office for National Statistics, and from previous studies. This produced a modelled population of 41 million adults in 326 lower tier local authorities in England. This analysis suggests that a 20% SSB duty could result in approximately 2,400 fewer diabetes cases, 1,700 fewer stroke and coronary heart disease cases, 400 fewer cancer cases, and gain some 41,000 Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) per year across England.

The objective of this cross-sectional observational study was to explore the association of sugar-sweetened and diet beverage intake with A1c, plasma lipids, adiponectin, leptin, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure in youth with type 1 diabetes. We examined data from 1,806 youth age 10-22 years with type 1 diabetes, of which 22% were minority (10% Hispanic, 8% African Americans, 4% other races) and 48% were female. Sugar-sweetened beverage, diet beverage, and mineral water intake was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire. After adjustment for socio-demographic and clinical covariates, physical activity and total energy intake, high sugar-sweetened beverage intake (at least one serving per day vs. none), was associated with higher levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and plasma triglycerides, but not with A1c. High diet beverage intake was associated with higher A1c, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. These associations were partially confounded by body mass index, saturated fat and total fiber intake. High sugar-sweetened beverage intake may have an adverse effect on CVD risk in youth with type 1 diabetes.

330,330,12628036,"The present study tests the hypothesis that higher consumption of bakery products, sweetened soft drinks and yogurt is associated with higher intake of energy, saturated fats, sugars and worse overall diet quality among Spanish children. This is a cross-sectional study covering 1112 children aged 6.0-7.0 years in four Spanish cities. Nutrient and food intake were obtained through a food-frequency questionnaire, and overall diet quality calculated using the healthy-eating index (HEI) developed by Kennedy et al. (1995). Standardized methods were used to measure anthropometric variables. Associations of interest were summarized as the difference in nutrient and food consumption between the value of the fifth and the first quintile of consumption (dq) of bakery products, sweetened soft drinks or yogurt, adjusted for energy intake and BMI. Bakery products, sweetened soft drinks and yogurt supplied 15.5, 1.0 and 5.6 % energy intake respectively. Higher consumption of these three foods was associated with greater energy intake (P<0.001), but not with higher BMI. Consumption of bakery products was associated with the proportion of energy derived from intake of total carbohydrates (dq 4.5 %, P<0.001) and sugars (dq 2 %, P<0.001), but did not show association with the HEI. Consumption of sweetened soft drinks was associated with a lower consumption of milk (dq -88 ml, P<0.001) and Ca (dq -175 mg/d, P<0.001), and worse HEI (dq -2, P<0.01). Consumption of yogurt, while associated with higher energy intake from saturated fats (dq 1.77 %, P<0.001) and sugars (dq 2.02 %, P<0.001), showed no association with the HEI. Differences in the intake of nutrients and foods across quintiles of consumption of bakery products, sweetened soft drinks and yogurt were usually very small. We conclude that the impact of the consumption of bakery products, sweetened soft drinks and yogurt on the quality of the diet of Spanish children is only modest, although it may contribute to aggravating certain unhealthy characteristics of their diet, particularly excess energy, saturated fats and sugars.

Mean patient-reported oropharynx examination discomfort scores were 2.3 cm (95% confidence interval = 1.4-3.2 cm) with traditional tongue depressors versus 1.9 cm (95% confidence interval = 1.0-2.8 cm) with flavored tongue depressors ( P = .72). There were similarly no significant differences between the 2 arms with regard to any of the secondary outcomes. We conclude that the use of flavored tongue depressors does not appear to significantly alleviate discomfort associated with examination of the oropharynx in pediatric patients.

This study tests the hypothesis that there is a relationship between dental caries and the level of socio-economic development, using recent international data. It goes on to explore the implications of this relationship for the development of national oral health policies. Dental caries data was obtained from the WHO, Global Oral Epidemiology Data Bank for the period 1981-1996. Socio-economic data was obtained from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

Secondary analysis of the Healthy Start Study, a 1·5-year randomised controlled trial designed to prevent overweight among Danish children aged 2-6 years (n 366), was carried out. Multivariate linear regression models were used to investigate the associations of beverage consumption with change in body weight (Δweight) or BMI(ΔBMI) z-score. Substitution models were used to extrapolate the influence of replacing sugary drinks with alternative beverages (water, milk and diet drinks) on Δweight or ΔBMI z-score. Sugary drink intake at baseline and substitution of sugary drinks with milk were associated with both Δweight and ΔBMI z-score. Every 100 g/d increase in sugary drink intake was associated with 0·10 kg and 0·06 unit increases in body weight (P=0·048) and BMI z-score (P=0·04), respectively. Substitution of 100 g/d sugary drinks with 100 g/d milk was inversely associated with Δweight (β=-0·16 kg; P=0·045) and ΔBMI z-score (β=-0·07 units; P=0·04). The results of this study suggest that sugary drink consumption was associated with body weight gain among young children with high predisposition for future overweight.

Transcripts of audio recordings for 15 pediatric medical visits were analyzed to assess the oral literacy demand of the visit, as measured by use of terminology, language complexity, and structural characteristics of the dialogue. Parent-completed surveys were used to determine recall of dental concepts discussed during the visit. Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated to identify relationships among these measures and parental recall of the visit. Visits were interactive and used limited jargon and uncomplicated language. Oral literacy demand measures were associated with each other. Parental recall of the visit was associated with measures of high oral literacy demand. Assessing measures of oral literacy demand is a novel method for examining provider communication used during preventive dental visits in a pediatric medical office. Providers displayed low oral literacy demand when communicating with parents. Parental recall of dental concepts, however, was associated unexpectedly with higher oral literacy demand.

The hypothesis was that television viewing and other screen activities at baseline result in increased consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) and increased BMI, BMI z-score and waist to height ratio (WHtR) two years later. A second hypothesis was that SSB consumption mediates the association between the screen activities and changes in the anthropometric measures. The study is a part of the prospective cohort study IDEFICS (""Identification and prevention of dietary and lifestyle-induced health effects in children and infants""), investigating diet, lifestyle and social determinants of obesity in 2 to 9-year-olds in eight European countries (baseline n=16,225, two-year follow-up; n=11,038). Anthropometry was objectively measured, and behaviours were parent-reported. The main hypothesis was supported, but the second hypothesis was not confirmed. The odds ratio of being in the highest quintile of % change in WHtR was 1.26 (95% CI: 1.17-1.36) and in BMI 1.22 (95% CI: 1.13-1.31), for each hour per day watching television. The odds ratio of having increased SSB consumption was 1.19 (95% CI: 1.09-1.29) for each hour per day watching TV. The associations for total screen time were slightly weaker. The results indicate substantial effects of TV viewing and other screen activities for young children, both on their consumption of sugary drinks and on an increase in BMI and central obesity.

353,353,16280431,"Few studies have investigated the association between sugar intake and insulin dynamics in children, and none have examined this association in overweight Latino youth. We aimed to examine the relation between dietary components, especially sugar intake, and insulin dynamics in overweight Latino youth. We examined 63 overweight Latino children aged 9-13 y. Dietary intake was determined by 3-d records, and body composition was measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Insulin sensitivity (S(I)), acute insulin response (AIR), and disposition index (an index of beta cell function) were measured by using a frequently sampled intravenous-glucose-tolerance test and minimal modeling. Hierarchical regression analysis ascertained the potential independent relation between insulin dynamics and dietary components. The relation between macronutrient intake and any variable related to insulin dynamics was not significant. However, higher total sugar intake, although not related to S(I), was significantly associated with lower AIR (beta = -0.296, P = 0.045) and lower beta cell function (beta = -0.421, P = 0.043), independent of the covariates age, sex, body composition, Tanner stage, and energy intake. Sugar-sweetened beverage intakes trended toward inverse association with lower AIR (beta = -0.219, P = 0.072) and beta cell function (beta = -0.298, P = 0.077). In overweight Latino children, higher intakes of sugar and sugar-sweetened beverages were associated with lower AIR and disposition index, which suggested that these children already have early signs of poor beta cell function. These results emphasize the need for early nutritional interventions to reduce daily sugar intake in overweight Latino children and potentially reduce their risk for type 2 diabetes.

354,354,28466533,"High sugar consumption elicits numerous deleterious effects on health by inducing insulin resistance, which is closely associated with the development of metabolic disorders such as obesity or type-2 diabetes. Furthermore, there is also growing evidence that caffeine may play an important role in the regulation of insulin release and the appearance of related metabolic impairments. Thus, the aim of this work was to investigate the impact of acute sugar and caffeine intake on the metabolic health status by using a metabolomic multi-platform based on the combination of flow injection mass spectrometry and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. To this end, we performed a randomized, crossover and double-blind intervention study with different soft drinks from the same brand. Numerous metabolomic changes were detected in serum samples over time after the intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, including energy-related metabolites, amino acids and lipids, thus demonstrating the intense effects provoked by acute sugar consumption on the organism during 3 h of follow-up. However, the most significant findings were observed after the co-ingestion of caffeine, which could be indicative of a synergic effect of this psychostimulant on insulin-mediated perturbations.

Food marketing has a profound impact on children and affects their lifelong eating patterns; in urban areas of South Africa, disposable incomes are growing and ultra-processed food is increasingly available at low cost. The combination of these factors will strain an already fragile health system. Our aim was to investigate the density of outdoor sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) advertising and the number of formal and informal vendors selling SSBs in a transforming, historically disadvantaged urban setting of South Africa. A digital camera and global positioning system navigation system were used to record the location of SSB advertisements and food vendors in a demarcated area in Soweto. Data were collected by walking or driving through each street; a food inventory was completed for every food vendor. Spatial analyses were conducted using a geographic information system. A total of 145 advertisements for SSBs were found over a driven or walked distance of 111.9 km. The density of advertisements was 3.6 per km(2) in relation to schools, and 50% of schools had branded advertising of SSBs on their school property. Most (n = 104; 58%) of the 180 vendors in the study sold SSBs. This is the first study in South Africa to document the location of billboard advertisements and vendors in relation to schools.

357,357,14760578,"Sweeteners elicit pleasurable sensations with (nutritive) or without (nonnutritive) energy. Nutritive sweeteners (eg, sucrose, fructose) are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), yet concern exists about increasing sweetener intakes relative to optimal nutrition and health. Dietary quality suffers at intakes above 25% of total energy (the Institutes of Medicine's suggested maximal intake level). In the United States, estimated intakes of nutritive sweeteners fall below this, although one in four children (ages 9 to 18 years) can surpass this level. Polyols (sugar alcohols), GRAS-affirmed or petitions filed for GRAS, add sweetness with reduced energy and functional properties to foods/beverages and promote dental health. Five nonnutritive sweeteners with intense sweetening power have FDA approval (acesulfame-K, aspartame, neotame, saccharin, sucralose) and estimated intakes below the Acceptable Daily Intake (level that a person can safely consume everyday over a lifetime without risk). By increasing palatability of nutrient-dense foods/beverages, sweeteners can promote diet healthfulness. Scientific evidence supports neither that intakes of nutritive sweeteners by themselves increase the risk of obesity nor that nutritive or nonnutritive sweeteners cause behavioral disorders. However, nutritive sweeteners increase risk of dental caries. High fructose intakes may cause hypertriglyceridemia and gastrointestinal symptoms in susceptible individuals. Thus, it is the position of The American Dietetic Association that consumers can safely enjoy a range of nutritive and nonnutritive sweeteners when consumed in a diet that is guided by current federal nutrition recommendations, such as the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Dietary References Intakes, as well as individual health goals. Dietetics professionals should provide consumers with science-based information about sweeteners and support research on the use of sweeteners to promote eating enjoyment, optimal nutrition, and health.

We used linear and logistic mixed models to assess beverage waste and identified themes in staff and student reactions. Our analysis of data from 315 unique students and 1,820 beverages choices indicated that average added sugar intake decreased by 2.8 g postremoval, while average reductions in calcium and protein consumption were negligible (12.2 mg and 0.3 g, respectively). Five thematic findings emerged, including concerns expressed by adult staff about student rebellion following removal, which did not come to fruition.

Most medicines are only available as tablets and capsules, and where liquid alternatives exist, these products often have issues with palatability and high costs. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the swallowing spray, Pill Glide, could help children in taking their solid and liquid medicines. This open label pilot study compared the spray with a behavioral approach alone, the current standard of care at the pediatric hospital. Patients were children on long-term drug therapies, either transitioning from liquid preparations to tablets and capsules, or known to be experiencing swallowing difficulties. Using age-adapted diaries, patients self-reported the difficulty of taking medicines on a 6-point hedonic scale for 2 weeks before the intervention, and then for 1 week while using Pill Glide. Data were analyzed from 10 children aged 6 to 16 years, with an average burden of 3.5 tablets per day. Pill Glide (strawberry was the most popular flavor) was shown to significantly decrease the overall medicine taking difficulty score by 0.93 (range, 0.33-1.53), almost 1 hedonic face point on the scale used (P = .002). There was insufficient data for liquid medicines. Pill Glide could help children with pill swallowing, thus improving patient acceptability of medicines and potentially adherence.

High caries prevalence and severity were associated with infrequent brushing, snacking on sugar-containing foods, having seen a dentist before, and having last visited a dentist because of pain. The caries prevalence of the sample was comparable with findings from a national oral health survey conducted in 1985/86, but the caries severity was greater.

Intake of beverages with excess free fructose (EFF), including apple juice, and HFCS sweetened fruit drinks and soft drinks, has been associated with asthma in children.

We conducted a systematic review of English-language, human studies of any design in children and adults with low to no alcohol intake and that reported at least one predetermined measure of liver health. The strength of the evidence was evaluated by considering risk of bias, consistency, directness, and precision. Six observational studies and 21 intervention studies met the inclusion criteria. The overall strength of evidence for observational studies was rated insufficient because of high risk of biases and inconsistent study findings. Of 21 intervention studies, 19 studies were in adults without NAFLD (predominantly healthy, young men) and 1 study each in adults or children with NAFLD. We found a low level of evidence that a hypercaloric fructose diet (supplemented by pure fructose) increases liver fat and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentrations in healthy men compared with the consumption of a weight-maintenance diet. In addition, there was a low level of evidence that hypercaloric fructose and glucose diets have similar effects on liver fat and liver enzymes in healthy adults. There was insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion for effects of HFCS or sucrose on NAFLD. On the basis of indirect comparisons across study findings, the apparent association between indexes of liver health (ie, liver fat, hepatic de novo lipogenesis, alanine aminotransferase, AST, and γ-glutamyl transpeptase) and fructose or sucrose intake appear to be confounded by excessive energy intake.

We aimed to examine the prospective relationships between flavored milk consumption and body fat. Subjects included 2270 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Flavored milk consumption at age 10 years was assessed using dietary records; consumption was dichotomized as consumers and non-consumers. Percent body fat was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at 11 and 13 years. Body weight at 11 and 13 years was included as a secondary outcome. Associations were also examined in a subset of plausible reporters to evaluate the influence of dietary reporting errors. There was an effect of interaction between flavored milk and baseline weight on body fat (P-interaction <0.02). In plausible reporters, overweight/obese children who consumed flavored milk had less favorable changes in body fat compared with non-consumers (adjusted means: -0.16%, 95% CI: -3.8, 3.5 vs -3.4%, 95% CI: -6.5, -0.42, P=0.02). Similar associations with body weight were observed. The adjusted mean percent body fat for overweight/obese girls who consumed flavored milk was greater at age 13 compared with 11 years (39.7%, 95% CI: 32, 47 vs 38.3%, 95% CI: 32, 44).

371,371,25840708,"The term «sweetener» refers to a food additive that imparts a sweet flavour and usually provides no or very low energy. It is used to sweeten foods, medicines and food supplements with no nutritional purposes. For years, no-calorie sweeteners have been used as substitutes for all or part of the sugar content in foods and beverages. In recent decades its consumption has risen to prevent tooth decay, or as an aid in weight control, obesity and diabetes and, in general, to achieve an optimal energy balance. However, consumption of sugary or sweetened food and soft drinks is high, making this situation of special interest in calorie intake and in the poor behavioural pattern of eating habits in children. In addition, questions remain among consumers about the risks to health associated with their use, whether they are artificial or natural. The «artificial sweeteners» are the group of greatest interest in research in order to demonstrate their safety and to provide firm data on their possible therapeutic effects.

Respondents were asked to indicate the number of children treated with EEN at their centers in the previous years and to provide details of their protocol used for administering EEN to these children.   Responses were received from 35 separate centers (42% of those asked). The duration of EEN varied from <6 weeks to >12 weeks, but was most commonly 6 to 8 weeks. Although 23 different formulas were utilized across the centers, most (90%) used polymeric formulas. Flavourings were commonly added to formulas but wide variations existed between centers with the prescription of food and fluids permitted during the EEN period. The reintroduction of food after EEN also varied greatly: the most common recommendations were for an initial low-fiber diet (26%) or the gradual introduction of food quantity as the formula volume decreased (52%).   This questionnaire-based study has shown the wide variations in EEN protocols used in different areas of the world.

However, certain populations display a significant overexpression of the disorder where incidence is reported to be 1 in every 52,541 new-borns. The first-line therapy for MSUD involves a strict dietary leucine restriction and oral supplementation of isoleucine and valine. The dose administered to patients requires strict tailoring according to age, weight and blood levels. In current clinical practice, however, practitioners still have to prepare extemporaneous formulations due to the lack of suitable oral treatments for MSUD. Herein, we evaluate the first time use of 3D printing in a hospital setting for the preparation of personalised therapies with the aim of improving safety and acceptability to isoleucine supplementation in paediatric patients suffering from MSUD. This investigation was a single-centre, prospective crossover experimental study. Four paediatric patients with MSUD (aged 3-16 years) were treated at the Clinic University Hospital in Santiago de Compostela, Spain which is a MSUD reference hospital in Europe. The primary objective was to evaluate isoleucine blood levels after six months of treatment with two types of formulations; conventional capsules prepared by manual compounding and personalised chewable formulations prepared by automated 3D printing. A secondary investigation was to evaluate patient acceptability of 3D printed formulations prepared with different flavours and colours. Isoleucine blood levels in patients were well controlled using both types of formulations, however, the 3D printed therapy showed mean levels closer to the target value and with less variability (200-400 µM). The 3D printed formulations were well accepted by patients regarding flavour and colour. The study demonstrates for the first time that 3D printing offers a feasible, rapid and automated approach to prepare oral tailored-dose therapies in a hospital setting. 3D printing has shown to be an effective manufacturing technology in producing chewable isoleucine printlets as a treatment of MSUD with good acceptability.

389,389,39064721,"One of the main public health issues that has recently been observed in a greater number of children is being overweight. The cause certainly lies in the decreasing physical activity of children, but mostly in their eating habits. Soft drinks are recognized as the most significant contributor to body overweight due to high sugar content; thus, as a result of numerous campaigns, part of the sugar is replaced by artificial sweeteners (ASs). Despite their advantage due to their low caloric value, WHO recommends that they should not be used to achieve weight control or as prevention for reducing the risk of non-communicable diseases, as there is no evidence of their effectiveness. Apart from beverages, artificial sweetener combinations are also added to a variety of ""low fat"" and ""high protein"" food products, which are highly favored especially among the young population. Therefore, it is necessary to take care of the cumulative intake. The conducted study included a survey of 323 parents of children aged 1-14 years, as well as an analysis of the AS content in the products most often consumed by the respondents. The results of the survey show that a large part of children (40%) aged 3-14 often consume soft drinks. Different products (soft drinks, juices/nectars, syrups) were sampled based on the respondents' responses, and an analysis showed that 54% of them contained one or more ASs. In addition, the survey indicated parents' lack of information about the presence of AS in products, as 51% of parents declared that they do not read the declarations of the products they buy.

Gastric tube administration of charcoal varies by age and is partly subjective in its application. We found no evidence that excipient flavoring of charcoal improved success of administration. Pulmonary aspiration of charcoal, although uncommon, should be considered when assessing the risk of therapy. We offer a report of symptomatic constipation from single-dose charcoal.

Reviewing records from the Northampton General Infirmary (from 1903 the Northampton General Hospital) for the period 1744-45 gives a flavour of hospital child health care in an era before the formal recognition of paediatrics as a medical specialty and the construction of specialist provision. Indeed the first patient admitted to the Northampton General Infirmary on 29 March 1744 was Thomasin Grace, a 13 year old child. In Northampton, in its first year of operation, children as young as 2 years of age were seen in outpatients and from 8 years were admitted. Paediatric cases up to and including those 16 years of age made up 26% of the number of patients seen for that year.

Although longitudinal evidence is sparse among children, SSB intake reduction is targeted to reduce cardiometabolic risk factors in this group. We investigated characteristics associated with consumption of SSBs in a multi-ethnic sample of children/adolescents and measured cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between SSB intake and plasma HDL cholesterol and triglycerides (TGs) over 12 mo. In a diverse cohort of children aged 8-15 y, cross-sectional associations (n = 613) between baseline SSB intake and blood lipid concentrations and longitudinal associations (n = 380) between mean SSB intake, changes in SSB intake, and lipid changes over 12 mo were assessed with multivariable linear regression. Greater SSB intake was associated with lower socioeconomic status, higher total energy intake, lower fruit/vegetable intake, and more sedentary time. In cross-sectional analysis, greater SSB intake was associated with higher plasma TG concentrations among consumers (62.4, 65.3, and 71.6 mg/dL in children who consumed >0 but <2, ≥2 but <7, and ≥7 servings/wk, respectively; P-trend: 0.03); plasma HDL cholesterol showed no cross-sectional association. In the longitudinal analysis, mean SSB intake over 12 mo was not associated with lipid changes; however, the 12-mo increase in plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration was greater among children who decreased their intake by ≥1 serving/wk (4.6 ± 0.8 mg/dL) compared with children whose intake stayed the same (2.0 ± 0.8 mg/dL) or increased (1.5 ± 0.8 mg/dL; P = 0.02). In a multi-ethnic sample of children, intake of SSBs was positively associated with TG concentrations among consumers, and changes in SSB intake were inversely associated with HDL cholesterol concentration changes over 12 mo.

399,399,25857343,"High soft drink consumption has been linked with asthma. Anecdotal evidence links high-fructose corn syrup with asthma. The receptor of advanced glycation end products (RAGE) has emerged as a mediator of asthma. The objectives of the present study were to: (i) assess the correlation between intake of beverages containing excess free fructose (EFF beverages) and asthma in children; and (ii) epidemiologically test the mechanistic hypothesis that intake of high EFF beverages, such as apple juice or beverages sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup, is associated with increased risk of asthma. This hypothesis is based on the possible effect of increases in the in situ intestinal formation of advanced glycation end products (enFruAGE) with EFF, which may be absorbed and play a role in RAGE-mediated asthma. We examined cross-sectional associations between beverage intake and self-reported current or history of asthma. Exposure variables were EFF beverages, including apple juice (AJ), non-diet soft drinks (ndSD) and fruit drinks (FD). Orange juice (OJ), not an EFF beverage, was included as a comparison. Rao-Scott χ(2) analysis was used for prevalence differences and logistic regression for associations, adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, BMI and total energy intake. Data are from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2006, a nationally representative survey.

Children consuming AJ ≥5 times/week v. ≤1 time/month, adjusted for the other beverages, were more than twice as likely to have asthma (OR=2·43, P=0·035). In contrast, there was a tendency for OJ to be protective. These results support the hypothesis that intake of high EFF beverages, including AJ and beverages sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup, is associated with asthma in children aged 2-9 years.

Guided by the Food Fortification Formulator, we found that these differences did not result in differences in recommended fortification levels. Differences were found, however, in estimated impacts: although both surveys found that oil would be effective in reducing the prevalence of inadequate vitamin A intake among both subpopulations, only OWFR also found that sugar and wheat flour fortification would significantly reduce inadequate vitamin A intake among children.

Sex-related differences in SSB consumption trends among racial groups were also observed. SSB consumption trends have differed among racial groups and between the sexes over the past two decades, with SSB intake having increased more dramatically in racial minorities during this time than in non-Hispanic whites. Although other Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites consumed more SSBs than other racial groups in 1988-1991, SSB consumption among adolescents from all racial groups was comparable by 2003-2004. Furthermore, adolescents from most racial groups consumed more SSBs in 1994-2004 than in 1988-1994, paralleling the increase in pediatric obesity and metabolic syndrome.

408,408,26537945,"Increased energy intake is consistently observed in individuals consuming sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), likely mainly because of an inadequate satiety response to liquid calories. However, SSBs have a high content of fructose, the consumption of which acutely fails to trigger responses in key signals involved in energy homeostasis. It is unclear whether the fructose content of SSBs contributes to the increased energy intake in individuals drinking SSBs. We investigated whether the relative amounts of fructose and glucose in SSBs modifies ad libitum energy intake over 8 d in healthy adults without fructose malabsorption. We conducted 2 randomized, controlled, double-blind crossover studies to compare the effects of consuming 4 servings/d of a fructose-, glucose-, or aspartame-sweetened beverage (study A; n = 9) or a fructose-, glucose-, or high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS)-sweetened beverage (study B; n = 24) for 8 d on overall energy intake. SSBs were provided at 25% of estimated energy requirement, or an equivalent volume of the aspartame-sweetened beverage, and consumption was mandatory. All solid foods were provided at 125% of estimated energy requirements and were consumed ad libitum. In study A, ad libitum energy intake was 120% ± 10%, 117% ± 12%, and 102% ± 15% of estimated energy requirements when subjects consumed the fructose-, glucose-, and aspartame-sweetened beverages. Energy intake was significantly higher in the fructose and glucose phases than in the aspartame phase (P < 0.003 for each), with no difference between the fructose and glucose phases (P = 0.462). In study B, total energy intake during the fructose, HFCS, and glucose phases was 116% ± 14%, 116% ± 16%, and 116% ± 16% of the subject's estimated total energy requirements (P = 0.880). In healthy adults, total 8-d ad libitum energy intake was increased in individuals consuming SSBs compared with aspartame-sweetened beverages. The energy overconsumption observed in individuals consuming SSBs occurred independently of the relative amounts of fructose and glucose in the beverages.

Given the powerful influence of marketing on children's diets, this cross-sectional study examined the types of foods, the nutritional quality of those foods, and the marketing techniques and messages used in food advertising during Saturday morning children's television programming. During 27.5 hours of programming in May 2005, 49% of advertisements shown were for food (281 food advertisements out of 572 total advertisements). The most commonly advertised food categories were ready-to-eat breakfast cereal and cereal bars (27% of all food advertisements), restaurants (19% of food advertisements), and snack foods (18% of food advertisements). Ninety-one percent of food advertisements were for foods or beverages high in fat, sodium, or added sugars or were low in nutrients. Cartoon characters were used in 74% of food advertisements, and toy or other giveaways were used in 26% of food advertisements. About half of food advertisements contained health/nutrition or physical activity messages and 86% of food advertisements contained emotional appeals.

Data are available for countries with different patterns of sweetener approvals and also for population groups with high potential intakes, such as children and diabetic subjects. These data provide a secure basis for predicting the potential intakes of a novel intense sweetener by adjustment of the reported intakes of different sweeteners in mg/kg body weight by their relative sweetness intensities. This approach allows the possibility that a novel sweetener attains the same pattern and extent of use as the existing sweeteners. The intakes by high consumers of other sweeteners allows for possible brand loyalty to the novel sweetener.

The objective of this study was to re-examine the dose-response and quantitative relationship between sugar intake and the incidence of dental caries and to see whether the WHO goal for sugar intake of 10% of energy intake (E) is optimum for low levels of caries in children and adults. Analyses focused on countries where sugar intakes changed because of wartime restrictions or as part of the nutritional transition. A re-analysis of the dose-response relation between dietary sugar and caries incidence in teeth with different levels of susceptibility to dental caries in nationally representative samples of Japanese children. The impact of fluoride on levels of caries was also assessed. Meticulous Japanese data on caries incidence in two types of teeth show robust log-linear relationships to sugar intakes from 0%E to 10%E sugar with a 10 fold increase in caries if caries is assessed over several years' exposure to sugar rather than only for the first year after tooth eruption. Adults aged 65 years and older living in water fluoridated areas where high proportions of people used fluoridated toothpastes, had nearly half of all tooth surfaces affected by caries. This more extensive burden of disease in adults does not occur if sugar intakes are limited to <3% energy intake. There is a robust log-linear relationship of caries to sugar intakes from 0%E to 10%E sugar. A 10%E sugar intake induces a costly burden of caries. These findings imply that public health goals need to set sugar intakes ideally <3%E with <5%E as a pragmatic goal, even when fluoride is widely used.

426,426,20352537,"An epinephrine (E) tablet is under development for sublingual (SL) administration for the first-aid treatment of anaphylaxis; however, the inherent bitterness of E may hinder acceptability by patients, especially children. To assess the degree of E bitterness and to predict the masking effects of sweetening and/or flavoring non-medicinal ingredients (NMIs), the potential usefulness of an electronic tongue (e-Tongue) was evaluated. The e-Tongue sensors were conditioned, calibrated, and tested for taste discrimination. Six standard active pharmaceutical ingredients were used to build and validate a bitterness model which was then used to assess E bitartrate (EB) solutions from 0.3-9 mM. Taste-masking efficiency of aspartame (ASP), acesulfame potassium (ASK), and citric acid (CA) each at 0.5 mM was evaluated. Using EB 9 mM, the bitterness score was 20 on a scale of 20 (unacceptable) down to 1 (not detected). When NMIs 0.5 mM were added, neither ASK (17.2, unacceptable) nor was ASP (14.0, limit acceptable) effective in masking the bitter taste. When the combination of ASK and ASP was used, the bitterness score was reduced to 9.2 (acceptable). However, the addition of CA alone resulted in the best reduction of the bitterness score to 3.3 (not detected). Using the e-Tongue, the incorporation of a variety of sweetening and/or flavoring NMIs into a SL tablet of E could be shown to mask its bitter taste by up to 80%. These results should be confirmed by in vivo studies.

We used the structural equation modeling to examine the associations between specific diet and physical activity (PA) behaviors at home and Hispanic children's metabolic health. A total of 187 Hispanic children and their parents from an urban community in Wisconsin participated in the study. Exposure variables included, children's daily intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) and PA; home availability of SSB and PA areas/equipment; and parents' intake of SSB and PA, assessed through self-administered questionnaires. Outcome variables for children's metabolic health included, measured anthropometrics; cardiovascular fitness assessed using the Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run (PACER); and insulin resistance determined with the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMAIR). We found that children's daily intake of SSB was positively associated with BMI z-score, which in turn, was positively associated with HOMAIR (P < 0.05). Specific diet behaviors at home associated with children's intake of SSB, included home availability of SSB, which mediated the association between parents' and children's intake of SSB (P < 0.05). Children's PA was positively associated with PACER z-score, which in turn, was inversely associated with HOMAIR (P < 0.05). Specific PA behaviors at home associated with children's PA, included home availability of PA areas/equipment, which mediated the association between parents' and children's PA (P < 0.05).

We first explored the association of social support with caries experience and the relative roles of support from family, friends and a special person on caries experience in 15-16-year-old adolescents. We then explored whether social support at 11-12 years of age predicts caries increment in second permanent molars over 4 years and the relative roles of different sources of support on 4-year caries increment. Data from phases 1 and 3 of the Research with East London Adolescents Community Health Survey (RELACHS), a school-based prospective study of a representative sample of adolescents in East London, were used for cross-sectional (phase 3) and longitudinal analyses (phases 1 and 3). Data were collected by questionnaires including the same questions on demographic characteristics, socioeconomic measures and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support at phases 1 and 3. A questionnaire section on dental behaviours and an oral clinical examination were also included in phase 3. Social support was negatively related to both caries experience and increment independently of demographic characteristics, socioeconomic measures and dental behaviours. Furthermore, only support from a special person was significantly related to caries experience and increment in unadjusted and adjusted regression models. In conclusion, adolescents who perceived higher levels of social support had lower caries experience and increment.

Thus, our study evaluated gender differences in COHB including the influencing pathways of family factors in China. Through multistage cluster sampling, 915 pairs of mothers and children from six public elementary schools in Beijing completed self-administered questionnaires regarding COHB, parents' modelling behaviours (PMB), parents' controlling behaviours (PCB), parents' oral health knowledge and attitudes (PKA), and children's oral health knowledge and attitudes (CKA). The influencing factors were analysed using path analysis. Compared with boys, girls showed significantly better performance in drinking less carbonated drinks regularly (8.6% vs. 16.9%). For both genders, PMB shad a significant direct influence on COHB, while PKA had an indirect influence through PMB. In the boys' model, PKA indirectly influenced COHB through CKA. In the girls' model, socioeconomic status had a positive direct effect on COHB. The gender differences were not as large as expected. Given that slightly different influential factors for COHB exist between boys and girls, interventions should take note of the similarities and differences in pathways.

Providing guidance for the consumption of candy in moderation requires an understanding of various behavioral health-related factors that influence candy consumption. A roundtable of behavioral nutrition experts, researchers, and nutrition educators met to discuss recent data on intakes of candy, health outcomes associated with usual candy intake, and the impact of behavioral strategies, including restriction, education, and environmental awareness, on modifying eating behaviors to achieve moderate intakes of candy. Restricting access to palatable foods, whether self-imposed or by parental control, may have potentially negative consequences.

Frequency (times per day) varied greatly across countries, ranging from 0.52 (95% CI = 0.43, 0.60) in Kiribati to 2.39 (95% CI = 2.25, 2.53) in Suriname. Our data confirm that consumption of carbonated soft drinks is frequent among young adolescents in LMICs. Our findings highlight the need for interventions in these countries to reduce adolescents' carbonated soft drink consumption.

446,446,18670698,"Few studies on treatment or prevention of obesity have shown significant results. Theoretically, in children and adolescents as compared to adults, prevention of excessive weight gain should be easy due to the energy expended during growth, associated with more time spent in leisure-time activities. However, numerous factors that stimulate overeating and sedentary behaviors are difficult to overcome. Additionally, most intervention studies have focused on a minor portion of the many factors associated with obesity. Important aspects of the obesity epidemic such as the role of the food industry, fast food chains, advertising, and a lifestyle that limits children to sedentary activities and overeating cannot be explored by a traditional clinical trial design. At any rate, among the published interventions, those including the family in weight-reduction strategies have shown the best results, as compared to children-centered approaches. Meanwhile, studies on specific nutrient or dietary composition (such as calcium, protein, or glycemic index) related to prevention or treatment of obesity have failed to yield good results. Reducing the intake of high-sugar carbonated drinks and juices has shown promising but still inconclusive results.

We surveyed the sugars content (per 100 ml and standardised 200 ml portion) of all FJJDS sold by seven major UK supermarkets (supermarket own and branded products). Only products specifically marketed towards children were included. We excluded sports drinks, iced teas, sugar-sweetened carbonated drinks and cordials as being not specifically marketed towards children. We identified 203 fruit juices (n=21), juice drinks (n=158) and smoothies (n=24) marketed to children. Sugars content ranged from 0 to 16 g/100 ml. The mean sugars content was 7.0 g/100 ml, but among the 100% fruit juice category, it was 10.7 g/100 ml. Smoothies (13.0 g/100 ml) contained the highest amounts of sugars and juice drinks (5.6 g/100 ml) contained the lowest amount. 117 of the 203 FJJDS surveyed would receive a Food Standards Agency 'red' colour-coded label for sugars per standardised 200 ml serving. Only 63 FJJDS would receive a 'green' colour-coded label. 85 products contained at least 19 g of sugars-a child's entire maximum daily amount of sugars. 57 products contained sugar (sucrose), 65 contained non-caloric sweeteners and five contained both. Seven products contained glucose-fructose syrup. The sugars content in FJJDS marketed to children in the UK is unacceptably high.

As part of an overall study of liquid oral medicine use in children, analysis of the number of prescriptions and volume of liquid oral medicines dispensed through the general medical and dental services, on a regional and national basis, was undertaken, together with a survey of liquid oral medicines ordering in hospital pharmacies and 'over-the-counter' (OTC) liquid oral medicines in community pharmacies. The number of prescriptions and volume of liquid oral medicines prescribed during a one-year period (1987) were: for Great Britain, 43.9 million prescriptions and 10.3 million litres; for the Northern Region, 2.7 million prescriptions and 0.7 million litres. The total volume of liquid oral medicines, for both long- and short-term use, supplied on prescription and over the counter within the Northern Region during a one-year period (1987) was approximately 1.1 million litres. Of this, 0.28 million litres were OTC liquid oral medicines destined for long- and short-term use. In quantity terms, 59% of prescribed liquid oral medicines and 65% of hospital pharmacy liquid oral medicines, dispensed potentially for long-term use, were sugar-based, whereas 45% of the quantity supplied over the counter was sugar-based.

This study was carried out to provide baseline information on the major oral health problems (dental caries, periodontal disease, malocclusion, and dental fluorosis) among school children in Addis Ababa. The study was school-based cross-sectional by design. It was conducted in April 2000 with the objective to determine the oral health status of school children who are 12 years and above. A total of 1736 study subjects were selected through a multi-stage sampling procedure from three different categories of schools (private, public and government), proportionate to their respective size of student population. The prevalence of dental caries was determined to be 21.1% and it was found to increase significantly with increasing age, high consumption of sweets, and in those who do not clean their teeth regularly. Periodontal disease affected more than half (53.4%) of the study subjects and was significantly higher in males, those with high consumption of sweets, and those having 'Injera' as staple diet, and those with poor oral hygiene. The prevalence of malocclusion was 23.7%, while crowding and spacing of teeth were found in 23.8% and 18.3% of the subjects, respectively. The prevalence of dental fluorosis was low (1.6%).

P < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. Although the postoperative parameters such as nausea, fever, vomiting, odor, bleeding, otalgia and trismus were not statistically different between the two groups based on chi-square analysis (P > 0.05), a significant pain-relieving effect was seen in hydration group after the second day (P < 0.05). There were no complications associated with intravenous hydration.

A structured questionnaire was used with personnel involved in the production, marketing and wholesaling of paediatric medicines in the UK. Information was obtained from interviews with, or from questionnaires completed by, personnel of five pharmaceutical and five wholesale companies. The findings indicated that the only obstacle to producing sugar-free medicines is slightly higher cost, and that manufacturers are influenced to change mainly by consumer pressure.

The aim of this study was to assess the erosive potential of 97 paediatric medicines in vitro. The study took the form of in vitro measurement of endogenous pH and titratable acidity (mmol). Endogenous pH was measured using a pH meter, followed by titration to pH 7.0 with 0.1-M NaOH. Overall, 55 (57%) formulations had an endogenous pH of < 5.5. The mean (+/- SD) endogenous pH and titratable acidity for 41 SC formulations were 5.26 +/- 1.30 and 0.139 +/- 0.133 mmol, respectively; for 56 sugars-free (SF) formulations, these figures were 5.73 +/- 1.53 and 0.413 +/- 1.50 mmol (P > 0.05).

Chewable and dispersible tablets (P < 0.001), gastrointestinal medicines (P = 0.002) and antibiotics (P = 0.007) were significant predictors of higher pH. In contrast, effervescent tablets (P < 0.001), and nutrition and blood preparations (P = 0.021) were significant predictors of higher titratable acidity.

The snacks differed in size (small vs large) or flavour (sweet vs sweet-sour). Two conditions were designed: 1) a monotonous group in which children continuously consumed the same snack across the 3 weeks, and 2) a free choice group in which children were allowed to freely choose amongst 3 different flavours of the snack each day during 3 weeks. Shape influenced long-term liking, i.e. small shaped snacks remained stable in liking over repeated consumption, whereas large shaped snacks with the same flavour decreased in liking. Mean wanting ratings for all snack products decreased over 3 weeks daily consumption. Flavour did not significantly influence liking and wanting over time. The ability to freely choose amongst different flavours tended to decrease children's liking (p < 0.1) and wanting (p < 0.001) for these products. Changes in liking rather than initial liking was the best predictor of snack choice during the intervention. Wanting rather than liking was most affected by repeated daily consumption of snack foods over three weeks. In order to increase the likelihood that children will repeatedly eat a food product, smaller sized healthy snacks are preferred to larger sized snacks.

The findings indicate that food advertising accounts for nearly half of all commercial messages on children's programs. An average hour includes 11 food ads that account for 4:25 of total ad time. Broadcast channels deliver more food advertising than cable channels, although the types of food products marketed on both channels are highly similar. The overwhelming majority of foods ads directed to children are for high-calorie, low nutrient food products that should not be part of a regular diet.

This study utilized in vitro, in vivo and clinical data to evaluate the palatability of a novel midazolam chocolate tablet. In vitro dissolution experiments showed the crushed tablet to release within 5 min 1.68 mg of midazolam into simulated saliva. This translated to a drug level of 0.84 mg/ml in the oral cavity, which would be higher than the midazolam bitterness detection threshold concentration of 0.03 mg/ml determined in a rat 'brief access taste aversion' (BATA) model. The visual analogue scale scores of patients aged 4-16 years prescribed with midazolam pre-surgery showed a clear preference for the midazolam chocolate tablets (3.35 ± 1.04, n = 20) compared to the control midazolam solution (1.47 ± 0.62, n = 17).

This was achieved through two surveys, one conducted amongst consultant paediatricians in five districts, and the other in four general medical practices in two districts within the region. The consultant survey identified 243 children aged 1-16 years currently taking long-term liquid oral medicines frequently, under consultant paediatric care. This represented a prevalence of 1:916 children (0.11 per cent) in the five districts studied. The general medical practice survey showed that the prescribing of liquid oral medicines for prolonged periods was not confined to those children who had been referred to and were under the care of consultant paediatricians. It indicated that the prevalence of long-term medication with prescription-based liquid oral medicines in children under the care of consultant paediatricians or general medical practitioners or both, was approximately 1:361 (0.28 per cent). Of the 67 different liquid oral medicine preparations which were used long-term, 39 per cent were sugar-based, 33 per cent sugar-free, and the rest 'variable'; either sugar-based or sugar-free depending on how specifically they were prescribed.

The investigation consisted of a prospective crossover design with 10 healthy children aged 2-4 years each with at least two caries lesions within the dentine (ds > or = 2). The children were instructed to chew 6 pieces of a test or a control gum every day for a 14-day period. The test gum contained 65% xylitol and the control gum was sweetened with sorbitol. At baseline and after 14 days, salivary mutans streptococci were enumerated with a chair-side test (Strip mutans) and dental plaque was collected from the upper maxillary incisors. After a washout period of 6 weeks, the same procedure was repeated with the corresponding test or control gum. Lactic acid was determined enzymatically in glucose-challenged plaque suspensions. The lactic acid concentration was significantly reduced (p<0.05) by 22% compared with baseline following the xylitol gum regimen but was unaltered after the control gum. The levels of salivary mutans streptococci were mainly unaffected by both chewing gums. A 14-day use of xylitol-containing chewing gums, corresponding to a daily amount of 5 grams of xylitol, could diminish glucose-initiated lactic acid formation in supragingival plaque in caries-active pre-school children.

A total of 437 non-dehydrated children aged less than five years presenting to health centres with acute diarrhoea were randomly assigned to the three ORS groups. Acceptability was determined by the amounts of ORS consumed at home by children still with diarrhoea on 24- or 48-hour follow-up. The amounts of ORS consumed by children given Oresol-R (54 [95% CL 38-70] mL/kg/24 h) and Oresol-F (47 [24-70]) were similar to the amount of Oresol-G (44 [32-56]). ORS consumption was not affected by the child's age, nutritional status, feeding before the episode, duration of diarrhoea at health centre visit, maternal education and previous ORS use. Informing the caretaker that rice-based ORS would help stop diarrhoea did not lead to increased consumption of the solution (Oresol-R 54 [38-70] mL/kg/24 h; Oresol-K 50 [32-68]).

500,500,32594969,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) particularly among chronic consumers of added sugar-rich diets. However, the impact of early consumption of such diets on NAFLD onset and progression is unclear. Thus, this study sought to characterise metabolic factors involved in NAFLD progression in young mice fed with a high-sucrose diet (HSD). Male Swiss mice were fed HSD or regular chow (CTR) from weaning for up to 60 or 90 days. Obesity development, glucose homeostasis and serum biochemical parameters were determined at each time-point. At day 90, mice were euthanised and white adipose tissue (WAT) collected for lipolytic function assessment and liver for histology, gene expression and cytokines quantification. At day 60, HSD mice presented increased body mass, hypertriglyceridemia, peripheral insulin resistance (IR) and simple steatosis. Upon 90 days on diet, WAT from HSD mice displayed impaired insulin sensitivity, which coincided with increased fasting levels of glucose and free fatty acids (FFA), as well as NAFLD progression to NASH. Transcriptional levels of lipogenic genes, particularly stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1, were consistently increased, leading to hepatic leukocyte infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokines spillover. Therefore, our dataset supports IR triggering in the WAT as a major factor for dysfunctional release of FFA towards portal circulation and consequent upregulation of lipogenic genes and hepatic inflammatory onset, which decisively concurred for NAFLD-to-NASH progression in young HSD-fed mice. Notwithstanding, this study forewarns against the early introduction of dietary sugars in infant diet, particularly following breastfeeding cessation.

Dietary intake was assessed by three 24-h recalls in 613 Canadian children (aged 8-10 years). Added sugars (mean of 3-day intakes) were categorized according to source (solid or liquid). Dietary intake and the Canadian Healthy Eating Index (« HEI-C ») were compared across tertiles of solid and liquid added sugars separately as were adiposity indicators (body mass index (BMI), fat mass (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), and waist circumference). Cross-sectional associations were examined in linear regression models adjusting for age, sex, energy intake, and physical activity (7-day accelerometer). Added sugar contributed 12% of total energy intake (204 kcal) on average, of which 78% was from solid sources. Higher consumption of added sugars from either solid or liquid source was associated with higher total energy, lower intake of micronutrients, vegetables and fruit, and lower HEI-C score. Additionally liquid sources were associated with lower intake of dairy products. A 10-g higher consumption of added sugars from liquid sources was associated with 0.4 serving/day lower of vegetables and fruit, 0.4-kg/m(2) higher BMI, a 0.5-kg higher fat mass, and a 0.9-cm higher waist circumference whereas the associations of added sugars from solid sources and adiposity indicators tended to be negative. In conclusion, higher consumption of added sugar from either solid or liquid sources was associated with lower overall diet quality.

The control group (A) was given two pellets containing sorbitol and maltitol three times daily for 4 weeks, and the test group (B) received corresponding pellets with xylitol as single sweetener (total dose=6.18 g day). Clinical scoring and saliva samples were collected at baseline and immediately after the test period. The outcome measures were visible plaque index, salivary mutans streptococci counts and salivary lactic acid production. The amount of visible plaque was significantly reduced in both groups after 4 weeks (P<0.05). Likewise, the sucrose-induced lactic acid formation in saliva diminished in both groups (P<0.05). The proportion of mutans streptococci decreased significantly in the test group compared to baseline, but not in the control group (P<0.05). The alterations in the test group seemed most prominent among children without previous caries experience. The results suggest that chewing gum with xylitol or sorbitol/maltitol can reduce the amount of dental plaque and acid production in saliva in schoolchildren, but only the xylitol-containing gum may also interfere with the microbial composition.

For this study, fructose solution for pain relief was tried during heel lancing in term neonates, and to compare its effect with glucose and placebo, using a validated behavioral acute pain rating scale. In total, 34 healthy full-term neonates were studied. Randomized, masked, placebo-controlled and crossover trial were used. Each infant was assessed three times, receiving 0.5 mL of 30% fructose, 0.5 mL of 30% glucose or 0.5 mL of sterile water orally by syringe in random order, 2 min before heel lancing. Pain scores were significantly lower in 30% fructose and 30% glucose groups as compared with the placebo group. No statistically significant difference in pain scores was found between 30% fructose and 30% glucose groups. A small dose of 0.5 mL of 30% fructose solution has an equal analgesic effect with 0.5 mL of 30% glucose solution.

504,504,28315887,"Across the first four years of life, infants transition from a diet of liquids to solid foods. Flavor preferences affect the acceptance of novel foods. Fetuses experience flavors in the uterine environment, and some preferences appear to be innate. Sweet and salty foods tend to be accepted by most newborns, while bitter tastes are rejected. Breast fed infants appear to have an advantage over formula fed infants, as their exposure to a varying flavor profile is influenced by the mother's diet. Infants are fairly accepting of novel foods, but rejection of new foods increases across the initial years of life. Children learn to accept novel foods through a variety of experiences, provided within social contexts. Some children are more accepting of various sensory inputs present during mealtimes. Parents report a greater challenge getting multiple taste exposures when their child exhibits less sensory adaptability. The number of foods eaten as a young child has a strong influence on the food repertoire later in childhood. Foods eaten by parents significantly predict the number and types of foods eaten by children. Strategies to help parents be more successful in achieving taste exposures in a positive social environment need to be identified.

A mixed methods, multi-step process was used to develop the research agenda, including: (i) a scientific advisory committee; (ii) systematic reviews on strategies to reduce SSB consumption and increase water access and consumption; (iii) two stakeholder surveys to first identify and then rank strategies to reduce SSB consumption and increase water access and consumption; (iv) key informant interviews to better understand determinants of beverage consumption and strategies to improve beverage consumption patterns among high-risk groups; (v) an in-person convening with experts; and (vi) developing the final research agenda. This process included research and stakeholders from across the United States. A total of 276 participants completed survey 1 and 182 participants completed survey 2. Key informant interviews were conducted with 12 stakeholders. Thirty experts attended the convening, representing academia, government, and non-profit sectors. Thirteen key issue areas and 59 research questions were developed. Priority topics were beverage consumption recommendations, fruit-flavoured drink consumption, interventions tailored to high-risk groups, and family engagement in childcare. This research agenda lays the groundwork for research efforts to improve beverage patterns of young children.

Sugar-free home diet was maintained and an ""open"" challenge to a large dose (3 g/kg) of candy bar sucrose was given. Subsequent behavior was noted by actometer, quantitative playroom observation using several standard behavioral tests, and ability to do maze drawings. No significant changes were found on the open challenge test. A slight change from baseline was noted in seven cases on three or four behavioral parameters. Five of these children agreed to a double-blind challenge test utilizing lemon-flavored slushes of sucrose, honey, tapioca starch, or aspartame, administered after a standard lunch free of sucrose. One child reacted to both sucrose and honey and another child reacted only to sucrose. These two children were challenged a second time. The child who reacted to honey again did so according to actometer readings, but this time not by Stony Brook test. To sugar, he reacted only at the 70-minute Stony Brook. The other child reacted to placebo instead of sucrose when rechallenged. The results indicate that high doses of sugar are not related to abnormal behavior.

We performed genome-wide association scans (GWASs) of the perceived intensity of 2 sugars (glucose and fructose) and 2 high-potency sweeteners (neohesperidin dihydrochalcone and aspartame) in an Australian adolescent twin sample (n = 1757), and the perceived intensity and sweetness and the liking of sucrose in a US adult twin sample (n = 686).

There was limited support for the associations with TAS1R2, TAS1R3, and GNAT3 in all 3 European samples. Our findings indicate that genes additional to those involved in the peripheral receptor system are also associated with the sweet taste perception and intake of sweet-tasting foods.

Given the potential cross-cueing effects of e-cigarette adverts on tobacco smoking, there is an urgent need to establish whether the effect found in prior research is robust and replicable using a larger sample and a stronger control condition. A between-subjects experiment with one independent factor of two levels corresponding to the advertisements to which participants were exposed: glamorous adverts for e-cigarettes, or adverts for objects unrelated to smoking or vaping. English school children aged 11-16 (n=1449). Perceived harm of occasional smoking of one or two tobacco cigarettes was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included: perceived harm of regular tobacco smoking, susceptibility to tobacco smoking and perceived prevalence of tobacco smoking in young people. Perceptions of using e-cigarettes were gauged by adapting all the outcome measures used to assess perceptions of tobacco smoking. Tobacco smokers and e-cigarette users were excluded from analyses (final sample n=1057). Children exposed to glamorous e-cigarette adverts perceived the harms of occasional smoking of one or two tobacco cigarettes to be lower than those in the control group ( This study adds to existing evidence that exposure to e-cigarette adverts reduces children's perceptions of the harm of occasional tobacco smoking.

526,526,36682347,"Consensus has yet to be reached on the impact of early sugar introduction on early childhood dental caries (ECC). This study aimed to evaluate the association between the time of introduction of sugar in the infant's diet and ECC at 48 months, using data from the 2015 Pelotas Birth Cohort Study. This cohort comprises 4,275 children. At 48 months, 3,654 (91.1%) children had their oral health clinically evaluated by a team of 12 trained and calibrated dentists and their dental caries experience and cavitated lesions were assessed. The period of life in which sugar was first introduced into the child's diet was considered the primary exposure of the study, collected through questionnaires at 3, 12, 24, and 48 months of age. Analyses were conducted using Stata, version 15.0. Descriptive analyses were initially performed. Poisson regression with robust variance adjustment for the crude and adjusted analysis was used to estimate the effect of the sugar introduction on ECC. The highest prevalence of caries experience (43.3%) was in children in which sugar was introduced into the infant's diet before 12 months of age. A higher prevalence of caries experience was found for less educated (49.8%) and younger (51.7%) mothers, and in poorer families (48.3%). In the adjusted analysis, the experience of caries was 48% greater in the group with sugar introduction before 12 months of age, compared to those where sugar was introduced after 24 months of age In conclusion, our results support the adoption of preventive measures to delay the supply of sugar in early life in order to reduce the caries experience in children.

527,527,32348882,"Reliable pediatric pharmacotherapy in all age groups requires the availability of age-appropriate drug administration. Orodispersible films (ODF) are a promising pediatric oral dosage form. ODFs would meet relevant targets: one dosage form matching the full range of pediatric patients, a minimum of non-toxic excipients, a stable drug formulation easily to be produced. However, there is a lack of reliable data on ODFs' acceptability, swallowability and palatability, especially in young children. The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority in acceptability of a drug-free ODF in comparison to glucose syrup in children aged below one year. Secondary objectives were swallowability and palatability of the two formulations. The study was performed in an open, randomized, two-way cross-over design with three age groups: 2-28 days, 29 days-5 months, 6-12 months. 150 children (N = 50 per age group) were randomized to the order of receiving the ODF (2 × 3 cm) and age-adapted amounts of glucose syrup (0.5-3 mL). Deglutition and swallowing were assessed according to predefined evaluation criteria. The application of the formulations was documented by video to evaluate the palatability. The primary objective was confirmed: Non-inferiority of the acceptability of an ODF compared to syrup was demonstrated, even superiority of the ODF was shown (p < 0.0001). The secondary endpoints demonstrated positive results including the superior swallowability of the ODF in comparison to syrup (p < 0.0001). The palatability assessments were in favor of the ODF.

In Persian ethnomedicine, several formulations of sugarcane extracts including faniz, shekar-e- sorkh and black strap molasses have been used to treat pediatric constipation. To evaluate efficacy and safety of oral intake of black strap molasses syrup (BSM) on FC in children. A randomized controlled double blinded trial was performed on children aged 4-12 years diagnosed with FC according to ROMIII Constipation Measurement Questionnaire. Ninety-two patients were randomly divided in two groups of BSM or PEG syrups (40%) with a dose of 1 mL/kg body weight/day for 1 month. Symptoms were evaluated every two weeks. Possible serological side-effects and changes in children's body weight were investigated. BSM syrup constituents were determined by pharmacognostic methods. Treatment was successful with both interventions with no significant difference between the groups. Defecation per week was significantly improved in both groups. Symptoms including volitional stool retention, large diameter stool, painful or hard stool and large fecal mass in the rectum decreased significantly two and four weeks after intervention (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between groups except for the rate of large diameter stool. No side -effects were observed. The BSM naturally contained polyphenols (960 μg/mL), potassium (12430 μg/mL), iron (80 μg/mL) and calcium (3320 μg/mL). BSM and PEG syrups had similar efficacy on FC.

The results of this investigation are reported in this series of 3 articles. Part 1 describes the assembly and analysis of all available data on oral health, sugar consumption, fluoride availability and other preventive programmes from 20 selected countries. These data showed that nine developed countries had achieved substantial reductions in caries (25-60%) in 5- and 12-year-old children.

532,532,27136428,"The collection of peripheral blood stem cells, although now a routine procedure, is still a challenge in low body weight children because of specific technical and clinical issues. For paediatric patients it is crucial to obtain an adequate number of CD34+ cells with the minimum number of procedures: this can be done using large volume leukapheresis (LVL). We analysed the efficacy and safety of 54 autologous LVL performed in 50 children (33 [66%] males and 17 [34%] females), median age 2 years (range, 1-5) and median body weight 12 kg (range, 6-15). The procedures were performed with a COBE Spectra previously primed with red blood cells; ACD-A solution and heparin were used as anticoagulants. The target CD34+ cell dose (≥5×10/kg body weight) were collected with one LVL in 46 (92%) patients, while four (8%) patients needed another procedure. All our LVL were well tolerated. Side effects were observed in five (9.2%) patients and one procedure had to be discontinued because of catheter-related haemorrhage. The platelet count decreased significantly (p<0.001) after each procedure but without bleeding or need for transfusion support. Our experience confirms that LVL is efficient and safe even in small children, if the procedure is adjusted considering the weight and age of child. The most important factors are good venous access, adequate preparation of the child's electrolyte status, and surroundings in which the small child as well as parents feel comfortable, and can tolerate the procedure better. Although a median platelet loss of 50% can be expected, LVL is safe and reduces the overall number of procedures required. It can be recommended for peripheral blood stem cell collection even in small body weight children with malignant diseases, particularly those who mobilise low numbers of CD34+ cells.

538,538,9560854,"Bad dental hygiene in adults is usually the result of bad care during childhood. Within the framework of Health for All, WHO and the International Dental Federation defined global objectives for dental health which allow for monitoring progress in different countries. The most common dental problems, such as dental cavities, can be prevented by simple and inexpensive methods. Dental health is based on dental hygiene, nutrition, fluoride intake and dental service utilisation. Dental health promotion aims to create an environment favourable to the adoption of these healthy behaviours. The principle recommended dental health measures are through fluoridation of water, salt, and milk, a low consumption of sweets, and modification of the amount of sugar in the diet; implementation of monitored dental hygiene activities in schools; the organisation of regular dental services in schools/workplaces; and adopting legislative texts or laws requiring certain measures of prevention. In the past several years, certain African countries have set up national dental health programmes (there were 12 in 1993), However, the implementation of dental health promotion generally doesn't result from a national initiative, but from a regional or local scale. This is largely due to the lack of integration of dental health in activities of education and health promotion in general. Programmes planned at a national level and then implemented at a local level on a multisectoral base have had more success. This article presents examples of dental health promotion activities in several African countries, mainly focusing on programmes aimed at 12-13 year olds in primary school. Programmes from Morocco, Kenya, Madagascar, Côte d'Ivoire, Benin, and Tanzania are briefly presented and show that in Africa, dental health promotion has mostly consisted of the implementation of health education actions and that there are no consistent policies, unlike in other developing countries, for fluoridation of water, salt, and milk. In terms of dental health promotion, WHO recommends the promotion of traditional methods of dental hygiene (such as plants or sticks for cleaning), especially among adolescents living in rural and low income communities. In turn, the identification and promotion of the positive aspects of hygiene and traditional care will allow for the implementation of more culturally acceptable approaches.

543,543,38428799,"Sucralose, a sugar substitute first approved for use in 1991, is a non-caloric sweetener regulated globally as a food additive. Based on numerous experimental animal studies (dating to the 1980s) and human epidemiology studies, international health agencies have determined that sucralose is safe when consumed as intended. A single lifetime rodent carcinogenicity bioassay conducted by the Ramazzini Institute (RI) reported that mice fed diets containing sucralose develop hematopoietic neoplasia, but controversy continues regarding the validity and relevance of these data for predicting health effects in humans. The present paper addresses the controversy by providing the perspective of experienced pathologists on sucralose-related animal toxicity and carcinogenicity data generally, and the RI carcinogenicity bioassay findings specifically, using results from publicly available papers and international regulatory authority decisions. In the authors' view, flaws in the design, methodology, data evaluation, and reporting of the RI carcinogenicity bioassay for sucralose diminish the value of the data as evidence that this agent represents a carcinogenic hazard to humans. This limitation will remain until the RI bioassay is repeated under Good Laboratory Practices and the design, data, and accuracy of the pathology diagnoses and interpretations are reviewed by qualified pathologists with experience in evaluating potential chemically-induced carcinogenic hazards.

Since excessive dietary sugar intake may be an initiating factor for NAFLD, we have characterized the metabolic effects of liquid sucrose intake at concentrations relevant to typical human consumption in mice. We report that sucrose intake induces sexually dimorphic effects in liver, adipose tissue, and the microbiome; differences concordant with steatosis severity. We show that when steatosis is decoupled from impairments in insulin responsiveness, sex is a moderating factor that influences sucrose-driven lipid storage and the contribution of de novo fatty acid synthesis to the overall hepatic triglyceride pool. Our findings provide physiologic insight into how sex influences the regulation of adipose-liver crosstalk and highlight the importance of extrahepatic metabolism in the pathogenesis of diet-induced steatosis and NAFLD.

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 19,742 respondents of single-day 24-h dietary recalls in the nationally representative 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey-Nutrition. Poisson regressions were used to estimate the prevalence of consuming each beverage type on a given day. Among consumers on a given day, linear regressions were used to estimate mean energy intake. Models included household education, food security and income quintiles as separate unadjusted exposures. Sex-specific models were estimated separately for children/adolescents (2-18 years) and adults (19 +). Among female children/adolescents, the prevalence of consuming sugary drinks and, separately, SSB ranged from 11 to 21 and 8 to 27 percentage-points higher among lower education compared to 'Bachelor degree or above' households. In female adults, the prevalence of consuming sugary drinks and, separately, SSB was 10 (95% CI: 1, 19) and 14 (95% CI: 2, 27) percentage-points higher in food insecure compared to secure households. In males, the prevalence of consuming 100% juice was 9 (95% CI: - 18, 0) percentage-points lower among food insecure compared to secure households. Social inequities in energy intake were observed in female adult consumers, among whom mean energy from sugary drinks was 27 kcal (95% CI: 3, 51) higher among food insecure compared to secure and 35 kcal (95% CI: 2, 67) higher from 100% juice among 'less than high school' education compared to 'Bachelor degree or above' households. Social inequities in sugary drink consumption exist in Canada. The associations differed by SEP indicator. Equitable interventions to reduce consumption are warranted. RéSUMé: OBJECTIF: Dresser le portrait de la consommation de boissons sucrées (boissons contenant des sucres libres), de boissons contenant du sucre ajouté et de jus purs à 100 % (boissons contenant des sucres naturels) chez la population canadienne en fonction du statut socioéconomique. MéTHODE: Nous avons effectué une analyse transversale des rappels alimentaires de 24 heures réalisés par 19 742 personnes dans le cadre de l’Enquête sur la santé dans les collectivités canadiennes – Nutrition 2015, laquelle est représentative de la population nationale. Nous avons utilisé la régression de Poisson pour estimer la prévalence de la consommation de chaque type de boisson durant un jour donné. Pour calculer l’apport énergétique quotidien moyen, nous avons utilisé des régressions linéaires. Les modèles d’analyse traitent la scolarité, la sécurité alimentaire et les quintiles de revenu des ménages comme des expositions non ajustées distinctes. L’analyse en fonction du sexe est divisée en deux groupes, soit les enfants et adolescents (2 à 18 ans) et les adultes (19 ans et plus). RéSULTATS: Chez les filles et les adolescentes, la prévalence de la consommation de boissons sucrées et de boissons contenant du sucre ajouté est plus élevée (de 11 à 21 points de pourcentage et de 8 à 27 points de pourcentage, respectivement) dans les ménages moins scolarisés que dans les ménages plus scolarisés (baccalauréat et études supérieures). Chez les femmes vivant de l’insécurité alimentaire, la prévalence de la consommation de boissons sucrées et de boissons contenant du sucre ajouté est plus élevée de 10 points de pourcentage (IC de 95 % : 1, 19) et de 14 points de pourcentage (IC de 95 % : 2, 27), respectivement, que chez celles qui n’en vivent pas. Chez les sujets masculins, la prévalence de consommation des jus purs à 100 % est moins élevée de 9 points de pourcentage (IC de 95 % : -18, 0) dans les ménages vivant de l’insécurité alimentaire. Nous avons remarqué des disparités sur le plan social dans l’apport énergétique chez les femmes; l’apport moyen provenant de boissons sucrées est plus élevé de 27 kcal (IC de 95% : 3, 51) dans les ménages vivant de l’insécurité alimentaire, et l’apport moyen provenant de jus pur à 100 % est plus élevé de 35 kcal (IC de 95 % : 2, 67) dans les ménages moins scolarisés (pas de diplôme d’études secondaires) que chez les ménages plus scolarisés (baccalauréat et études supérieures). CONCLUSION: Il existe des disparités sur le plan social dans la consommation de boissons sucrées au Canada. Les résultats variaient en fonction de l’indicateur de statut économique. Nous recommandons des interventions équitables pour réduire la consommation de ces boissons.

547,547,38327254,"Genetic sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (GSID) is an inherited deficiency in the ability to digest sucrose and potentially starch due to mutations in the sucrase-isomaltase (SI) gene. Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency is historically considered to be a rare condition affecting infants with chronic diarrhea as exposure to dietary sucrose begins. Growing evidence suggests that individuals with SI variants may present later in life, with symptoms overlapping with those of irritable bowel syndrome. The presence of SI genetic variants may, either alone or in combination, affect enzyme activity and lead to symptoms of different severity. As such, a more appropriate term for this inherited condition is GSID, with a recognition of a spectrum of severity and onset of presentation. Currently, disaccharidase assay on duodenal mucosal tissue homogenates is the gold standard in diagnosing SI deficiency. A deficiency in the SI enzyme can be present at birth (genetic) or acquired later, often in association with damage to the enteric brush-border membrane. Other noninvasive diagnostic alternatives such as sucrose breath tests may be useful but require further validation. Management of GSID is based on sucrose and potentially starch restriction tailored to the individual patients' tolerance and symptoms. As this approach may be challenging, additional treatment with commercially available sacrosidase is available. However, some patients may require continued starch restriction. Further research is needed to clarify the true prevalence of SI deficiency, the pathobiology of single SI heterozygous mutations, and to define optimal diagnostic and treatment algorithms in the pediatric population.

We analyzed data of 4,047 adolescents aged 12-19 years from the 2005-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey. We estimated the usual percentage of calories (%kcal) from added sugars using up to two 24-hour dietary recalls and the National Cancer Institute method to account for measurement error. The average usual %kcal from added sugars was 16.0%. Most adolescents (88.0%) had usual intake of ≥10% of total energy, and 5.5% had usual intake of ≥25% of total energy. After adjustment for potential confounders, usual %kcal from added sugars was inversely associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and positively associated with triglycerides (TGs), TG-to-HDL ratio, and total cholesterol (TC) to HDL ratio. Comparing the lowest and highest quintiles of intake, HDLs were 49.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 47.4-51.6) and 46.4 mg/dL (95% CI, 45.2-47.6; p = .009), TGs were 85.6 (95% CI, 75.5-95.6) and 101.2 mg/dL (95% CI, 88.7-113.8; p = .037), TG to HDL ratios were 2.28 (95% CI, 1.84-2.70) and 2.73 (95% CI, 2.11-3.32; p = .017), and TC to HDL ratios were 3.41 (95% CI, 3.03-3.79) and 3.70 (95% CI, 3.24-4.15; p = .028), respectively. Comparing the highest and lowest quintiles of intake, adjusted odds ratio of dyslipidemia was 1.41 (95% CI, 1.01-1.95).

549,549,38880404,"Sucralose, the extensively utilized sweetener, might lead to metabolic disorders with prolonged consumption, but it remains uncertain if sucralose has any impact on female reproductive health. We incorporated sucralose into drinking water and observed food intake, body weight, estrous cycle, follicular development, serum hormones, and insulin sensitivity of mice. The mice did not experience any changes in their food intake or body weight after consuming sucralose. However, they displayed irregularities in the estrous cycle, marked by a reduced count of primordial, primary, and secondary follicles, coupled with a significant increase in the number of antral follicles. There was a decline in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), and progesterone (P4) levels, while testosterone (T) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels surged, leading to a notable elevation in the LH / FSH ratio. Sucralose also induced insulin resistance, as evidenced by elevated insulin levels and impaired insulin tolerance, which responded to an increase in bacterial-derived serum endotoxin. By eliminating insulin resistance with rosiglitazone (RSG), eradicating intestinal flora-derived endotoxins with neomycin (NEO), or enhancing intestinal barrier function with indole-3-carbinol (I3C), the abnormalities in estrous cycle, disruptions in follicular development, hormonal imbalances and elevation in serum endotoxins induced by sucralose were successfully reversed. The present study indicates that sucralose-induced follicular dysplasia in mice is probably related to impaired intestinal permeability, infiltration of endotoxins, initiation of systemic inflammation, and insulin resistance.

Thus, the study aims to explore dietary patterns and their associations with overweight/obesity among preschool children in the Dongcheng District of Beijing. With a stratified proportionate cluster sampling, the study included 3373 pairs of preschool children and their guardians. Children's weight and height were measured by school nurses, and their food and beverage consumption frequencies were reported by guardians via a food frequency questionnaire. Children's age, gender, physical activity time, and sedentary time, as well as their parents' highest level of educational attainment, occupation, weight, and height were also collected. Dietary patterns were identified through exploratory factor analysis. Among these identified dietary patterns, the one with the largest factor score was defined as the predominant dietary pattern for each child. The associations between predominant dietary patterns and overweight/obesity were tested by two-level random-intercept logistic models with cluster-robust standard errors. Four dietary patterns, i.e., a ""Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) and snack"" pattern, a ""Chinese traditional"" pattern, a ""Health conscious"" pattern, and a ""Snack"" pattern, were identified.

The aim of this study is to determine if taste and smell dysfunction is present in childhood cancer survivors (CCS). Food preference and Quality of Life was also assessed. Fifty-one child cancer survivors (mean age: 19.69±7.09years), more than five years since treatment completion, (mean: 12.4years) were recruited from the long term follow-up clinics at two Sydney-based children's hospitals. Taste function was assessed using a 25 sample taste identification test comprising five concentrations each of sweet, salty, sour and bitter tastes and water. Smell function was assessed by determining the ability of participants to identify 16 common odorants. The participants' Quality of Life was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Anorexia Cachexia scale and food preferences were assessed using a 94-item food liking tool. Taste dysfunction was found in 27.5% of participants (n=14), and smell dysfunction in 3.9% (n=2) of participants. The prevalence of taste dysfunction was higher than that seen in the non-cancer population. The child cancer survivors' appeared to ""like"" the less healthy food groups such as flavoured beverages, takeaway and snacks over healthier food groups such as vegetables and salad. No correlation was found between those with a taste dysfunction and their food ""likes"". A high level of taste dysfunction was found in CCS though there did not appear to be an issue with smell dysfunction. Further work is also needed to assess whether a taste dysfunction do play a role in the dietary habits of CCS.

557,557,29211705,"This report summarises a workshop convened by ILSI Europe on 3 and 4 April 2017 to discuss the issue of dietary sweetness. The objectives were to understand the roles of sweetness in the diet, establish whether exposure to sweetness affects diet quality and energy intake, and consider whether sweetness per se affects health. Although there may be evidence for tracking of intake of some sweet components of the diet through childhood, evidence for tracking of whole diet sweetness, or through other stages of maturity are lacking. The evidence to date does not support adverse effects of sweetness on diet quality or energy intake, except where sweet food choices increase intake of free sugars. There is some evidence for improvements in diet quality and reduced energy intake where sweetness without calories replaces sweetness with calories. There is a need to understand the physiological and metabolic relevance of sweet taste receptors on the tongue, in the gut and elsewhere in the body, as well as possible differentiation in the effects of sustained consumption of individual sweeteners. Despite a plethora of studies, there is no consistent evidence for an association of sweetness sensitivity/preference with obesity or type 2 diabetes. A multifaceted integrated approach, characterising nutritive and sensory aspects of the whole diet or dietary patterns, may be more valuable in providing contextual insight. The outcomes of the workshop could be used as a scientific basis to inform the expert community and create more useful dialogue among health care professionals.

Children and adults on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion were enrolled into a study with a crossover design. Each episode of hypoglycaemia (defined as capillary glucose <4.0 mmol/l) was randomly assigned one of two treatment protocols using glucose tablets: either 0.3 g/kg body weight or usual treatment with 15 g (adults) or 10 g (children) for capillary glucose levels 3-3.9 mmol/l or twice these doses for capillary glucose levels <3 mmol/l. All participants received each treatment in random order for up to 10 hypoglycaemic episodes. Glucose levels were re-tested 10 min after treatment, with a repeat dose if still <4 mmol/l. Of the 37 participants enrolled, 35 (aged 6-68 years) completed the study. Twenty-four participants completed all treatment episodes, while 10 participants had <10 hypoglycaemic episodes and two withdrew without data.

559,559,8747098,"Adverse behavioral responses to ingestion of any kind of candy have been reported repeatedly in the lay press. Parents and teachers alike attribute excessive motor activity and other disruptive behaviors to candy consumption. However, anecdotal observations of this kind need to be tested scientifically before conclusions can be drawn, and criteria for interpreting diet behavior studies must be rigorous. Ingredients in nonchocolate candy (sugar, artificial food colors), components in chocolate candy (sugar, artificial food colors in coatings, caffeine), and chocolate itself have been investigated for any adverse effects on behavior. Feingold theorized that food additives (artificial colors and flavors) and natural salicylates caused hyperactivity in children and elimination of these components would result in dramatic improvement in behavior. Numerous double-blind studies of the Feingold hypothesis have led to the rejection of the idea that this elimination diet has any benefit beyond the normal placebo effect. Although sugar is widely believed by the public to cause hyperactive behavior, this has not been scientifically substantiated. Twelve double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of sugar challenges failed to provide any evidence that sugar ingestion leads to untoward behavior in children with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or in normal children. Likewise, none of the studies testing candy or chocolate found any negative effect of these foods on behavior. For children with behavioral problems, diet-oriented treatment does not appear to be appropriate. Rather, clinicians treating these children recommend a multidisciplinary approach. The goal of diet treatment is to ensure a balanced diet with adequate energy and nutrients for optimal growth.

560,560,25893716,"Breakfast consumption has been recommended as part of a healthy diet. Recently, ready-to-eat cereals (RTEC) became more popular as a breakfast item. Our aim was to analyse the dietary characteristics of an RTEC breakfast in European adolescents and to compare them with other breakfast options. From the European multi-centre HELENA study, two 24-h dietary recalls of 3137 adolescents were available. Food items (RTEC or bread, milk/yoghurt, fruit) and macro- and micronutrient intakes at breakfast were calculated. Cross-sectional regression analyses were adjusted for gender, age, socio-economic status and city. Compared to bread breakfasts (39 %) and all other breakfasts (41.5 %), RTEC breakfast (19.5 %) was associated with improved nutrient intake (less fat and less sucrose; more fibre, protein and some micronutrients like vitamin B, calcium, magnesium and phosphorus) at the breakfast occasion. Exceptions were more simple sugars in RTEC breakfast consumers: more lactose and galactose due to increased milk consumption, but also higher glucose and fructose than bread consumers. RTEC consumers had a significantly higher frequency (92.5 vs. 50.4 and 60.2 %) and quantity of milk/yoghurt intake and a slightly higher frequency of fruit intake (13.4 vs. 10.9 and 8.0 %) at breakfast. Among European adolescents, RTEC consumers showed a more favourable nutrient intake than consumers of bread or other breakfasts, except for simple sugars. Therefore, RTEC may be regarded as a good breakfast option as part of a varied and balanced diet. Nevertheless, more research is warranted concerning the role of different RTEC types in nutrient intake, especially for simple sugars.

Secondary goals of this study were to determine the extent to which MVPA confounded the associations between diet and adiposity and whether associations between diet and adiposity would differ depending on reporting error. An ethnically diverse urban sample of 342 children aged 9-10 years and 323 adolescents aged 17-18 years were recruited for this cross-sectional study. Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) were measured in the school; dietary assessment included three 24-hour recalls via telephone in the evenings, and MVPA assessment included 5 days of accelerometry. Over (n = 68), under (n = 250), or plausible (n = 347) dietary intake reporters were identified with the Huang calculation method. Linear regression assessed the relationship between adiposity indicators (BMI z-score and WC) and components of the diet (energy intake, food groups, macronutrients) after controlling for reporting error, demographic variables, and MVPA. When dietary reporting error and potential confounders such as MVPA and demographic variables were controlled, energy intake (EI), vegetables, refined grains, total fat, total protein, and total carbohydrate were positively related to BMI z-score and WC and artificially sweetened beverages to WC. MVPA was a significant confounder. For BMI z-score, but not WC, relationships and strength of these relationships differed depending on dietary reporting error group (plausible, underreporter, overreporter). Among plausible reporters, as expected, EI, refined grains, and all macronutrients were positively related to adiposity; however, artificially sweetened beverages and vegetables, which are low-energy-dense foods, were also positively related to adiposity. Reporting error interfered with associations between diet and BMI z-score but not WC, suggesting WC is a more robust measure of adiposity in relation to diet.

Youth were asked about their SSB consumption (soda, sports drinks, and fruit-flavored drinks), and parents were asked about their attitudes, consumption, and home availability of SSBs. We estimated expected rates of youth SSB consumption for hypothetical parents at very low (5th) and very high (95th) percentiles for home/parental risk factors (ie, they consumed little, had negative attitudes, and did not keep SSBs in the home; or they consumed a lot, had positive attitudes, and did keep SSBs in the home). Youth of lower-risk parents (at the 5th percentile) were estimated to drink substantially less of each type of beverage than did youth of higher-risk parents (at the 95th percentile). For example, youth with higher-risk parents averaged nearly double the SSB consumption of youth of lower-risk parents (2.77 vs 1.37 glasses on the previous day; overall model significance F Results suggest a need to focus on parental and home environmental factors when intervening to reduce youths' SSB consumption.

Such measures should be based on a theoretical framework, acknowledging the dynamic and complex nature of interactions occurring within a family. The aim of the Family & Dietary habits (F&D) project was to develop a conceptual framework identifying important and changeable family processes influencing dietary behaviours of 13-15 year olds. A second aim was to develop valid and reliable questionnaires for adolescents and their parents (both mothers and fathers) measuring these processes. A stepwise approach was used; (1) preparation of scope and structure, (2) development of the F&D questionnaires, (3) the conducting of pilot studies and (4) the conducting of validation studies (assessing internal reliability, test-retest reliability and confirmatory factor analysis) using data from a cross-sectional study. The conceptual framework includes psychosocial concepts such as family functioning, cohesion, conflicts, communication, work-family stress, parental practices and parental style. The physical characteristics of the home environment include accessibility and availability of different food items, while family meals are the sociocultural setting included. Individual characteristics measured are dietary intake (vegetables and sugar-sweetened beverages) and adolescents' impulsivity. The F&D questionnaires developed were tested in a test-retest (54 adolescents and 44 of their parents) and in a cross-sectional survey including 440 adolescents (13-15 year olds), 242 mothers and 155 fathers. The samples appear to be relatively representative for Norwegian adolescents and parents. For adolescents, mothers and fathers, the test-retest reliability of the dietary intake, frequencies of (family) meals, work-family stress and communication variables was satisfactory (ICC: 0.53-0.99).

The internal reliability (Cronbach's alphas: 0.77/0.82) and test-retest reliability values (ICC: 0.74/0.77) of BIS-Brief were good. The conceptual framework developed may be a useful tool in guiding measurement and assessment of the home food environment and family processes related to adolescents' dietary habits, in particular and for EBRBs more generally.

567,567,16175806,"The decision to begin eating or to stop eating is a complex process. Hunger is primarily driven by hunger signals, like ghrelin and neuropeptide Y, originating from the gastrointestinal tract and from the hypothalamus. The hunger signals stimulate the seeking of food and the eating, being activating for the body and mind. Thirty minutes after the start of eating, satiety signals arise from the intestinal tract and, in between meals, from the adipose tissue and liver. Satiety signals are sedative and arrest the processing of food in the intestine, hence leading to termination of eating. One problem with overeating today is the ready access to palatable food, such as sucrose and fat. The palatable food works by weakening the satiety signals and activating the hunger signals. The reward system with endogenous opiates may also be activated. Food and drinks rich in sucrose and fat should be given in a restricted way to children, since there is no biological control feedback to regulate the intake of such products.

Twelve percent of mothers delayed introducing sweets/fruit juice, 93% continued offering initially refused foods, and 32% introduced flavor/texture variety early.

The sugar (sugars g/100 mL), energy (kcal/100 mL), caffeine (mg/100 mL) and serving size were collected from product packaging and nutrition information panels of energy drinks available in the nine main UK grocery retailers, three health and beauty retailers and one convenience store. The number of formulations (per 100 mL) and number of products (per serving) have fallen (from 75 to 49 and from 90 to 59) between 2015 and 2017, respectively. Energy drinks surveyed showed a 10% reduction in sugar, from 10.6 to 9.5 g/100 mL (P=0.011) and a 6% reduction in energy content (P=0.005) per 100 mL between 2015 and 2017. The average caffeine content of energy drinks, with a warning label, has remained high at 31.5±0.9 in 2015 and 31.3±1.0 mg/100 mL in 2017. Despite there being reductions, sugar, energy and caffeine content remain at concerning levels in 2017. To reduce the harmful impact of energy drinks, further reduction in sugar and a reduction in caffeine by reformulation are urgently needed. Other measures such as ban on the sale of energy drinks to children and smaller product sizes should also be explored, while warning labels should be kept. A reduction in sugar, energy and caffeine content and overall energy drinks consumption could be beneficial in reducing sugar, energy and caffeine intake of consumers of energy drinks.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 2-year changes in the types of foods and beverages served during a community-based intervention designed to achieve the Healthy Eating Standards. Randomized delayed treatment trial with an immediate (1-year baseline and 2-year intervention) or delayed (2-year baseline and 1-year intervention) group. Twenty ASPs serving 1,700 children (aged 5-12 years) were recruited, with baseline occurring spring 2013, and outcome assessment occurring spring 2014 and 2015. The multistep intervention, Strategies To Enhance Practice for Healthy Eating, assisted ASP leaders/staff to serve foods/beverages that meet the nutrition standards. The foods and beverages served for snack were observed directly. Compared with non-intervention years, both the immediate and delayed groups increased the number of days/week that fruits/vegetables (0.6 vs 1.7 days/week and 0.6 vs 4.4 days/week, OR=3.80, 95% CI=1.45, 9.95) and water (2.3 vs 3.7 days/week and 2.7 vs 4.8 days/week, OR=4.65, 95% CI=1.69, 12.79) were served.

575,575,9511836,"Mutans streptococci (MS) are the primary pathogens involved in the development of early childhood caries. However, factors that may affect their acquisition in the mouths of young children are not well understood, and the period of initial colonization remains controversial. This study investigated the relationship of age, number of teeth, and bottle usage/content with regard to the isolation of MS in 6-24-month-old children. A total of 122 children from low-income families attending a nutritional supplement program, and their mothers, participated in this study. Children were examined for dental caries and number of erupted teeth and were sampled for MS. Mothers were administered a questionnaire to obtain details of baby bottle use, including what food items were put in the bottle during the last week. MS was detected in more than one-third of the 6-24-month-olds. Unlike some studies that suggest a later period of infectivity, approximately 20% of children under 14 months of age, including 4 of 22 infants aged 6-9 months, were colonized with MS. When examined separately, age, number of teeth, and bottle usage/content were each found to be related to the presence of MS. Mutans streptococci colonization was more likely with increasing age and number of teeth, and children whose bottles contained sweetened beverages were more likely to be colonized than children whose bottles contained milk. Logistic regression models that controlled for both age and number of teeth indicated that children who consumed sweetened beverages in their baby bottle had a statistically significant, four-fold increase in the odds of colonization by MS relative to children who consumed milk. The finding that approximately 20% of the children under 14 months of age were infected with MS indicates that colonization in this sample of low-income preschool children may begin earlier than suggested by some investigations. Additionally, the risk of MS colonization appears lower among infants who consume milk rather than sweetened beverages in the bottle.

In 2020, 124 countries have legislation for mandatory salt iodization and 21 have legislation allowing voluntary iodization. As a result, 88% of the global population uses iodized salt. For population surveys, the urinary iodine concentration (UIC) should be measured and expressed as the median, in μg/L. The quality of available survey data is high: UIC surveys have been done in 152 out of 194 countries in the past 15 years; in 132 countries, the studies were nationally representative. The number of countries with adequate iodine intake has nearly doubled from 67 in 2003 to 118 in 2020. However, 21 countries remain deficient, while 13 countries have excessive intakes, either due to excess groundwater iodine, or over-iodized salt. Iodine programs are reaching the poorest of the poor: of the 15 poorest countries in the world, 10 are iodine sufficient and only 3 (Burundi, Mozambique and Madagascar) remain mild-to-moderately deficient. Nigeria and India have unstable food systems and millions of malnourished children, but both are iodine-sufficient and population coverage with iodized salt is a remarkable 93% in both. Once entrenched, iodine programs are often surprisingly durable even during national crises, for example, war-torn Afghanistan and Yemen are iodine-sufficient. However, the equity of iodized salt programs within countries remains an important issue.

Participants completed an Internet-based discrete choice experiment to reveal their preferences for, and trade-offs between, the attributes of hypothetical waterpipe smoking sessions. Participants were presented with waterpipe lounge menus, each with three fruit-flavoured options and one tobacco flavoured option, in addition to an opt out option. Nicotine content and price were provided for each choice. Participants were randomised to either receive menus with a text-only health-warning message or no message. Multinomial and nested logit models were used to estimate the impact on consumer choice of attributes and between-subject assignment of health warnings respectively. On average, participants preferred fruit-flavoured varieties to tobacco flavour. They were averse to options labelled with higher nicotine content. Females and non-smokers of cigarettes were more likely than their counterparts to prefer flavoured and nicotine-free varieties. Participants exposed to a health warning were more likely to opt out. Fruit-flavoured tobacco and lower nicotine content labels, two strategies widely used by the industry, increase the demand for waterpipe smoking among young adults.

However, there is little evidence regarding their biological effects, particularly during development. Here, we used a mouse model of maternal LCS consumption to explore the impact of perinatal LCS exposure on the development of neural systems involved in metabolic regulation. We report that adult male, but not female, offspring from both aspartame- and rebaudioside A-exposed dams displayed increased adiposity and developed glucose intolerance. Moreover, maternal LCS consumption reorganized hypothalamic melanocortin circuits and disrupted parasympathetic innervation of pancreatic islets in male offspring. We then identified phenylacetylglycine (PAG) as a unique metabolite that was upregulated in the milk of LCS-fed dams and the serum of their pups. Furthermore, maternal PAG treatment recapitulated some of the key metabolic and neurodevelopmental abnormalities associated with maternal LCS consumption. Together, our data indicate that maternal LCS consumption has enduring consequences on the offspring's metabolism and neural development and that these effects are likely to be mediated through the gut microbial co-metabolite PAG.

The mean total air flow was 637.60 ± 76.18 mL/s (range 490-760 mL/s). The mean total nasal airway resistance was 0.24 ± 0.03 Pa/mL s (range 0.20-0.31 Pa/mL s). In terms of the degree of nasal air flow and nasal airway resistance and the total air flow and total nasal airway resistance of each nostril, there was no difference between the 2 groups. The results obtained in anterior rhinomanometry and saccharin test showed that there was no statistically significant difference between CCHF (+) patients and controls. These results suggest us that CCHF virus infection does not affect nasal physiology.

Fructose, a major component of SSBs, may acutely trigger inflammation, which may be one link between SSB consumption and cardiometabolic disease. We sought to determine whether beverages sweetened with fructose, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), and glucose differentially influence systemic inflammation [fasting plasma C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 (IL-6) as primary endpoints] acutely and before major changes in body weight. Secondary endpoints included adipose tissue inflammation, intestinal permeability, and plasma fetuin-A as potential mechanistic links between fructose intake and low-grade inflammation. We conducted a randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover design dietary intervention (the Diet and Systemic Inflammation Study) in 24 normal-weight to obese adults without fructose malabsorption. Participants drank 4 servings/d of fructose-, glucose-, or HFCS-sweetened beverages accounting for 25% of estimated calorie requirements while consuming a standardized diet ad libitum for three 8-d periods. Subjects consumed 116% of their estimated calorie requirement while drinking the beverages with no difference in total energy intake or body weight between groups as reported previously. Fasting plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein and IL-6 did not differ significantly at the end of the 3 diet periods. We did not detect a consistent differential effect of the diets on measures of adipose tissue inflammation except for adiponectin gene expression in adipose tissue (P = 0.005), which was lowest after the glucose phase. We also did not detect consistent evidence of a differential impact of these sugars on measures of intestinal permeability (lactulose:mannitol test, plasma zonulin, and plasma lipopolysaccharide-binding protein).

Granulation experiments were performed incorporating PZQ either in the powder mixture, according to the traditional way, or in the liquid phase containing wetting agents. In the powder mixture several excipients were tested: Flowlac 100 as filler, Galeniq 721 (isomalt) and Neosorb P 100 T (D-sorbitol) as sweeteners and PVP K30 as binder; while in the liquid phase Lutrol F68, Cremophor RH 40 or Tween 80 as surfactants were investigated. Different formulations loaded with 10% w/w (batches 1-8) and 20% w/w of PZQ (batches 9-13) were produced The majority of granules displayed good flow properties and uniform drug content. X-ray powder diffraction showed that PZQ remained in its original crystalline state, while differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform-infrared analysis evidenced the formation of chemical interactions among the ingredients. The solubilisation test performed in non-sink condition to reproduce the actual condition in which a child of 4 years takes the medicine revealed that granules quickly formed a very fine suspension in water (dV90=39.9 μm). Although after the granulation process the solubility of raw PZQ was not increased, adding the aqueous suspension to 500 ml of buffer solution of pH 1.5, simulating the fasted state of a child, 50% of the drug was dissolved after 30 min. After granule manipulation with milk and fruit juices, no PZQ degradation was observed during time. Finally, the selected granule formulation provided evidence to be stable even at hot and very humid climate (30°C/75% RH), at least for the examined time.

595,595,29025999,"To assess the retail availability of cigar products that refer to marijuana and the largest package size of cigarillos available for ≤$1. Trained data collectors conducted marketing surveillance in a random sample of licensed tobacco retailers that sold little cigars/cigarillos (LCCs) (n=530) near a statewide sample of middle and high schools (n=132) in California. Multilevel models examined the presence of marijuana co-marketing and cigarillo pack size as a function of school/neighbourhood characteristics and adjusted for store type. Of stores that sold LCCs, approximately 62% contained at least one form of marijuana co-marketing: 53.2% sold cigar wraps marketed as blunt wraps, 27.2% sold cigarillos marketed as blunts and 26.0% sold at least one LCC with a marijuana-related 'concept' flavour. Controlling for store type, marijuana co-marketing was more prevalent in school neighbourhoods with a higher proportion of young residents (ages 5-17 years) and with lower median household income. Nearly all stores that sold LCCs (87.9%) offered the products for ≤$1. However, significantly larger packs at similarly low prices were available near schools in lower-income neighbourhoods and with a lower percentage of Hispanic students. Understanding how the tobacco industry manipulates cigar products and marketing to capitalise on the appeal of marijuana to youth and other priority populations is important to inform regulation, particularly for flavoured tobacco products. In addition, the retail availability of five and six packs of LCCs for ≤$1 near California schools underscores policy recommendations to establish minimum prices for multipacks.

In order for such policies to be successful it is important to understand the positions of key stakeholders. This research investigated New Zealand (NZ) stakeholders' views on the feasibility and acceptability of selected health-related food taxes and subsidies over the next 5 to 10 years. Twenty semi-structured interviews were undertaken by telephone from November 2014 to May 2015. The purposive sample of key stakeholders included politicians, bureaucrats, public health experts, food industry leaders and consumer representatives. Prior to interviews participants were sent summary information on the estimated impacts of a range of health-related food taxes and subsidies on dietary intake and mortality. According to key stakeholders there appears to be little appetite for taxes on foods high in saturated fat or salt in NZ. Stakeholders largely agreed that a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and a subsidy on fruit and vegetables were both feasible and likely acceptable. There was strong support for starting with a SSBs tax, possibly framed around protecting children and dental health. Addressing obesity and noncommunicable diseases is a multidimensional challenge. A tax on SSBs and a subsidy on fruit and vegetables, possibly in tandem, could be part of the solution in NZ.

We have developed a novel chocolate-based drug delivery platform to taste-mask bitter drugs commonly utilised in the hospital setting, but there is limited evidence regarding parent's perspectives on these medications. Aim To identify key themes regarding parents' perspectives on taste-masked medications that look like confectionary. Additionally, to explore and identify the various barriers and facilitators to using oral medication among the paediatric population.Methods Qualitative descriptive study (July to August 2020) at a single tertiary paediatric hospital (Perth Children's Hospital-PCH). Parents with at least one child (2-18 years) that underwent any elective operation at PCH were included in the study, in total 17 were interviewed. Results The two primary themes that underpinned parent's perspectives on taste-masked medications that look like confectionary were medication safety and taste. Majority of parents supported the use of the proposed medication on the basis that the favourable taste profile will facilitate oral consumption, as opposed to their previous experiences with conventional paediatric medications that do not taste mask the bitter flavour. However, medication safety, in the forms of patient education and appropriate packaging, must be considered to minimise harmful misuse of the proposed medication. Conclusion Participants unanimously support the short-term use of taste-masked medications that look like confectionary, particularly in the hospital setting.

Restaurant foods and beverages are second only to grocery store foods and beverages in their contribution to total energy intake of U.S. 4- to 11-year-olds. Shifting their restaurant consumption in healthier directions could have a positive impact on child health. In 2014 this study examined self-reported child receptivity and parent awareness of child receptivity to ordering a fruit or vegetable side dish instead of French fries; and milk, water, or flavored water instead of soda/pop with a kids' meal when eating out. Child receptivity to side dishes was compared between 2010 and 2014. An online survey was administered by Nielsen via their Harris Poll Online to a national panel of 711 parents and their 8- to 12-year-old child, as part of a larger study. Frequencies, logistic regressions, t-tests, chi-square tests, and percent agreement were used to evaluate child likelihood of ordering certain side dishes; receptivity to healthier side dish and beverage alternatives; changes in receptivity to healthier sides across years; and parent awareness. A majority of children said they were likely to order a meal with a vegetable (60%), fruit (78%), or French fry (93%) side dish. They were receptive to receiving a fruit or vegetable (FV) side dish instead of French fries (68%); or milk, water, or flavored water instead of soda (81%) with their restaurant kids' meal. Liking/taste was the most common reason for children's feelings. Child receptivity to a FV side dish instead of French fries was high in both years and significantly higher in 2014 (t = -2.12, p = 0.034). The majority of parent and child reports of child receptivity were concordant (85%).

Moreover, a significant association was found between fast food consumption, BP levels, and anthropometric indices (except for WHtR and WHR). Sweet beverages consumption was significantly associated with anthropometric indices; however, the consumption of salty snacks was only significantly associated with height, HC, and WHR.

We address whether, compared to other foods, does consumption of SSB (1) automatically lead to failure to compensate for the energy it contains? (2) fail to elicit homeostatic hormone responses? (3) promote hedonic eating through activation of the brain's reward pathways? We followed the evidence to address: (4) Would restriction of targeted marketing of SSB and other unhealthy foods to vulnerable populations decrease their prevalence of obesity? The data are lacking to demonstrate that SSB consumption promotes body weight gain compared with isocaloric consumption of other beverages or foods and that this is linked to its failure to elicit adequate homeostatic hormone responses. However, more recent data have linked body weight gain to reward activation in the brain to palatable food cues and suggest that sweet tastes and SSB consumption heightens the reward response to food cues. Studies investigating the specificity of these responses have not been conducted. Nevertheless, the current data provide a biological basis to the body of evidence demonstrating that the targeted marketing (real life palatable food cues) of SSB and other unhealthy foods to vulnerable populations, including children and people of color and low socioeconomic status, is increasing their risk for obesity. While the mechanisms for the association between SSB consumption and body weight gain cannot be identified, current scientific evidence strongly suggests that proactive environmental measures to reduce exposure to palatable food cues in the form of targeting marketing will decrease the risk of obesity in vulnerable populations.

607,607,32885485,"Maternal abnormal glucose tolerance during pregnancy may adversely affect offspring cognition and behaviour, but few prospective studies investigated this association at multiple points throughout childhood. We hypothesised that maternal abnormal glucose tolerance is associated with child cognitive and behavioural outcomes in early and mid-childhood. We examined the associations of maternal abnormal glucose tolerance at 26-28 weeks of pregnancy with offspring cognitive and behavioural scores in 1421 children in the Project Viva pre-birth cohort. In early (mean 3.3 years) and mid-childhood (mean 7.9 years), we measured child cognition using validated instruments, the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test, Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning, and the Wide Range Assessment of Visual Motor Abilities (WRAVMA); we assessed parent- and teacher-rated behavioural outcomes with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the Behavioural Rating Inventory of Executive Function. We used linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders (maternal race/ethnicity, pre-pregnancy BMI, intelligence, age, parity, smoking status, education, and household income at enrolment, in addition to child's sex and age at assessment). Of 1421 mothers, 69 (4.9%) had gestational diabetes mellitus, 43 (3.0%) impaired glucose tolerance, 122 (8.6%) isolated hyperglycaemia, and 1187 (83.5%) normal glucose tolerance. Offspring born to women with gestational diabetes mellitus had lower total WRAVMA scores (-3.09 points; 95% CI -6.12, -0.05) in early childhood compared with offspring of women with normal glucose tolerance. None of the abnormal glucose tolerance categories during pregnancy were associated with any of the cognitive outcomes (verbal, non-verbal, and visual motor scores) or behavioural measures in mid-childhood. Children born to mothers who had gestational diabetes mellitus had slightly lower scores on one cognitive test in early childhood.

609,609,31079067,"To determine the impact of incorporating dextrose gel in the treatment of neonatal hypoglycaemia (NH) and the role of feeding type in NH outcomes. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 2688 infants >35 weeks' gestation who were screened for NH before and after implementation of a clinical guideline for NH evaluation and treatment. We analysed the proportion of infants who required intravenous dextrose for NH before and after guideline implementation, the change in blood glucose concentrations with gel by feeding type and the odds of successful NH treatment with gel and feeding by feeding type. Following implementation of the guideline, a lower proportion of infants required intravenous dextrose for NH treatment (8.6% (60 infants) before guideline vs. 5.6% (112 infants) after guideline (p=0.007)). The median rise in blood glucose concentration with gel administration in the entire cohort was 0.61 mmol/L (11 mg/dL) (IQR 0.28-1.06 mmol/L (5-19 mg/dL)). Blood glucose concentration of formula-fed infants rose more in response to feeding and gel than breastfed infants (p≤0.0001). Formula feeding was associated with a lower odds of recurrent hypoglycaemia, as defined by requiring a second gel, in a fully adjusted model. Specifically, in infants with a pregel blood glucose of 2.00-2.17 mmol/L (36-39 mg/dL), formula feeding with gel was associated with a lower odds of recurrent hypoglycaemia. Dextrose gel is an effective tool in the treatment of NH. An infant's pregel blood glucose concentration may be helpful in guiding decisions around type of feeding provided.

615,615,36904237,"Health authorities are near universal in their recommendation to replace sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) with water. Non-nutritive sweetened beverages (NSBs) are not as widely recommended as a replacement strategy due to a lack of established benefits and concerns they may induce glucose intolerance through changes in the gut microbiome. The STOP Sugars NOW trial aims to assess the effect of the substitution of NSBs (the ""intended substitution"") versus water (the ""standard of care substitution"") for SSBs on glucose tolerance and microbiota diversity. The STOP Sugars NOW trial (NCT03543644) is a pragmatic, ""head-to-head"", open-label, crossover, randomized controlled trial conducted in an outpatient setting. Participants were overweight or obese adults with a high waist circumference who regularly consumed ≥1 SSBs daily. Each participant completed three 4-week treatment phases (usual SSBs, matched NSBs, or water) in random order, which were separated by ≥4-week washout. Blocked randomization was performed centrally by computer with allocation concealment. Outcome assessment was blinded; however, blinding of participants and trial personnel was not possible. The two primary outcomes are oral glucose tolerance (incremental area under the curve) and gut microbiota beta-diversity (weighted UniFrac distance). Secondary outcomes include related markers of adiposity and glucose and insulin regulation.

A set of 1885 foods was collected and analysed using the National Food Safety Standard procedure in order to establish the concentration levels of the sweeteners. Dietary exposure was estimated using probabilistic modelling software and compared directly with each sweetener's ADI. Consumption data from the China National Nutrition and Health Survey (conducted in 2010-2013) and the actual concentrations of sweeteners in the collected food products were used to perform the intake assessment. The results indicated that Acesulfame-K and cyclamate were commonly used in processed food, and processed nuts, preserved fruit, beverages, and bakery products are the main sources of sweeteners in Nanjing. The estimated exposure of sweeteners in Nanjing was well below the ADIs, as relative intakes at the 95th percentile were 29.7% for saccharin, 79.8% for cyclamate, and 35.9% for Acesulfame-K of the respective ADIs.

The residuals of a regression of UIC against creatinine were used to define a variable corrected for creatinine (UIC~Cr). Neither iodine supplements nor iodised salt consumption or maternal UIC were associated with cognitive or motor function. After adjusting for creatinine, children of women with UIC~Cr <100 µg/L had 3.93 (95% CI -6.18 to -1.69) general cognitive scores lower than the reference (150-249 µg/L).

621,621,37967537,"Exposure to marketing for foods high in sugar, salt, and fat is considered a key risk factor for childhood obesity. To support efforts to limit such marketing, the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe has developed a nutrient profile model (WHO NPM). Germany's Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture plans to use this model in proposed new food marketing legislation, but it has not yet been tested in Germany. The present study therefore assesses the feasibility and implications of implementing the WHO NPM in Germany. We applied the WHO NPM to a random sample of 660 food and beverage products across 22 product categories on the German market drawn from Open Food Facts, a publicly available product database. We calculated the share of products permitted for marketing to children based on the WHO NPM, both under current market conditions and for several hypothetical reformulation scenarios. We also assessed effects of adaptations to and practical challenges in applying the WHO NPM. The median share of products permitted for marketing to children across the model's 22 product categories was 20% (interquartile range (IQR) 3-59%) and increased to 38% (IQR 11-73%) with model adaptations for fruit juice and milk proposed by the German government. With targeted reformulation (assuming a 30% reduction in fat, sugar, sodium, and/or energy), the share of products permitted for marketing to children increased substantially (defined as a relative increase by at least 50%) in several product categories (including bread, processed meat, yogurt and cream, ready-made and convenience foods, and savoury plant-based foods) but changed less in the remaining categories. Practical challenges included the ascertainment of the trans-fatty acid content of products, among others. The application of the WHO NPM in Germany was found to be feasible. Its use in the proposed legislation on food marketing in Germany seems likely to serve its intended public health objective of limiting marketing in a targeted manner specifically for less healthy products. It seems plausible that it may incentivise reformulation in some product categories. Practical challenges could be addressed with appropriate adaptations and procedural provisions.

625,625,28388927,"Birth cohort studies link gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) with impaired cognitive performance in the offspring. However, the mechanisms involved are unknown. We tested the hypothesis that obesity-associated GDM induces chronic neuroinflammation and disturbs the development of neuronal circuitry resulting in impaired cognitive abilities in the offspring. In rats, GDM was induced by feeding dams a diet high in sucrose and fatty acids. Brains of neonatal (E20) and young adult (15-week-old) offspring of GDM and lean dams were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, cytokine assay, and western blotting. Young adult offspring of GDM and lean dams went also through cognitive assessment. Cultured microglial responses to elevated glucose and/or fatty acids levels were analyzed. In rats, impaired recognition memory was observed in the offspring of GDM dams. GDM exposure combined with a postnatal high-fat and sucrose diet resulted in atypical inattentive behavior in the offspring. These cognitive changes correlated with reduced density and derangement of Cornu Ammonis 1 pyramidal neuronal layer, decreased hippocampal synaptic integrity, increased neuroinflammatory status, and reduced expression of CX3CR1, the microglial fractalkine receptor regulating microglial pro-inflammatory responses and synaptic pruning. Primary microglial cultures that were exposed to high concentrations of glucose and/or palmitate were transformed into an activated, amoeboid morphology with increased nitric oxide and superoxide production, and altered their cytokine release profile. These findings demonstrate that GDM stimulates microglial activation and chronic inflammatory responses in the brain of the offspring that persist into young adulthood. Reactive gliosis correlates positively with hippocampal synaptic decline and cognitive impairments. The elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine expression at the critical period of hippocampal synaptic maturation suggests that neuroinflammation might drive the synaptic and cognitive decline in the offspring of GDM dams. The importance of microglia in this process is supported by the reduced Cx3CR1 expression as an indication of the loss of microglial control of inflammatory responses and phagocytosis and synaptic pruning in GDM offspring.

The purpose of this study is to describe five children who acutely decompensated after receiving milk and molasses enemas. Retrospective review of the medical records of children with constipation who received milk and molasses enema with subsequent PICU admission at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center between 1994 and 2000. Five children developed significant hemodynamic deterioration after receiving milk and molasses enemas. One of these children died and the others recovered after aggressive resuscitation. Milk and molasses enema administration can be associated with significant hemodynamic compromise. These risks appear similar to those risk observed with the use of other enema preparations.

628,628,19351697,"High levels of dietary sodium (consumed as common salt, sodium chloride) are associated with raised blood pressure and adverse cardiovascular health. Despite this, public health efforts to reduce sodium consumption remain limited to a few countries. Comprehensive, contemporaneous sodium intake data from around the world are needed to inform national/international public health initiatives to reduce sodium consumption. Use of standardized 24-h sodium excretion estimates for adults from the international INTERSALT (1985-87) and INTERMAP (1996-99) studies, and recent dietary and urinary sodium data from observational or interventional studies--identified by a comprehensive search of peer-reviewed and 'grey' literature--presented separately for adults and children. Review of methods for the estimation of sodium intake/excretion. Main food sources of sodium are presented for several Asian, European and Northern American countries, including previously unpublished INTERMAP data. Sodium intakes around the world are well in excess of physiological need (i.e. 10-20 mmol/day). Most adult populations have mean sodium intakes >100 mmol/day, and for many (particularly the Asian countries) mean intakes are >200 mmol/day. Possible exceptions include estimates from Cameroon, Ghana, Samoa, Spain, Taiwan, Tanzania, Uganda and Venezuela, though methodologies were sub-optimal and samples were not nationally representative. Sodium intakes were commonly >100 mmol/day in children over 5 years old, and increased with age. In European and Northern American countries, sodium intake is dominated by sodium added in manufactured foods ( approximately 75% of intake). Cereals and baked goods were the single largest contributor to dietary sodium intake in UK and US adults. In Japan and China, salt added at home (in cooking and at the table) and soy sauce were the largest sources. Unfavourably high sodium intakes remain prevalent around the world. Sources of dietary sodium vary largely worldwide. If policies for salt reduction at the population level are to be effective, policy development and implementation needs to target the main source of dietary sodium in the various populations.

630,630,31332028,"Exposure in utero to maternal obesity or gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is linked to a high risk for obesity in offspring. Animal studies suggest that these exposures disrupt the development of the hypothalamus, a brain region that regulates body weight, predisposing offspring to develop obesity. This study tested the hypothesis in humans that in utero exposure to maternal obesity and/or GDM is associated with alterations in the hypothalamic response to glucose and the altered hypothalamic response would predict greater increases in child adiposity 1 year later. Participants were 91 children aged 7-11 years with and without in utero exposure to GDM. Maternal prepregnancy BMI and GDM exposures were determined from electronic medical records. Arterial spin labeling MRI was used to determine the child's hypothalamic blood flow response to oral glucose. Anthropometric measures were acquired in all children at their initial visit and again 1 year later in a subset of 44 children. Children exposed to GDM diagnosed at ≤26 weeks' gestation had increased hypothalamic blood flow (a marker of hypothalamic activation) in response to glucose when compared with unexposed children, and results remained after adjustments for child age, sex, BMI, and maternal prepregnancy BMI. Maternal prepregnancy BMI was positively associated with the child's hypothalamic response to glucose. Greater hypothalamic response to glucose predicted greater increases in child's BMI 1 year later. Increased glucose-linked hypothalamic activation during childhood represents a possible mechanism by which exposure to maternal metabolic disorders during fetal development increases future risk for obesity.

631,631,36471989,"There are many kinds of pharmaceutical preparations for children in China, which are generally divided into oral solid preparations and oral liquid preparations. Solid preparations, such as microtablets, pellets, dispersible tablets, and fine granules, have become the development trend of pediatric drugs. Liquid preparations mainly include syrup, suspension, oral solution, and drops. The poor taste and the treatment of drugs in children of different ages are the key factors affecting the efficacy, safety, and compliance of pediatric drugs. To reduce the risk caused by the fluctuation of blood concentration and improve the oral compliance of pediatric drugs, it is urgent to develop new techniques for granulation and flavor maskingto improve the poor taste of solid preparations. For liquid pre-parations with poor taste, the flavor correction technique should be used. This paper summarized the new pharmaceutical techniques for granulation and flavor masking, and it was found that sustained/controlled-releasegranules, fine granules, and chewing solid mini-tablets became the mainstream of oral solid preparations for children. Generally, multiparticle preparation, coating, microencapsulation, and other granulating techniques were involved in these preparations. Granulation and flavor masking are closely related and synergetic. Flavor masking techniques mask the bitter taste of Chinese medicine from four aspects, including confusing the brain taste, changing the compounds, reducing the exposure of bitter molecules to bitter receptors in the mouth, and numbing the taste cells to increase the threshold of bitter perception. At present, the main drugs for children on the market mainly inhibit the oral release of bitter drugs.

Qualitative research involving children provides an opportunity to consider their views. The aim of the Kids initiative inspires Dietary Success in Adults and Youth (KiiDSAY) project was to explore the views of school-aged children, who had participated in a school-based nutrition education program, about inspiring their peers and families to eat more vegetables. A total of 26 children (15 boys) aged 10-12 years from four primary schools in New South Wales, Australia, participated in seven focus group interviews. Purposeful sampling was used to recruit participants. The study involved open-ended semi-structured questions conducted via Zoom that were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis with deductive and inductive coding in NVivo. Four major themes emerged: (i) taste; (ii) family environment; (iii) healthy eating; and (iv) change makers; with subthemes that were embedded within Social Cognitive Theory and Ecological Model of Health Behaviour theoretical frameworks. Children's inputs hold great potential for informing future interventions, particularly when designing or refining school-based nutrition programs. Children offered suggestions on how to inspire increased vegetable consumption among their peers and families that could be taken into consideration for future research and practice. These included: cooking activities in the home and school settings using recipes that creatively hide/mask/enhance the flavour of vegetables, involving positive role models and supportive school environments. Additionally, children recommended a sequential approach to the delivery of recipes starting from fruit-based and transitioning to vegetable-based recipes. Given the challenges faced in increasing children's vegetable consumption, particular focus on future research in this area is warranted.

Several studies support an association between childhood sugary beverage (SB) consumption and poor cardiometabolic health. This study aimed to assess the association of maternal SB consumption during pregnancy and later, with her offspring's SB consumption in early infancy and childhood. A total of 1945 women and 1595 children participating in 3 Canadian studies reported SB consumption during pregnancy, at 2 years of age, and/or at school age (5 to 8 years old). Mother and offspring SB intakes were self-reported by mothers. Multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted within each cohort and cohort data were combined using fixed effect meta-analyses. Maternal SB consumption during pregnancy was associated with higher offspring SB consumption at 2 years of age (standardized β = 0.19 predicted change in the number of standard deviations of offspring SB intake for an increase of 1 standard deviation in maternal serving [95% CI: 0.16 to 0.22]). Concurrent maternal SB consumption was associated with higher offspring SB intake when children were aged 5 to 8 years (standardized β= 0.25 [95% CI: 0.10 to 0.40]). Maternal SB consumption during pregnancy is associated with a marginally higher SB intake among their offspring at age 2, and concurrent maternal consumption is associated with a higher SB intake among school-aged offspring (5 to 8 years old). Future interventions tailored for pregnancy and early childrearing years to reduce SB intakes of mothers may reduce young children's SB intake. RéSUMé: OBJECTIFS: Il peut y avoir un lien entre les choix alimentaires d’une femme pendant la grossesse et ceux de son enfant. Plusieurs études font état d’une association entre la consommation de boissons sucrées (BS) durant l’enfance et la mauvaise santé cardiométabolique. Notre étude visait à évaluer l’association entre la consommation de BS des mères pendant et après la grossesse et la consommation de BS de leurs enfants durant la petite enfance et l’enfance. MéTHODE: En tout, 1 945 femmes et 1 595 enfants participant à 3 études canadiennes ont fait état de leur consommation de BS pendant la grossesse, à l’âge de 2 ans et/ou à l’âge scolaire (5 à 8 ans). La consommation de BS des mères et des enfants a été déclarée par les mères. Des analyses de régression linéaire multivariée ont été menées dans chaque cohorte, et les données des cohortes ont été combinées à l’aide de méta-analyses à effets fixes. RéSULTATS: La consommation maternelle de BS pendant la grossesse était associée à une consommation de BS plus élevée chez les enfants à l’âge de 2 ans (le coefficient β standardisé = 0,19 prédisait le changement du nombre d’écart-types de consommation de BS chez les enfants pour chaque hausse de 1 écart-type de la portion maternelle [IC de 95 % : 0,16 à 0,22]). La consommation maternelle concomitante de BS était associée à une consommation de BS plus élevée chez les enfants lorsqu’ils étaient âgés de 5 à 8 ans (coefficient β standardisé = 0,25 [IC de 95 % : 0,10 à 0,40]). CONCLUSION: La consommation maternelle de BS pendant la grossesse est associée à une consommation de BS marginalement plus élevée chez l’enfant à l’âge de 2 ans, et la consommation maternelle concomitante est associée à une consommation de BS plus élevée chez l’enfant d’âge scolaire (5 à 8 ans).

The mice exhibited a marked preference specifically for the HSD and HSSD. Following consumption of these diets, c-Fos expression levels in the aPVT were significantly higher in these two groups compared to the others. Utilizing fiber photometry calcium imaging, we observed rapid activation of aPVT neurons in response to sucrose and stevioside intake, but not to xylitol or water.

The purpose of this work was to investigate the acute effects of dietary glycemic index (GI) on energy metabolism and voluntary food intake in obese subjects. Twelve obese teenage boys were evaluated on three separate occasions using a crossover study protocol. During each evaluation, subjects consumed identical test meals at breakfast and lunch that had a low, medium, or high GI. The high- and medium-GI meals were designed to have similar macronutrient composition, fiber content, and palatability, and all meals for each subject had equal energy content. After breakfast, plasma and serum concentrations of metabolic fuels and hormones were measured. Ad libitum food intake was determined in the 5-hour period after lunch. Voluntary energy intake after the high-GI meal (5.8 megajoule [mJ]) was 53% greater than after the medium-GI meal (3.8 mJ), and 81% greater than after the low-GI meal (3.2 mJ). In addition, compared with the low-GI meal, the high-GI meal resulted in higher serum insulin levels, lower plasma glucagon levels, lower postabsorptive plasma glucose and serum fatty acids levels, and elevation in plasma epinephrine. The area under the glycemic response curve for each test meal accounted for 53% of the variance in food intake within subjects. The rapid absorption of glucose after consumption of high-GI meals induces a sequence of hormonal and metabolic changes that promote excessive food intake in obese subjects. Additional studies are needed to examine the relationship between dietary GI and long-term body weight regulation.

Two cross-sectional observational surveys in ten general medical practices in north-east England during 1996. Computerised patient records of all elderly patients (aged 60 years and over) were surveyed for prescribed medicines use. Within these practices, 50% of elderly patients registered with ten general medical practitioners were surveyed by postal questionnaire to assess over-the-counter (OTC) medicines use. Of 20,731 elderly patients registered, prevalence of use of prescribed prolonged oral clearance (POC) medicines was 9.8% (95% CI: 8.2%, 11.3%) and use in females aged 75 years and older was significantly more likely (P < 0.0001). Of 2,796 prescribing instances (PIs) for 143 POC medicines used long-term, 53% were gastrointestinal and 72% were sugars-free; however, 82% of 542 PIs for generic liquids were sugars-containing compared with 8% of 685 PIs for proprietary liquid oral medicines. Of 1,532 elderly respondents to a postal questionnaire, 17 were using 13 different OTC medicines with POC regularly and long-term (mean prevalence; 1.1%). Of the 17 instances of regular long-term use of OTC medicines, 59% were sugars-free. Prescribed medicines represent the bulk of regular, long-term medicines use in the elderly. Generic prescribing is more likely to result in sugars-containing medicines being dispensed. Generic medicines manufacturers must be encouraged to provide sugars-free alternatives to POC medicines used long-term, and health professionals should be vigilant when prescribing and dispensing these medicines to the increasingly dentate elderly.

648,648,26066526,"In India, endemic goitre is present in sub-Himalayan region and in pockets in states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat. Being a public health problem amenable for prevention, the assessment of prevalence of endemic goitre in an area helps in understanding whether the preventive strategies under National Iodine Deficiency Disorder Control Program (NIDDCP) have any impact on the control of endemic goitre. Hence, the current study was carried out to determine the prevalence, distribution and factors associated with iodine deficiency goitre among 6-12-year-old children in a rural area in south Karnataka. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 838 children, using a questionnaire adopted from Iodized Salt Program Assessment Tool and the tools prescribed by WHO for goitre survey. The prevalence of goitre in the study area was 21.9% (95% CI 19.2-24.8). There was higher prevalence of goitre among those having salt iodine <15 ppm than those with >15 ppm (P = 0.01; OR 1.59; 95% CI 1.10-2.29). In 10% of the children, urinary iodine excretion (UIE) was assessed and prevalence was higher among those with <100 μg/l of UIE than those with normal UIE, which was not statistically significant (P = 0.8, OR 1.36; 95% CI 0.62-2.96). Multiple logistic regression revealed that gender (P = 0.002; OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.21-2.35) was an independent variable associated with goitre. The study area was found to be moderately endemic for goitre based on the WHO criteria. Higher prevalence of goitre was found to be still associated with consumption of low iodized salt (<15 ppm) necessitating emphasis on monitoring of salt iodine levels in the study area. Though NIDDCP is being implemented since five decades in India, the burden of iodine deficiency disorders (IDDs) is still high demanding further impetus to the monitoring systems of the programme.

650,650,30501650,"Consumption of sugar and alternative low- or no-energy sweeteners has increased in recent decades. However, it is still uncertain how consumption of sugar and alternative sweeteners during pregnancy affects pregnancy outcomes and long-term offspring health. This review aims to collate the available evidence surrounding the consequences of sugar and alternative sweetener consumption during pregnancy, a so-called secondhand sugar effect. We found evidence that sugar consumption during pregnancy may contribute to increased gestational weight gain and the development of pregnancy complications, including gestational diabetes, preeclampsia and preterm birth. Further, we found a growing body of the animal and human evidence that maternal sugar intake during pregnancy may impact neonatal and childhood metabolism, taste perception and obesity risk. Emerging evidence also suggests that both maternal and paternal preconception sugar intakes are linked to offspring metabolic outcomes, perhaps via epigenetic alterations to the germline. While there have been fewer studies of the impacts of alternative sweetener consumption before and during pregnancy, there is some evidence to suggest effects on infant outcomes including preterm birth risk, increased infant body composition and offspring preference for sweet foods, although mechanisms are unclear. We conclude that preconception and gestational sugar and alternative sweetener consumption may negatively impact pregnancy outcomes and offspring health and that there is a need for further observational, mechanistic and intervention research in this area.

652,652,35709397,"While the prevalence of undernutrition in children has decreased in many low- and middle-income countries since the 1990s, prevalences of overweight and obesity have increased. Frequent consumption of sugar-sweetened food might have contributed to this change, although very little is known about sugar-sweetened food consumption in early life. The objective of this study was to explore the associations between individual, household, and maternal factors and the prevalence of sugar-sweetened food consumption in 6- to 24-month-old children in Bangladesh. Multistage sampling was used to select households with children aged 6-24 months in rural Chatmohar, a subdistrict of Bangladesh (n = 1635). Research assistants conducted a 24-hour qualitative dietary recall questionnaire with the enrolled child's primary caregiver to measure maternal and child dietary patterns. We examined factors associated with the prevalence of child sugar-sweetened food consumption with multivariate logistic regression models. We conducted tests of heterogeneity to explore differential associations between the child sugar-sweetened food consumption prevalence and household income by maternal nutrition knowledge and wealth. Primary caregivers reported that 62% of toddlers had consumed sugar-sweetened food in the past 24 hours. A higher prevalence of child sugar-sweetened food consumption was associated with both a higher dietary diversity score (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.09-1.29) and a higher prevalence of maternal sugar-sweetened food consumption (OR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.97-3.28). At higher levels of maternal nutrition knowledge and wealth, more household income was associated with a lower prevalence of child sugar-sweetened food consumption. Almost two-thirds of 6- to 24-month-old children in rural Chatmohar, Bangladesh, had consumed sugar-sweetened food in the last day. This is a high and concerning prevalence, and the associated factors identified in this study should be investigated further to identify potential areas of intervention to decrease the prevalence of child sugar consumption in Bangladesh.

Children completed questionnaires about several sociodemographic and oral health related factors of the previous years. To adjust for confounding, we used log risk regression and estimated relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). For 12-13 year-olds mean DMFS were 1.9 (sd 2.5) and 1.1 (2.2) in the LF and the HF-areas, respectively. Prevalence of aesthetically relevant fluorosis (TF > 2) was 1% (LF) and 87% (HF). Water fluoride concentration (adjusted for age and SES) was inversely associated with caries-status [RR: 0.7, (CI 0.6-0.8)]. RR for fluorosis was 17 (CI 8-33). In HF-area, caries scores were significantly higher for children with TF > or = 5 on upper central incisors compared with TF < or = 4 (p < 0.05 Mann-Whitney test). Caries prevalence in the examined areas in Iran is quite low.

Despite the availability of various analgesics to manage vaccine injection pain, they have not been incorporated into clinical practice. To date, no systematic review has been published on the effectiveness of pharmacologic and combined interventions for reducing injection pain. The objectives of this article were to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of various pharmacologic and combined interventions for reducing the pain experienced by children during immunization. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs pertaining to pharmacologic and combined interventions to reduce injection pain in children 0 to 18 years of age using validated child self-reported pain or observer-reported assessments of child pain and distress. We included trials that (1) investigated the effects of pharmacologic interventions (ie, topical local anesthetics, sweet-tasting solutions, vapocoolants, and oral analgesics [acetaminophen or ibuprofen]); (2) compared 2 different analgesic interventions; and (3) evaluated combinations of >or= 2 analgesic interventions, including breastfeeding. Meta-analyses were performed using a fixed-effects model. Thirty-two studies, involving 3856 infants and children 2 weeks to 15 years of age, were included in this systematic review; 23 of these trials were included in meta-analyses. Ten trials, including 1156 infants and children, evaluated topical local anesthetics. In a meta-analysis of 2 trials, including 276 children, child self-reported pain ratings were lower in children who received topical local anesthetics than in those who received a placebo. The standardized mean difference (SMD) was -0.25 (95% CI, -0.49 to -0.01; P = 0.04). The use of topical local anesthetics was associated with less pain than was placebo in 4 trials (527 infants) based on the difference between Modified Behavioral Pain Scale scores (range, 0-10) before and after vaccination: the weighted mean difference (WMD) was -0.79 (95% CI, -1.10 to -0.48; P < 0.001) and the SMD was -0.43 (95% CI, -0.60 to -0.26; P = 0.001).

In a meta-analysis of 6 studies (665 infants), administration of sucrose with or without non-nutritive sucking (NNS; use of a pacifier) was associated with less pain than no intervention or sterile water with or without NNS; the SMD was -0.56 (95% CI, -0.72 to -0.40; P < 0.001). Total cry duration was lower in infants who received sucrose than in those who received sterile water (WMD, -9.41 sec; 95% CI, -13.18 to -5.64; P < 0.001; and SMD, -0.43; 95% CI, -0.61 to -0.25; P < 0.001). The NNT to prevent 1 child from having clinically significant pain, using the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (score, >3), was 1.4 (95% CI, 1.0 to 2.5). In 3 trials that evaluated sweet-tasting solutions longitudinally, administration of sucrose or glucose (vs sterile water, with or without NNS) was associated with reduced pain based on cry duration or the University of Wisconsin Children's Hospital Pain Scale (all, P < 0.05). Data were pooled for 2 studies conducted in 100 children who received a spray with a vapocoolant or placebo at the injection site before the procedure. Child self-rated pain (4-point scale) was lower in the group treated with the vapo-coolant (SMD, -0.43; 95% CI, -0.83 to -0.02; P = 0.04); significant heterogeneity was reported for this outcome (chi(2) = 5.51; P = 0.02; I(2) = 82%).

661,661,17724028,"The mitochondria of pancreatic beta cells are believed to convert insulin secretagogues into products that are translocated to the cytosol where they participate in insulin secretion. We studied the hypothesis that short chain acyl-CoA (SC-CoAs) might be some of these products by discerning the pathways of SC-CoA formation in beta cells. Insulin secretagogues acutely stimulated 1.5-5-fold increases in acetoacetyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA), and acetyl-CoA in INS-1 832/13 cells as judged from liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry measurements. Studies of 12 relevant enzymes in rat and human pancreatic islets and INS-1 832/13 cells showed the feasibility of at least two redundant pathways, one involving acetoacetate and the other citrate, for the synthesis SC-CoAs from secretagogue carbon in mitochondria and the transfer of their acyl groups to the cytosol where the acyl groups are converted to SC-CoAs. Knockdown of two key cytosolic enzymes in INS-1 832/13 cells with short hairpin RNA supported the proposed scheme. Lowering ATP citrate lyase 88% did not inhibit glucose-induced insulin release indicating citrate is not the only carrier of acyl groups to the cytosol. However, lowering acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase 80% partially inhibited glucose-induced insulin release indicating formation of SC-CoAs from acetoacetate in the cytosol is important for insulin secretion. The results indicate beta cells possess enzyme pathways that can incorporate carbon from glucose into acetyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, and succinyl-CoA and carbon from leucine into these three SC-CoAs plus HMG-CoA in their mitochondria and enzymes that can form acetyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and HMG-CoA in their cytosol.

663,663,21654319,"The intraoperative infusion of isotonic solutions with 1-2.5% glucose in children is considered well established use in Europe and other countries. Unfortunately, a European marketing authorisation of such a solution is currently missing and as a consequence paediatric anaesthetists tend to use suboptimal intravenous fluid strategies that may lead to serious morbidity and even mortality because of iatrogenic hyponatraemia, hyperglycaemia or medical errors. To address this issue, the German Scientific Working Group for Paediatric Anaesthesia suggests a European consensus statement on the composition of an appropriate intraoperative solution for infusion in children, which was discussed during a working session at the 2nd Congress of the European Society for Paediatric Anaesthesiology in Berlin in September 2010. As a result, it was recommended that an intraoperative fluid should have an osmolarity close to the physiologic range in children in order to avoid hyponatraemia, an addition of 1-2.5% instead of 5% glucose in order to avoid hypoglycaemia, lipolysis or hyperglycaemia and should also include metabolic anions (i.e. acetate, lactate or malate) as bicarbonate precursors to prevent hyperchloraemic acidosis. Thus, the underlying intention of this consensus statement is to facilitate the granting of a European marketing authorisation for such a solution with the ultimate goal of improving the safety and effectiveness of intraoperative fluid therapy in children.

Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs between SSB or ASB intake and physical activity with incident CVD among 65,730 females in the Nurses' Health Study (1980-2016) and 39,418 males in the Health Professional's Follow-up Study (1986-2016), who were free from chronic diseases at baseline.

673,673,25762724,"The lipid composition of insulin secretory granules (ISG) has never previously been thoroughly characterized. We characterized the phospholipid composition of ISG and mitochondria in pancreatic beta cells without and with glucose stimulation. The phospholipid/protein ratios of most phospholipids containing unsaturated fatty acids were higher in ISG than in whole cells and in mitochondria. The concentrations of negatively charged phospholipids, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol in ISG were 5-fold higher than in the whole cell. In ISG phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin, fatty acids 12:0 and 14:0 were high, as were phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol containing 18-carbon unsaturated FA. With glucose stimulation, the concentration of many ISG phosphatidylserines and phosphatidylinositols increased; unsaturated fatty acids in phosphatidylserine increased; and most phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins, and lysophosphatidylcholines were unchanged. Unsaturation and shorter fatty acid length in phospholipids facilitate curvature and fluidity of membranes, which favors fusion of membranes. Recent evidence suggests that negatively charged phospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine, act as coupling factors enhancing the interaction of positively charged regions in SNARE proteins in synaptic or secretory vesicle membrane lipid bilayers with positively charged regions in SNARE proteins in the plasma membrane lipid bilayer to facilitate docking of vesicles to the plasma membrane during exocytosis. The results indicate that ISG phospholipids are in a dynamic state and are consistent with the idea that changes in ISG phospholipids facilitate fusion of ISG with the plasma membrane-enhancing glucose-stimulated insulin exocytosis.

680,680,32493338,"Dental caries in primary teeth is a serious oral health concern among children. It can lead to detrimental impacts on a child's growth, development, and quality of life. Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to examine the prevalence of dental caries and its associations with nutritional status, sugar and second-hand smoke exposure among pre-schoolers. A total of 26 pre-schools in Seremban, Malaysia were randomly selected using the probability proportional to size sampling. Dental examination was performed by a dentist to record the number of decayed teeth (dt). Weight and height of the pre-schoolers were measured. The mother-administered questionnaire was used to gather information pertaining to the sociodemographic characteristics and second-hand smoke exposure. Total sugar exposure was calculated from a 3-day food record. Among the 396 participating pre-schoolers, 63.4% of them had at least one untreated caries, with a mean ± SD dt score of 3.56 ± 4.57. Negative binomial regression analysis revealed that being a boy (adjusted mean ratio = 1.42, 95% CI = 0.005-0.698, p = 0.047), exposed to second-hand smoke (adjusted mean ratio = 1.67, 95% CI = 0.168-0.857, p = 0.004) and those who had more than 6 times of daily total sugar exposure (adjusted mean ratio = 1.93, 95% CI = 0.138-0.857, p = 0.013) were significantly associated with dental caries among pre-schoolers. A high prevalence of dental caries was reported in this study. This study highlights the need to reduce exposure to second-hand smoke and practice healthy eating behaviours in reducing the risk of dental caries among pre-schoolers.

682,682,25979510,"The diets of most US children and adults are poor, as reflected by low diet quality scores, when compared with the recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAs). Contributing to these low scores is that most Americans overconsume solid fats, which may contain saturated fatty acids and added sugars; although alcohol consumption was generally modest, it provided few nutrients. Thus, the 2005 DGAs generated a new recommendation: to reduce intakes of solid fats, alcohol, and added sugars (SoFAAS). What precipitated the emergence of the new SoFAAS terminology was the concept of discretionary calories (a ""calorie"" is defined as the amount of energy needed to increase the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1°C), which were defined as calories consumed after an individual had met his or her recommended nutrient intakes while consuming fewer calories than the daily recommendation. A limitation with this concept was that additional amounts of nutrient-dense foods consumed beyond the recommended amount were also considered discretionary calories. The rationale for this was that if nutrient-dense foods were consumed beyond recommended amounts, after total energy intake was met then this constituted excess energy intake. In the 2010 DGAs, the terminology was changed to solid fats and added sugars (SoFAS); thus, alcohol was excluded because it made a minor contribution to overall intake and did not apply to children. The SoFAS terminology also negated nutrient-dense foods that were consumed in amounts above the recommendations for the specific food groups in the food patterns. The ambiguous SoFAS terminology was later changed to ""empty calories"" to reflect only those calories from solid fats and added sugars (and alcohol if consumed beyond moderate amounts). The purpose of this review is to provide an historical perspective on how the dietary recommendations went from SoFAAS to SoFAS and how discretionary calories went to empty calories between the 2005 and 2010 DGAs. This information will provide practitioners, as well as the public, with valuable information to better understand the evolution of SoFAS over time.

683,683,35895408,"PXVX0200 is an oral cholera vaccine that is approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency under the tradename Vaxchora. The vaccine is supplied as two packets, one containing buffer component and the other the active component, that are mixed with water and ingested. The aim of this study was to develop vaccine preparation methods that are appropriate for administering PXVX0200 to children. Developing oral liquid medication for children has unique challenges, including administration volume and palatability. These challenges were addressed by preparing PXVX0200 in different volumes and testing the potency of the vaccine in the presence of sweeteners, flavorings, and food and drinks. Vaccine potency, defined as colony-forming units/dose, was used to determine the compatibility of PXVX0200 with different vaccine preparation methods. We found that the reconstitution volume can be reduced from 100 to 50 mL to accommodate children aged 2 to 6 years and to 10 mL for children aged 6 months to 2 years, as long as the buffer concentration is the same as for the approved (100 mL) dose. Sucrose or stevia sweeteners may also be added without affecting the vaccine potency. Reconstitution in juices or foods was challenging because of effervescence caused by bicarbonate in the buffer component. An alternate preparation method was developed for reconstitution in baby formula. Vaccine preparation methods to make PXVX0200 appropriate for pediatric administration will facilitate administration of the vaccine to improve compliance and protect children from cholera infection while traveling.

Cross-sectional data on urinary iodine (UI) and total goitre prevalence (TGP) in school-age children from 1993-2003 compiled in the WHO Global Database on Iodine Deficiency were analysed. The median UI was used to classify countries according to the public health significance of their iodine nutrition status. Estimates of the global and regional populations with insufficient iodine intake were based on the proportion of each country's population with UI below 100 microg/l. TGP was computed for trend analysis over 10 years. UI data were available for 92.1% of the world's school-age children. Iodine deficiency is still a public health problem in 54 countries. A total of 36.5% (285 million) school-age children were estimated to have an insufficient iodine intake, ranging from 10.1% in the WHO Region of the Americas to 59.9% in the European Region. Extrapolating this prevalence to the general population generated an estimate of nearly two billion individuals with insufficient iodine intake. Iodine intake was more than adequate, or excessive, in 29 countries. Global TGP in the general population was 15.8%. Forty-three countries have reached optimal iodine nutrition. Strengthened UI monitoring is required to ensure that salt iodization is having the desired impact, to identify at-risk populations and to ensure sustainable prevention and control of iodine deficiency.

This cross-sectional study utilised baseline data from 12 211 schoolchildren participating in the Feel4Diabetes European lifestyle modification intervention. Sociodemographics, soft drink intake and household food availability data were collected using parent-completed questionnaires. Anthropometry was recorded, and children were classified into BMI categories according to the International Obesity Task Force cut-offs. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis controlled for children's sex, mother's BMI, and educational level, frequent household availability of fruit juice (sugar added), regular soft drinks and salty snacks compared to less frequent were positively associated with daily regular soft drink intake in children, regardless of BMI group (ORs range 1.59-6.69). Conversely, frequent availability of fruit juice (no added sugar) was inversely related to regular soft drink intake in both BMI groups, as was the availability of fresh fruit in the overweight/obesity group, and the availability of diet soft drinks in the underweight/normal-weight (ORs range 0.31-0.54). In conclusion, habitual household availability of selected energy-dense foods/beverages was positively associated with a daily intake of regular soft drinks in European children, regardless of BMI status. Contrastingly, household availability of fresh fruit, fruit juice (no added sugar) and diet soft drinks were inversely associated with regular soft drink intake.

Systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled intervention studies. Medine, Embase, and the Cochrane Library up to 25 April 2018. Controlled intervention studies of at least seven days' duration and assessing the effect of different food sources of fructose-containing sugars on glycaemic control in people with and without diabetes were included. Four study designs were prespecified on the basis of energy control: substitution studies (sugars in energy matched comparisons with other macronutrients), addition studies (excess energy from sugars added to diets), subtraction studies (energy from sugars subtracted from diets), and ad libitum studies (sugars freely replaced by other macronutrients without control for energy). Outcomes were glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose, and fasting blood glucose insulin. Four independent reviewers extracted relevant data and assessed risk of bias. Data were pooled by random effects models and overall certainty of the evidence assessed by the GRADE approach (grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation). 155 study comparisons (n=5086) were included. Total fructose-containing sugars had no harmful effect on any outcome in substitution or subtraction studies, with a decrease seen in HbA1c in substitution studies (mean difference -0.22% (95% confidence interval to -0.35% to -0.08%), -25.9 mmol/mol (-27.3 to -24.4)), but a harmful effect was seen on fasting insulin in addition studies (4.68 pmol/L (1.40 to 7.96)) and ad libitum studies (7.24 pmol/L (0.47 to 14.00)).

693,693,30519164,"In most species, including humans, food preference is primarily controlled by nutrient value. In particular, glucose-containing sugars exert exquisitely strong effects on food choice via gut-generated signals. However, the identity of the visceral signals underlying glucose's rewarding effects remains uncertain. In particular, it is unknown whether sugar metabolism mediates the formation of preferences for glucose-containing sugars. Using the mouse as a model organism, we made use of a combination of conditioning schedules, gastrointestinal nutrient administration, and chromatographic/electrochemical methods to assess the behavioral and neural effects of activating the gut with either metabolizable glucose or a non-metabolizable glucose analog. We show that mice display much superior preferences for flavors associated with intra-gastric infusions of glucose compared to flavors associated with intra-gastric infusions of the non-metabolizable glucose analog α-methyl-D-glucopyranoside (""MDG,"" an activator of intestinal sodium/glucose co-transporters). These effects were unaffected by surgical bypassing of the duodenum, suggesting glucose-specific post-absorptive sensing mechanisms. Consistently, intra-portal infusions of glucose, but not of MDG, induced significant rises in dopamine (DA) levels within brain reward circuits. Our data reveal that the unmatched rewarding effects of glucose-containing sugars cannot be accounted for by metabolism-independent activation of sodium/glucose cotransporters; rather, they point to glucose metabolism as the physiological mechanism underlying the potent reward value of sugar-sweetened flavored beverages. In particular, no circulating ""gut factors"" need to be invoked to explain the reward value of ingested glucose. Thus, instead of circulating gut hormones, portal-mesenteric sensing of glucose emerges as the preferential physiological pathway for sugar reward.

Interestingly, both children's and maternal post-load glucose levels were positively associated with children's LTL. However, negative associations were observed between children's LTL and children's OGTT insulin levels. In addition, the LTL in females was more strongly associated with pancreatic beta-cell function whilst LTL in males was more strongly associated with OGTT glucose levels.

The panel sought to ensure that the recommendations promoted timely seizure cessation while avoiding respiratory depression and seizure recurrence. The panel recommended that all patients in an active seizure have capillary blood glucose checked and be treated with intravenous (IV) dextrose or intramuscular (IM) glucagon if <60 mg/dL (3 mmol/L). The panel also recommended that non-IV routes (buccal, IM, or intranasal) of benzodiazepines (0.2 mg/kg) be used as first-line therapy for status epilepticus, rather than the rectal route. Using GRADE methodology, we have developed a pediatric seizure guideline that emphasizes the role of capillary blood glucometry and the use of buccal, IM, or intranasal benzodiazepines over IV or rectal routes. Future research is needed to compare the effectiveness and safety of these medication routes.

Our objectives were to compare the frequency of (1) fructose (FM), lactose (LM) and sorbitol malassimilation (SM), (2) gastrointestinal symptoms (GS) following carbohydrate ingestion and (3) recurrent GS relevant to the participants' daily lives. We conducted a prospective case-control study of 45 ambulatory patients with HT and 38 healthy volunteers, matched with regard to age, gender and area of origin. Hydrogen breath tests with fructose, lactose, sorbitol and glucose were performed, the lactose testing additionally comprising measurements of capillary blood glucose (cBG). GS during the tests and recurrent GS concerning the participants' daily lives were assessed. A food-frequency questionnaire was administered. FM was diagnosed in 48.9% of patients compared with 26.3% of the control group (P=0.035). In all, 42.2% of patients with HT and 21.1% of healthy controls showed LM (P=0.04).

This progress evaluation explores its implementation process and influencing factors using mixed methods. The mixed-methods process evaluation employed the RE-AIM framework. Quantitative data were collected from a management website monitoring 54,435 third-grade students across two cities. Questionnaire surveys (n = 27,542) assessed pre- and post-education effectiveness. Mixed-effects models were used to control cluster effects. Qualitative interviews (23 individuals and 8 focus groups) identified program performance, facilitators, and barriers. Findings were triangulated using the RE-AIM framework. The program achieved 100% participation among all the third-grade classes of the 208 invited primary schools, with a 97.7% registration rate among all the 54,435 families, indicating high ""Reach."" Qualitative interviews revealed positive engagement from children and parents through the ""small hands leading big hands"" strategy. The high completion rate of 84.9% for each health cloud lesson and the significant improvement in salt reduction knowledge and behaviors scores from 75.0 (95%CI: 74.7-75.3) to 80.9 (95%CI: 80.6-81.2) out of 100 demonstrated the ""Effect"" of EduSaltS. The program's ""Adoption"" and ""Implementation"" were supported by attractive materials, reduced workload via auto-delivered lessons/activities and performance evaluation, and high fidelity to recommended activities, with medians 3.0 (IQR: 2.0-8.0)/class and 9.0 (IQR: 5.0-14.0)/school. Stable course completion rates (79.4%-93.4%) over one year indicated promising ""Maintenance."" Apart from the facilitating features praised by the interviewees, government support was the basis for the scaling up of EduSaltS. Barriers included the lack of smartphone skills among some parents and competing priorities for schools. Unhealthy off-campus environments, such as excessive use of salt in pre-packaged and restaurant foods, also hindered salt reduction efforts. The program's scalability was evident through its integration into existing health education, engagement of local governments and adaptation across various mobile devices. The mHealth-based school health education program is scalable and effective for public salt reduction in China. Identified barriers and facilitators can inform future health program scale-ups.

This entity has traditionally been treated with mannitol, but use of 3% hypertonic saline has become an accepted alternative. We sought to assess if changes in the use of hyperosmolar therapies for treatment of cerebral edema in diabetic ketoacidosis may have influenced mortality over the last decade. Retrospective cohort study. Patients discharged between 1999 and 2009 from 41 children's hospitals that provided data to the Pediatric Health Information System database. A total of 43,107 children (age < 19) with diagnosis codes related to diabetic ketoacidosis were identified and further classified as having cerebral edema if treated with mannitol and/or 3% hypertonic saline. None. Billing for 3% hypertonic saline and mannitol was quantified, and mortality associated with both diabetic ketoacidosis and cerebral edema in diabetic ketoacidosis was examined. Overall mortality in diabetic ketoacidosis was 0.25% and significantly decreased (p < 0.001) over the study period, whereas the frequency of treatment with hyperosmolar agents (3.8%) was unchanged. Use of mannitol as a sole agent decreased from 98% to 49%, 3% hypertonic saline as a sole agent increased from 2% to 39%, and combined therapy increased from 0% to 10%. Use of 3% hypertonic saline alone was associated with a higher mortality than mannitol alone (adjusted odds ratio, 2.71 [95% CI, 1.01-7.26]) in patients treated for cerebral edema. Similar results were obtained after adjustment for the propensity to receive hypertonic saline (adjusted odds ratio, 2.33 [95% CI, 1.07-5.07]) and in the subset of subjects receiving mechanical ventilation (adjusted odds ratio, 3.27 [95% CI, 1.12-9.60]). Hypertonic saline has replaced mannitol as the most commonly used agent at many institutions for treatment of cerebral edema in diabetic ketoacidosis. In our analysis, however, use of hypertonic saline as a sole agent was associated with an increased risk of mortality. Recognizing the limitations of administrative data, we conclude that equipoise regarding choice of therapy for treatment of cerebral edema in diabetic ketoacidosis should be maintained until a more definitive study is performed to guide therapy of this potentially lethal complication.

However, there is no conclusive evidence that the use of small-particle aerosols to target small airways improves clinical outcomes in controlled clinical trials. Clinical outcomes of patients with symptomatic asthma have been better in ""real-life"" studies when fine-particle aerosols were compared with conventional (large-particle) aerosols.

A total of five papers were reviewed: two randomized controlled trials (RCTs), a post-hoc subset analysis of adolescents who had been included in three RCTs carried out on adults and two open studies. Topiramate has been proven to reduce headache frequency and the accompanying disability. The frequency of side effects varied considerably among studies, the most frequent being weight loss, anorexia, abdominal pain, difficulties in concentrating, sedation and paresthesia. Since these adverse events, although often transitory, may be distressing for the child, we strongly recommend to assess the disability caused by the migraine episodes before deciding to initiate a prophylactic treatment.

Primary outcomes were caries increment, plaque levels, gingival health, reported frequency and/or amount of free sugars intake and oral hygiene behaviour. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane criteria. Eight cluster RCTs met the inclusion criteria and had substantial heterogeneity. Three trials assessed caries increment and one found significant reductions in the intervention group. Another trial found similar benefits, but these were limited to children from high socioeconomic groups. The third trial found an increase in dental caries in the intervention group. Three studies reported significant reductions in plaque scores and improvements in gingival health with modest effects. Interventions delivered by peers (at adolescence) or with parents' involvement (at pre-adolescence) showed significant reductions in plaque scores compared to those delivered by dentists or teachers only. Most interventions showed significant improvements in self-reported behaviours. There is limited evidence of clinical benefit to dental health from school-based behavioural interventions.

Samples of whole-mouth saliva and dental plaque were collected from initially 7- to 8-year-old subjects who participated in a 3-year school-based programme investigating the effect of the consumption of polyol-containing candies on caries rates. The subjects were randomized in three cohorts, consumed erythritol, xylitol, or sorbitol candies. The daily polyol consumption from the candies was approximately 7.5 g. A significant reduction in dental plaque weight from baseline (p<0.05) occurred in the erythritol group during almost all intervention years while no changes were found in xylitol and sorbitol groups. Usage of polyol candies had no significant or consistent effect on the levels of plaque protein, glucose, glycerol, or calcium, determined yearly in connection with caries examinations. After three years, the plaque of erythritol-receiving subjects contained significantly (p<0.05) lower levels of acetic acid and propionic acid than that of subjects receiving xylitol or sorbitol. Lactic acid levels partly followed the same pattern. The consumption of erythritol was generally associated with significantly (p<0.05) lower counts of salivary and plaque mutans streptococci compared with the other groups.

Cross sectional. The recent indicators recommended by the World Health Organization-United Nations Childrens Fund-International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (WHO-UNICEF-ICCIDD) were utilized for the assessment of IDD. A total of 30 clusters were selected using population proportionate to size cluster sampling procedure. In each identified cluster, one primary school was selected using random sampling. A total of 6911 school children in the age group of 8-10 years were included for the study. The total goiter prevalence rate was 8.6% while 2.1, 8.4, 17.6 and 71.9% of the children had urinary iodine excretion levels of < 2, 2-4.9, 5-9.9 and 10 and above mcg/dl, respectively. The median urinary iodine excretion was 17 mcg/dl. Of the 1854 salt samples analyzed, salt with a nil iodine content was consumed only by 1.4% of the beneficiaries. Forty one per cent of families consumed salt with an iodine content of less than 15 ppm. IDD continues to be a public-health problem in the NCT of Delhi.

715,715,26707022,"The objective of this paper is to investigate differences in diets of families in intervention versus control communities 5 years after the Identification and Prevention of Dietary- and Lifestyle-Induced Health Effects in Children and Infants intervention ended. Altogether, 4,691 families from the I.Family study with at least one participating parent and one child are included in this analysis. Diet quality indicators, defined as propensities to consume fat, sugar, water and fruit and vegetables, are calculated from a 59-item food frequency questionnaire. Multilevel linear models with random intercepts for study centre are used to determine whether mean diet indicators, calculated at the family level, differed as a function of previous exposure to the intervention. Families in the intervention communities reported a significantly lower sugar propensity (19.8% vs. 20.7% of total food items, p < 0.01) and a higher water propensity (47.3% vs. 46.0% of total beverages, p < 0.05) compared with families in the control communities, while fat and fruit and vegetables propensities were similar. No significant diet differences between intervention and control children were present at the Identification and Prevention of Dietary- and Lifestyle-Induced Health Effects in Children and Infants baseline. This result indicates better diet quality in intervention families, which was not present in children when their diets were assessed before the intervention, and gives some cause for optimism regarding the sustainability of some aspects of the diet intervention.

In the village of Rude near Zagreb, goiter was detected in 85% of school children with 2.3% of cretins in the village population. In 1953 the first regulation on obligatory salt iodination, requiring 10 mg of potassium iodide (KI) per kg of salt was established in former Yugoslavia. A three-fold reduction of goiter prevalence, together with disappearance of cretinism was recorded ten years later In 1992, the National Committee for Eradication of Goiter was founded. The survey performed during 1991-1993 exhibited prevalence of goiter among school children between 8% and 35% and urinary iodine excretion under 10 microg/dL in most of the children from continental parts of the country. The new obligatory regulation, requiring 25 mg of KI/kg of salt, was proposed by the National Comittee and finally established in 1996. In 2002 thyroid volumes and medians of urinary iodine excretion were normal according to the ICCIDD criteria. Overall median of urinary iodine excretion for schoolchildren in Croatia was 14 ug/dL.

Insulin resistance is prevalent metabolic abnormality in pediatric obesity. The Pediatric Obesity Clinic was established in 2011 at the Children's Medical Center, Landspítali University Hospital. This study aimed to observe metabolic abnormalities and insulin resistance in blood values of children receiving obesity treatment. The study included all children (n = 180) who received obesity treatment at The Pediatric Obesity Clinic between 2016 and 2020 and had at least eight out of the nine following serum values analyzed while fasting: HbA1c, glucose, insulin, ALAT, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, TSH and free T4. HOMA-IR value was calculated from insulin and glucose values. Decreased insulin sensitivity was defined as HOMA-IR > 3.42. 84% of the children had at least one abnormality in their tested blood values. 50% had abnormal insulin values and 44% had abnormal ALAT values. 78% had decreased insulin sensitivity, and their mean HOMA-IR was 7.3 (± 5.0), surpassing twice the normal value. A large majority of the children undergoing obesity treatment already exhibited signs of metabolic sequelae during their treatment.

722,722,24452235,"During the first 2 y of life, development is rapid and includes dramatic changes in eating behavior. Individual patterns of food preferences and eating behaviors emerge and differ depending on the foods offered and on the contexts of feeding during this early period of dietary transition. In this review, we discuss evidence on ways in which early learning influences food preferences and eating behavior, which, in turn, shape differences in dietary patterns, growth, and health. Although the evidence reviewed indicates that this early period of transition provides opportunities to influence children's developing intake patterns, there is no consistent, evidence-based guidance for caregivers who are feeding infants and toddlers; the current Dietary Guidelines are intended to apply to Americans over the age of 2 y. At present, the evidence base with regard to how and what children learn about food and eating behavior during these first years is limited. Before developing guidance for parents and caregivers, more scholarship and research is necessary to understand how infants and toddlers develop the food preferences and self-regulatory processes necessary to promote healthy growth, particularly in today's environment. By the time they reach 2 y of age, children have essentially completed the transition to ""table foods"" and are consuming diets similar to those of other family members. This article discusses parenting and feeding approaches that may facilitate or impede the development of self-regulation of intake and the acceptance of a variety of foods and flavors necessary for a healthy diet. We review the limited evidence on how traditional feeding practices, familiarization, associative learning, and observational learning affect the development of eating behavior in the context of the current food environment. Areas for future research that could inform the development of anticipatory guidance for parents and caregivers responsible for the care and feeding of young children are identified.

723,723,17015497,"The obesity epidemic in the United States continues to increase. Because obesity tends to track over time, the increase in overweight among young children is of significant concern. A number of eating patterns have been associated with overweight among preschool-aged children. Recently, 100% fruit juice and sweetened fruit drinks have received considerable attention as potential sources of high-energy beverages that could be related to the prevalence of obesity among young children. Our aim was to evaluate the beverage intake among preschool children who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002 and investigate associations between types and amounts of beverages consumed and weight status in preschool-aged children. We performed a secondary analysis of the data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002, which is a continuous, cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of the noninstitutionalized population of the United States. It included the collection of parent reported demographic descriptors, a 24-hour dietary recall, a measure of physical activity, and a standardized physical examination. The 24-hour dietary recall was obtained in person by a trained interviewer and reflected the foods and beverages that were consumed by the participant the previous day. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey food groups were classified on the basis of the US Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies. We reviewed the main food descriptors used and classified all beverages listed. One hundred percent fruit juice was classified as only beverages that contained 100% fruit juice, without sweetener. Fruit drinks included any sweetened fruit juice, fruit-flavored drink (natural or artificial), or drink that contained fruit juice in part. Milk included any type of cow milk and then was subcategorized by percentage of milk fat. Any sweetened soft drink, caffeinated or uncaffeinated, was categorized as soda. Diet drinks included any fruit drink, tea, or soda that was sweetened by low-calorie sweetener. Several beverages were removed from the analysis because of low frequency of consumption among the sample. Water was not included in the analysis because it is not part of the US Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrient Database categories. For the purposes of this analysis, the beverages were converted and reported as ounces, rather than grams, as reported by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, to make it more clinically relevant. The child's BMI percentile for age and gender were calculated on the basis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria and used to identify children's weight status as underweight (< 5%), normal weight (5% to < 85%), at risk for overweight (85% to < 95%), or overweight (> or = 95%). Because of the small number of children in the underweight category, they were included in the normal-weight category for this analysis. Data were analyzed using SUDAAN 9.0.1 statistical software programs. SUDAAN allows for improved accuracy and validity of results by calculating test statistics for the stratified, multistage probability design of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Sample weights were applied to all analyses to account for unequal probability of selection from oversampling low-income children and black and Mexican American children. Descriptive and chi2 analyses and analysis of covariance, adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, household income, energy intake, and physical activity, were conducted. All children who were aged 2 to 5 years were identified (N = 1572). Those with missing data were removed from additional analysis, resulting in a final sample of 1160 preschool children. Of the 1160 children analyzed, 579 (49.9%) were male. White children represented 35%, black children represented 28.3%, and Hispanic children represented 36.7% of the sample. Twenty-four percent of the children were overweight or at risk for overweight (BMI > or = 85%), and 10.7% were overweight (BMI > or = 95%). There were no statistically significant differences in BMI between boys and girls or among the ethnicities. Overweight children tended to be older (mean age: 3.83 years) compared with the normal-weight children (mean age: 3.48 years). Eighty-three percent of children drank milk, 48% drank 100% fruit juice, 44% drank fruit drink, and 39% drank soda. Whole milk was consumed by 46.5% of the children, and 3.1% and 5.5% of the children consumed skim milk and 1% milk, respectively. Preschool children consumed a mean total beverage volume of 26.93 oz/day, which included 12.32 oz of milk, 4.70 oz of 100% fruit juice, 4.98 oz of fruit drinks, and 3.25 oz of soda. Weight status of the child had no association with the amount of total beverages, milk, 100% fruit juice, fruit drink, or soda consumed. There was no clinically significant association between the types of milk (percentage of fat) consumed and weight status. In analysis of covariance, daily total energy intake increased with increased consumption of milk, 100% fruit juice, fruit drinks, and soda. However, there was not a statistically significant increase in BMI on the basis of quantity of milk, 100% fruit juice, fruit drink, or soda consumed. On average, preschool children drank less milk than the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommendation of 16 oz/day. Only 8.6% drank low-fat or skim milk, as recommended for children who are older than 2 years. On average, preschool children drank < 6 oz/day 100% fruit juice. Increased beverage consumption was associated with an increase in the total energy intake of the children but not with their BMI. Prospectively studying preschool children beyond 2 to 5 years of age, through their adiposity rebound (approximately 5.5-6 years) to determine whether there is a trajectory increase in their BMI, may help to clarify the role of beverage consumption in total energy intake and weight status.

728,728,32642773,"There is limited information regarding the potential effect macronutrients have on postprandial glycemic variability in young children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). To date, studies examining nutrition and glycemic outcomes either assess these factors at a single timepoint, or aggregate large datasets for group level analyses. This study examined how inter- and intraindividual fluctuations in carbohydrate, fat, and protein intake impact glycemic variability in the postprandial period for young children with T1D. Thirty-nine young children, aged 2-6 years, wore a continuous glucose monitor for 72 hr, while their parents completed detailed diet records of all food intake. The analyses tested three multilevel models to examine intra- and interindividual differences between food intake and postprandial glycemic variability. The results suggest carbohydrate intake, relates to greater postprandial glycemic variability. In contrast, the results reveal the inverse effect for protein, suggesting a tendency for young children who ate more protein at some meals to have lower postprandial glycemic variability, with the exception of lunch. There was no effect for fat on postprandial glycemic variability. These results suggest protein consumption may be an important consideration when aiming for optimal glycemic levels for some meals. When counseling parents of young children with T1D on common behaviors underlying glycemic excursion, pediatric psychologists may consider discussing the nutritional make up of children's meals.

Nasal mucociliary clearance is the most important protective factor that protects the upper and lower airways from foreign particulates. This study aimed to investigate the effect of celiac disease on nasal mucociliary clearance. The study included patients with celiac disease and healthy children. Nasal mucociliary clearance time was measured using the saccharin test. The children's saccharin taste time was recorded in seconds. Overall, 65 children were included: 43 patients with celiac disease (66.2%) and 22 healthy children (33.8%). Of all the children, 42 (64.6%) were female, and the average age was 11.8 ± 4 years. Nasal mucociliary clearance time of patients with celiac disease (531 ± 155 s) was significantly prolonged in comparison to that of healthy children (448 ± 80 s) (p = 0.006). No relationships were found between the diagnosis age, celiac type, and histopathological phase and compliance with the gluten-free diet and nasal mucociliary clearance time of patients with celiac disease. This study showed that nasal mucociliary clearance was prolonged in patients with celiac disease. A defect in nasal mucociliary clearance increases the risk of infection and inflammation in small airways. Studies reported a high prevalence of respiratory tract infection in patients with celiac disease, which was associated with malnutrition, vitamin deficiency, and hyposplenism. The findings of the present study indicated that impairment of nasal mucociliary clearance could play a role in the development of frequent lung infections in patients with celiac disease.

Children aged 4-59 months participating in WIC. Daily servings of total SSBs, daily servings of specific types of SSBs, and daily servings of water. Multivariable count regression models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations of the duration of family WIC participation with daily servings of total SSBs, water, and specific types of SSBs. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression models were used for total SSBs and specific types of SSBs, and Poisson regression was used for water. Children of families with 2 years of WIC participation consumed significantly fewer daily servings of total SSBs (IRR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.93-0.98; P = 0.002), fruit-flavored SSBs (IRR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91-0.99; P = 0.02), soda (IRR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.98; P = 0.02), and water (IRR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.98 to < 1.00; P = 0.03) than children of families with 1 year of WIC participation. Protective associations for total SSBs, fruit-flavored SSBs, and soda remained statistically significant and increased in magnitude through 10 years of family WIC participation. Duration of WIC participation was associated with decreased SSB intake by young children. Given the role that increasing water intake in lieu of SSBs plays in child obesity, improving the effectiveness of WIC nutrition education on parental perceptions and provision of fruit-flavored SSBs and water to their children merits detailed evaluation.

This study aimed to characterize glycemic control throughout ALL/ALLy and to evaluate risk factors and outcomes associated with increased mean glucose and glucose coefficient of variation (glucose CV) during induction chemotherapy. The records for 220 pediatric/young adult patients, age 1 to 26 years, who underwent treatment for ALL/ALLy from 2010 to 2014 at Children's Hospital Colorado were retrospectively reviewed. Measures of glycemic control were calculated for each cycle.

Highest mean glucose by cycle were induction 116 mg/dL, pretreatment 108 mg/dL, delayed intensification 96 mg/dL, and maintenance 93 mg/dL; these cycles also had the most glycemic variability. During induction, patients with Down syndrome, or who were ≥12 years and overweight/obese, had higher mean glucoses; age and overweight/obese status were each associated with increased glucose CV.

The aims of this study were (a) to examine lifestyle behavior changes for 30 obese preschoolers participating in a weight-control intervention and (b) to explore which lifestyle behavior changes predicted changes in body mass index (BMI) z score. Preschooler height, weight, diet (three 24-hr recalls), physical activity (accelerometry), and television use (parent report) were measured at baseline and posttreatment (6 months). A linear regression was conducted to examine pre- to posttreatment changes in diet (i.e., intake of calories, sugar-sweetened beverages, fruits and vegetables, and sweet and salty snacks) and activity (i.e., moderate-to-vigorous activity and television use) behaviors on changes in BMI z score. Despite significant reductions in sugar-sweetened beverage intake and television use, and increases in fruit and vegetable intake, only reductions in absolute caloric intake significantly predicted reductions in BMI z score. Our findings suggest that attaining healthy caloric goals may be the most important component of weight-control interventions for preschoolers.

Observational data link SSB consumption with excessive weight gain; however, randomized, controlled trials are lacking and necessary to resolve the debate. We conducted a pilot study to examine the effect of decreasing SSB consumption on body weight. We randomly assigned 103 adolescents aged 13 to 18 years who regularly consumed SSBs to intervention and control groups. The intervention, 25 weeks in duration, relied largely on home deliveries of noncaloric beverages to displace SSBs and thereby decrease consumption. Change in SSB consumption was the main process measure, and change in body mass index (BMI) was the primary end point. All of the randomly assigned subjects completed the study. Consumption of SSBs decreased by 82% in the intervention group and did not change in the control group. Change in BMI, adjusted for gender and age, was 0.07 +/- 0.14 kg/m2 (mean +/- SE) for the intervention group and 0.21 +/- 0.15 kg/m2 for the control group.

The interaction between weight change and baseline BMI was not attributable to baseline consumption of SSBs.

751,751,34813490,"Short and animated story-based (SAS) videos can be an effective strategy for promoting health messages. However, health promotion strategies often motivate the rejection of health messages, a phenomenon known as reactance. In this study, we examine whether the child narrator of a SAS video (perceived as nonthreatening, with low social authority) minimizes reactance to a health message about the consumption of added sugars. This study aims to determine whether our SAS intervention video attenuates reactance to the sugar message when compared with a content placebo video (a health message about sunscreen) and a placebo video (a nonhealth message about earthquakes) and determine if the child narrator is more effective at reducing reactance to the sugar message when compared with the mother narrator (equivalent social authority to target audience) or family physician narrator (high social authority) of the same SAS video. This is a web-based randomized controlled trial comparing an intervention video about sugar reduction narrated by a child, the child's mother, or the family physician with a content placebo video about sunscreen use and a placebo video about earthquakes. The primary end points are differences in the antecedents to reactance (proneness to reactance, threat level of the message), its components (anger and negative cognition), and outcomes (source appraisal and attitude). We performed analysis of variance on data collected (N=4013) from participants aged 18 to 59 years who speak English and reside in the United Kingdom. Between December 9 and December 11, 2020, we recruited 38.62% (1550/4013) men, 60.85% (2442/4013) women, and 0.52% (21/4013) others for our study. We found a strong causal relationship between the persuasiveness of the content promoted by the videos and the components of reactance. Compared with the placebo (mean 1.56, SD 0.63) and content placebo (mean 1.76, SD 0.69) videos, the intervention videos (mean 1.99, SD 0.83) aroused higher levels of reactance to the message content (P<.001). We found no evidence that the child narrator (mean 1.99, SD 0.87) attenuated reactance to the sugar reduction message when compared with the physician (mean 1.95, SD 0.79; P=.77) and mother (mean 2.03, SD 0.83; P=.93). In addition, the physician was perceived as more qualified, reliable, and having more expertise than the child (P<.001) and mother (P<.001) narrators. Although children may be perceived as nonthreatening messengers, we found no evidence that a child narrator attenuated reactance to a SAS video about sugar consumption when compared with a physician.

753,753,32374713,"Limiting free sugars to <5% of energy intake is a World Health Organization evidence-based recommendation to protect oral health throughout the life course. Achieving this requires a concerted approach with upstream interventions, including legislation underpinning community interventions and health promotion. Global production and trade are the main drivers of sugars consumption, which can be addressed only through prioritization of health impacts in agricultural and trade agreements, including pricing and subsidies. Increasing evidence demonstrates the benefit, including dental benefits, of taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages, a major source of sugars-with taxes based on sugars content being favored due to the dual impact in incentivizing consumers to buy less and encouraging producers to use less through product reformulation. A benefit of product reformulation is that the potential impact on sugars intake occurs independent of consumer behavior change, making the benefits more equitable across social groups. Evidence from meta-analysis indicates that sugars reformulation and portion size reduction could lower energy intake by more than 10% and 16%, respectively. Sophisticated and targeted digital marketing of products high in sugars is another key driver of sugars intake. With the exception of children's television broadcasting, marketing of products high in sugars is largely unregulated, and increased awareness of modern marketing strategies and more stringent regulation are urgently needed. To ensure a commercial level playing field, mandatory approaches are required. Midstream actions include creating healthier food environments in neighborhoods, community settings (schools, sports centers, hospitals), and workplaces. Only through coalition among authorities responsible for planning and health will ""obesogenic and cariogenic"" environments be replaced with those that make healthy choices the easiest choice. It is recognized that providing nutrition health education alone is insufficient to achieve necessary sugars reduction; however, education has a key role to play in changing social norms and creating drive for change.

A content analysis of FOP claims/imagery (e.g., nutrient claims, fruit imagery) on beverages (n = 1365) purchased by households with 0-5-year-olds was conducted by linking beverage sales with FOP marketing data. Results were merged with purchasing data from a nationally representative sample of households (FoodAPS), and survey-weighted logistic regression was used to assess differences in the proportions of 100% juices and fruit drinks with specific FOP claims/imagery purchased by household race/ethnicity, income, and SNAP/WIC participation. The most common claims on fruit-flavored beverages included nutrient claims (fruit drinks: 73%; 100% juices: 68%; flavored waters: 95%), which most commonly highlighted vitamin C (35-41% across beverage categories) and the absence of sugar (31-48%). Most beverages also contained implied-natural claims (fruit drinks: 60%; 100% juices: 64%; flavored waters: 95%) and natural imagery (fruit drinks: 97%; 100% juices: 96%; flavored waters: 73%). A large proportion of fruit drinks and 100% juices purchased by households across all demographic groups contained FOP claims and imagery, with a few minor differences between racial/ethnic groups. In conclusion, most fruit drinks, 100% juices, and flavored waters purchased by households with 0-5-year-olds contained FOP claims and imagery that may lead consumers to believe the beverages are healthy and natural.

Complex ingredient terminology (eg, casein and whey for milk) and label ambiguities (eg, natural flavor and may contain peanut ) might compromise the ability of patients/parents to determine the safety of particular products. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the accuracy of label reading among parents of food-allergic children. Parents of children on restricted diets attending our referral center were asked to review a group of 23 food labels taken from widely available commercial products. For each label, each parent/parent pair was asked to indicate whether the product was safe for the allergic child and, if it was not, which foods restricted from the child's diet were in the product. There were 91 participants. Peanut was the most commonly restricted food (82 children), followed by milk, egg, soy, and wheat (60, 45, 27 and 16 children, respectively). Identification of milk and soy was the most problematic: only 4 (7%) of 60 parents correctly identified all 14 labels that indicated milk, and only 6 (22%) of 27 parents correctly identified soy protein in 7 products. Peanut was correctly identified in 5 products by 44 (54%) of the 82 parents restricting peanut. Wheat (10 labels) and egg (7 labels) were correctly identified by most parents (14/16 and 42/45, respectively). Correct label identification was associated with prior instruction by a dietitian. With current labeling practices, most parents are unable to identify common allergenic food ingredients.

767,767,35619251,"One of the important parameters in the case of dosage form is taste. Most of the drugs available in oral dosage form have an unpleasant taste which leads to patient incompliance and affects the success ratio of products in the market. Geriatric and paediatric patients suffer more with the bitter taste of medicines. According to the studies reported, it is found that 50% of the population have the problem swallowing tablets, especially the pediatric and geriatric population. Masking the taste of bitter drugs has become necessary in the pharmaceutical field and increasing interest of researchers to develop various methods for masking the bitter taste of drugs. Five major tastes, felt by our tongue are salt, sour, sweet, bitter, and umami. When the drug dissolves with saliva, drug molecules interact with taste receptors present on the tongue and give taste sensations. Although, many solid oral dosage forms like pills, and tablets have an additional advantage of masking and encapsulation of bitter taste drugs; however, they might not be effective for children because they may or may not swallow pills or tablets. There are various other methods that mask the bitter taste of drugs such as the addition of sweeteners and flavouring agents, granulation, coating, inclusion complexes, extrusion method, ion-exchange resins, etc, discussed in the first section of the article. The second part of this article consists of various nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems that were fabricated by researchers to mask the bitter taste of drugs. A brief of recent literature on various nanocarriers that were fabricated or developed for taste masking has been discussed in this part.

For all calls to a single poison center that involved e-cigarette devices or refill fluid, a data collection instrument was filled out by the specialist in poison information (SPI). Two hundred sixty-five total cases were identified, including 193 children and 72 adults. The majority of both pediatric (72%; 139/193) and adult (61%; n = 44/72) exposures involved e-liquid refill containers or fluid. Fifty-six percent (n = 108/193) of pediatric exposures involved ingestion of refill liquid. Though children who ingested e-liquid received only a small amount, initial symptoms were evident in 32% (n = 35/108) of cases. Children who did not ingest or inhale the products were less likely to develop toxicity. Only 2 children who were asymptomatic on initial call became symptomatic on follow-up. Most patients symptoms resolved within 4 hours. Seventy-one specific products/brands were identified with nicotine concentrations ranging from 0 mg/mL to 60 mg/mL with one product containing 3000 mg in a single bottle. A variety of flavors were identified, including several with names that may be attractive to toddlers or adolescents. E-cig exposures tend to produce irritant effects from topical exposures and nicotine toxicity from ingestions, as well as some dermal and ""sucking"" toddler exposures. Exposure to e-cig fluid or device frequently causes mild symptoms and rarely may produce systemic nicotine toxicity.

Research shows that consumption of SSBs leads to weight gain in both adults and children, and reducing SSBs will significantly impact the prevalence of obesity and its related diseases. We estimated the effect of a 20% tax on SSBs on the prevalence of and obesity among adults in South Africa. A mathematical simulation model was constructed to estimate the effect of a 20% SSB tax on the prevalence of obesity. We used consumption data from the 2012 SA National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and a previous meta-analysis of studies on own- and cross-price elasticities of SSBs to estimate the shift in daily energy consumption expected of increased prices of SSBs, and energy balance equations to estimate shifts in body mass index. The population distribution of BMI by age and sex was modelled by fitting measured data from the SA National Income Dynamics Survey 2012 to the lognormal distribution and shifting the mean values. Uncertainty was assessed with Monte Carlo simulations. A 20% tax is predicted to reduce energy intake by about 36 kJ per day (95% CI: 9-68 kJ). Obesity is projected to reduce by 3.8% (95% CI: 0.6%-7.1%) in men and 2.4% (95% CI: 0.4%-4.4%) in women. The number of obese adults would decrease by over 220 000 (95% CI: 24 197-411 759).

Several studies have been conducted on adults, but little is known about children's opinions on colours of medicines and to what extent medicines' colour affects their acceptability. To address this gap, a systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE, and Web of Science was conducted. Two authors independently screened the titles, abstracts, and references of all articles and selected studies conducted on children (0-18 years old), assessing children's preferences or opinions about colour of oral dosage forms as either a primary or secondary objective or as an anecdotal record. A total of 989 publications were identified and, after screening, 18 publications were included in the review. Red and pink were the most liked colours and there appeared to be a relationship between the colour of a medicine and expected taste/flavour. The review also highlighted a scarcity of information, usually collected as an anecdotal record. Several gaps in the current knowledge were underlined, emphasizing the need of patient-centred studies to understand if the use of certain colours can improve or worsen the acceptability of a paediatric medicine.

In a group of children and adults, we determined whether adding sucrose to urea, caffeine, denatonium benzoate, propylthiouracil (PROP), and quinine would reduce their bitterness using a forced-choice method of paired comparisons. To better understand individual differences, adults also rated each solution using a more complex test (general Labeled Magnitude Scale [gLMS]) and were genotyped for the sweet taste receptor gene TAS1R3 and the bitter receptor TAS2R38. Sucrose suppressed the bitterness of each agent in children and adults. In adults, sucrose was effective in reducing the bitterness ratings from moderate to weak for all compounds tested, but those with the sensitive form of the sweet receptor reported greater reduction for caffeine and quinine. For PROP, sucrose was most effective for those who were genetically the most sensitive, although this did not attain statistical significance.

776,776,23888053,"Hypertriglyceridemia is the most common lipid disorder in obesity and type 2 diabetes. It results from increased production and/or decreased clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. To better understand the pathophysiology of hypertriglyceridemia, we studied hepatic regulation of triglyceride metabolism by the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a member of the basic leucine zipper-containing protein subfamily. We determined the effect of ATF4 on hepatic lipid metabolism in Atf4(-/-) mice fed regular chow or provided with free access to fructose drinking water. ATF4 depletion preferentially attenuated hepatic lipogenesis without affecting hepatic triglyceride production and fatty acid oxidation. This effect prevented excessive fat accumulation in the liver of Atf4(-/-) mice, when compared with wild-type littermates. To gain insight into the underlying mechanism, we showed that ATF4 depletion resulted in a significant reduction in hepatic expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, a nuclear receptor that acts to promote lipogenesis in the liver. This effect was accompanied by a significant reduction in hepatic expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and fatty-acid synthase, three key functions in the lipogenic pathway in Atf4(-/-) mice. Of particular significance, we found that Atf4(-/-) mice, as opposed to wild-type littermates, were protected against the development of steatosis and hypertriglyceridemia in response to high fructose feeding. These data demonstrate that ATF4 plays a critical role in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism in response to nutritional cues.

782,782,38498239,"Intravenous maintenance fluid therapy (IV-MFT) is probably the most prescribed drug in paediatric hospital care. Recently paediatric societies have produced evidence-based practice guidelines that recommend the use of balanced isotonic fluid when prescribing IV-MFT in both acute and critical paediatric care. Unfortunately, the applicability of these guidelines could be called into question when a ready-to-use glucose-containing balanced isotonic fluid is not available. The main objective of this study was to describe the availability of glucose-containing balanced isotonic fluids in European and Middle Eastern paediatric acute and critical care settings. This work is an ancillary study of the survey dedicated to IV-MFT practices in the paediatric acute and critical care settings in Europe and Middle East, a cross-sectional electronic 27-item survey, emailed in April-May 2021 to paediatric critical care physicians across 34 European and Middle East countries. The survey was developed by an expert multi-professional panel within the European Society of Peadiatric and Neonatal Intensive Care (ESPNIC). Balanced isotonic fluid with glucose 5% was available for only 32/153 (21%) responders. Balanced isotonic fluid with glucose 5% was consistently available in the UK (90%) but not available in France, Greece, The Netherlands and Turkey.    Conclusion: Ready-to-use isotonic balanced IV solutions containing glucose in sufficient amount exist but are inconsistently available throughout Europe. National and European Medication Safety Incentives should guarantee the availability of the most appropriate and safest IV-MFT solution for all children. What is Known: • Intravenous maintenance fluid therapy (IV-MFT) is probably the most prescribed drug in paediatric hospital care. • Balanced isotonic fluid is recommended when prescribing IV-MFT in both acute and critical paediatric care. What is New: • Balanced isotonic fluid with glucose 5% is available for less than 25% of the prescribers in Europe and the Middle East. Availability of balanced isotonic fluid with glucose 5% varies from one country to another but can also be inconsistent within the same country. • Clinicians who have access to a ready-to-use balanced isotonic fluid with glucose 5% are more likely to consider its use than clinicians who do not have access to such an IV solution.

On the whole, we find our results agree with those of previous studies, but we add certain observations. First, when we considered the sum value of glucose and lactate in the vitreous humour, we found that not only diabetes patients are included in the higher range group (values > or = 430 mg%): intensive reanimation or prolonged or intense agony should also be taken into account. Indeed, when we split our study group into acute agony and prolonged agony subgroups, we noticed a statistically significant difference; persons dying after protracted agony showed a higher sum value, which can be explained in terms of biophysical dynamics. Second, a positive correlation was found between the lactate and the sum values on one hand, and the postmortem interval on the other. However, the vitreous glucose, lactate, and sum values are so dispersed that a precise determination of the postmortem interval cannot be obtained on the basis of these parameters. Additionally, we compared several causes of death, but unfortunately, we did not manage to reveal that some causes of death were specifically limited to high or low concentrations. Indeed, the statistically significant differences in sum values could easily be explained by factors such as intensity of agony, reanimation attempts, or iatrogenic interventions (e.g., glucose infusions).

786,786,25663610,"This survey aimed to assess iodine status in a female population at different ages, also investigating their eating habits. We measured urinary iodine concentrations (UIC) in: 634 females at puberty and 361 fertile women in 246 of whom were considered also their children (134 daughters and 120 sons). All subjects completed a food frequency questionnaire. Median UIC decreased from childhood to adulthood (median UIC 107, 77 and 55 μg/l in the young girls, females at puberty and fertile women, respectively). Though using iodized salt improved iodine status in all groups, a significantly higher UIC was only noted in females at puberty. Milk consumption significantly increased UIC at all ages. In mother-child (both daughters and sons) pairs, the children's median UIC was nearly twice as high as their mothers' (UIC 115 vs. 57 μg/l). Milk consumption varied significantly: 56% of the mothers and 76% of their children drank milk regularly. The children (both daughters and sons) and mothers who drank milk had UIC ≥100 μg/l in 59 and 34% of cases, respectively, among the pairs who did not drink milk, 44% of the children and 19% of the mothers had UIC ≥100 μg/l. On statistical regression, 3.6% of the variability in the children's UIC depended on that of their mothers. Dietary iodine status declines from childhood to adulthood in females due to different eating habits. A mild iodine deficiency emerged in women of child-bearing age that could have consequences during pregnancy and lactation.

The purpose of this study was to analyse the relationship between obesity and hypertension and related factors in Italian students. We studied 2007 healthy individuals between the ages of 6 and 17 years of age (998 males and 1009 females) attending schools in the cities of Varese (northern Italy), Rome (central Italy) and Catanzaro (southern Italy). The blood pressure, weight and height of the students were measured. We also assessed their daily intake of foods and the amount of physical activity they performed. A questionnaire was administered to the parents of the subjects to obtain information on the child's medical history and family lifestyle. Of the students, 27.2% were overweight, and 6.6% were obese, with the highest percentages in southern Italy. A total of 6.2% of students had hypertension, and the region with the highest percentage was found to be northern Italy. Obese students had a risk of developing hypertension that was four times greater than those subjects who were of normal weight. Overweight and obese children/adolescents were more frequently found in southern Italy as opposed to northern and central Italy, and hypertensive children were more prevalent in the north. An unhealthy diet might explain the more widely spread obesity among children living in the south; an excess use of salt could explain the greater rate of hypertension found among children/adolescents living in the north.

788,788,24308394,"The aim of this paper is to make known the potential of fluoridated salt in community oral health programs, particularly in South Eastern Europe. Since 1922, the addition of iodine to salt has been successful in Switzerland. Goiter is virtually extinct. By 1945, the caries-protective effect of fluorides was well established. Based on the success of water fluoridation, a gynecologist started adding of fluoride to salt. The sale of fluoridated salt began in 1956 in the Swiss Canton of Zurich, and several other cantons followed suit. Studies initiated in the early seventies showed that fluoride, when added to salt, inhibits dental caries. The addition of fluoride to salt for human consumption was officially authorized in 1980-82. In Switzerland 85% of domestic salt consumed is fluoridated and 67% in Germany. Salt fluoridation schemes are reaching more than one hundred million in Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Cuba. The cost of salt fluoridation is very low, within 0.02 and 0.05 € per year and capita. Children and adults of the low socio-economic strata tend to have substantially more untreated caries than higher strata. Salt fluoridation is by far the cheapest method for improving oral health. Salt fluoridation has cariostatic potential like water fluoridation (caries reductions up to 50%). In Europe, meaningful percentages of users have been attained only in Germany (67%) and Switzerland (85%). In Latin America, there are more than 100 million users, and several countries have arrived at coverage of 90 to 99%. Salt fluoridation is by far the cheapest method of caries prevention, and billions of people throughout the world could benefit from this method.

790,790,34776289,"One in five UK children aged 10-11 years live with obesity. They are more likely to continue living with obesity into adulthood and to develop obesity-related chronic health conditions at a younger age. Regulating the marketing of high fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) foods and beverages has been highlighted as a promising approach to obesity prevention. In 2019, Transport for London implemented restrictions on the advertisement of HFSS products across its network. This paper reports on a process evaluation of the design and implementation of this intervention. In 2019-2020, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 23 stakeholders. Interviews with those responsible for implementation (n = 13) explored stakeholder roles, barriers and facilitators to policy development/implementation and unintended consequences. Interviews with food industry stakeholders (n = 10) explored perceptions and acceptability of the policy, changes to business practice and impact on business. Data were analysed using a general inductive approach. Practical challenges included limited time between policy announcement and implementation, translating the concept of 'junk food' into operational policy, the legal landscape, and reported uneven impacts across industry stakeholders. Political challenges included designing a policy the public views as appropriate, balancing health and financial impacts, and the perceived influence of political motivations. Consultation during policy development and close communication with industry reportedly facilitated implementation, as did the development of an exceptions process that provided a review pathway for HFSS products that might not contribute to children's HFSS consumption. Findings suggest that restricting the outdoor advertisement of HFSS foods and beverages at scale is feasible within a complex policy and business landscape. We outline practical steps that may further facilitate the development and implementation of similar policies and we report on the importance of ensuring such policies are applied in a way that is perceived as reasonable by industry and the public.

791,791,25211467,"High-fructose diets have been implicated in obesity via impairment of leptin signaling in humans and rodents. We investigated whether fructose-induced leptin resistance in mice could be used to study the metabolic consequences of fructose consumption in humans, particularly in children and adolescents. Male C57Bl/6 mice were weaned to a randomly assigned diet: high fructose, high sucrose, high fat, or control (sugar-free, low-fat). Mice were maintained on their diets for at least 14 weeks. While fructose-fed mice regularly consumed more kcal and expended more energy, there was no difference in body weight compared to control by the end of the study. Additionally, after 14 weeks, both fructose-fed and control mice displayed similar leptin sensitivity. Fructose-feeding also did not change circulating glucose, triglycerides, or free fatty acids. Though fructose has been linked to obesity in several animal models, our data fail to support a role for fructose intake through food lasting 3 months in altering of body weight and leptin signaling in mice. The lack of impact of fructose in the food of growing mice on either body weight or leptin sensitivity over this time frame was surprising, and important information for researchers interested in fructose and body weight regulation.

792,792,24345826,"Although obesity is a major risk factor for nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), not all individuals with obesity develop the condition, suggesting that other factors such as diet may also contribute to NAFL development. We evaluated associations between fructose and total sugar intake and subsequent diagnosis of NAFL in adolescents with obesity and without obesity in a population-based cohort. Adolescents participating in the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study completed 3-day food records and body mass index measurement at age 14 years. At age 17 years, participants underwent abdominal ultrasound to determine NAFL status. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyse associations between energy-adjusted fructose and total sugar intake and NAFL status. Food diaries and liver assessments were completed for 592 adolescents. The prevalence of NAFL at age 17 was 12.8% for the total group and 50% for adolescents with obesity. Fructose intake did not significantly differ between adolescents with or without NAFL in our cohort as a whole. Among adolescents with obesity, those without NAFL had significantly lower energy-adjusted fructose intake at age 14 years compared with those with NAFL (mean ± standard deviation [SD] 38.8 ± 19.8 g/day, vs 55.7 ± 14.4 g/day, P = 0.02). Energy-adjusted fructose intake was independently associated with NAFL in adolescents with obesity (OR [odds ratio] 1.09, 95% CI 1.01-1.19, P = 0.03) after the adjustment for confounding factors. Energy-adjusted total sugar intake showed less significance (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.999-1.07, P = 0.06). No significant associations were observed in other body mass index categories. Lower fructose consumption in adolescents with obesity at 14 years is associated with a decreased risk of NAFL at 17 years.

793,793,25857309,"Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a life-sustaining therapy designed to deliver essential nutrients to patients unable to meet nutrition needs via the enteral route. PN may be delivered via a 2-in-1 system (one solution containing amino acids, dextrose, electrolytes, vitamins, minerals, and fluids and one solution containing intravenous fat emulsions [IVFEs]) or via a 3-in-1 system (all nutrients mixed in one container). Although the use of 3-in-1 PN solutions is not necessarily therapeutically advantageous, certain benefits may exist such as the potential to reduce the risk of contamination due to decreased manipulations; ease of administration, particularly in the home care setting; possible cost savings; and reduced IVFE wastage. However, the incorporation of IVFE in 3-in-1 solutions also presents unique risks for the neonatal and pediatric population such as decreased stability, increased lipid globule size, decreased sterility and the potential for increased microbial growth/infectious complications, the need to use a larger filter size, precipitation and compatibility risks, and an increased chance of catheter occlusion. This review outlines the unique issues and challenges to be considered when formulating neonatal and pediatric 3-in-1 PN admixtures. While 3-in-1 PN solutions may be advantageous for certain pediatric populations, specifically those dependent on home PN, the risks do not outweigh the benefits in neonatal patients, and use should be avoided in this population.

Children were classified as having MHO or metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO) using consensus-based criteria. Those with MHO had normal triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, and fasting glucose. Logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with MHO, which included calculating odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Further, primary human fibroblasts were cultured under normal or high glucose conditions to assess the effect of high glucose exposure on cells' DNA methylation. We found that higher added sugar intake across pregnancy was associated with reduced 3rd-trimester fetal movement (p < .05) and shorter gestation (p < .01). Our sample size was not powered to detect the alteration of individual placental CpG with genome-wide significance. However, a secondary analysis suggested that added sugar consumption was associated with differential methylation of functionally related gene families across pregnancy. Consistent with this, high glucose exposure in primary cultured human fibroblasts altered the methylation of 17% of all CpGs, providing converging evidence for an effect of sugar on DNA methylation.

Toddlers were randomized to either 25% sucrose or water before venipuncture, stratified by age (12 to 24 mo and more than 24 to 36 mo). Standard of care included topical anesthetics for both groups. Pain assessment included cry duration and FLACC (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability) scores. Descriptive statistics and linear models were used to report the percentage of time crying and mean differences in FLACC scores. Data analysis was performed using R, version 3.6.3. A total of 95 toddlers were randomized and 85 subsequently studied. The median percentage of time spent crying between insertion of the first needle and 30 seconds after the end of procedure in both groups was 81% (interquartile range=66%). There was no significant difference in crying time and FLACC scores between groups (P>0.05). When examining effects of sucrose for the younger toddlers (less than 24 mo of age) there was a reduction in crying time of 10% and a 1.2-point reduction in mean FLACC scores compared with the toddlers older than 24 months. Findings highlight that toddlers become highly distressed during venipuncture, despite the standard care of topical anesthetics. In addition, sucrose does not effectively reduce distress especially in the older group of toddlers.

803,803,24605697,"Zambia was a pioneer when it started fortifying sugar with vitamin A in 1998. Micronutrient deficiencies-especially among young children-have changed little over the past decade. In 2008 an initiative to introduce fortified flours was halted when last-hour questions about the program could not be answered. To provide information about the need, coverage, and impact of alternative fortification portfolio options to help Zambia overcome its fortification impasse. Using household data from the 2006 Living Conditions Monitoring Survey, apparent micronutrient intake levels and apparent consumption levels of sugar, vegetable oil, wheat flour and maize meal were estimated. The household level data were used to estimate individual intakes by assuming that food was distributed among household members in direct proportion to their share of the household's total adult consumption equivalent. Intake adequacy was measured relative to age- and gender-specific Estimated Average Requirements. Combining information on the industrial structure and estimated fortifiable quantities consumed of each food, and assuming the nutrient content is that specified in official regulations, simulations were conducted of the coverage and impact of 14 fortification portfolios. Maize, the most commonly consumed food, is consumed in a fortifiable form by only 23% of the population. Sugar fortification is estimated to have reduced inadequate intake of vitamin A from 87% to 79%. Introducing oil fortification could reduce the prevalence of inadequate vitamin A intake to 61%, and fortifying roller and breakfast maize meal would further reduce it to 57%, and reduce inadequate iron and zinc intakes by 2.2% and 5.5%, respectively. Implementing WHO flour guidelines would triple the potential iron and zinc impacts. Analysis of LCMS apparent consumption data have helped address important information gaps and provide better understanding of the coverage and impacts of alternative fortification portfolios.

Hence, this study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of goiter among children in Waghimra Zone, northeast Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted from April 8 to 25, 2015 in northeast Ethiopia. A multistage sampling method was used to select 454 schoolchildren. Data were collected using a pre-tested structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. Children were examined for the presence or absence of goiter based on the criteria of the United Nations Children's Fund, International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency, and the World Health Organization. Salt samples from children's homes were tested for iodine levels using a rapid iodized salt test kit. Data were entered into EpiInfo version 7 and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were fitted, and adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed to determine the level of significance. The prevalence of goiter was 62.1% (95% CI, 57.5 to 66.5%).

To determine whether the amount of IV dextrose administered is related to a return visit with admission (RVA) in children with AGE and dehydration, and to determine which clinical, laboratory, and treatment parameters are associated with an RVA. The investigators performed a case control study of children aged 6 months to 6 years who presented to an urban ED with AGE and dehydration and who received IV rehydration before discharge from the ED. Dehydration was defined a priori on the basis of parameters used in prior studies. Cases were defined as those patients who had an RVA within 72 hours of an original visit for ongoing symptoms. Controls were defined as those patients who met inclusion criteria who did not have an RVA. The authors studied whether the amount of IV dextrose administered at the initial visit was related to an RVA as well as which other clinical and treatment parameters were associated with an RVA. A total of 56 cases and 112 controls were studied. Patients who had an RVA received significantly less IV dextrose (mean: 399 mg/kg vs. 747 mg/kg, p < 0.001) than those who did not have an RVA. Patients who received no IV dextrose had 3.9 times greater odds of having a return visit with admission than those who received some dextrose. Controlling for fluid volume, the amount of dextrose administered remained statistically significant by logistic regression; for every 500 mg/kg of IV dextrose administered, the patient was 1.9 times less likely to have an RVA.

In nearly all countries, the best strategy to control iodine deficiency is iodisation of salt, which is one of the most cost-effective ways to contribute to economic and social development. When iodisation of salt is not possible, iodine supplements can be given to susceptible groups. Introduction of iodised salt to regions of chronic iodine-deficiency disorders might transiently increase the proportion of thyroid disorders, but overall the small risks of iodine excess are far outweighed by the substantial risks of iodine deficiency.

815,815,24291354,"Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is a multifunctional protein with Ca(2+)-dependent transamidating and G protein activity. Previously we reported that the role of TG2 in insulin secretion may involve cytoplasmic actin remodeling and a regulative action on other proteins during granule movement. The aim of this study was to gain a better insight into the role of TG2 transamidating activity in mitochondria and in the nucleus of INS-1E rat insulinoma cell line (INS-1E) during insulin secretion. To this end we labeled INS-1E with an artificial donor (biotinylated peptide), in basal condition and after stimulus with glucose for 2, 5, and 8min. Biotinylated proteins of the nuclear/mitochondrial-enriched fraction were analyzed using two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Many mitochondrial proteins involved in Ca(2+) homeostasis (e.g. voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein, prohibitin and different ATP synthase subunits) and many nuclear proteins involved in gene regulation (e.g. histone H3, barrier to autointegration factor and various heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein) were identified among a number of transamidating substrates of TG2 in INS-1E. The combined results provide evidence that a temporal link exists between glucose-stimulation, first phase insulin secretion and the action of TG on histone H3 both in INS-1E and human pancreatic islets. Research into the role of transglutaminase 2 during insulin secretion in INS-1E rat insulinoma cellular model is depicting a complex role for this enzyme. Transglutaminase 2 acts in the different INS-1E compartments in the same way: catalyzing a post-translational modification event of its substrates. In this work we identify some mitochondrial and nuclear substrates of INS-1E during first phase insulin secretion. The finding that TG2 interacts with nuclear proteins that include BAF and histone H3 immediately after (2-5min) glucose stimulus of INS-1E suggests that TG2 may be involved not only in insulin secretion, as suggested by our previous studies in cytoplasmic INS-1E fraction, but also in the regulation of glucose-induced gene transcription.

We paired 24-h urine samples of 65 children, UNa = 134 ± 36 mmol/day, (7.9 ± 2.3 g of salt) to 75 corresponding parents, UNa = 136 ± 45 mmol/day (8.0 ± 2.6 g of salt). Within parents, 50 were mothers, UNa = 138 ± 49 mmol/day (8.1 ± 2.9 g of salt) and 25 were fathers, UNa = 116 ± 41 mmol/day (6.8 ± 2.4 g of salt). Sodium excretion did not differ between boys vs. girls and mothers vs. fathers. Salt intake of children was not different from that of mothers (n = 50; 7.9 ± 2.3 vs. 8.1 ± 2. 8 g/24 h, p = 0.515) but higher than that of fathers (n = 25; 8.0 ± 2.3 vs. 6.8 ± 2.4 g/24 h, p < 0.05). Only 9.2% of children and 30.8% of the parents had a salt intake below 5 g/24 h. Around 60% of the children had a salt intake higher than their parents. Parental educational level was not associated with differences in salt consumption in children and parents. Overall, parents and children UNa excretion showed a moderate positive and significant correlation (r = 0.45, p = 0.001). In 91% of children aged 10-15 years, daily salt intake was higher than recommended. Also, children's salt consumption was closer to that of their mothers than that of their fathers, -possibly because of closeness in dietary habits with their mothers.

Insulin resistance is universal among children with end-stage renal disease and may be caused by uremic toxins accumulated because of reduced renal function. The normal response of the beta cell is to enhance insulin secretion to overcome the insulin resistance. In patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, this increase in insulin secretion is inhibited, resulting in glucose intolerance. Presence of glucose intolerance may be responsive for the growth retardation in uremic children. Improvements in glucose tolerance correlate with improvements in linear growth in uremic children.

824,824,29518765,"This analysis sets out an overview of an IUNS presentation of a European clinician's assessment of the challenges of coping with immediate critical clinical problems and how to use metabolic and a mechanistic understanding of disease when developing nutritional policies. Critically ill malnourished children prove very sensitive to both mineral and general nutritional overload, but after careful metabolic control they can cope with a high-quality, energy-rich diet provided their initial lactase deficiency and intestinal atrophy are taken into account. Detailed intestinal perfusion studies also showed that gastroenteritis can be combatted by multiple frequent glucose/saline feeds, which has saved millions of lives. However, persisting pancreatic islet cell damage may explain our findings of pandemic rates of adult diabetes in Asia, the Middle East and Mexico and perhaps elsewhere including Africa and Latin America. These handicaps together with the magnitude of epigenetic changes emphasized the importance of a whole life course approach to nutritional policy making. Whole body calorimetric analyses of energy requirements allowed a complete revision of estimates for world food needs and detailed clinical experience showed the value of redefining stunting and wasting in childhood and the value of BMI for classifying appropriate adult weights, underweight and obesity. Lithium tracer studies of dietary salt sources should also dictate priorities in population salt-reduction strategies. Metabolic and clinical studies combined with meticulous measures of population dietary intakes now suggest the need for far more radical steps to lower the dietary goals for both free sugars and total dietary fat unencumbered by flawed cohort studies that neglect not only dietary errors but also the intrinsic inter-individual differences in metabolic responses to most nutrients.

Consumption volume, sugar content, and pack size were obtained from household panel data linked with a packaged food composition database. Category-specific targets were set as 20% reductions in sales-weighted means adjusted for feasibility, i.e., ∼1/3 of products already meeting the target, and alignment with existing, relevant targets. Twenty-two food groups were identified as major contributors to NZ children's total sugar intake.

Eligible studies reported the intake of total sugars, intake of a component of total sugars, or intake of sugar containing foods or beverages; and at least one measure of body fatness. Minimum duration was two weeks for trials and one year for cohort studies. Trials of weight loss or confounded by additional medical or lifestyle interventions were excluded. Study selection, assessment, validity, data extraction, and analysis were undertaken as specified by the Cochrane Collaboration and the GRADE working group. For trials, we pooled data for weight change using inverse variance models with random effects. We pooled cohort study data where possible to estimate effect sizes, expressed as odds ratios for risk of obesity or β coefficients for change in adiposity per unit of intake. 30 of 7895 trials and 38 of 9445 cohort studies were eligible. In trials of adults with ad libitum diets (that is, with no strict control of food intake), reduced intake of dietary sugars was associated with a decrease in body weight (0.80 kg, 95% confidence interval 0.39 to 1.21; P<0.001); increased sugars intake was associated with a comparable weight increase (0.75 kg, 0.30 to 1.19; P=0.001). Isoenergetic exchange of dietary sugars with other carbohydrates showed no change in body weight (0.04 kg, -0.04 to 0.13). Trials in children, which involved recommendations to reduce intake of sugar sweetened foods and beverages, had low participant compliance to dietary advice; these trials showed no overall change in body weight. However, in relation to intakes of sugar sweetened beverages after one year follow-up in prospective studies, the odds ratio for being overweight or obese increased was 1.55 (1.32 to 1.82) among groups with the highest intake compared with those with the lowest intake. Despite significant heterogeneity in one meta-analysis and potential bias in some trials, sensitivity analyses showed that the trends were consistent and associations remained after these studies were excluded. Among free living people involving ad libitum diets, intake of free sugars or sugar sweetened beverages is a determinant of body weight. The change in body fatness that occurs with modifying intakes seems to be mediated via changes in energy intakes, since isoenergetic exchange of sugars with other carbohydrates was not associated with weight change.

Diet therapy may result in significant cost savings if effective in deterring the need for expensive medical management within this growing population. In only 6 randomized controlled trials in 250 women, data suggest that a diet higher in complex carbohydrate and fiber, low in simple sugar, and lower in saturated fat may be effective in blunting postprandial hyperglycemia, preventing worsened insulin resistance and excess fetal growth. The use of diet in gestational diabetes mellitus remains an area in grave need for high-quality randomized controlled trials.

832,832,22892867,"Salt iodization has been introduced in many countries to control iodine deficiency. The two most commonly used approaches to assessing iodine nutrition on the population level are estimation of the household penetration of adequately iodized salt (HHIS) and measurement of urinary iodine concentrations (UICs). The aim of this review is to assess global and regional iodine status in 2012 by using each of these indicators. The most recent national data on HHIS were obtained from UNICEF. The most recent data on UICs, primarily national data in school-age children, were obtained from a systematic literature search, the International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders and the WHO Micronutrients Database. The median UIC was used to classify national iodine status and the UIC distribution to estimate the number of individuals with low iodine intakes. Thirty-two countries are iodine deficient based on the national median UIC. Globally, 29.8% of school-age children (246 million) are estimated to have insufficient iodine intake. Out of 128 countries with HHIS data, 37 countries have salt iodization coverage that meets the international goal of at least 90% of households consuming adequately iodized salt and 39 countries have coverage rates of less than 50%. Overall, ≈70% of households worldwide have access to iodized salt. Iodized salt programs need to be strengthened and extended to reach nearly one-third of the global population that still has inadequate iodine intakes.

833,833,35677718,"The objective of this study is to investigate whether body mass index (BMI) changes are associated with fasting glucose and insulin resistance (IR) in early childhood. From the Environment and Development of Children (EDC) cohort, 334 children who visited at ages 2 and 4 were included in this study. Height and weight were measured at ages 2 and 4, and fasting glucose and insulin were assessed at age 4. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated as insulin (μIU/ml) × glucose (mg/dl)/405. The BMI Z-score [BMI (Z)] quartiles for each age group were defined as Q4, ≥75th percentile; Q2-3, 25th to 75th percentile; and Q1, <25th percentile. Glucose, insulin, and the HOMA-IR were compared between groups according to the change in BMI (Z) from age 2 to 4. Children who stayed in Q4 at both ages had higher fasting glucose (92.2 vs. 88.0 and 87.1 mg/dl), insulin (3.2 vs. 2.5 and 2.3 μIU/ml), and HOMA-IR (0.68 vs. 0.54 and 0.52) than children who stayed in Q1 or Q2-3 (all P<0.01). Children in Q4 at both ages had higher fasting glucose than children whose BMI (Z) increased from Q1 or Q2-3 to Q4 (92.2 vs. 87.3, P<0.001). The BMI (Z) category at age 2 of children who were in Q2-3 at age 4 did not affect glucose or IR at 4 years. The group of children within the highest BMI (Z) quartile at both 2 and 4 years of age had higher fasting glucose and IR at age 4 than any other BMI (Z) change group.

Here, we determine whether the Chinese government-recommended diet (GRD) or a modified diet of further restriction of sugar and ultra-processed food but without energy restriction, minimally processed diet (MPD) is effective on weight loss in children and adolescents with obesity/overweight. This open-label, randomized study included 60 children and adolescents between 5-18 years old with overweight/obesity. Participants were randomized 1:1 to the GRD or MPD and self-managed at home for 12 weeks. Both groups received general recommendations in physical activities. The changes were evaluated in body weight, fasting glucose and insulin, lipid metabolism and serum uric acid between baseline and week 12. The results indicated great reductions by time for BMI, BMI z-score, fat mass percentage and fat mass index in both groups. An obvious decrease by time for weight was found in the MPD group (p<0.001) as well as fasting glucose (p=0.005), fasting insulin (p=0.001), total cholesterol (p=0.007) and serum uric acid (p=0.006). As for the amount of visceral fat, greater reduction by time was observed in MPD group compared with GRD group. A 12-week self-intervention combining the Chinese government-recommended diet with physical activities was effective on weight loss in children and adolescents with overweight/obesity. The minimally processed diet was more effective on decreasing visceral fat mass and may be beneficial to improving insulin resistance.

Years of monitoring results in Shanghai show the iodine status has approached the upper limit of the appropriate range for children aged 8-10 years, indicating a risk of iodine excess. We used multi-stage random sampling to select children. Sixteen districts of Shanghai were divided into five units based on geographic location, and one primary school was randomly selected from each unit. In each selected school, about 40 children aged 8-10 years were randomly recruited to measure their urinary iodine concentration (UIC), household salt iodine concentration (SIC), the score of the final unified exam of the last semester, and school canteen salt iodine concentration. The median UIC of 3213 children aged 8-10 years in Shanghai was 195.4 (122.0, 285.8) µg/L and exceeded 200 µg/L in 48.8% of the population. Household and school canteen iodized salt coverage rates were 60.3% and 82.5% respectively, and mean household and school canteen SICs were 21.51 ± 9.30 mg/kg and 25.29 ± 3.40 mg/kg respectively.

Systematic review following standard Cochrane review methodology. Medline (Ovid), Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Clinicaltrials.gov, and reference lists of relevant publications. Studies including generally healthy adults or children with or without overweight or obesity were eligible. Included study designs allowed for a direct comparison of no intake or lower intake of NSS with higher NSS intake. NSSs had to be clearly named, the dose had to be within the acceptable daily intake, and the intervention duration had to be at least seven days. Body weight or body mass index, glycaemic control, oral health, eating behaviour, preference for sweet taste, cancer, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, mood, behaviour, neurocognition, and adverse effects. The search resulted in 13 941 unique records. Of 56 individual studies that provided data for this review, 35 were observational studies. In adults, evidence of very low and low certainty from a limited number of small studies indicated a small beneficial effect of NSSs on body mass index (mean difference -0.6, 95% confidence interval -1.19 to -0.01; two studies, n=174) and fasting blood glucose (-0.16 mmol/L, -0.26 to -0.06; two, n=52). Lower doses of NSSs were associated with lower weight gain (-0.09 kg, -0.13 to -0.05; one, n=17 934) compared with higher doses of NSSs (very low certainty of evidence). For all other outcomes, no differences were detected between the use and non-use of NSSs, or between different doses of NSSs. No evidence of any effect of NSSs was seen on overweight or obese adults or children actively trying to lose weight (very low to moderate certainty). In children, a smaller increase in body mass index z score was observed with NSS intake compared with sugar intake (-0.15, -0.17 to -0.12; two, n=528, moderate certainty of evidence), but no significant differences were observed in body weight (-0.60 kg, -1.33 to 0.14; two, n=467, low certainty of evidence), or between different doses of NSSs (very low to moderate certainty). Most health outcomes did not seem to have differences between the NSS exposed and unexposed groups. Of the few studies identified for each outcome, most had few participants, were of short duration, and their methodological and reporting quality was limited; therefore, confidence in the reported results is limited.

Six batches of 1% BNZ suspension were prepared using safe excipients currently available in a galenic area of Hospital Pharmacy and then stored at 5 and 25 °C for 90 days. The BNZ content was determined by UV spectrophotometry. Physical stability was defined as the absence of colour, odour and/or flavour changes and the re-suspension of solid phase by a reasonable amount of simple 15-s shaking. The compliance with microbiological attributes of non-sterile pharmaceutical products was also evaluated. An oral liquid suspension, containing 1% of BNZ, was developed from commercially available BNZ tablets. The formulations stored for 90 days were easily re-dispersed after a simple 15-s shaking, ensuring the pouring of a liquid volume containing the desired dose of BNZ. All samples were within the acceptable range of BNZ concentration with minimal standard deviations. There were no detectable changes in colour, odour, viscosity, pH and microbial growth, complying with official quality requirements. The quality attributes were not affected by storage, room or refrigeration conditions or by the frequent opening or closing of the multidose containers.

Repeated cross-sectional analyses of data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey in children aged 4-18 years. Sodium intake was estimated from a 4-day dietary record in years 2008-2009 to 2018-2019 and 24-h urine collection (2008-2009 to 2011-2012 only). Socioeconomic status was based on parental occupation and equivalized household income. We included 6281 children (age 11.0 ± 4.3 years, 51.3% boys). In 2008-2009 to 2011-2012, the mean sodium intake was 2342.4 ± 60.0 mg/day as measured by 24-h urinary sodium excretion, and was 2053.1 ± 18.2 mg/day by dietary records. From 2008-2009 to 2018-2019, the sodium intake as assessed by dietary records decreased by 15, 9 and 12% in children from routine and manual occupation families, intermediate occupation families and higher managerial, administrative and professional occupation families, respectively. On the basis of dietary records, the sodium intake of children from families in routine and manual occupations was 109.6 ± 23.1 mg/day ( P  < 0.001) higher than those from higher managerial, administrative and professional occupation families in 2008-2009 to 2011-2012.

Diabetes prevalence was 39.6% and 10.6% within the HCC and CLD cohorts, respectively. The odds ratio for having HCC in patients with diabetes was 5.55 (P < 0.001). Univariate analysis found an increased association of HCC with age, sex, cirrhosis, hemochromatosis, alcohol abuse, diabetes, and Child's Pugh score.

850,850,36373514,"Females with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) later in life. This study prospectively examined whether greater habitual coffee consumption was related to a lower risk of T2D among females with a history of GDM. We followed 4522 participants with a history of GDM in the NHS II for incident T2D between 1991 and 2017. Demographic, lifestyle factors including diet, and disease outcomes were updated every 2-4 y. Participants reported consumption of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee on validated FFQs. Fasting blood samples were collected in 2012-2014 from a subset of participants free of diabetes to measure glucose metabolism biomarkers (HbA1c, insulin, C-peptide; n = 518). We used multivariable Cox regression models to calculate adjusted HRs and 95% CIs for the risk of T2D. We estimated the least squares mean of glucose metabolic biomarkers according to coffee consumption. A total of 979 participants developed T2D. Caffeinated coffee consumption was inversely associated with the risk of T2D. Adjusted HR (95% CI) for ≤1 (nonzero), 2-3, and 4+ cups/d compared with 0 cup/d (reference) was 0.91 (0.78, 1.06), 0.83 (0.69, 1.01), and 0.46 (0.28, 0.76), respectively (P-trend = 0.004). Replacement of 1 serving/d of sugar-sweetened beverage and artificially sweetened beverage with 1 cup/d of caffeinated coffee was associated with a 17% (risk ratio [RR] = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.75, 0.93) and 9% (RR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.84, 0.99) lower risk of T2D, respectively. Greater caffeinated coffee consumption was associated with lower fasting insulin and C-peptide concentrations (all P-trend <0.05). Decaffeinated coffee intake was not significantly related to T2D but was inversely associated with C-peptide concentrations (P-trend = 0.003). Among predominantly Caucasian females with a history of GDM, greater consumption of caffeinated coffee was associated with a lower risk of T2D and a more favorable metabolic profile.

We aimed to survey all available CBFs in the UK market with F&V included in the food name in order to describe the amount and types of F&V used in CBF and their contribution to total sugar content. Food labels were used to identify F&V and total sugar content. Fruits were more common than vegetables in names of the 329 CBFs identified. The six most common F&V in the names were all relatively sweet: apple, banana, tomato, mango, carrot and sweet potato. The percentage of F&V in the foods ranged from a median of 94% for sweet-spoonable to 13% for dry-savoury products. Fruit content of sweet foods (n = 177) was higher than vegetable content of savoury foods (n = 152) with a median (IQR) of 64.0 g/100 g (33.0-100.0) vs. 46.0 g/100 g (33-56.7).

Objective of the present study was to assess in more detail the iodine status and knowledge, attitudes and practice (KAP) relating to use of iodised salt in a remote community in Kotidanga area, Kerema district, Gulf province, Papua New Guinea. This prospective school and community based cross-sectional study was carried out in 2017. Simple random sampling was used to select schools. Multistage sampling was used to randomly select 300 children aged 6 to 12 years, of which 289 consented to participate in the study. A single urine sample was collected from each of the consenting children, as well as a salt sample from their households. Discretionary salt intake was assessed in a sub-sample of the children's households. Salt iodine content and urinary iodine concentration (UIC) were analysed. A semi-structured modified Food and Agriculture Organisation questionnaire was used to assess KAP of three different community groups. Only 64% of households had salt on the day of data collection. Mean iodine content in household salt samples was 29.0 ± 19.1 ppm. Iodine content was below 30.0 ppm in 54.8% and below 15.0 ppm in 31.2% of salt samples. Mean per capita discretionary intake of household salt was 2.9 ± 1.8 g/day. Median UIC was 25.5 μg/L and Interquartile Range was 15.0 to 47.5 μg/L, indicating moderate status iodine nutrition. Median UIC was 34.3 μg/L for children in households with salt, compared to 15.5 μg/L for children in households without salt, indicating severe iodine deficiency in the latter group. The three community groups had limited knowledge about importance of using iodised salt and consequences of iodine deficiency on health outcomes. This remote community has limited access to adequately iodised household salt due to high cost, inappropriate packaging, storage and food preparation, resulting in iodine deficiency.

857,857,31172169,"Artificially sweetened beverages (ASBs) are commonly consumed and recommended for individuals at high risk for cardiometabolic diseases; however, the health effects of ASBs remain contradictory. Given that cross-sectional analyses are subject to reverse causation, prospective studies with long-term follow-up are needed to evaluate associations between ASBs and cardiometabolic health, especially among high-risk individuals. The aim of this study was to examine associations of ASB intake and cardiometabolic health among high-risk women with prior gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We included 607 women with GDM from the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC; 1996-2002) who completed a clinical exam 9-16 y after the DNBC pregnancy for the Diabetes & Women's Health (DWH) Study (2012-2014). We assessed ASB intake using FFQs completed during the DNBC pregnancy and at the DWH Study clinical exam. We examined cardiometabolic outcomes at the DWH clinical exam. We estimated percentage differences in continuous cardiometabolic markers and RRs for clinical endpoints in association with ASB intake both during pregnancy and at follow-up adjusted for prepregnancy BMI, diet, and lifestyle factors. Sensitivity analyses to account for reverse causation were performed. In pregnancy and at follow-up, 30.4% and 36.4% of women regularly (≥2 servings/wk) consumed ASB, respectively. Consumption of ASBs, both during pregnancy and at follow-up, was associated with higher glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin, HOMA-IR, triglycerides, liver fat, and adiposity and with lower HDL at follow-up. After adjustment for covariates, particularly prepregnancy BMI, the majority of associations between ASB intake in pregnancy and outcomes at follow-up became null with the exception of HbA1c. ASB intake at follow-up (≥1 serving/d compared with <1 serving/mo) was associated with higher HbA1c (6.5%; 95% CI: 1.9, 11.3; P-trend = 0.007); however, associations were not upheld in sensitivity analyses for reverse causation.

Inadequate or inappropriate dietary intake in the neonatal period may have long term adverse consequences on neurodevelopmental function. The late effect of neonatal sodium deficiency or repletion in the premature human infant on neurological development and function has not been examined, despite evidence in animals of a serious adverse effect of salt deprivation on growth of the central nervous system. Thirty seven of 46 children who had been born prematurely (gestational age of 33 weeks or less) and allocated to diets containing 1-1.5 mmol sodium/day (unsupplemented) or 4-5 mmol sodium/day (supplemented) from the 4th to the 14th postnatal day were recalled at the age of 10-13 years. Detailed studies of neurodevelopmental performance were made, including motor function and assessment of intelligence (IQ), memory and learning, language and executive skills, and behaviour. Sixteen of the children were found to have been in the supplemented group and 21 in the unsupplemented group. Children who had been in the supplemented group performed better in all modalities tested than those from the unsupplemented group. The differences were statistically significant (analysis of variance) for motor function, performance IQ, the general memory index, and behaviour as assessed by the children's parents. The supplemented children outperformed the unsupplemented controls by 10% in all three components of the memory and learning tests (difference not significant but p < 0.1 for each) and in language function (p < 0.05 for object naming) and educational attainment (p < 0.05 for arithmetic age). Infants born at or before 33 weeks gestation require a higher sodium intake in the first two weeks of postnatal life than those born at or near term, and failure to provide such an intake (4-5 mmol/day) may predispose to poor neurodevelopmental outcome in the second decade of life.

865,865,23472655,"Dietary iodine intake is required for the production of thyroid hormone. Consequences of iodine deficiency include goiter, intellectual impairments, growth retardation, neonatal hypothyroidism, and increased pregnancy loss and infant mortality. In 1990, the United Nations World Summit for Children established the goal of eliminating iodine deficiency worldwide. Considerable progress has since been achieved, largely through programs of universal salt iodization. Approximately 70% of all households worldwide currently have access to adequately iodized salt. In 2013, as defined by a national or subnational median urinary iodine concentration of 100-299 μg/L in school-aged children, 111 countries have sufficient iodine intake. Thirty countries remain iodine-deficient; 9 are moderately deficient, 21 are mildly deficient, and none are currently considered severely iodine-deficient. Ten countries have excessive iodine intake. In North America, both the United States and Canada are generally iodine-sufficient, although recent data suggest pregnant U.S. women are mildly iodine-deficient. Emerging issues include discrepancies between urinary iodine status in pregnant women compared to school-aged children in some populations, the problem of re-emerging iodine deficiency in parts of the developed world, the importance of food industry use of iodized salt, regions of iodine excess, and the potential effects of initiatives to lower population sodium consumption on iodine intake. Although substantial progress has been made over the last several decades, iodine deficiency remains a significant health problem worldwide and affects both industrialized and developing nations. The ongoing monitoring of population iodine status remains crucially important, and particular attention may need to be paid to monitoring the status of vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women and infants. There is also need for ongoing monitoring of iodized salt and other dietary iodine sources in order to prevent excess as well as insufficient iodine nutrition. Finally, it will be essential to coordinate interventions designed to reduce population sodium intake with salt iodization programs in order to maintain adequate levels of iodine nutrition as salt intake declines.

867,867,8500127,"This paper examines the impact on the development of caries, especially on the proximal and the free smooth surfaces, that follows the reduction in sucrose consumption and the increase in consumption of the monosaccharides in the United States and Great Britain. Laboratory evidence shows that sucrose has a special role in proximal- and smooth-surface caries because of its ability to produce extracellular polysaccharides with the mutans streptococci, thus increasing plaque's ability to adhere to the enamel surface. Evidence from human studies, however, is less clear about the relative cariogenicity of the various sugars, possibly because experimental conditions are difficult to maintain in such studies. In the USA sucrose consumption has been diminishing for some year and is now only 47% of the total sugar consumption of 61 kg per person annually. The change in Britain has been less pronounced, sucrose there in 1984 constituted 83% of total consumption of 47.9 kg per person. Sucrose consumption in Britain is, therefore, higher than in the United States, even though the average total consumption of all sugars is higher in the USA. Limited data suggest that proximal- and smooth-surface lesions also constitute a higher proportion of caries incidence in Britain than in USA, and a cause-and-effect hypothesis between these factors is explored. Dietary education for oral health should harmonize with that for general health by emphasizing sensible food choices, which generally means selection of low-fat, low-sugar foods.

868,868,35373285,"Infectious meningitis (IM) in US children is increasingly rare and new rapid multiplex PCR-based testing is increasingly available. We evaluated the added value of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein and glucose tests to predict IM when compared with information provided by CSF white blood cell count (WBC) and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We retrospectively reviewed CSF results from October 2015 to August 2017 in patients 0 to 18 years at a US children's hospital. Noninfectious evaluations were excluded. Test characteristics were calculated for CSF WBC, protein, and glucose in isolation and in parallel for prediction of microbiologically confirmed IM. Chart review was performed to identify consideration of protein and glucose in medical decision-making (MDM). We identified 735 patients including 446 <2 months; 45 (6.1%) had microbiologically-confirmed IM, including 23 (5.2%) age <2 months. Multiplex PCR and/or CSF WBC identified all IM patients. When added to CSF WBC, measurement of glucose made no contribution to sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) or negative predictive value (NPV), and protein had no impact on sensitivity and decreased the specificity, PPV, and NPV compared with CSF WBC alone. Abnormal protein was documented in MDM in 6 (0.8%) patients, all of whom had elevated WBC counts also cited. Glucose was not mentioned in MDM. Multiplex PCR testing and WBC may be sufficient to predict meningitis in children in low incidence settings. Protein and glucose did not contribute significant additional information. More intentional use of protein and glucose testing in patients with suspected IM may achieve higher value care.

One of these features is low serum ferritin. In this retrospective, pilot study, we assess the response to iron supplementation. Children were given oral ferrous sulfate (FS) or intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (IV FCM). Children 5-18 years old with a diagnosis of RSD were evaluated clinically. Serum ferritin, iron profile, and video-polysomnography were obtained at baseline. Oral or IV iron supplementation was offered as part of routine care. Oral FS was one 325 mg tablet daily or 3 mg/kg/day liquid for 3 months. IV FCM was 15 mg/kg, up to 750 mg as a single infusion. Adverse effects were assessed. Ferritin and iron profile were checked after 2-3 months. Eight weeks after FCM, the phosphorus level was checked. Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale was obtained pre- and posttreatment. A total of 15 children received oral FS and 15 IV FCM. Baseline RSD severity, age, gender, or pretreatment lab values did not differ significantly between groups.

Urine iodine and thyroid size by ultrasound in school-age children are important indicators for assessing IDD in a population. Interpretation of sonographically measured thyroid volume requires valid reference criteria from iodine-sufficient populations, and in 2003 WHO (World Health Organization)/ICCIDD (International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders) proposed new international reference values for thyroid volume in children aged 6-12 years. To establish a normative reference of thyroid volume and characterize the current status of iodine nutrition in Japanese schoolchildren in Tokyo, where iodine deficiency has never existed, a total of 654 subjects aged 6-12 years (317 girls and 337 boys) in three primary schools were enrolled in the study in 2002. Thyroid volume was determined by using the standardized method recommended by WHO/ICCIDD and the iodine concentration in spot urine samples and the anthropometric measurements were evaluated. Thyroid volume was positively correlated with the children's age, height, weight, or BSA. Regardless of gender the computed median and 97th percentile thyroid volumes based on age or BSA in Japanese children were generally lower than the corresponding values recently reported in iodine-sufficient areas, although these values were slightly higher (5-13%) than those in the 2003 WHO/ICCIDD international reference. The computed median value of urinary iodine concentration was 281.6 microg/L (303.7 microg/gCre) and extremely high values exceeding 1,000 microg/L were found in 16% of the subjects.

Data from epidemiology and intervention studies however have long been contradictory, despite mechanistic evidence pointing towards poor compensation for addition of ""liquid"" energy from these two sources into the diet providing a strong rational for the balance to be tipped towards weight gain. Regulatory and government intervention has been increasing globally, particularly with respect to intake of SSBs in children.

Counts of Streptococcus mutans entered into the analysis but only as a relatively minor component. Similar significant relationships were seen with the determination of odds ratios. A caries activity test was formulated combining the following caries-associated variables: high counts of S. mutans, or lactobacilli, or the misuse of sugar, or frequent consumption of paediatric medicines. Regular use of fluoride tablets could compensate for paediatric medicine use or misuse of sugar.

We analyzed the effects of HFCS intake on hippocampal function in three age categories: childhood and adolescence (postnatal day (PD) 21-60), young adulthood (PD60-100), and late adulthood (PD100-140). For the experiments, male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three age categories, the control group was received distilled water and the HFCS group was received 20% HFCS solution for 40 days in each period. We analyzed mRNA and protein levels for qPCR and western blotting, respectively, of a hippocampal NF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf). HFCS consumption reduced hippocampal Bdnf mRNA and protein expressions in childhood and adolescence. Moreover, pyrosequencing assays revealed increased DNA methylation at the Bdnf promoter in childhood and adolescence. This Bdnf levels reduction may be due to hypermethylation of the promoter regions. It should be noted that this phenomenon was observed only in childhood and adolescence fructose consumption.

The date of the last search of all databases (except for Scopus) was May 2019. We last searched Scopus in January 2019. We did not apply any language restrictions. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of four weeks or more comparing any type of NNS with usual diet, no intervention, placebo, water, a different NNS, or a nutritive sweetener in individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Trials with concomitant behaviour-changing interventions, such as diet, exercise, or both, were eligible for inclusion, given that the concomitant interventions were the same in the intervention and comparator groups. Two review authors independently screened abstracts, full texts, and records retrieved from trials registries, assessed the certainty of the evidence, and extracted data. We used a random-effects model to perform meta-analysis, and calculated effect estimates as risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. We included nine RCTs that randomised a total of 979 people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The intervention duration ranged from 4 to 10 months. We judged none of these trials as at low risk of bias for all 'Risk of bias' domains; most of the included trials did not report the method of randomisation. Three trials compared the effects of a dietary supplement containing NNS with sugar: glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 0.4% higher in the NNS group (95% CI -0.5 to 1.2; P = 0.44; 3 trials; 72 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The MD in weight change was -0.1 kg (95% CI -2.7 to 2.6; P = 0.96; 3 trials; 72 participants; very low-certainty evidence). None of the trials with sugar as comparator reported on adverse events. Five trials compared NNS with placebo. The MD for HbA1c was 0%, 95% CI -0.1 to 0.1; P = 0.99; 4 trials; 360 participants; very low-certainty evidence. The 95% prediction interval ranged between -0.3% and 0.3%. The comparison of NNS versus placebo showed a MD in body weight of -0.2 kg, 95% CI -1 to 0.6; P = 0.64; 2 trials; 184 participants; very low-certainty evidence. Three trials reported the numbers of participants experiencing at least one non-serious adverse event: 36/113 participants (31.9%) in the NNS group versus 42/118 participants (35.6%) in the placebo group (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.56; P = 0.48; 3 trials; 231 participants; very low-certainty evidence).

No effect was observed for substitution of SSB by 100% fruit juice. Our results suggest that SSB intake is associated with long-term changes in body fatness in children, and replacing SSBs with water or milk, but not 100% fruit juice, is inversely associated with body fatness development.

In 2019, U.S. parents of children aged 2-12 years (N=1,078) recruited from an online survey panel were randomized to one of three arms: natural claim on a fruit drink, 100% all-natural claim, or a no-claim control. Parents reported their intentions and perceptions regarding fruit drinks using 1-5 response scales. Analysis occurred in 2022-2023. Both natural claims led parents to have higher intentions to purchase a fruit drink for their child than the control (average differential effect=0.20-0.24, both p<0.05). The natural claim (but not the 100% all-natural claim) also led parents to think that the fruit drink was healthier for their children (average differential effect=0.22, p=0.024). Claims made parents less likely to think that the drink contained added sugar (average differential effect= -0.08 to -0.12, both p<0.05) and led to lower estimated amounts of added sugar in teaspoons (average differential effect= -1.77 to -2.09, both p<0.05). Mediation analyses revealed that the claims led to higher intentions to purchase the fruit drink by increasing perceived healthfulness of the fruit drink and by leading parents to believe that there was no added sugar in the fruit drink. Natural claims could increase interest in and perceived healthfulness of fruit drinks. Misperceptions about the nutritional content caused by claims appear to be driving greater purchase intentions. These findings suggest a need for stronger regulation around natural claims to prevent consumer misunderstanding.

886,886,37650380,"Children with intractable chronic pancreatitis may require total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation (TPIAT) for pain relief. The IAT reduces the severity of post- pancreatectomy diabetes. We analyzed 635 mixed meal tolerance tests (MMTT) in 134 children undergoing TPIAT to determine whether superior survival of islet grafts explains higher rates of insulin independence previously reported in young children (n = 52, age 3-11 years) versus adolescents (n = 82, age 12-18 years). For MMTT, children consumed Boost HP and we sampled C-peptide and glucose repeatedly over 2 h. The trajectory of outcomes before and after TPIAT was compared between children and adolescents using data from pre-TPIAT and 3, 6 months, 1, 2, 3, and 4 years post-TPIAT and mixed linear models with a random effect for child. Cox regression was used to analyze time outcomes (e.g., time to first off insulin). Islet mass transplanted, measured as islet equivalents (IEQ), was higher in adolescents (p = .003) but IEQ/kg was higher in young children (p < .001) because of their lower weight. AUC C-peptide in young children increased somewhat over 4 years, but was stable in adolescents (p = .0013). AUC glucose increased more in adolescents over time post-TPIAT (p = .0024). Islet function by AUC C-peptide:AUC glucose ratio was better preserved in young children (p < .001). Adolescents were less likely to wean off insulin (hazard ratio .44 [95% CI .28, .69]). These data support an advantage of young age in islet graft survival after TPIAT. The greater likelihood of insulin independence in young children may be driven by better islet survival after transplant.

887,887,30105567,"To assess prevalence of goiter and associated factors among school going children in Udupi district. A school based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 6-12 year old children. A sample of 30 villages was selected from the entire district by probability proportionate to size. One school was then randomly selected from each of the 30 villages. Goiter was assessed clinically and was graded as per the recommended criteria of World Health Organization (WHO)/ United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)/ International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD). Salt and urine samples were collected from a subsample for iodine estimation. A total of 2703 children were examined. The mean (±SD) age of the participants was 9.6 y (±1.9). The overall prevalence of goiter in Udupi district was found to be 9.3% with 7.0% and 2.3% having grade 1 and grade 2 goiter respectively. Prevalence of goiter was significantly higher among females [153(11.1%)] as compared to males [98(7.4%)] (p = 0.001). Of the 543 salt samples analyzed, 379 (69.8%) salt samples had adequate salt iodine content (> 15 ppm); while among the children with goiter 32 (8.4%) had inadequate salt iodine. Median iodine value was 202.12 mcg/l among the 270 urine samples tested for iodine levels. Goiter prevalence at 9.3% in the coastal district contributes to the endemicity of the public health problem. The district had adequate iodine nutrition based on median urinary iodine levels.

891,891,35406113,"Pediatric obesity is a significant public health problem, the negative outcomes of which will challenge individual well-being and societal resources for decades to come. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of dietary counseling on weight management and metabolic abnormalities in children with obesity. One hundred and sixty-five patients aged 2−18 years old were studied over a two and a half year period. Data collected included demographic information, anthropometric assessment, laboratory measurements, and self-reported eating behaviors. Dietary counseling was provided at each visit. The data was analyzed from the first and last visits and the subjects were retrospectively divided into responders and non-responders based on a decrease in their BMI. After receiving dietary guidance, BMI decreased in 44% of the children, and these participants were classified as responders (BMI-R; n = 72). However, BMI did not improve in 56% of the participants, and these were classified as non-responders (BMI-NR; n = 93). At the initial visit, anthropometric measurements and dietary habits were similar between the groups. At the time of the last visit, mean change in BMI was −1.47 (SD 1.31) for BMI-R and +2.40 (SD 9.79) for BMI-NR. Analysis of food intake revealed that BMI-R significantly improved their dietary habits (p = 0.002) by reducing the intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (p = 0.019), processed foods (p = 0.002), sweets (p < 0.001), and unhealthy snacks (p = 0.009), as compared with BMI-NR. There was no change in the intake of second helpings, portion sizes, skipping meals, frequency of meals eaten at school, condiment use, intake of fruits and vegetables and consumption of whole grains between the groups. BMI-R also achieved an improvement in fasted glucose (p = 0.021), triglycerides (p < 0.001), and total cholesterol (p = 0.023), as compared to BMI-NR. In conclusion, children with obesity who were able to decrease their BMI implemented a significant reduction in consumption of foods with high sugar content. Focusing on reducing sugar intake may yield the biggest impact in terms of weight management and the improvement of metabolic abnormalities.

892,892,34585250,"Is intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) or artificially sweetened beverages (ASB) associated with testicular function in young men? Among young men unaware of their semen quality and reproductive hormone levels, intake of SSBs was associated with lower sperm concentration, lower total sperm count, and a lower ratio of serum inhibin-B/FSH. SSBs may adversely impact testicular function, but results are not consistent across studies. Moreover, the associations of ASB, energy-drinks or fruit juices with testicular function are unclear. Young healthy men and unselected for fertility status men enrolled in a cross-sectional study between 2008 and 2017. A total of 2935 young (median age: 19 years) men enrolled in the study. Intake of SSBs, ASBs, fruit juices, and energy-drinks was assessed with a validated food frequency questionnaire. Testicular function was assessed through conventional semen quality parameters (semen volume, sperm concentration, total count, motility and morphology), testicular volume assessed with ultrasound, and serum reproductive hormone concentrations (total testosterone, free testosterone, E2, inhibin-B, LH, FSH, sex hormone-binding globulin) were measured. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, men in the highest category of SSB intake (median: 1.1 servings (∼220 ml)/day) had a 13.2 million/ml lower median sperm concentration (95% CI: -21.0, -5.5) than non-consumers. A similar pattern was observed with total sperm count (-28 million (95% CI: -48, -9)), serum inhibin-B (-12 pg/ml (95% CI: -21, -4)), and inhibin-B/FSH ratio (-9 (95% CI: -18, 0)). The adjusted median difference in sperm concentration and inhibin-B associated with increasing SSB intake by 1 serving (∼200ml)/day at the expense of water was -3.4 million sperm/ml (95% CI: -5.8, -1.0) and -7 pg/ml (95% CI: -11, -3), respectively. Inferring causality is limited owing to the cross-sectional design. We adjusted for a number of potential confounders but cannot exclude that unmeasured lifestyle and behavior associated with soft drink intake is associated with testicular function in these young men. In the largest study to date, intake of SSBs was associated with lower sperm concentration, total sperm count, and serum inhibin-B/FSH ratio, consistent with a direct suppressive effect of SSB intake on testicular function among otherwise healthy men, potentially affecting fertility. However, the observed association between higher SSB intake and lower semen quality does not necessarily imply a decrease in fertility.

Initiatives and policies to increase consumption have the potential to ensure students benefit from the healthy school foods available. This systematic review evaluates studies examining initiatives, interventions, and policies to increase school meal consumption. Following PRISMA guidelines, this review was conducted using four databases and resulted in a total of 96 studies. The research evidence supports the following strategies to increase school meal consumption: (1) offering students more menu choices; (2) adapting recipes to improve the palatability and/or cultural appropriateness of foods; (3) providing pre-sliced fruits; (4) rewarding students who try fruits and vegetables; (5) enabling students to have sufficient time to eat with longer (~30 min) lunch periods; (6) having recess before lunch; and (7) limiting students' access to competitive foods during the school day. Research findings were mixed when examining the impact of nutrition education and/or offering taste tests to students, although multiple benefits for nutrition education outside the cafeteria were documented. There is some evidence that choice architecture (i.e., ""Smarter Lunchroom"") techniques increase the proportion of students who select targeted meal components; however, there is not evidence that these techniques alone increase consumption. There were limited studies of the impact of increasing portion sizes; serving vegetables before other meal components; and strengthening local district and/or school wellness policies, suggesting that further research is necessary. Additionally, longer-term studies are needed to understand the impact of policies that limit students' access to flavored milk. Several studies found increases in students' meal consumption following the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) and concerns regarding an increase in food waste following the HHFKA were not supported.

These results are noteworthy as they revealed that firstly, the baseline IFG predicts future development of GD, and secondly, that almost half of patients with IFG at the outset had normal glucose handling 15 years later.

The special communication advances the ENDS harm reduction conversation because it calls for national tobacco regulators to develop an epidemiological prediction of ENDS impact on the population and to expand the scope of their analysis to evaluate the impacts of ENDS on congenital birth defects, abuse liability and non-flavour drivers of youth usage. Through learning from the American experience regulating Vuse, national tobacco regulators around the globe will be better equipped to evaluate the impact of ENDS on the public health.

901,901,16144813,"Protein synthesis and eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) activation are increased in muscle and liver of pigs parenterally infused with amino acids and insulin. To examine the effects of enteral protein and carbohydrate on protein synthesis, pigs (n = 42, 1.7 kg body wt) were fed isocaloric milk diets containing three levels of protein (5, 15, and 25 g x kg body wt(-1) x day(-1)) and two levels of lactose (low = 11 and high = 23 g x kg body wt(-1) x day(-1)) from 1 to 6 days of age. On day 7, pigs were gavage fed after 4-h food deprivation, and tissue protein synthesis rates and biomarkers of mRNA translation were assessed. Piglet growth and protein synthesis rates in muscle and liver increased with dietary protein and plateaued at 15 g x kg body wt(-1) x day(-1) (P < 0.001). Growth tended to be greater in high-lactose-fed pigs (P = 0.07). Plasma insulin was lowest in pigs fed 5 g x kg body wt(-1) x day(-1) protein (P < 0.0001). Plasma branched-chain amino acids increased as protein intake increased (P < 0.0001).

The results indicate that growth and protein synthesis rates in neonatal pigs are influenced by dietary protein and lactose intake and might be mediated by plasma amino acids and insulin levels. However, feeding protein well above the piglet's requirement does not further stimulate the activation of translation initiation or protein synthesis in skeletal muscle and liver.

905,905,20962157,"Recently, a genetic variant (rs738409; C→G) of the PNPLA3 gene was identified to be associated with increased hepatic fat deposition, and the effect was more pronounced in Hispanics. Animal models have also shown that PNPLA3 expression can be regulated by dietary carbohydrate. The aim of this study was to examine whether the influence of PNPLA3 genotype on hepatic fat is modulated by dietary factors in Hispanic children. PNPLA3 was genotyped in 153 Hispanic children (75% female, ages 8-18 y) by using the TaqMan method. Dietary intake was assessed by using three 24-h dietary recalls or diet records. Visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SAAT), and hepatic fat fraction (HFF) were assessed in multiple abdominal slices by magnetic resonance imaging. Analysis of covariance was used to assess the diet × genotype interaction in liver fat, with the following a priori covariates: sex, age, energy, VAT, and SAAT. HFF was influenced by a significant interaction between genotype and diet (genotype × carbohydrate, P = 0.04; genotype × total sugar, P = 0.01). HFF was positively related to carbohydrate (r = 0.31, P = 0.04) and total sugar (r = 0.34, P = 0.02) intakes but only in the GG group, independent of covariates. Dietary variables were not related to HFF in the CC or CG group or to other fat depots in all genotype groups. These findings suggest that Hispanic children carrying the GG genotype are susceptible to increased hepatic fat when dietary carbohydrate intake, specifically sugar, is high. Specific dietary interventions based on genetic predisposition in this population may lead to more effective therapeutic outcomes for fatty liver.

Two hundred and six children were reported to have 223 diarrheal episodes. The incidence of diarrhea in children under five was 3.4 episodes per child per year. When children had diarrhea 65.5 per cent of mothers sought help from health providers, 25.2 per cent treated their children with drugs bought from stores, 2.3 per cent used herbal medicine and 6.1 per cent did not treat their children. 50.7 per cent of diarrheal episodes mother gave ORT, using ORS 19.7, commercial electrolytes mixture 16.6 and home available fluid 14.4 per cent. The accuracy of dilution of electrolytes powder from the packets was checked in 80 incidences. 31.8 and 27.8 per cent of mothers made correct dilution of ORS and commercial electrolytes products respectively. Health providers carried both ORS and commercial electrolytes packets. ORS added to a glass of water was found in 13.6 per cent which was 3 times concentrated. Commercial electrolytes products were too dilute in 72.2 per cent. 17.5 per cent of mothers divided electrolytes powder to add in one spoon of water to treat their children as one drug dose. Data showed that the ORT use rate was 50.7 per cent. Home available fluid was used by 14.4 per cent. ORT should be further promoted to control diarrheal diseases and health providers should give instructions to every mother or child minder on how to dispense ORS or electrolytes packets for appropriate dilution and use.

Researchers estimated the number of episodes of diarrhea/year/child to be 3.4 46.1% of the cases experienced mild diarrhea and no child had severe diarrhea. 70.9% of children 2 years old experienced diarrhea during the study period. These children had the highest proportion of diarrheal incidence. 25.2% of the mothers treated the diarrhea with drugs, while 67.8% went to health providers for treatment. 47.5% of the mothers did not treat their children's diarrhea with ORT. 19.7% of those that did treat their children with ORT used WHO's ORS packets, 16.6% used commercial electrolyte mixtures, and 14.4% used home available fluid. Researchers checked the accuracy dilution of ORS and commercial electrolyte packets in 80 cases of diarrhea. Only 31.8% of ORS was correctly prepared. Further, 13.6% of ORS preparations were 3 times too concentrated--a potentially harmful concentration. Only 27.8% of the commercial packets was correctly diluted. The rest were too diluted. Researchers theorized that these mothers either did not read the instructions on the packets and/or did not receive any instructions from the health providers on how to correctly prepare ORT.

However, whether maternal depression before pregnancy influences behaviour and related neurobiological mechanisms in the offspring has not been studied. A social defeat stress (SDS) maternal rat model was established using the resident-intruder paradigm with female specific pathogen-free Wistar rats and evaluated with behavioural tests. SDS maternal rats showed a significant reduction in sucrose preference and locomotor and exploratory activities after 4 weeks of stress. In the third week of the experiment, a reduction in body weight gain was observed in SDS animals. Sucrose preference, open field, the elevated-plus maze, light-dark box, object recognition, the Morris water maze, and forced swimming tests were performed using the 2-month-old male offspring of the female SDS rats. Offspring subjected to pre-gestational SDS displayed enhanced anxiety-like behaviours, reduced exploratory behaviours, reduced sucrose preference, and atypical despair behaviours. With regard to cognition, the offspring showed significant impairments in the retention phase of the object recognition test, but no effect was observed in the acquisition phase. These animals also showed impairments in recognition memory, as the discrimination index in the Morris water maze test in this group was significantly lower for both 1 h and 24 h memory retention compared to controls. Corticosterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and monoamine neurotransmitters levels were determined using enzyme immunoassays or radioimmunoassays in plasma, hypothalamus, left hippocampus, and left prefrontal cortex samples from the offspring of the SDS rats.

We undertook a systematic review of the impact of iodine supplementation in populations with mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency. We searched Medline and the Cochrane library for relevant articles published between January 1966 and April 2013, which investigated the effect of iodine supplementation on maternal and newborn thyroid function, infant neurodevelopment and cognitive performance in school-age children. The quality of studies was graded and eligible trials were evaluated in the meta-analysis. Nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and eight observational studies met the inclusion criteria. Controlled trials on infant neurodevelopment were lacking; gestational iodine supplementation reduced maternal thyroid volume and serum thyroglobulin and in some studies prevented a rise in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone. None of the intervention trials recorded an excess frequency of thyroid dysfunction in contrast to observational studies. A pooled analysis of two RCTs which measured cognitive function in school-age children showed modest benefits of iodine supplementation on perceptual reasoning (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.55; 95% CI 0.05, 1.04; P=0.03) and global cognitive index (SMD 0.27; 95% CI 0.10, 0.44; P=0.002) with significant heterogeneity between studies. Iodine supplementation improves some maternal thyroid indices and may benefit aspects of cognitive function in school-age children, even in marginally iodine-deficient areas.

A significant source of many essential nutrients, its inclusion as a component of a healthy balanced diet has been long recommended. Beyond milk's nutritional value, an increasing body of evidence illustrates cow's milk may confer numerous benefits related to health. Evidence from adult populations suggests that cow's milk may have a role in overall dietary quality, appetite control, hydration and cognitive function. Although evidence is limited compared with the adult literature, these benefits may be echoed in recent paediatric studies. This article, therefore, reviews the scientific literature to provide an evidence-based evaluation of the associated health benefits of cow's milk consumption in primary-school-aged children (4-11 years). We focus on seven key areas related to nutrition and health comprising nutritional status, hydration, dental and bone health, physical stature, cognitive function, and appetite control. The evidence consistently demonstrates cow's milk (plain and flavoured) improves nutritional status in primary-school-aged children. With some confidence, cow's milk also appears beneficial for hydration, dental and bone health and beneficial to neutral concerning physical stature and appetite. Due to conflicting studies, reaching a conclusion has proven difficult concerning cow's milk and cognitive function; therefore, a level of caution should be exercised when interpreting these results. All areas, however, would benefit from further robust investigation, especially in free-living school settings, to verify conclusions. Nonetheless, when the nutritional-, physical- and health-related impact of cow's milk avoidance is considered, the evidence highlights the importance of increasing cow's milk consumption.

918,918,24938882,"Gluten-free diet (GFD) is the cornerstone treatment for celiac disease (CD). This diet excludes the protein gluten a protein forum in in grains such as wheat, barley, rye and triticale. Gluten causes small intestines inflammation in patients with CD and eating a GFD helps these patients in controlling signs and symptoms and prevent complications. Following a GFD may be frustrating, however, it is important to know that plenty of foods are naturally gluten-free and nowadays is relatively easy to find substitutes for gluten-containing foods. Certain grains, such as oats, are generally safe but can be contaminated with wheat during growing and processing stages of production. For this reason, it is generally recommended avoiding oats unless they are specifically labelled gluten-free. Other products that may contain gluten include food additives, such as malt flavouring, modified food starch and some supplement and/or vitamins that use gluten as a binding agent. Cross-contamination occurs when gluten-free foods come into contact with foods that contain gluten. It can happen during the manufacturing process or if the same equipment is used to make a variety of products. Cross-contamination can also occur at home if foods are prepared on common surfaces or with utensils that have not been cleaned after being used to prepare gluten-containing foods (using a toaster for gluten-free and regular bread). Although safe and effective, the GFD is not ideal: it is expensive, of limited nutritional value, and not readily available in many countries. Consequently, a need exists for novel, non-dietary therapies for celiac disease. Advances in understanding the immunopathogenesis of CD have suggested several types of therapeutic strategies alternative to the GFD. Some of these strategies attempt to decrease the immunogenicity of gluten-containing grains by manipulating the grain itself or by using oral enzymes to break down immunogenic peptides that normally remain intact during digestion. Other strategies focus on preventing the absorption of these peptides, preventing tissue transglutaminase from rendering gluten peptides more immunogenic, or inhibiting their binding to CD-specific antigen-presenting molecules. Strategies that limit T cell migration to the small intestine or that re-establish mucosal homeostasis and tolerance to gluten antigens are also being explored.

In contrast, we observed less postprandial variability following meals with more fat (SD and CV) and protein (SD only) after adjusting for carbohydrates. Insulin modality, exercise after meals, and exercise intensity did not influence associations between macronutrients and postprandial glycemic variability. To reduce postprandial glycemic variability in youth with T1D, clinicians should encourage diversified macronutrient meal content, with a goal to approximate dietary guidelines for suggested carbohydrate intake.

The aim of this study was to assess the association between gestational glucose concentrations in women without (pre)gestational diabetes mellitus and childhood cardiovascular alterations at the age of 4 y. Our study was based on the Shanghai Birth Cohort. Briefly, among 1016 nondiabetic mothers (age: 30.8 ± 3.42 y; BMI: 21.3 ± 2.94) and their offsprings (age: 4.41 ± 0.22 y; BMI: 15.0 ± 1.56; 53.0% males), results of maternal 1-h oral OGTT between 24 and 28 gestational weeks were obtained. Childhood blood pressure (BP) measurement, echocardiography, and vascular ultrasound were performed at 4 y old. Linear regression and binary logistic regression were conducted to test the association between maternal glucose and childhood cardiovascular outcomes.

928,928,18826993,"This review summarizes three controversial areas of clinical practice that were discussed in many articles that appeared in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition during the author's tenure as editor in chief. Controversy 1-obesity and high-fructose corn syrup. The increased frequency of obesity in the US is paralleled by increasing annual consumption of high-fructose corn syrup, an extracted sweetener that is routinely added to soft drinks and to many processed foods in the US diet. Metabolic studies implicate increased fructose consumption in increased body fat and obesity and with increased circulating triglyceride levels and hypercholesterolaemia in children. Controversy 2-folic acid fortification and supplements. Together with widespread use of supplemental multivitamins, fortification of the US diet with folic acid has resulted in high serum folate levels in much of the population, which may be associated with increased risk of cognitive decline in ageing people with low vitamin B12 status, decreased natural killer T-cell immune function and increased risk of recurrent advanced precancerous colorectal adenomas and breast cancer. Controversy 3-recommended intakes of vitamin D. Levels of serum 25(OH)D sufficient for fracture prevention are at least 75 nmol/l (30 ng/ml) but cannot be achieved by the current recommended dietary intakes in the US.

929,929,25924872,"Both sleep duration and screen time have been suggested to affect children's diet, although in different directions and presumably through different pathways. The present cross-sectional study aimed to simultaneously investigate the associations between sleep duration, screen time and food consumption frequencies in children. The analysis was based on 10 453 children aged 6-9 years from five European countries that participated in the World Health Organization European Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative. Logistic multilevel models were used to assess associations of parent-reported screen time as well as sleep duration (exposure variables) with consumption frequencies of 16 food items (outcome variables). All models were adjusted for age, sex, outdoor play time, maximum educational level of parents and sleep duration or screen time, depending on the exposure under investigation. One additional hour of screen time was associated with increased consumption frequencies of 'soft drinks containing sugar' (1.28 [1.19;1.39]; odds ratio and 99% confidence interval), 'diet/light soft drinks' (1.21 [1.14;1.29]), 'flavoured milk' (1.18 [1.08;1.28]), 'candy bars or chocolate' (1.31 [1.22;1.40]), 'biscuits, cakes, doughnuts or pies' (1.22 [1.14;1.30]), 'potato chips (crisps), corn chips, popcorn or peanuts' (1.32 [1.20;1.45]), 'pizza, French fries (chips), hamburgers'(1.30 [1.18;1.43]) and with a reduced consumption frequency of 'vegetables (excluding potatoes)' (0.89 [0.83;0.95]) and 'fresh fruits' (0.91 [0.86;0.97]). Conversely, one additional hour of sleep duration was found to be associated with increased consumption frequencies of 'fresh fruits' (1.11 [1.04;1.18]) and 'vegetables (excluding potatoes)' (1.14 [1.07;1.23]). The results suggest a potential relation between high screen time exposure and increased consumption frequencies of foods high in fat, free sugar or salt whereas long sleep duration may favourably be related to children's food choices.

Preschoolers (N = 313) were recruited into a longitudinal study, with behavioral measurement of EC at age 5.25 years, temperament assessed multiple times across preschool, and eating outcomes assessed in adolescence (mean age = 15.34 years). Separate latent moderated structural equation models demonstrated that weaker EC was associated with eating less healthful foods, including high sugar foods, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), and convenience foods (p < .05). In the moderation models, negative affectivity temperament was correlated with eating less healthful foods, high sugar foods, and SSBs (p < .05). Children lower in surgency/extraversion temperament were more likely to drink SSBs. There was an interaction between temperament and EC, such that children high in negative affectivity with weaker EC were particularly more likely to consume less healthful foods, high sugar foods, and SSBs (p < .05). There was no interaction of surgency with EC and food consumption. Child characteristics measured early in development were associated with later adolescent eating behaviors. Adequate EC could be necessary to counteract the drive toward eating associated with temperaments high in negative affectivity.

Analysis of WIC was done in both treatment plants in 2012 (n = 166) and tap water in 2007 (n = 30). The correlation of WIC to the children's UIC and thyroid volume after iodination was tested based on data from the national survey in 2007. The association of WIC to former goitre frequency was tested based on pre-iodination data, derived from a map of goitre frequency drawn in 1929. The median WIC from water treatment plants was 4.0 μg/L (range 0-27 μg/L). WIC was similar in coastal and inland areas, for both ground and surface water. WIC correlated with historical goitre areas and was lower in the goitre areas than in non-goitre areas (p < 0.001). WIC in the same municipalities as the schools correlated with the UIC of children (p < 0.01), but not with their thyroid volume.

The aim of this study led in four districts (Koungheul, Bambey, Mekhe and Kebemer), was to estimate by a questionnaire, the women knowleges, attitudes and practices (KAP) concerning IDD, and to measure children urinary iodine excretion by the Sandell-Kolthoff method to assess a potential deficiency. Six hundred ninety eight households were selected covering 1336 women (age 15 to 49 years) and 400 children (age 6 to 12 years). Sixty three per cent of the women knew the goiter, 89% of them considered that it was a disease and only 0.6% knew the role of iodized salt in the treatment. On the other hand, 20% of the children presented a normal range of urinary iodine excretion superior to 100 microg/l, the deficiency was light (50 to 100 microg/l) in 38% of the children, moderate (25 to 50 microg/l) in 27% and severe (< 25 microg/l) in 15% of them.

Enrolled infants were stratified by gestational age-groups and randomized to either the enhanced nutrition protocol (intervention group) or the standard PN protocol (standard group). Welch's two-sample t tests were used to investigate differences in calorie and protein intake, insulin use, days of hyperglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia, and proportion of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and death between groups. Intervention and standard groups were similar in baseline characteristics. The intervention group received higher weekly mean caloric intake (102.6 [SD 24.9] kcal/kg/day versus 89.7 [SD 30.2] kcal/kg/day; p = 0.001) and higher mean caloric intake on days of life 2-4 (p < 0.05 for all). Both groups received the recommended protein intake (≥4 g/kg/day). There were no significant differences in safety or feasibility outcomes between groups (all p values >0.12). Utilization of an enhanced nutrition protocol during the first week of life resulted in increased caloric intake and was feasible with no evidence of harm. Follow-up of this cohort is needed to determine if enhanced PN will result in improved growth and neurodevelopment.

Currently, data supporting the efficacy of these medications are insufficient. In this prospective observational study, intracranial hypertension (intracranial pressure ≥ 20 mm Hg for > 5 min) was treated by clinical protocol. Administration times of medications for intracranial hypertension (fentanyl, 3% hypertonic saline, mannitol, and pentobarbital) were prospectively recorded and synchronized with an automated database that collected intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure every 5 seconds. Intracranial pressure crises confounded by external stimulation or mechanical ventilator adjustments were excluded. Mean intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure from epochs following drug administration were compared with baseline values using Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance and Dunn test. Frailty modeling was used to analyze the time to intracranial pressure crisis resolution. Mixed-effect models compared intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure 5 minutes after the medication versus baseline and rates of treatment failure. A tertiary care children's hospital. Children with severe traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤ 8). None. We analyzed 196 doses of fentanyl, hypertonic saline, mannitol, and pentobarbital administered to 16 children (median: 12 doses per patient). Overall, intracranial pressure significantly decreased following the administration of fentanyl, hypertonic saline, and pentobarbital. After controlling for administration of multiple medications, intracranial pressure was decreased following hypertonic saline and pentobarbital administration; cerebral perfusion pressure was decreased following fentanyl and was increased following hypertonic saline administration. After adjusting for significant covariates (including age, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and intracranial pressure), hypertonic saline was associated with a two-fold faster resolution of intracranial hypertension than either fentanyl or pentobarbital. Fentanyl was significantly associated with the most frequent treatment failure. Intracranial pressure decreased after multiple drug administrations, but hypertonic saline may warrant consideration as the first-line drug for treating intracranial hypertension, as it was associated with the most favorable cerebral hemodynamics and fastest resolution of intracranial hypertension.

The brain does not store glycogen and perform gluconeogenesis, it relies on a continuous supply of glucose from blood. There are several studies demonstrating the brain's ability to use lactate, alanine and ketone as alternative fuels yet there is no evidence showing that this mechanism works in diabetic individuals. During hypoglycemia, cerebral blood flow increases very little in children. It is unlikely that this mechanism alone explains the maintenance of glucose utilization. Up regulation of GLUT transporters may be an additional or alternative protective mechanism. Severe hypoglycemic episodes experienced particularly in early childhood can cause deterioration in neurocognitive functions. There are significant individual differences in terms of vulnerability to hypoglycemia. Adaptive responses to hypoglycemia might vary according to both the degree and frequency of prior hypoglycemia and the presence of structural brain changes induced by chronic hyperglycemia.

Children, two-to-nine-years old, who consulted to a paediatric dental clinic for any reason, were recruited to complete the FFQ and 24-h recall, inquired oral hygiene habits, performed oral examinations, recorded dmft(s)/DMFT(S) index, and taken anthropometric measurements. The statistical methods used for validation were Wilcoxon signed rank test, Spearman ranked correlations, weighted kappa statistic and Bland-Altman graphs were drawn. Besides, intraclass and spearman correlation coefficients calculated for the reliability. A total of 120 children participated in to the first stage of the study while 70 participants completed the 4-month period. The Spearman correlation coefficient and weighted kappa values confirmed that the FFQ had moderate validation against the food records for lactose, calcium and phosphorus. Dietary fat, fibre, lactose, calcium, potassium, fluoride, magnesium, phosphorus and zinc intakes were negatively and statistically significantly correlated with DMFT and DMFS according to both FFQ and 24-h (p < 0.05, for each). Furthermore, a positive correlation between DMFT/S and dietary carbohydrate, starch, polysaccharide and sucrose intakes was obtained. These results provide the preliminary evidence for the moderated reliability and validity of the FFQ; the higher DMFT and DMFS scores might be linked to lower dietary intakes of fat, fibre, lactose, calcium, potassium, fluorine, magnesium, phosphorus and zinc; and probably higher dietary intakes of carbohydrate, starch, polysaccharide and sucrose in children.

Pathologic changes seen in the resected cortex were more pronounced in cortical areas of abnormal metabolism than in regions showing normal metabolism. In 9 patients evaluated later (>1 year after onset of seizures), the PET scan showed more diffuse hemispheric metabolic abnormalities including the occipital cortex, but the abnormalities remained highly lateralized.

Diaschisis refers to a functional impairment at a remote site following injury to an anatomically connected area of brain and, presumably due to a loss of afferent input to the remote site. Of the 40 patients, 11 had sustained their cerebral injury prenatally, 7 in the perinatal period (+/- 24 hours of birth), and 22 postnatally (1 day to 15 years). Crossed cerebellar hypometabolism was seen in 22 patients; symmetric cerebellar metabolism was found in 16 subjects. The presence of crossed cerebellar hypometabolism was typically associated (75% of cases) with a postnatal injury, while symmetric cerebellar metabolism was seen only in patients with injury occurring prior to 4 weeks of age (13 of the 16 had prenatal or perinatal insults). A third pattern of cerebellar metabolism, consisting of paradoxical crossed cerebellar hypermetabolism, was seen in two patients; both had sustained their cerebral injury at 4 months of age.

Just more than 17 per cent were always provided with a sugar-free liquid medicine, 58.3 per cent sometimes received this form of medication and 24.6 per cent never received it. The strongest individual predictor of a high frequency of provision of the medication in sugar-free form was the frequency of parents requesting this type of medication from their medical doctor and the next strongest predictor was the frequency of use of antibiotics. Parental awareness or knowledge of the importance of the issue for dental health did not affect the outcome in the present study.

The associations with other specific cancer were no significant. We found linear dose-response associations between consumption of SSBs and the risk of breast and kidney cancer, and between consumption of ASBs and 100% fruit juices and the risk of pancreatic cancer. An increment in consumption of SSBs of 250 mL/day was positively associated with increased risk of breast, colorectal, and biliary tract cancer. Fruit juices consumption was also positively associated with the risk of overall cancer, thyroid cancer, and melanoma.

952,952,28582819,"To counter emerging iodine deficiency mandatory iodine fortification of bread was introduced throughout Australia in 2009. This study investigated the impact of iodine fortification on the iodine status of school aged children living in the iodine replete state of Queensland, and investigated which foods had greatest influence on overall iodine status. A convenience sample of 30 children aged 8.0-10.9 years living in south east Queensland, Australia, provided spot morning and afternoon urine samples on two consecutive days. Iodine status was categorised by the World Health Organization criterion. Semiquantitative food questionnaires (FFQ) completed by carers were used to investigate which foods were having the greatest influence on UIC. Analysis of variance was used to reduce the within person variation observed in urinary iodine concentrations (UIC) and the data were log transformed before statistical analysis. Adjusted median UIC was 144 ug/L (IQR 120-210 ug/L) indicating iodine sufficient status. No samples were above the cut off for excessive UIC. Bread was the only statistically significant contributor to UIC (standardized β=0.37, p=0.04) with 14% of variation in UIC explained by bread consumption. UIC increased by 8.7% for each additional serve of bread. Iodine fortification of bread has increased the iodine status of school aged children in this Queensland cohort. Despite the small sample size in this study, improvements in methodology allowed its findings to be comparable to other, larger surveys.

955,955,26564394,"Both the intake of fat, especially saturated trans fatty acids, and refined carbohydrates, particularly sugar, have been linked to increased risk of obesity, diabetes and CVD. Dietary guidelines are generally similar throughout the world, restrict both intake of SFA and added sugar to no more than 10 and 35 % energy for total fat and recommend 50 % energy from carbohydrates being derived from unrefined cereals, tubers, fruit and vegetables. Current evidence favours partial replacement of SFA with PUFA with regard to risk of CVD. The translation of these macronutrient targets into food-based dietary guidelines is more complex because some high-fat foods play an important part in meeting nutrient requirements as well as influencing the risk of chronic disease. Some of the recent controversies surrounding the significance of sugar and the type of fat in the diet are discussed.

956,956,37516844,"Clinical trials to treat childhood obesity show modest results, weight regain and high dropout rates. Children with obesity often live in families with habits that contribute to unhealthy weight gain. This study will test whether a family intervention with a Brazilian-adapted Planetary Healthy Diet (PHD) and reduced portion sizes, along with increased physical activity and reduced sedentary behavior, can reduce excessive weight gain. The protocol promotes the intake of in natura products and water and reduces ultra-processed foods, sugar, and sodium. It encourages family lifestyle changes and physical activities, with randomized allocation to experimental and control groups. The responsible family member will be evaluated during follow-up. The control group will receive a print of the Brazilian dietary guideline. A factorial crossover design will also allocate families to receive reduced sodium salt plus anti-inflammatory herbs and a placebo salt. Both the control and intervention groups will be randomly assigned to the sequence of both salts. The approach aims to reduce body weight expectations and evaluate salt's impact on blood pressure. It includes a 1-month intervention, 1-month washout, and 1-month intervention with monthly clinic visits and teleservice by health professionals. The primary outcomes will be the variation in the Body Mass Index (BMI) of the children. BMI and the variation in the blood pressure of the pair (child/mother or father) as well as waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) will also be measured. The project will test the effectiveness of the use of the recommendations of the PHD, physical activity and a salt-reduced sodium. The results of the present study will allow the refinement of interventions aimed at the treatment of childhood obesity and may help develop guidelines for the treatment of obesity in Brazilian children.

In order to provide up to date IV-MFT guidelines, the European Society of Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care (ESPNIC) undertook a systematic review to answer the following five main questions about IV-MFT: (i) the indications for use (ii) the role of isotonic fluid (iii) the role of balanced solutions (iv) IV fluid composition (calcium, magnesium, potassium, glucose and micronutrients) and v) and the optimal amount of fluid. A multidisciplinary expert group within ESPNIC conducted this systematic review using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) grading method. Five databases were searched for studies that answered these questions, in acute and critically children (from 37 weeks gestational age to 18 years), published until November 2020. The quality of evidence and risk of bias were assessed, and meta-analyses were undertaken when appropriate. A series of recommendations was derived and voted on by the expert group to achieve consensus through two voting rounds. 56 papers met the inclusion criteria, and 16 recommendations were produced. Outcome reporting was inconsistent among studies. Recommendations generated were based on a heterogeneous level of evidence, but consensus within the expert group was high. ""Strong consensus"" was reached for 11/16 (69%) and ""consensus"" for 5/16 (31%) of the recommendations.

We reviewed published studies examining LCS consumption in relation to dietary and health outcomes and extracted the methods used to categorize LCS as reported by the authors of each study. We then examined the extent to which these approaches reliably identified LCSBs using the Internet Archive Wayback Machine to examine beverage ingredients lists across three NHANES cycles (2011-2016). None of the four general strategies used appeared to include all LCSBs while also excluding all beverages that did not contain LCS.

Neuropsychological data were available for 88 patients (45 patients for TPM and 43 patients for CBZ). Of the cognitive variables measured, arithmetic showed significant worsening in TPM (p = 0.037). An additional test, for maze, also showed a significantly greater improvement for CBZ (p = 0.026). Of behavioral variables, no significant changes were found but the scores had a negative trend for the TPM. When 30 patients on the minimum target dose for TPM were compared to 40 patients treated with minimum target CBZ, there was no significant worsening of cognitive and behavioral effects in the TPM.

A few previous studies suggest Fontan patients have an increased risk of abnormal glucose metabolism without a clear mechanism. We aim to evaluate the prevalence and severity of abnormal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values in Fontan patients and identify associated factors. Single-center retrospective cross-sectional cohort study including Fontan patients and documented HbA1c testing. Univariate demographic, anthropometric, and laboratory variable comparisons were completed and a stepwise selection multivariate regression model was attempted. The study included 414 Fontan patients, median age of 19 years (range 3-59 years). Of these, 190 patients (60.5% male) had at least one HbA1c. Abnormal HbA1c (> 5.6%) was found in 36% (n = 70) and diabetic-range HbA1c (≥ 6.5%) in 4.7% (n = 9). Factors associated with abnormal HbA1c included non-white race (63% vs 45%, p = 0.018), female sex (49% vs 34%, p = 0.050), elevated adult BMI [29.6 (± 8.4) vs 24.8 (± 4.8), p =  < 0.0001], elevated blood glucose [108.7 (± 47.3) vs 91.1 (± 17.9), p =  < 0.0001], and elevated triglycerides [101.5 (± 52.9) vs 84.1 (± 50.9), p = 0.029].

Globally, two billion individuals have an insufficient iodine intake, and approximately 50% of continental Europe remains mildly iodine deficient. Iodine intakes in other industrialised countries, including the USA and Australia, have fallen in recent years. Iodine deficiency has reappeared in Australia, as a result of declining iodine residues in milk products because of decreased iodophor use by the dairy industry. In the USA, although the general population is iodine sufficient, it is uncertain whether iodine intakes are adequate in pregnancy, which has led to calls for iodine supplementation. The few available data suggest that pregnant women in the Republic of Ireland and the UK are now mildly iodine deficient, possibly as a result of reduced use of iodophors by the dairy industry, as observed in Australia. Representative data on iodine status in children and pregnant women in the UK are urgently needed to inform health policy. In most industrialised countries the best strategy to control iodine deficiency is carefully-monitored salt iodisation. However, because approximately 90% of salt consumption in industrialised countries is from purchased processed foods, the iodisation of household salt only will not supply adequate iodine. Thus, in order to successfully control iodine deficiency in industrialised countries it is critical that the food industry use iodised salt. The current push to reduce salt consumption to prevent chronic diseases and the policy of salt iodisation to eliminate iodine deficiency do not conflict; iodisation methods can fortify salt to provide recommended iodine intakes even if per capita salt intakes are reduced to <5 g/d.

993,993,34955677,"During a dual-center study on obese and normal weight children and adolescents, focusing on glucose metabolism, we observed a marked difference in glucose results (N = 16,840) between the two sites, Salzburg, Austria and Uppsala, Sweden (P < 0.001). After excluding differences in patient characteristics between the two populations as cause of this finding, we investigated other preanalytic influences. Finally, only the tubes used for blood collection at the two sites were left to evaluate. While the Vacuette FC-Mix tube (Greiner Bio-One, Kremsmünster, Austria) was used in Uppsala, in Salzburg blood collections were performed with a lithium heparin tube (LH-Monovette, Sarstedt, Germany). To prove our hypothesis, we collected two blood samples in either of these tubes from 51 children (Salzburg N = 27, Uppsala N = 24) and compared the measured glucose results. Indeed, we found the suspected bias and calculated a correction formula, which significantly diminished the differences of glucose results between the two sites ( ",993,Deviating glucose results in an international dual-center study.

Newry and Mourne Health Trust Area, Northern Ireland. Proportions of respondents citing various learning sources and the levels of support for the use of sugar-free medicines were obtained and the proportions of doctors and pharmacists claiming to offer various frequencies of choice were compared to the proportions of parents recalling receiving such choices. Test prescriptions were examined and the sugar-free status of the prescribed medication was determined. Markedly different sources of learning were cited by different groups. Ninety per cent of pharmacists and 88% of dentists believed that medication should be in sugar-free form in all cases, while only 66% of doctors thought so. Forty three per cent of doctors claimed to always offer a choice while 17% of parents recalled receiving this. The equivalent figures for pharmacists and parents were 69% and 11%.

997,997,33035588,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) caused by consumption of high levels of fat and sugars (HFHS) in diet is considered one of the most dangerous medical complications among children and adolescents. Nicotinamide is among the promising candidates in ameliorating HFHS diet-induced NAFLD, but its use is limited by the possibility of prompting hepatotoxicity in high doses. Ascorbic acid is another promising candidate, however its use as a hepatoprotective agent is limited by its chemical instability. Therefore, the aim of the study was to overcome their delivery limitations and enhance their hepatoprotective activity by loading into nanoparticles. In the present study, upon incorporating nicotinamide or ascorbic acid in chitosan nanoparticles, they ameliorated the insulin-resistant status induced in rats by a high-fat-high-fructose (HFHF) diet. Both formulae decreased serum level of ALT and AST, as well as liver tissue total cholesterol, triglycerides and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels. They also decreased oxidative and nitrosative stresses along with a significant increase in the hepatocellular energy. The biochemical findings were further confirmed by histopathological examination. Finally from the obtained data it could be concluded that chitosan nicotinamide nanoparticles at a dose level (10 mg/kg, p.o.) demonstrated beneficial pharmacological effect with safer toxicity profile than chitosan ascorbic acid nanoparticles. Nicotinamide chitosan nanoparticles could be recommended as daily supplement in the recovery from NAFLD.

998,998,28483584,"There is limited evidence on how diet changes over the transition from primary to secondary school. In this study we investigated changes in diet from age 10 (2007) to age 14 years (2011) and the contribution of school-time consumption and school lunch choice to such changes. The 351 participants with dietary data (4 day food record) available at baseline (age 10 years) and follow-up (age 14 years) were included. Multi-level regression models were fitted for absolute or change in food and nutrient intake, cross-classified by primary and secondary school attended as appropriate, with adjustment for covariates and mis-reporting. From age 10 to age 14 years, children decreased energy intake from sugars (-2.6% energy (%E)) (standard error (SE) 0.44) and from saturated fats (-0.54%E (SE 0.18)), decreased fruit (-3.13 g/MJ (SE 1.04)) and vegetables (-1.55 g/MJ (SE 0.46)) consumption and increased sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) (4.66  g/MJ (SE 1.87)) and fries (1.31  g/MJ (SE 0.39)) consumption. Intake of snack foods, SSBs, and fries, but also fruits and vegetables was higher outside school hours. Prospective change from non-school lunch to school lunch, compared to maintaining non-school lunch consumption, was associated with decreased consumption of savoury snacks (-8.32 g/day (SE 2.03)), increased consumption of fries (12.8 g/day (SE 4.01)) and decreased consumption of fruit (-25.16 g/day (SE 11.02)) during school hours. Changes in diet from age 10 to age 14 years differed within and outside of school hours. Consumption of a school lunch, compared to lunch obtained elsewhere, was associated with negative as well as positive changes in diet, suggesting that any efforts to encourage school lunch take-up need to be accompanied by further efforts to improve school lunch provision to meet nutritional guidelines.
