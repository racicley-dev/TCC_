This systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) summarises evidence on the impact of colour-coded interpretive labels and warning labels on changing consumers' purchasing behaviour. We conducted a literature review of peer-reviewed articles published between 1 January 1990 and 24 May 2021 in PubMed, Embase via Ovid, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and SCOPUS. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies were included for the primary outcomes (measures of changes in consumers' purchasing and consuming behaviour). A frequentist NMA method was applied to pool the results. A total of 156 studies (including 101 RCTs and 55 non-RCTs) nested in 138 articles were incorporated into the systematic review, of which 134 studies in 120 articles were eligible for meta-analysis. We found that the traffic light labelling system (TLS), nutrient warning (NW), and health warning (HW) were associated with an increased probability of selecting more healthful products (odds ratios [ORs] and 95% confidence intervals [CIs]: TLS, 1.5 [1.2, 1.87]; NW, 3.61 [2.82, 4.63]; HW, 1.65 [1.32, 2.06]). Nutri-Score (NS) and warning labels appeared effective in reducing consumers' probability of selecting less healthful products (NS, 0.66 [0.53, 0.82]; NW,0.65 [0.54, 0.77]; HW,0.64 [0.53, 0.76]). NS and NW were associated with an increased overall healthfulness (healthfulness ratings of products purchased using models such as FSAm-NPS/HCSP) by 7.9% and 26%, respectively. TLS, NS, and NW were associated with a reduced energy (total energy: TLS, -6.5%; NS, -6%; NW, -12.9%; energy per 100 g/ml: TLS, -3%; NS, -3.5%; NW, -3.8%), sodium (total sodium/salt: TLS, -6.4%; sodium/salt per 100 g/ml: NS: -7.8%), fat (total fat: NS, -15.7%; fat per 100 g/ml: TLS: -2.6%; NS: -3.2%), and total saturated fat (TLS, -12.9%; NS: -17.1%; NW: -16.3%) content of purchases. The impact of TLS, NS, and NW on purchasing behaviour could be explained by improved understanding of the nutrition information, which further elicits negative perception towards unhealthful products or positive attitudes towards healthful foods. Comparisons across label types suggested that colour-coded labels performed better in nudging consumers towards the purchase of more healthful products (NS versus NW: 1.51 [1.08, 2.11]), while warning labels have the advantage in discouraging unhealthful purchasing behaviour (NW versus TLS: 0.81 [0.67, 0.98]; HW versus TLS: 0.8 [0.63, 1]). Study limitations included high heterogeneity and inconsistency in the comparisons across different label types, limited number of real-world studies (95% were laboratory studies), and lack of long-term impact assessments. Our systematic review provided comprehensive evidence for the impact of colour-coded labels and warnings in nudging consumers' purchasing behaviour towards more healthful products and the underlying psychological mechanism of behavioural change. Each type of label had different attributes, which should be taken into consideration when making front-of-package nutrition labelling (FOPL) policies according to local contexts. Our study supported mandatory front-of-pack labelling policies in directing consumers' choice and encouraging the food industry to reformulate their products. PROSPERO (CRD42020161877).

2,2,38423749,"Many additives, some of which have no nutritional value, can be legally used in processed foods. They intensify colour, thicken, increase shelf life and enhance flavour. Regulatory authorities issue approvals as safe within acceptable quantitative limits. Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) contain combinations of all these additives and are particularly attractive to children.Many publications suggest that artificial colourants, benzoate preservatives, non-caloric sweeteners, emulsifiers and their degradation derivatives have adverse effects by increasing risks of mental health disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and potential carcinogenic effects.A systematic review has established that artificial azo dye food colourants (AFCs) and sodium benzoate preservative cause disturbed behaviour in children. AFCs and benzoates in animal models have neurotoxic properties through gut microbial generation of toxic metabolites. Observational studies show associations between high emulsifier intake and cardiovascular disease. Animal models and in vitro studies have highlighted neurotoxic, cytotoxic, genotoxic and carcinogenic effects. High intake of non-caloric sweeteners has been linked to cardiovascular disease and depression in adults and is linked to childhood obesity.Little research has focused on children who are the largest consumers of UPFs. Potentially, they are a ticking time bomb for adult obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, mental health disorders and cancers. Based on risk/benefit analysis, azo dye AFCs should be banned. Benzoates, emulsifiers and sweeteners require assessment of quantitative limits and cumulative effects of combinations. Consumers purchasing UPFs require information through ingredient health warnings and recommendations to use natural unprocessed foods which have well-described health-promoting properties.

3,3,34742660,"The mission of pediatric medical education is to train the workforce who will provide and innovate child healthcare, including addressing healthcare inequities for children and adolescents of color. A diverse physician workforce is associated with more equitable outcomes. Therefore, it is imperative that our workforce continue to reflect the ever-growing diverse nature of our society. While diversity has been at the forefront of conversations for increasing the number of underrepresented communities in medicine, inclusion and equity are oftentimes overlooked. It is crucial to recognize that while diversity is an important aspect to the UIM experience, the overall impact of diversity is diluted when it is not paired with inclusion and equity. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to illustrate the experiences that shape inclusion and equity for UIM physicians along the training continuum and how negative factors may impact the wellness and career longevity of UIM physicians. Our study explored the experiences of UIM physicians throughout their medical education through the lens of inclusion and equity by exploring three common factors: social support, racism and discrimination, and well-being and burnout. There may be a perception that stressors, including racial discrimination, diminish with progression through one's educational career; however, this review suggests that these stressors manifest differently relative to the trials inherent to each career stage. By exploring the interplay between these factors and the UIM experience as a continuum, we are better able to discuss effective solutions to diversity, equity and inclusion for UIM physicians.

ECEC is even more crucial in the context of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and the disproportionate burden of trauma and stress borne by families of color in disinvested neighborhoods. Remote learning and repeated disruptions to in-person instruction as protocols shifted during waves of the pandemic placed an extra strain on families, and may have increased educational disparities in the U.S. Taken together, these challenges have implications for children's school readiness due to their impact on opportunities for learning at home and in the classroom.

7,7,35913365,"Previous research has underscored a need to understand the experiences and decision-making processes that contribute to suspension and expulsion in early care and education settings, particularly among young children of color. The present study conducted qualitative interviews with 20 center- and family-based childcare providers from the Minnesota Early Care and Education (MECE) study. Participants were asked about challenging child behaviors that they have encountered, their perceptions of these behaviors and how they manage them, and their thought processes around suspension and expulsion. Overall, the most frequently reported categories of challenging behaviors were physical aggression and noncompliance/defiance/arguing. The most commonly reported perceived causes of challenging behaviors were typical child development and parenting problems. The primary reported strategy for addressing challenging behaviors was connecting with the child, with relatively few providers reporting using other evidence-based strategies. Finally, the most commonly reported reasons for considering suspension or expulsion were the providers feeling they had exhausted options and could not meet the child's needs, and the child's behavior being perceived as dangerous to self or others. Implications for future research and practice (including increased support services for childcare providers) are discussed. La investigación previa ha subrayado una necesidad de comprender las experiencias y los procesos de toma de decisiones que contribuyen a la suspensión y expulsión en centros de tempranos cuidados y educación, particularmente entre niños pequeños de color. El presente estudio llevó a cabo entrevistas cualitativas con 20 proveedores de cuidado infantil con base en el centro y en la familia, del estudio Tempranos Cuidados y Educación en Minnesota (MECE). A los participantes se les preguntó acerca de los retos enfrentados en cuanto al comportamiento de los niños, sus percepciones de estos comportamientos y cómo los manejaron, así como los procesos de pensamiento sobre la suspensión y expulsión. En términos generales, las categorías más frecuentemente reportadas de comportamientos desafiantes fueron la agresión física y la desobediencia/desafío/discusión. Las más comúnmente reportadas causas percibidas de comportamientos desafiantes fueron el típico desarrollo del niño y problemas de crianza. La estrategia primariamente reportada para hablar de y dirigir los comportamientos desafiantes fue la conexión con el niño, con relativamente pocos proveedores que reportaron el uso de otra estrategia con base en la evidencia. Finalmente, las razones más comúnmente reportadas en cuanto a considerar la suspensión o la expulsión fueron el instinto del proveedor de haber agotado las opciones y el no haber podido satisfacer las necesidades del niño, así como la percepción de que el comportamiento del niño era peligroso para el propio niño y otros. Se discuten las implicaciones para la futura investigación (incluyendo el aumento de servicios de apoyo para proveedores del cuidado infantil). Les recherches précédentes ont souligné un besoin de comprendre les expériences et les processus décisionnels qui contribuent à la suspension et à l'expulsion dans les contextes de la crèche ou de l’éducation, particulièrement chez les jeunes enfants racialisés / de couleur. Cette étude a procédé à des entretiens qualitatifs avec 20 prestataires de service de garde d'enfants (centres ou crèches et prestataires à domicile) de l’étude des Soins Précoces et de l'Education (abrégé MECE) dans l’état du Minnesota aux Etats-Unis. Les participants ont répondu à des questions sur les comportements difficiles de l'enfant auxquels ils ont fait face, leurs perceptions de ces comportements et la manière dont ils les ont gérés, et leurs processus de réflexion au sujet de la suspension et de l'expulsion. Dans l'ensemble les catégories les plus fréquemment rapportées de comportements difficiles étaient l'agression physique et le non-respect, la défiance et la dispute. Les causes perçues de comportements difficiles les plus fréquemment rapportées étaient les problèmes typiques de comportement de l'enfant et de parentage. La stratégie la plus rapportée pour faire face aux comportements difficiles était de communiquer avec l'enfant, avec relativement peu de prestataires utilisant d'autres stratégies fondées sur des données probantes. Enfant, les raisons les plus communément rapportées quant à la considération de la suspension ou de l'expulsion étaient que les prestataires sentaient qu'ils avaient épuisé les options et ne pouvaient pas répondre aux besoins de l'enfant et que le comportement de l'enfant était perçu comme dangereux pour lui / elle ou les autres. Les implications pour les recherches et la pratique futures (y compris l'augmentation de services de soutien pour les prestataires de garde d'enfant) sont discutées. Die Sicht von Kinderbetreuungseinrichtungen auf problematisches Verhalten von Kindern, Suspendierung und Ausschluss: Eine qualitative Analyse Frühere Forschungsarbeiten haben die Notwendigkeit betont, die Erfahrungen und Entscheidungsprozesse zu verstehen, die zur Suspendierung und zum Ausschluss von Kindern aus der Frühbetreuung/ -erziehung beitragen, insbesondere bei Kleinkindern of Color. In der vorliegenden Studie wurden mit 20 Anbietern von Kinderbetreuungseinrichtungen und Familienbetreuungseinrichtungen aus der Minnesota Early Care and Education (MECE) Studie qualitative Interviews durchgeführt. Die Teilnehmenden wurden zu herausfordernden Verhaltensweisen von Kindern befragt, mit denen sie konfrontiert wurden, zu ihrer Wahrnehmung dieser Verhaltensweisen, zu ihrer Art, damit umzugehen, und zu ihren Denkprozessen bezüglich Suspendierung und Ausschluss. Insgesamt waren die am häufigsten genannten Kategorien herausfordernder Verhaltensweisen körperliche Aggression und Ungehorsam/Trotz/Streit. Die am häufigsten genannten Ursachen für herausforderndes Verhalten waren typische kindliche Entwicklungsprozesse und Erziehungsprobleme bei den Eltern. Die am häufigsten genannte Strategie zur Bewältigung schwieriger Verhaltensweisen war die Kontaktaufnahme mit dem Kind. Nur relativ wenige Anbieter gaben an, andere evidenzbasierte Strategien zu verwenden. Die am häufigsten genannten Gründe für eine Suspendierung oder einen Ausschluss waren schließlich, wenn die Anbieter das Gefühl hatten, alle Möglichkeiten ausgeschöpft zu haben und den Bedürfnissen des Kindes nicht gerecht werden zu können. Ein weiterer häufig genannter Grund war, wenn das Verhalten des Kindes als selbst- oder fremdgefährdend eingeschätzt wurde.

8,8,34742662,"Health inequities disproportionately impact children of color in the United States. Research demonstrates that a diverse physician workforce that reflects the demographic profile of the United States population has been associated with better health outcomes and physicians of color are more likely to work in communities that are medically underserved. Therefore, a key driver to reducing health inequities is recruiting a physician workforce that reflects the racial/ethnic composition of the population. Although efforts on increasing UIM applicants and matriculants into medical school and more recently, graduate medical education (GME) programs have shown some small successes, there has still not been significant change in decades. This narrative review examined the historical trends and current landscape of recruitment in GME to better understand the barriers and facilitators that continue to exist and identify successful interventions that might serve as a model to support recruitment of UIM applicants. There is evidence for racial disparities and bias in traditional residency selection metrics (USMLE, Clerkship Evaluations, MSPE, AOA status, etc.) and a need for more holistic recruitment strategies. Along with implementing new holistic recruitment practices, there is a need for ongoing research and collaboration to study inclusive and equitable learning environments and assessments that will eliminate racial disparities in educational outcomes. Additionally, there must be better longitudinal data utilization and transparency across Electronic Residency Application Services (ERAS) and National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) for accountability and tracking of interventions.

We investigate color morph-enriched Asian vine snakes (Ahaetulla prasina), to explore the mechanism underpinning color variations.

Additionally, we assemble a 1.77-Gb high-quality chromosome-anchored genome of the snake. Genome-wide association study and RNA sequencing reveal a conservative amino acid substitution (p.P20S) in SMARCE1, which may be involved in the regulation of chromatophore development initiated from neural crest cells. SMARCE1 knockdown in zebrafish and immunofluorescence verify the interactions among SMARCE1, iridophores, and tfec, which may determine color variations in the Asian vine snake.

This cross-sectional study was based on data obtained from the first phase of the Shahroud Schoolchildren Eye Cohort Study. The target population was 6 to12 year-old students living in urban and rural areas. Iris colors were classified by comparing eye colors with close-up images of iris colors. Myopia was defined as a spherical equivalent (SE) ≤ - 0.5 diopter and hyperopia was defined as SE ≥ 2 diopter in cycloplegic refraction. The association of iris color with hyperopia and myopia was investigated by fitting two separate multiple logistic regression models adjusted for place of residence, age, sex, and times for outdoor activity and near work. Among the 5394 participates with the mean age of 9.7 year, the prevalence of myopia and hyperopia was 4.8% and 4.7% respectively.

12,12,39451058,"One of the major causes of dental anxiety in children is their first impression of the dental environment. Even minor details, such as the choice of color in a dental setting and the color of dental equipment, can positively influence a child's behavior. The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between the emotions in children and color combinations in a pediatric setting. The study involved 200 children (99 boys and 101 girls) aged between 6 and 12 years who visited the dental clinics at the College of Dentistry, Jazan University, for the first time between November 2017 and January 2018. The participants were divided into 2 groups based on age. The younger children group included participants aged from 6 to 9 years, while the older children group included participants aged from 10 to 12 years. Anxiety levels were recorded using the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale. Colored pencils and images of emoticons were provided to all children, who were instructed to color the negative and positive emoticons with their preferred colors. The analysis of anxiety levels among children in both groups revealed statistically significant differences across sexes in the younger age group, with girls being more anxious than boys (p = 0.003). Additionally, a statistically significant difference was observed in the choice of colors by children of both sexes in 2 age groups (p = 0.001).

In the absence of a solid and comprehensive evidence base, sufficient training, education, and consensus guidelines, commercial promotion of pharmacogenetic testing panels has the potential to become the main source of information for providers. Commonly, these tests include multigene panels and group medications into color-coded bins.

14,14,25772121,"Physical abuse of children has many manifestations. Depending on the type of force involved, specific injury patterns are produced on the body of the child, the morphology and localization of which are forensically relevant in terms of diagnostic classification as child abuse. Typical patterned bruising includes, for example, tramline bruises resulting from blows with oblong, stick-like objects. In addition to rounded or one-sided horseshoe-shaped bite injuries, injuries of different ages, clustered injuries (e.g., three or more individual injuries in the same body region), and thermal injuries are typical results of abuse. Abusive scalds are usually characterized by a symmetrical impression and localization with sharp delineation of the scald wound edges, in contrast to accidental scalding injuries with radiating splash patterns ending in tapered points. The coloration of a hematoma can help indicate the time when the injury occurred. Lack of a coherent and comprehensible explanation for accidental injury constitutes grounds for suspecting abuse. Suspicions should be raised in cases of a delayed visit to a doctor, waiting for an unusually long period before summoning emergency medical help for serious injuries to a child, and when differing versions of a purported accident are provided. Documentation of the findings is highly relevant in later reviews of the diagnosis, for instance, when new relevant facts and investigative results come to light in subsequent criminal proceedings.

15,15,33648536,"The unacceptably high rate of maternal and child mortality in Nigeria prompted the government to introduce a free maternal and child health (MCH) programme, which was stopped abruptly following a change in government. This triggered increased advocacy for sustaining MCH as a political priority in the country and led to the formation of advocacy coalitions. This study set out to explain the process involved in the formation of advocacy coalition groups and how they work to bring about sustained political prioritization for MCH in Nigeria. It will contribute to the understanding of the Nigerian MCH sector subsystem and will be beneficial to health policy advocates and public health researchers in Nigeria. This study employed a qualitative case study approach. Data were collected using a pretested interview guide to conduct 22 in-depth interviews, while advocacy events were reviewed pro forma. The document review was analysed using the manual content analysis method, while qualitative data audiotapes were transcribed verbatim, anonymized, double-coded in MS Word using colour-coded highlights and analysed using manual thematic and framework analysis guided by the advocacy coalition framework (ACF). The ACF was used to identify the policy subsystem including the actors, their belief, coordination and resources, as well as the effects of advocacy groups on policy change. Ethics and consent approval were obtained for the study. The policy subsystem identified the actors and characterized the coalitions, and described their group formation processes and resources/strategies for engagement. The perceived deep core belief driving the MCH agenda is the right of an individual to health. The effects of advocacy groups on policy change were identified, along with the factors that enabled effectiveness, as well as constraints to coalition formation. External factors and triggers of coalition formation were identified to include high maternal mortality and withdrawal of the free MCH programme, while the contextual issues were the health system issues and the socioeconomic factors affecting the country. Our findings add to an increasing body of evidence that the use of ACF is beneficial in exploring how advocacy coalitions are formed and in identifying the effects of advocacy groups on policy change.

Here, we report the outcomes in a retrospective case series, with a review of literature. Between January 2013 and October 2019, 8 patients who met our inclusion criteria were initially investigated. The inclusion criteria were: (1) injured by an eyebrow razor during fiddling or grasping, and (2) the availability of complete medical records and radiological data, with follow-up of at least 2 years. The core sutures were performed using a modified Becker (4-strand) method for flexor digitorum profundus (FDP). Nerves and/or vessels were repaired under microscopy. A long-arm mitten cast was then applied, with the fingers slightly flexed in a resting position, for 3 weeks. Then, the children were allowed to return to unrestricted activity. Formal outpatient hand therapy was not performed. Mean postnatal age was 6.3 months. The FDP was injured in zones 1 and 2 in 3 and 5 infants, respectively. Most of the infants were injured near a dressing table, in the bedroom used by their mother. The colors of these razors were all bright, except for one achromatic (white) razor. All of the razors had been left uncovered, without their cap, or were left open in the case of hinged razors.

24,24,36294032,"Additives are defined as substances added to food with the aim of preserving and improving safety, freshness, taste, texture, or appearance. While indirect additives can be found in traces in food and come from materials used for packaging, storage, and technological processing of food, direct additives are added to food with a special purpose (canning). The use of additives is justified if it is in accordance with legal regulations and does not pose a health or danger to consumers in the prescribed concentration. However, due to the specificity of the child's metabolic system, there is a greater risk that the negative effects of the additive will manifest. Considering the importance of the potential negative impact of additives on children's health and the increased interest in the control and monitoring of additives in food for children, we have reviewed the latest available literature available through PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Expert data were taken from publicly available documents published from January 2010 to April 2022 by internationally recognized professional organizations. It was found that the most frequently present additives in the food consumed by children are bisphenols, phthalates, perfluoroalkyl chemicals, perchlorates, pesticides, nitrates and nitrites, artificial food colors, monosodium glutamate, and aspartame. Increasing literacy about the presence and potential risk through continuous education of parents and young people as well as active monitoring of newly registered additives and harmonization of existing legal regulations by competent authorities can significantly prevent the unwanted effects of additives on children's health.

Yellow was the most 'drawn to' color and blue the commonest 'favourite' color in all subjects. Yellow was most often associated with a normal mood and grey with an anxious or depressed mood. Different shades of the same color had completely different positive or negative connotations. Reproducibility was exceptionally high when color choice was recorded in positive, neutral or negative terms. The Color Wheel could be used to assess health status, mood or even treatment outcome in a variety of clinical situations. It may also have utility in circumstances where verbal communication may not be optimal, such as with children.

An attempt has been made to measure simultaneously the single drug, acetaminophen (AT), along with the colors, carmoisine (CA), erythrosine (ET), and sunset yellow FCF (SSY) added in it by three derivative spectroscopy methods namely, 1st order, ratio, and differential derivative methods. Moreover, evaluation has been made for the exposure assessment of the colors added as excipient because some colors have been reported to cause allergic reactions and hypersensitivity in children. The present methods provide simple, accurate, and reproducible quantitative determination of the drug, AT, along with the color in synthetic mixtures and commercial drug formulations without any interference. The limit of detection varied from 0.0001-0.31 μg/ml while limit of quantification ranged from 0.002-1.04 μg/ml in all the three methods. The calibration curve of all the three derivative methods exhibited good linear relationship with excellent regression coefficients (0.9986-1.000). Both intra-day and inter-day precisions showed %RSD value less than 2% while the percentage recovery was found between 96.8-103.8%. The sensitivity of the proposed methods is almost comparable to HPLC and thus, can be used for determination of drug AT, and color simultaneously in pharmaceutical formulation on routine basis. The present methods also showed that colors like SSY and ET are saturating more than 50% of acceptable daily intake (ADI) value which is alarming and needs to be considered for modification by regulatory authorities to safeguard the health of children.

35,35,30522380,"Possibilities for Suicide Prevention Through Architecture in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Abstract. In Germany, departments of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry are responsible for the treatment of young people with acute suicidal tendencies. Therefore, it is important to consider means of preventing suicide already during the construction and business operations of these institutions. Approaches to structural suicide prevention can be divided into restrictive and atmospheric-therapeutic measures. The latter includes ways to create an antisuicidal environment and to establish a setting amenable to close support and care by mental-health professionals. Restrictive measures comprise security measures and means of avoiding potential hazards, for example, through life-threatening jumps (e. g., staircases) or intentional strangulation (e. g., employing materials with predetermined breaking points). In addition to security issues, architectural and creative aspects must be incorporated to enable a suicide-preventive atmosphere, that is, satisfying protective needs, creating positive distractions (panoramic views, activities, occupational therapy opportunities), and using positive physiological and natural influences (such as colors and light). Secure access to a pleasant and protected external area as well as exercise spaces is also essential. Architects and construction managers should work closely with the institution's health personnel (e. g., doctors, therapists, and psychiatric nursing staff) during the planning stages for Departments of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in order to come up with solutions that comprise appropriate, practical, and functional requirements and safety-restrictive measures. Thus, an inviting and atmospherically pleasant space can be created that simultaneously provides suicide prevention and protection, where adolescents with psychiatric disorders can be treated by mental-health professionals. Zusammenfassung. Da in Kliniken für Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie auch Jugendliche mit akuter Suizidalität behandelt werden, sind beim Bau und Unterhalt solcher Kliniken suizidpräventive Maßnahmen zu berücksichtigen. Die Ansätze der baulichen Suizidprävention lassen sich in restriktive und atmosphärisch-therapeutische Maßnahmen unterteilen. Letztere umfassen Maßnahmen zur Schaffung eines antisuizidalen Milieus und zur engen Begleitung der Patienten und Patientinnen durch die Mitarbeiter. Unter restriktiven Maßnahmen sind die Sicherung von potenziellen Sprung- sowie die Reduzierung von Strangulationsmöglichkeiten, zum Beispiel durch die Verwendung von Materialien mit Sollbruchstellen, zu verstehen. Neben suizidpräventiver sichernder Gestaltung sind zur Schaffung einer solchen suizidpräventiven Atmosphäre architektonisch-gestalterische Aspekte zu berücksichtigen, wie zum Beispiel Befriedigung des Schutzbedürfnisses, Schaffung positiver Ablenkung (Blick in Natur, Beschäftigungsmöglichkeiten) und die Nutzung positiver physiologischer Wirkung (durch Licht, Farben). Ein gesicherter Zugang zu einem ansprechenden und gleichzeitig geschützten Außenbereich sowie zu Bewegungsräumen ist ebenfalls zu berücksichtigen. Bereits in der Planung einer kinder- und jugendpsychiatrischen Klinik sollten sich Architekten und Bauplaner eng mit Ärzten, Therapeuten und Mitarbeitern des Pflege- und Erziehungsdienstes austauschen und restriktive Maßnahmen hinsichtlich Praktikabilität und funktionellen Abläufen abstimmen. So kann kooperativ ein suizidpräventiver, ebenso sichernder wie atmosphärisch ansprechender altersgerechter Ort entstehen, an dem Jugendliche mit psychischen Störungen mit therapeutischer Unterstützung und fachpflegerisch-pädagogischer Begleitung behandelt werden können.

Children's perceptions of medicine are mostly formed from everyday experience. This can have an impact on children's beliefs about medicines which they are also required to be active and rational medicine users. This study aims to look at children's perceptions and beliefs about medicines, especially in the perspective of medicine efficacy and children's autonomy in using them. The study was conducted with an analytical method with a cross-sectional approach using a questionnaire instrument in grade V elementary school children in Padang City, Indonesia. The total sample size obtained was 503 students. Children still think that medicine efficacy is influenced by taste, colour, size, medicine price, a place to buy medicine and how to get medication. 10.1% of children have stored the medicine at home, and 48.5% of children always depends on waited for their parents when they wanted to take medicine. Regarding children's access to medicines, 11.5% of children have bought their own over-the-counter medicine to a pharmacy or medicine store without the parents' knowledge. 31.4% of children have taken medicine at home without the parents' knowledge. The results of this study indicate that children's perceptions of medicine efficacy are still very limited. Even though the child has used the medicine alone in a limited way, the child's autonomy in using the medicine still needs to be monitored by the parent. Therefore, this is the reason for the need for medical education given to children, especially in schools as an integral part of health education.

Retrospective case-control study. Eighty eyes of 40 normal subjects and 175 eyes of 95 patients with keratoconus. Anterior and posterior corneal elevations were assessed using Orbscan 2. Best-fit sphere maps were drawn with several color-coded scales: 2-, 5-, 10-, and 20-microm height per each color interval. The maps were judged to be abnormal when more than three colors (discriminant number) were found within the central 3-mm area. For each color-coded scale, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and sensitivity + specificity were calculated. After determining the most appropriate color-coded scales for the anterior and posterior elevation maps, validity of the discriminant number was assessed. By varying the discriminant number from two to eight, receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were created using the sensitivity and specificity for each threshold number. The highest sensitivity + specificity values and highly balanced predictive values were obtained with the 10- and 20-microm scales for the anterior and posterior elevation maps, respectively. The ROC curve analyses showed that the best discriminant color number is three, indicating that maps with four or more colors within the central 3-mm area are judged abnormal in screening.

49,49,36321366,"Children of color are diagnosed with autism later than White children. Caregivers of color are also more likely than White caregivers to report that their child's healthcare providers do not treat them as a partner, spend enough time with them, or respect their culture and values. We wanted to better understand the experiences of caregivers of color with the diagnostic process of autism spectrum disorder, from the time they discuss developmental concerns with their child's primary care provider to when the diagnosis is shared with them. We systematically reviewed the literature and found 15 articles that explored the experiences of caregivers of color. Caregivers of color described that they faced large-scale barriers, such as the cost of appointments, transportation, and long wait lists. They also reported negative experiences with providers, including providers not taking their concerns seriously, making assumptions about caregivers, and delaying referrals for an evaluation. Caregivers stated that their own lack of knowledge of autism spectrum disorder, stigma, their family's thoughts and opinions, and cultural differences between providers and caregivers served as barriers during the diagnostic process. Communication challenges were discussed and included use of medical and technical jargon, a lack of follow-up, language barriers, and difficulty obtaining high-quality interpreters. Some families described providers, other individuals, community networks, and self-advocacy as helpful during the diagnostic process. Large-scale changes are needed, such as increases in the number of providers who are trained in diagnosing Autism. Provider-level changes (e.g. implicit bias training) are also important for improving caregivers' experiences.

50,50,27610750,"Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) represents a complementary technique to greyscale and colour Doppler ultrasonography which allows for real-time visualization and characterization of tissue perfusion. Its inherent advantages in the child makes ultrasonography an ideal imaging modality; repeatability and good tolerance along with the avoidance of CT, a source of ionizing radiation, renders ultrasonography imaging desirable. Although currently paediatric CEUS is principally used in an ""off-label"" manner, ultrasonography contrast agents have received regulatory approval for assessment of paediatric focal liver lesions (FLL) in the USA. The safety of ultrasound contrast-agents is well documented in adults, as safe as or even surpassing the safety profile of CT and MR contrast agents. Except for the established intracavitary use of CEUS in voiding urosonography, i.v. paediatric applications have been introduced with promising results in the abdominal trauma initial diagnosis and follow-up, characterization and differential diagnosis of FLL and characterization of lung, pleura, renal and splenic pathology.

Several studies have been conducted on adults, but little is known about children's opinions on colours of medicines and to what extent medicines' colour affects their acceptability. To address this gap, a systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE, and Web of Science was conducted. Two authors independently screened the titles, abstracts, and references of all articles and selected studies conducted on children (0-18 years old), assessing children's preferences or opinions about colour of oral dosage forms as either a primary or secondary objective or as an anecdotal record. A total of 989 publications were identified and, after screening, 18 publications were included in the review. Red and pink were the most liked colours and there appeared to be a relationship between the colour of a medicine and expected taste/flavour. The review also highlighted a scarcity of information, usually collected as an anecdotal record. Several gaps in the current knowledge were underlined, emphasizing the need of patient-centred studies to understand if the use of certain colours can improve or worsen the acceptability of a paediatric medicine. This will help inform pharmaceutical manufacturers and regulators on the role and need of colours in children's medicines beyond quality purposes.

53,53,17945160,"Color is commonly used for branding and coding consumer products including medications. People associate certain colors in tablets and capsules with the effect of the drug and the illness for which it is meant. Color coding was introduced in age-specific prepacked antimalarial drugs for preschool aged children in Nigeria by the National Malaria Control Committee. Yellow was designated for the younger ages and blue for the older. The National Malaria Control Committee did not perform market research to learn how their color codes would be perceived by consumers. The study aimed at determining perceptions of both consumers and sellers of medicines at the community level to learn about color likes and dislikes that might influence acceptance of new color-coded child prepacks of antimalarial drugs. Qualitative methods were used to determine perceptions of drug colors. A series of focus group interviews were conducted with male and female community members, and in-depth interviews were held with medicine sellers in the Igbo-Ora community in southwestern Nigeria. Respondents clearly associated medicines with their effects and purpose, for example white drugs for pain relief, red for building blood, blue to aid sleep, and yellow for malaria treatment. Medicine vendors had a low opinion of white colored medicines, but community members were ultimately more concerned about efficacy. The perceived association between yellow and malaria, because of local symptom perceptions of eyes turning yellowish during malaria, yielded a favorable response when consumers were shown the yellow prepacks. The response to blue was noncommittal but consumers indicated that if they were properly educated on the efficacy and function of the new drugs they would likely buy them. Community members will accept yellow as an antimalarial drug but health education will be needed for promoting the idea of blue for malaria and the notion of age-specific packets. Therefore, the strong medicine vendor-training component that accompanied roll out of these prepacks in the pilot states needs to be replicated nationally.

Hispanic children are disproportionately affected by obesity, but research is needed to better understand culturally specific reasons for providing SSBs to Hispanic children. This exploratory study utilized the Social Ecological Model framework to evaluate Hispanic parents' perceptions of SSBs and serving them to young children. A cross-sectional survey (in English and Spanish) used a national US online panel to recruit a convenience sample of Hispanic parents (N = 350) with young children (aged 1-5 years). Participants reported types of drinks and SSB brands that they served their child in the past month and rated drink healthfulness. Attitude questions assessed individual, community-level, and socio-cultural factors, including normative beliefs, about serving SSBs to young children. Nearly all parents (98%) reported serving their child SSBs in the past month, averaging 6.7 different SSB types. For all categories of SSBs except fruit-flavored drinks, parents who served that type of SSB rated it as significantly healthier than parents who did not serve them. A linear regression model examined associations between individual and socio-cultural factors and number of SSB types served to their child. In the model, higher average rating of SSB healthfulness, child's age, normative beliefs that others serve SSBs to children, being born in the US/Puerto Rico, and parent and child enjoyment of SSBs were positively associated with serving more SSB types, while concerns about SSBs for their own health was negatively related. Language-related acculturation and community-level factors assessed were not significant. Public health initiatives should focus on healthfulness misperceptions of some SSB categories and address normative beliefs to help reduce serving SSBs to Hispanic children.

Since 2004, Taiwan has implemented a national screening program that uses an infant stool color card (SCC) for the early detection of BA. The purpose of this study was to examine the outcomes of BA cases before and after the launch of this screening program. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the rates of hospitalization, liver transplantation (LT), and mortality of BA cases before and after the program, and to examine the association between the hospitalization rate and survival outcomes.This was a population-based cohort study. BA cases born during 1997 to 2010 were identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Sex, birth date, hospitalization date, LT, and death data were collected and analyzed. The hospitalization rate by 2 years of age (Hosp/2yr) was calculated to evaluate its association with the outcomes of LT or death.Among 513 total BA cases, 457 (89%) underwent the Kasai procedure. Of these, the Hosp/2yr was significantly reduced from 6.0 to 6.9/case in the earlier cohort (1997-2004) to 4.9 to 5.3/case in the later cohort (2005-2010). This hospitalization rate reduction was followed by a reduction in mortality from 26.2% to 15.9% after 2006. The Cox proportional hazards model showed a significant increase in the risk for both LT (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10-1.18) and death (HR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.01-1.08) for each additional hospitalization. A multivariate logistic regression model found that cases with a Hosp/2yr >6 times had a significantly higher risk for both LT (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 4.35, 95% CI = 2.82-6.73) and death (aOR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.17-2.62).The hospitalization and mortality rates of BA cases in Taiwan were significantly and coincidentally reduced after the launch of the SCC screening program.

62,62,28099296,"Accurate weight estimation is important for calculating appropriate medication dosages, determining rates of fluid replacement, and selecting correct equipment sizes in critically ill children requiring resuscitation. The actual measurement of the weight of a critically ill or injured child is often not possible. The Broselow Pediatric Emergency Tape (BT) is an important tool for predicting a child's weight based on his/her height. Although BT has previously been validated, given the increasing prevalence of obesity in today's society, it behooves clinicians relying on this resuscitation aid to revisit the issue. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the color-coded BT in weight estimation and the influence of obesity on its accuracy. This is a retrospective study conducted in a pediatric clinic of urban hospital. This study reviewed the medical records of children up to 96 months of age, who presented during 2008-2010. We recorded the child's age (in months), actual (measured) weight (in kilograms), and height (in centimeters). Based on the height, weight estimation was obtained using the color-coded BT. The actual weight was compared with the predicted weight obtained by the height-based BT. Patients presenting with any medical condition that would substantially affect growth of the child were excluded. A univariate logistic regression model was utilized to predict any underestimation based on age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) percentile. The medical records of 538 children were reviewed. There was a discrepancy in 226 children (42%). Broselow Pediatric Emergency Tape underestimated weight (measured weight was higher than predicted weight) in 158 children (29.4%) and overestimated (measured weight was lower than predicted weight) in 68 children (12.6%). Of the 158 underestimated children, 138 were off by 1 color zone, 16 by 2 color zones, and 4 by more than 2 color zones. When characterized by BMI, 46 children (13.6%) had normal BMI, 27 (45.8%) were overweight, and 84 (80.8%) were obese, whereas one child (2.8%) was underweight. In our population, BT was inaccurate in predicting weight in 42% of children (underestimation in 158 children [29.4%] and overestimation weight in 68 children [12.6%]). However, the majority of discrepancies involved only 1 BT color zone. Emergency physicians should be aware of this discrepancy until more accurate methods become available.

63,63,36399776,"Reducing the burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) is one of the top priorities of public health policies worldwide. One of the recognized means of achieving this objective is to improve the diet quality. The Nutri-Score (N-S) is a [five-color-A, B, C, D, E letters] front-of-pack labeling logo intended to help consumers quickly identify the healthier prepackaged foods within a food category. Available studies have shown that the N-S is an efficient tool to achieve this aim in terms of consumers' awareness, perception, understanding, and purchasing and that its use may help to reduce the prevalence of NCDs. The N-S is currently implemented on a voluntary basis in 7 European countries and a discussion is underway within the European Commission to achieve a harmonized mandatory label. However, no study on the putative impact of the N-S on children's dietary patterns and health is available. The N-S is not applicable to infants' and young children's formulas and to specific baby foods, the compositions of which are already laid down in European Union regulations. The N-S does not replace age-appropriate dietary guidelines. As children consume an increasing number of adult type and processed foods, the relevance of the N-S for children should be evaluated considering the children's high specific requirements, especially in younger children.

COVID-19 protocols have resulted in increased provision of telehealth in integrated primary care (IPC) but little is known about pediatric telehealth IPC utilization during the pandemic for diverse and traditionally underserved groups. A comparative study was conducted to explore variability between in-person (pre-COVID-19; n = 106) and telehealth (mid-COVID-19; n = 120) IPC consultation utilization among children 1-19 years old served through a large, inner-city primary care clinic. Logistic regression modeling was used to examine the association between service delivery modality (i.e., in-person vs. telehealth) and attendance, referral concerns, and several sociodemographic variables. Service delivery modality and attendance, referral concerns, and race/ethnicity were significantly associated. The odds of non-attendance were greater for children scheduled for telehealth, the odds of children with internalizing problems being scheduled for telehealth were greater than those with externalizing problems, and the odds of Black children being scheduled for telehealth were less compared to White children. Though telehealth has helped provide IPC continuity during COVID-19, findings from this study show troubling preliminary data regarding reduced attendance, increased internalizing concerns, and disparities in scheduling for Black patients. Specific actions to monitor and address these early but alarming indications of telehealth and Covid-19 related behavioral health disparities are discussed.

The color-word matching Stroop task (cwmStroop) differs from the traditional Stroop task in ways that make it easy to administer, and it enables the examiners to analyze reaction time. It is expected that the cwmStroop and Go/NoGo tasks will be useful as clinical assessments for children with developmental disorders and in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. The objectives of this study were to elucidate the pattern of developmental change in cwmStroop scores and Go/NoGo scores and to determine whether and how cwmStroop scores are related to Go/NoGo scores. The subjects consisted of 108 healthy Japanese children aged 6-14 years. We found that cwmStroop and Go/NoGo scores displayed clear developmental changes between 6 and 14 years of age. The children's scores on the 2 tasks followed different developmental courses, however, and the correlation between scores on the two tasks was weak on the whole. These results indicate that the cwmStroop and Go/NoGo tasks tap different aspects of selective attention and response inhibition. Therefore it is expected that the combination of both tests will be useful in the multifaceted assessment of selective attention and response inhibition in childhood.

68,68,26467146,"Sonoelastography is a novel technique that uses ultrasound waves to assess the elasticity of tissues noninvasively. It provides an ultrasound-based method to detect and display the relative stiffness of tissue. The main principle of sonoelastography is the measurement of tissue distortion in response to external compression. Changes in elasticity and tissue deformation elicited by compression are measured, processed and then shown in real time presentation with color-coded elastograms. One of the most important applications of sonoelastography is the evaluation of liver diseases, mainly liver fibrosis assessment and staging. Although in terms of definite diagnosis the liver biopsy still remains the golden standard, elastography seems to be a very inexpensive, repeatable and noninvasive method to evaluate most of liver conditions. The technique is also applicable in detection and differential diagnosis of focal lesions. It provides better imaging information and therefore more accurate evaluation of the lesions nature, e.g. in liver, lymphatic nodes or thyroid gland. Most of the applications mentioned above are well known and have been described in details in adults. Similarly, most of sonoelastographic studies are based on groups of adults. The purpose of this review article is to bring this technology closer to pediatric clinicians and to summarize some of its current clinical applications that are being pursued.

We evaluated the performance of a low technology, thin layer agar, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) culture color plate (TB-CX) test with concurrent drug susceptibility testing (DST) to isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), and pyrazinamide (PZA) directly from sputum specimens. Patients undergoing examination for TB and multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB were enrolled in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from March 2016 to February 2017. All subjects received a GeneXpert MTB/RIF PCR test. TB-CX test results were compared to reference Löwenstein-Jensen (LJ) culture for M.tb detection and DST for susceptibility to INH and RIF. Kappa statistic was applied to test agreement between results for TB-CX test and the reference methods, a cut-off Kappa value of 0.75 was considered as high level of agreements. A total of 137 participants were analyzed: 88 (64%) were new TB cases, 49 (36%) were re-treatment cases. The TB-CX test detected M.tb and DST in an average of 13 days compared to 50 days for the conventional DST result. The sensitivity and specificity of the TB-CX test for detecting M.tb were 94% and 98%, respectively (concordance, 96%; kappa 0.91). The sensitivity of the TB-CX test to detect drug resistance to INH, RIF, and MDR-TB was 91%, 100%, and 90% respectively. The specificity of the TB-CX test for detecting INH, RIF, and MDR-TB was 94%, 40%, and 94% respectively. Overall agreement between TB-CX test and LJ DST for detection of MDR-TB was 93%. The TB-CX test showed strong agreement with the GeneXpert test for detecting M.tb (89%, kappa 0.76) but low agreement for the detection of RIF resistance (57%, kappa 0.28).

The prosthetic ear is aesthetically pleasing, composed of natural looking anatomical contours, shape, and texture along with good color that blends with surrounding existing skin. These outcomes can be optimized by the integration of digital technologies in the construction process. This report describes a sequential process of reconstructing a missing left ear by digital technologies. Two implants were planned for placement in the left mastoid region utilizing specialist biomedical software (Materialise, Belgium). The implant positions were determined underneath the thickest portion (of anti-helix area) left ear that is virtually simulated by means of mirror imaging of the right ear. A surgical stent recording the implant positions was constructed and used in implant fixtures placement. Implants were left for eight weeks, after which they were loaded with abutments and an irreversible silicone impression was taken to record their positions. The right existing ear was virtually segmented using the patient CT scan and then mirror imaged to produce a left ear, which was then printed using 3D printer (Z Corp, USA). The left ear was then duplicated in wax which was fitted over the defect side. Then, it was conventionally flasked. Skin color was digitalized using spectromatch skin color system (London, UK). The resultant silicone color was mixed as prescribed and then packed into the mold. The silicone was cured conventionally. Ear was trimmed and fitted and there was no need for any extrinsic coloring. The prosthetic ear was an exact match to the existing right ear in shape, skin color, and orientation due to the great advantages of technologies employed. Additionally, these technologies saved time and provided a base for reproducible results regardless of operator.

75,75,20139669,"Physical abuse of children is a severe social problem and is usually identified by the presence of bruises of various ages. The visual appearance of bruises is widely used to identify victims of abuse. Therefore, to objectively evaluate the age of bruises, we used a spectrophotometer to examine 86 bruises that occurred accidentally in healthy child volunteers, with consent from appropriate guardians. The bruise color was measured using a spectrophotometer and plotted using the CIE-L*a*b* color system, a method that expresses color numerically. The differences [Delta] in L* (lightness), a* (red and green content) and b* (yellow and blue content) color values relative to neighboring healthy/unbruised skin were measured for 7-10 days until the bruise disappeared. A characteristic pattern was observed in 21 bruises; DeltaL* increased from the negative peak and returned to baseline, Deltaa* decreased from the positive peak to baseline, and Deltab* increased above baseline and then slowly returned to baseline. The pattern of these color changes could be classified into three phases according to the time between bruising and the peak values for DeltaL* (negative peak, 38.9 +/- 19.5 hours), Deltaa* (positive peak, 37.6 +/- 21.7 hours), and Deltab* (negative and positive peak, 43.5 +/- 18.7 and 132.6 +/- 40.4 hours). Thus, spectrophotometric measurement of the color of bruises is helpful to estimate the approximate age of bruises and to distinguish between old and new bruises.

76,76,35943256,"When the illumination falling on a surface change, so does the reflected light. Despite this, adult observers are good at perceiving surfaces as relatively unchanging-an ability termed colour constancy. Very few studies have investigated colour constancy in infants, and even fewer in children. Here we asked whether there is a difference in colour constancy between children and adults; what the developmental trajectory is between six and 11 years; and whether the pattern of constancy across illuminations and reflectances differs between adults and children. To this end, we developed a novel, child-friendly computer-based object selection task. In this, observers saw a dragon's favourite sweet under a neutral illumination and picked the matching sweet from an array of eight seen under a different illumination (blue, yellow, red, or green). This set contained a reflectance match (colour constant; perfect performance) and a tristimulus match (colour inconstant). We ran two experiments, with two-dimensional scenes in one and three-dimensional renderings in the other. Twenty-six adults and 33 children took part in the first experiment; 26 adults and 40 children took part in the second. Children performed better than adults on this task, and their performance decreased with age in both experiments. We found differences across illuminations and sweets, but a similar pattern across both age groups. This unexpected finding might reflect a real decrease in colour constancy from childhood to adulthood, explained by developmental changes in the perceptual and cognitive mechanisms underpinning colour constancy, or differences in task strategies between children and adults. HIGHLIGHTS: Six- to 11-year-old children demonstrated better performance than adults on a colour constancy object selection task. Performance decreased with age over childhood. These findings may indicate development of cognitive strategies used to overcome automatic colour constancy mechanisms.

Considering a 2 × 2 factorial design, 504 children were randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 arms: placebo VA and placebo iron supplement; high-dose vitamin VA and placebo iron supplement; iron supplement and placebo VA; and iron and high-dose vitamin VA supplements. Cognitive development was assessed using Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices, digit span, Tower of London, and visual search tasks. The mean [± standard deviation (SD)] age of the enrolled children was 9.6 (±1.6) y. One-fifth of the children had iron deficiency or anemia, whereas 2.9%, 3.9%, and 12.1% of children had low iron stores, iron deficiency anemia, and VA deficiency, respectively. Intermittent iron supplementation did not result in any significant improvement of children's cognitive development and had a negative effect on the performance index of the visual search task compared with placebo (-0.17 SD, 95% confidence interval: -0.32, -0.02). Effects were evident among children with stunting, thinness, or children coming from understimulating home environments.

However, innovative and creative US approaches as well as new US techniques such as amplitude-coded color Doppler, harmonic and high-resolution imaging, and US contrast media or three-dimensional US have been introduced over the past decade and significantly broadened the potential of US. Thus, now, the role of US has been widened in many conditions and queries, and US today may well play a more pronounced and essential role in modern imaging algorithms at still relatively low cost, with sufficient diagnostic accuracy and conspicuity. Particularly in the pediatric setting, these new capabilities are applicable in many queries and almost all body regions and should be used to reduce the number of more invasive or radiating and relatively costly examinations that often additionally need some sedation or intravenous iodinated contrast material.

84,84,32341129,"In 1913, eccentric French composer Erik Satie wrote a fragmentary, diary-like essay where he depicted a strikingly rigid diet consisting solely of white foods: eggs, sugar, coconuts, rice, cream cheese, fuchsia juice and so on. Satie's brief essay has later been used as one of many puzzle pieces in attempts to retrospectively diagnose him with autism spectrum disorder. With Satie's white meal as a starting point, this paper explores colour-based food preferences and selective eating in clinical and non-clinical populations, with a special focus on autism spectrum disorder and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). General colour preferences and their causes as well as the impact of colour on taste and food identification are also explored. Selective eating during childhood is immensely common and does not generally lead to disordered eating in the long run, although subgroups may experience rigidity around food of a more enduring nature. Problems related to eating were repeatedly described in Kanner's original 1943 autism case series and continue to be common in autism. Most studies on eating and sensory sensitivity in autism show that the texture and consistency of the food are the most common factors behind selective eating. In contrast, colour-based food preferences appear to be relatively rare, although numerous anecdotal reports exist. Foods that are white or colourless may be particularly appealing or tolerable for individuals with sensory hypersensitivity, which can occur in autism or ARFID. Ultimately, in the case of Erik Satie, this paper concludes that his description of a strictly white diet should not be read as an autobiographical account but rather as an ironic take on contemporary symbolist literature, with the famously decadent all-black dinner party in French novelist Joris-Karl Huysmans'  ",84,"Eggs, sugar, grated bones: colour-based food preferences in autism, eating disorders, and beyond",Strand M.,Med Humanit. 2021 Mar;47(1):87-94. doi: 10.1136/medhum-2019-011811.

85,85,31562252,"Universal screening is recommended to reduce the age of diagnosis for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, there are insufficient data on children who screen negative and no study of outcomes from truly universal screening. With this study, we filled these gaps by examining the accuracy of universal screening with systematic follow-up through 4 to 8 years. Universal, primary care-based screening was conducted using the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers with Follow-Up (M-CHAT/F) and supported by electronic administration and integration into electronic health records. All children with a well-child visit (1) between 16 and 26 months, (2) at a Children's Hospital of Philadelphia site after universal electronic screening was initiated, and (3) between January 2011 and July 2015 were included ( Nearly universal screening was achieved (91%), and ASD prevalence was 2.2%. Overall, the M-CHAT/F's sensitivity was 38.8%, and its positive predictive value (PPV) was 14.6%. Sensitivity was higher in older toddlers and with repeated screenings, whereas PPV was lower in girls. Finally, the M-CHAT/F's specificity and PPV were lower in children of color and those from lower-income households. Universal screening in primary care is possible when supported by electronic administration. In this ""real-world"" cohort that was systematically followed, the M-CHAT/F was less accurate in detecting ASD than in previous studies. Disparities in screening rates and accuracy were evident in traditionally underrepresented groups. Future research should focus on the development of new methods that detect a greater proportion of children with ASD and reduce disparities in the screening process.

Storytelling is an important tradition for AIAN communities that can function as an intervention modality. To support the needs of AIAN children and caregivers, we (a collaborative workgroup of Indigenous health researchers) developed a culturally grounded storybook that provides pandemic-related public health guidance and mental health coping strategies woven with Inter-Tribal values and teachings. A collaborative workgroup, representing diverse tribal affiliations, met via four virtual meetings in early 2021 to discuss evolving COVID-19 pandemic public health guidance, community experiences and responses to emerging challenges, and how to ground the story in shared AIAN cultural strengths. We developed and distributed a brief survey for caregivers to evaluate the resulting book. The workgroup iteratively reviewed versions of the storyline until reaching a consensus on the final text. An AI artist from the workgroup created illustrations to accompany the text.

Previous research has indicated that color has a variety of cognitive, physiological, and behavioral effects on individuals, differentiating their performance. However, there is a gap in understanding the influence of color on performance on VR cognitive tasks. An understanding of how stimulus color wavelength influences human performance could enhance the control over the design and interpretation of assessment and training outcomes in VR. Participants (n = 99, 57 males, aged 18 to 33 years) were recruited from the University of Houston and surrounding areas. Participants completed a VR-based Go/No-Go task. In this task, participants were instructed to strike 3D shape stimuli only if they matched the color of one of 2 virtual sabers that participants hand in their hands in VR (""Go"" trials). If neither virtual saber matched the presented shape color (""No-Go"" trials), participants were instructed not to respond. Stimulus colors could be violet (407 nm), blue (478 nm), green (507 nm), yellow (612 nm), and red (679 nm). Participants' reaction times and accuracy were recorded. The study design and procedures were approved by the University of Houston's Institutional Review Board. Stimulus color wavelength had a significant influence on accuracy during the Go/No-Go saber color match condition task. In both Go and No-Go trials, longer wavelengths were associated with reduced accuracy. However, no significant findings on wavelength and reaction time were present. These findings emphasize the impact of stimulus color on task performance. Shorter color wavelengths were associated with higher accuracy in a VR Go/No-Go task. These findings support the importance of color selection in VR tasks and trainings, especially in scenarios that include decision-making and require accuracy. Realistic colors encountered in real-life military operations into VR training environments may better prepare individuals for real-world challenges. Future research in this area could explore color effects in additional tasks and incorporate realistic color-based cues in VR training scenarios.

However, previous studies on mHealth apps for children older than 7 years old with asthma are limited, and most studies on asthma apps do not consider interactions involving communication between children and caregivers. Therefore, a prototype mHealth child asthma app was developed for children and their caregivers, with features of tailored feedback messages in continuing self-management and interactions between children and caregivers. The aim of this study was to identify the beneficial features of a prototype mHealth app developed for children with asthma and their caregivers. Children diagnosed with persistent asthma by allergy specialists at the National Center for Child Health and Development were recruited. The features of a prototype mHealth app for children with asthma and their caregivers were investigated using semistructured interviews after they tried the app. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Content-characteristic words were named and grouped together as categories to explore themes. We recruited 27 children with asthma aged 2 to 12 years and 26 their caregivers. Findings on the good aspects of the app for children older than 7 years old and caregivers suggested 4 themes (confirmation of asthma knowledge, child-caregiver interaction, design of the app, and child's interest), and 6 categories were identified. Findings on the good aspects of app for children 7 to 12 years old and caregivers suggested 5 themes (new knowledge, manga as a Japanese-style comic, child's interest, trigger of self-management, and design and operability), and 11 categories were identified. Findings on the beneficial features of app suggested 6 themes (asthma knowledge, elements for continuous, universal design, notification, monitoring, and functions), and 12 categories were identified. Children with asthma and their caregivers perceived that the good aspects of the app were learning asthma knowledge with fun, including manga; interaction between child and caregiver; and easy-to-read design, such as colors.

93,93,30558463,"Lino Castle - An interior design concept to improve inpatient treatment in child and adolescent psychiatry Abstract. Only very few data exist concerning hospital architecture in psychiatry/child and adolescent psychiatry. Previous data suggest that architectural improvements do reduce the application of coercive measures as well as reducing aggressive behavior, endangerment of self and others, and provoking changes in the kind and frequency of medication. In order to improve the overall hospital environment of inpatient treatment, the Center for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of Clienia Littenheid AG developed a spatial and communication concept named ""Lino Castle."" In cooperation with patients, their parents as well as members of the multidisciplinary team, we implemented a concept that serves to ameliorate the recovery process of the children and adolescents. ""Lino Castle"" is deeply rooted in the history of the local village and aims to allow patients to feel at ease for the duration of their stay. It hosts seven characters that serve as guardians and protectors of the individual wards and represent various types of disorders and emotional states. The respective architectural concept grew out of the storyline of ""Lino Castle"" and combines colors, forms, materials, graphics, and furniture to ensure an environment conducive to healing and reduced anxiety. With the implementation of ""Lino Castle,"" we observed that the number of admissions and hospital occupancy increased significantly, whereas the length of stay and the ratio of involuntary admissions in closed wards decreased. We presume that this turn of events is due to higher commitment, acceptance, and less aggressive behavior in the patients, and to higher motivation and work satisfaction in the staff. Zusammenfassung. Es gibt nur wenige Daten über Krankenhausarchitektur in psychiatrischen Kliniken. Die bisherigen Daten weisen darauf hin, dass architektonische Verbesserungen die Anwendung von Zwangsmaßnahmen verringern und zu einer Verminderung von aggressivem Verhalten, Selbst- und Fremdgefährdung und einer Veränderung in der Art und Häufigkeit einer Medikation führen. Mit dem Ziel, die Krankenhausumgebung der stationären Behandlung zu verbessern, hat das Zentrum für Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie und -psychotherapie der Clienia Littenheid AG das Raum- und Kommunikationskonzept „Burg Lino“ entwickelt. Gemeinsam mit den Patientinnen und Patienten, ihren Eltern und den Mitarbeitenden des multidisziplinären Teams entstand ein Konzept, das den Genesungsprozess von Kindern und Jugendlichen unterstützen und ihnen den stationären Aufenthalt erleichtern soll. Das architektonische Raumkonzept leitet sich aus der Geschichte von „Burg Lino“ ab und vereinigt Farben, Formen, Materialien, Grafiken und Möbel, um einen Genesungsprozess anzustoßen und eine angstreduzierende Umgebung zu schaffen. Mit Umsetzung von „Burg Lino“ stellten wir eine signifikante Zunahme stationärer Aufnahmen und der Belegung fest. Die Verweildauern und der Anteil der Behandlungstage unfreiwilliger Aufnahmen im fakultativ geschlossenen Bereich nahmen hingegen ab.

101,101,25039829,"This review analyses the literature on screening for congenital colour vision deficiency in school students, which predominantly uses the Ishihara test. The review was framed with respect to the established Wilson and Jungner criteria for screening programs. These criteria relate to the characteristics of the condition concerned, the performance of the screening test, the existence of treatment options and the performance of screening programs. The literature reviewed suggests that congenital colour vision deficiency has not been shown to increase risk of road traffic crashes and is not a preclusion to driver licensing in most developed countries. The occurrence of congenital colour vision deficiency has been used to limit entry into certain occupations; however, the value of screening school students with regard to occupational preclusion is questionable. Stronger evidence exists indicating no association between congenital colour vision deficiency and level of educational achievement. Studies showing any association between congenital colour vision deficiency and other health and lifestyle impacts were rare. The most commonly used screening test (using Ishihara pseudoisochromatic plates) performs well with respect to detecting red-green colour vision deficiencies. Finally, the only interventions we identified for congenital colour vision deficiency were management ones around the availability of specific tinted lenses and computer programs to aid colour perception in certain tasks. Given this picture, the weight of evidence appears to be in favour of not adopting (or discontinuing) routine colour vision screening programs for school students; however, it may be worthwhile for a career advisor to refer school students to an optometrist or ophthalmologist for colour vision screening, upon expression of interest in an occupation where normal colour vision is either particularly desirable or is a regulatory requirement.

Novel medication delivery systems that may reduce dosing errors resonate with national healthcare priorities. Our goal was to evaluate novel, prefilled medication syringes labeled with color-coded volumes corresponding to the weight-based dosing of the Broselow Tape, compared to conventional medication administration, in simulated prehospital pediatric resuscitation scenarios. We performed a prospective, block-randomized, cross-over study, where 10 full-time paramedics each managed two simulated pediatric arrests in situ using either prefilled, color-coded syringes (intervention) or their own medication kits stocked with conventional ampoules (control). Each paramedic was paired with two emergency medical technicians to provide ventilations and compressions as directed. The ambulance patient compartment and the intravenous medication port were video recorded. Data were extracted from video review by blinded, independent reviewers. Median time to delivery of all doses for the intervention and control groups was 34 (95% CI: 28-39) seconds and 42 (95% CI: 36-51) seconds, respectively (difference=9 [95% CI: 4-14] seconds).

Despite the paucity of studies on cognitive remediation (CR) in children, preliminary results have suggested, as in adults with schizophrenia, good compliance and optimization of executive functioning. Consequently, programs dedicated to young subjects were developed in English-speaking countries, and the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry of Sainte Anne Hospital (Paris) developed a new CR program for children with attention deficit disorder, academic problems, or eating disorders. These programs complete the field of CRT proposed by Sainte Anne Hospital's Remediation and Psychosocial Rehabilitation Reference Center, initially designed for adults with schizophrenia. Our team used and adapted validated tools such as Delahunty and Wykes's CRT program (translated and validated in French by Amado and Franck) and Lindvall and Lask's CRT Resource Pack. One program was developed for an adolescent with anorexia nervosa and applied to the subject and her family, but the purpose of this paper is to present a CR approach for children with attention deficit disorder or academic disorder, a 6-month program based on paper-pencil tasks and board and card games. The team was trained in different kinds of cognitive remediation, and the program was applied by a clinical nurse with the supervision of a child and adolescent psychiatrist and the department's neuropsychologists. Paper-pencil tasks were adapted from the CRT program for adults; the card and board games used were geometric figures, illusions, Rush Hour(®), Set(®), Jungle Speed(®), Color Addict(®), etc. These games are available in stores and the program can be applied at home, which helps families set aside their preoccupations with their child's academic performance. Diagnostic and neuropsychological evaluations were done before the beginning of the therapy and repeated at the end of the 6-month program. This program does not ignore the metapsychological impact of the therapy, and work on self-esteem is also done. The presence of the therapist is necessary, which seems better than a computer program, which cannot encourage the young subject in the same personalized and empathetic way. We therefore conducted the first clinical feasibility trial of cognitive remediation in young subjects and present a clinical case of a 6-year-old boy with attention deficit disorder and academic disorder. The results of neuropsychological evaluations before and after therapy suggest improvement in executive functions and better self-esteem. Satisfaction for the boy and his family was high. Even if these results need to be replicated, cognitive remediation appears to be a new therapeutic tool, complementary to classical approaches used in childhood psychiatric disorders. The Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry will submit this program to a research program conducted by the National Health Department to study the impact of this approach in a controlled study.

We aimed to assess parental knowledge and perceptions of the use of AAPs in managing their child's asthma. In 2023 we conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess knowledge and perceptions of AAPs in parents/caregivers of children aged 0-17 years with asthma who had an AAP and attended respiratory clinics at Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick. The questionnaire included parental perceptions on the utility of AAPs, parental asthma management self-efficacy (PAMSE), and an adapted version of the Asthma Action Plan Knowledge Interview tool (AAPKI). Descriptive statistics and regression analyses were used to assess associations between AAPKI, PAMSE and other outcomes. Seventy-one parents completed the survey. Mean PAMSE score was 4.2/5 (SD 0.5). Median AAPKI score was 70.2% out of 100% (IQR 20.4%). Most parents (80.0%, n = 56) were satisfied/very satisfied with using AAPs to manage their child's asthma. Most agreed/strongly agreed that AAPs were helpful in knowing when to seek medical attention for their child's asthma (81.7%, n = 58), helped their understanding of asthma severity (81.7%, n = 58), and increased their confidence in asthma management (76.0%, n = 54). Over half of parents (55.7%, n = 39) would prefer AAPs digitally and majority (78.6%, n = 55) would like colour-coded AAPs. High levels of AAP knowledge and self-efficacy scores were demonstrated. Most parents expressed understanding of the benefits of AAPs. Our findings suggest parents of children with asthma prefer AAPs in colour and in digital version which may help guide standardisation of AAPs across Australia.

123,123,26514929,"Medical students and residents in training have limited opportunities to develop pediatric endoscopy skills and would benefit from a realistic simulation model. We sought to develop such a model for flexible endoscopy using fresh head and neck tissue from young sheep. Tissue was collected from pre-pubescent sheep (n=5; mean age: 4 months; mean mass: 28kg) following humane euthanasia at the end of an in vivo protocol. No live animals were used in this study. The head and neck of the sheep were disarticulated 4-6cm above the sternal notch and stored at 5°C for 1-5 days. With the preparation was supported in supine position, flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscopy and transnasal endoscopic intubation were performed with video recording. Five sheep were studied. Endoscopy was performed by a medical student under direct supervision by a pediatric otolaryngologist. Differences between ovine and human pediatric airway anatomy were defined. Despite variations in proportion and structure, the experience of passing a flexible nasopharyngoscope through a sheep's airway is remarkably similar to pediatric endoscopy. The nasal anatomy is elongated, but very much like a child's in terms of anatomy, color and texture. The tactile feedback is nearly identical. Annoying secretions and their associated ""whiteout"" phenomena nicely simulate these challenges in pediatric endoscopy.

124,124,39146229,"Care navigation support is designed to help connect families with health care resources. Given that children with autism have more unmet needs than their peers, such a service may be especially valuable to families who have recently received a diagnosis. This study sought to examine engagement in care navigation support after an autism telehealth evaluation. Specifically, we report on what demographic and diagnostic factors predicted engagement in care navigation support and satisfaction with this service. Care navigation was offered to 220 families receiving autism telehealth evaluations between April 2020 and April 2022. Survey data from initial evaluation appointments and 2 follow-up care navigation meetings (approximately 1-3 months and approximately 9-12 months after evaluation), along with data from medical records, were collected and analyzed to determine whether any traits predicted engagement in care navigation. Satisfaction with care navigation was also analyzed. Of 220 families, 48.2% (n = 106) participated in a care navigation meeting within 1 to 3 months after an evaluation and 59.5% (n = 131) participated in at least 1 meeting across 2 time periods. The findings did not support the hypothesis that a diagnosis of autism would predict engagement. Analyses found that child sex (female compared with male) and child race and ethnicity (children of color compared with White children) predicted engagement. For those who engaged in care navigation, high satisfaction was reported.

125,125,28652355,"Migraineurs avoid light because it intensifies their headache. However, this is not the only reason for their aversion to light. Studying migraineurs and control subjects, we found that lights triggered more changes in autonomic functions and negative emotions during, rather than in the absence of, migraine or in control subjects, and that the association between light and positive emotions was stronger in control subjects than migraineurs. Seeking to define a neuroanatomical substrate for these findings, we showed that, in rats, axons of retinal ganglion cells converge on hypothalamic neurons that project directly to nuclei in the brainstem and spinal cord that regulate parasympathetic and sympathetic functions and contain dopamine, histamine, orexin, melanin-concentrating hormone, oxytocin, and vasopressin. Although the rat studies define frameworks for conceptualizing how light triggers the symptoms described by patients, the human studies suggest that the aversive nature of light is more complex than its association with headache intensification.

This study is a prospective, blinded, multicentre case series. This study included two groups: an adult group (n=268 eyes) and a paediatric group (n=168 eyes). Sickle cell disease (SCD) types included haemoglobin S homozygous (HbSS), haemoglobin S and C (HbSC) and Hb S with β-thalassaemia (HbSß-Thal). Participants underwent DFE and UWFI. Each eye received three independent grades (1-4), documented by three graders: clinical grader, image grader 1 and image grader 2. Three clinically relevant diagnostic thresholds were determined. Based on these thresholds, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for all three graders were calculated relative to each other as reference tests. HbSC was associated with the most advanced SCR grades. When compared to the clinical grader, image grader 1 and image grader 2 consistently detected more SCR and higher SCR grades in both adult and paediatric groups. In both groups, image grader 1 and image grader 2 identified twice as many cases of capillary occlusion/anastomosis than clinical grader. To detect the presence of any proliferative SCR, image grader 1 and image grader 2 had a sensitivity of 82%, 71% in the paediatrics group and 90% and 72% in the adult group. The clinical grader sensitivity was 52% in the paediatrics group and 53% in the adult group. The UWFI is a sensitive tool to screen for SCR.

127,127,32710507,"Little is known about how racial/ethnic differences may influence attributions for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and subsequent vaccine hesitancy, the latter of which refers to a continuum of concerns about vaccine safety that may lead to vaccine delays and/or refusals. Two hundred and twenty-five parents of children with ASD who were enrolled in the SPARK cohort (Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research for Knowledge) completed the Parent Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines survey and the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire. 28.9% of respondents (n = 65) were vaccine hesitant (PACV score ≥ 50). Significant differences were observed between proportions of vaccine-hesitant parents (VHP) in the White sample and combined samples of color (Asian, Black, Latinx, Multiracial, and Other): 22.8% of the White sample (n = 39) versus 48.1% of the samples of color (n = 26). White, non-hesitant parents more often agreed with the child's brain structure as a cause of their child's ASD, while White, VHP more often agreed with the deterioration of the child's immunity as a cause. All VHP (regardless of race) agreed more often with diet, their own decisions, and vaccines as causes. VHP of color more often agreed with accident or injury, environmental pollution, their own general stress, and their own emotional state as causes. Future work should examine this phenomenon in larger, diverse samples to further understand differences across specific racial/ethnic groups. LAY SUMMARY: Some parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are vaccine hesitant, meaning they have concerns about vaccine safety and may delay/refuse vaccines. We examined possible racial/ethnic differences related to how common vaccine hesitancy is and which causes of ASD were typically endorsed among a sample of caregivers in the SPARK cohort (Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research for Knowledge). Higher proportions of parents of color were vaccine hesitant, and all vaccine-hesitant parents agreed that ""toxins in vaccines"" were a cause of their child's ASD.

We enrolled children ages 0-14 years from the emergency department of a free-standing, academic children's hospital. We obtained sex, body habitus, true weight, true height, BT colour, and experimental heights. We converted experimental height measurements into weight estimates using standardised growth charts. We calculated Pearson correlations between experimental and actual measurements and the percentages of weight estimates within 10% and 20% of true weights. We repeated analyses on a restricted cohort of children 0-11 years, the intended BT age range. We enrolled 198 children. The laser, optical device and BT weight estimates had strong positive correlations with the actual weight measurements with Pearson's correlation coefficients of 0.946, p < 0.0001, 0.965, p < 0.0001, and 0.825, p < 0.0001 respectively. 47.8% of optical weight estimates fell within 10% of actual weight and 80.6% within 20%, compared to 40.5% and 75.4% of laser estimates and 39.8% and 65.1% of BT estimates.

Vision screening must focus on pre-school children if the aim of the screening is to detect and treat conditions that may lead to amblyopia, whereas if the aim is to detect and correct significant refractive errors (not likely to lead to amblyopia) then it would be expedient for the optometric profession to act as the major provider of refractive (and colour vision) screening at 5-6 years of age. Myopia is the refractive error most likely to develop during primary school presenting typically between 8 and 12 years of age, thus screening at entry to secondary school is warranted.

Children, especially younger ones, communicate better through pictures than verbally. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the usefulness of drawings of the child's headache in the diagnostic process carried out by a pediatrician and a pediatric neurologist. At the beginning of a visit in a neurological clinic, or on the first day of hospitalization, the child was asked, ""Please draw your headache,"" or ""How do you feel your headache?"" without any additional explanations or suggestions. Clinical diagnosis of headache type was made on the basis of the standard diagnostic evaluation. For the purpose of this study, children's headaches were categorized as migraine, tension-type headache, or ""the others."" One hundred twenty-four drawings of children with headaches were analyzed by 8 pediatricians and 8 pediatric neurologists. The analysts were unaware of the clinical history, age, sex, and diagnosis of the patients. The clinical diagnosis was considered the ""gold standard"" to which the headache drawing diagnosis was compared. There were 68 girls 5-18 years of age and 56 boys 7-18 years of age. Of the 124 children, 40 were clinically diagnosed with migraine (32.2%), 47 with tension-type headache (37.9%), and 37 (29.8%) as the others.

In the group of ""the other"" headaches, 21 children were diagnosed with somatoform disorders. The most frequent element in this group's drawings was a whirl in the head. Colors used most frequently were black and red, which signify severe pain. There was no difference in sensitivity of diagnoses between neurologists and pediatricians. Because the evaluation of drawings by children with headaches done both by pediatricians and pediatric neurologists was correct for approximately half of the children, the authors decided to prepare a set of test pictures, including characteristic presentations of pain. Preparing a ready set of test drawings may facilitate differentiation for the inexperienced doctors and encourage those children who refuse to draw.

135,135,10413700,"Until recently, diagnosis of disorders of the lacrimal system has depended on digital dacryocystography and on clinical examinations such as the fluorescein dye test, lacrimal probing, and irrigation. The lacrimal system and its mucous membranes can now be viewed directly with a lacrimal endoscope. While the first endoscopes were rigid and limited by poor picture quality in axial illuminations, the new generation of endoscopes are a great leap forward for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. 132 patients ranging in age from 8 months to 73 years with nasolacrimal obstruction were referred to the lacrimal department. Diagnostic lacrimal imaging utilising various small calibre endoscopes less than 0.5 mm in external diameter was performed. The endoscopes are coupled to specially designed lacrimal probes as well as a CCD camera and a video recorder. The imaging was performed during standard lacrimal probing and irrigation in an outpatient clinic setting in 120 of 132 patients All patients reported the pain of endoscopy as being similar to that of standard lacrimal probing and irrigation. No adverse effects such as bleeding or lacrimal perforation were noted. Endoscopic manipulation was not too difficult and the picture quality, depth of focus, and illumination were satisfactory in all cases. The most common site of stenosis was the nasolacrimal duct (59 patients), followed by the lacrimal sac (39 patients) and the canaliculi (34 patients). In 25 patients, partial obstruction, rather than complete stenosis, was visualised as a narrow lumen, which widened during irrigation. In 14 of 28 patients, obstruction was due to canalicular submucosal folds and was removed with laser. In addition, the colour and consistency of the lining mucosa correlated with type of obstruction. Normal mucosa is smooth and light pink in colour. Inflammatory changes manifest as thickened and reddish grey mucosa. More complete stenosis is shown as fibrotic plaques with grey white inelastic membranes. Lacrimal endoscopy is a new, non-invasive method used to view directly and localise obstructions precisely. It allows differentiation between inflammatory, partial, and complete stenosis. Endoscopy enables one to choose the appropriate surgical therapy for patients. Patients tolerated the procedure well without any adverse reactions or effects. While it may not replace standard probing and irrigation, this technique is an extremely useful adjunct in determining the proper surgical modality, ease, and tolerance of the endoscopic manipulation by patients, and obtaining sharp and clear images of the nasolacrimal outflow system anatomy and pathology. Differentiation of various types of obstruction by precise location and severity can be achieved.

A two-step process was followed to generate and refine concepts, guided by Delphi methodology. First, a scoping review was conducted, including original peer-reviewed research articles that quantified or qualitatively described determinant(s) of racial or ethnic differences in athlete mental health or mental healthcare. Next, a multiday virtual meeting was facilitated to review the results of the scoping review, discuss lived experiences and generate potential concepts. Participants included a racially and ethnically diverse group of student-athletes, medical and mental health professionals, athletics administrators, diversity, equity and inclusion experts, health educators and representatives from leading organisations involved in athlete mental health. Through the consensus process, participants identified 42 concepts that member institutions might consider implementing on their campuses. Concepts were largely focused on organisational policies and practices such as staffing diversity and inclusion, expanded options for clinical support (ie, identity-relevant support groups) and within-organisation accountability. Concepts related to specific areas for stakeholder education were also identified. Institutions have the potential to play an important role in supporting the mental well being of student-athletes of colour, and the present concepts can help inform institutional action.

Analysis of longitudinal data is required to discern how children use services across programmes to provide the necessary context for IDEA oversight and to identify areas for programme or policy interventions to reduce barriers to service use and promote equity. We applied sequence analysis to a data linkage across five public record systems among 15 626 New York City children born in 1998 who had records from birth through third grade. Five predominant patterns of service use were identified: (1) multiple therapies across EI/ECSE/SE (13%), (2) EI without transition to Department of Education schools or services (24%), (3) EI and intermittent ECSE/SE (16%), (4) older entry into EI and both speech and occupational therapy throughout ECSE/SE (9%) and (5) limited EI use and mostly speech therapy in ECSE/SE (38%). Each pattern had distinct demographics (e.g., pattern 2 was disproportionately White and from low poverty neighbourhoods; pattern 4 was disproportionately male and Black; pattern 5 was disproportionately Latino) and academic outcomes (e.g., pattern 1 had largest proportion in a SE school and not tested in third grade; pattern 3 had third grade tests scores that were similar to overall citywide mean scores). The differences in demographic profiles across the five patterns of service use illustrate the systemic inequities in the delivery of these important services. Delayed entry and limited use of EI services among children of colour underscore the need for equity goals to increase early referral and optimize service use.

Children were requested to use the app for at least five days between clinical visits. Children's app-reported data were extracted from individual user accounts for analysis. Quantitative data were summarized descriptively. Qualitative data were summarized using qualitative content analysis. Nineteen children (6-12 years; median 8 years; 7 females) completed 107 days of app use. All children reported symptoms at least once, and 14 reported at least one day with a symptom of moderate or greater severity. Daily experiences reported through the app reflected children's engagement in usual childhood experiences while also describing life with cancer, including symptoms. Elementary school-age children are capable of self-reporting symptoms using a symptom reporting app, providing preliminary evidence for the potential benefits and clinical relevance of mHealth resources to support health outcomes within this population.

We conducted a multicenter, noninferiority, observational study among a convenience sample of children aged 3 months to 6 years treated in tertiary care emergency departments across North and Central America, Europe, and Australia. The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy of POCUS and RADUS with respect to clinically important intussusception. Sample size was determined using a 4-percentage-point noninferiority margin for the absolute difference in accuracy. Secondary outcomes included agreement between POCUS and RADUS for identification of secondary sonographic findings. The analysis included 256 children across 17 sites (35 sonologists). Of the 256 children, 58 (22.7%) had clinically important intussusception. POCUS identified 60 (23.4%) children with clinically important intussusception. The diagnostic accuracy of POCUS was 97.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 94.9% to 99.0%), compared to 99.3% (95% CI 96.8% to 99.9%) for RADUS. The absolute difference between the accuracy of RADUS and that of POCUS was 1.5 percentage points (95% CI -0.6 to 3.6). Sensitivity for POCUS was 96.6% (95% CI 87.2% to 99.1%), and specificity was 98.0% (95% CI 94.7% to 99.2%). Agreement was high between POCUS and RADUS for identification of trapped free fluid (83.3%, n=40/48) and decreased color Doppler signal (95.7%, n=22/23).

Application of 0.1% epinephrine (0.12 mL) by aerosol spray decreased the x value significantly, in association with a significant decrease in blood flow in normal subjects. The x value of chromaticity in PAR patients was significantly lower than that in normal subjects; this showed the reduced red component of the color. There was no significant difference in the y value between PAR patients and the normal group. In the CP group, the x and y values were not significantly different from values in normal subjects. However, the x value in the first week after the onset of symptoms was significantly greater than that in the normal group.

However, there is limited research on lead-based paint, especially its use in toys, which poses an explicit health risk to vulnerable children. The present study sampled 100 different toys purchased from the three largest online shopping platforms in China: JD, Taobao (TB) and Tmall (TM). These selected toys have been sold nearly 3 million times in total, suggesting that they may have reached the dwellings of millions of children. It was found that the toys sold by JD and TM, which are considered organized sellers, had average lead concentrations of 25 mg/kg and 32 mg/kg, respectively, much lower than that of toys sold by unorganized sellers on the TB platform, at 219 mg/kg. Approximately 12% of the toys purchased from TB contained paint with total lead concentrations exceeding China's regulatory standard for paints in toy manufacturing, and nearly 36% of the toys purchased from TB exceeded the equivalent US regulatory standard and EU standard. These results suggest that further action is needed to verify the health and safety standards of toys sold by such unorganized sellers. Moreover, this study found that China's regulatory standard (90 mg/kg) based on soluble lead may underestimate the risk posed by lead in paints, and it is suggested that future regulatory thresholds for lead levels in paints for toy manufacture be based on total rather than soluble lead concentrations.

151,151,33168907,"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections in children. The symptoms of UTI in young children are nonspecific, therefore urine should be examined whenever UTI cannot be ruled out. In clinical settings, however, collecting urine from children who are not toilet trained is sometimes difficult, presenting a challenge in UTI management. Here, we developed a ""diaper UTI test"", which enables the quick detection of pyuria in ordinary diapers, and investigated its sensitivity and specificity in a clinical study. The diaper UTI test is based on a leukocyte esterase reaction. Reagent was prepared in liquid form so that it can be absorbed by disposable diapers, where it will produce a violet color in the presence of pyuria. For the clinical study, we enrolled children younger than 3 years with potential UTI who underwent bladder catheterization for urine culture and urinalysis. Of the 65 children included, 21 were diagnosed with UTI. The sensitivity and specificity of the diaper UTI test were 90.5% (95% CI 69.6-98.8) and 93.2% (95% CI 81.3-98.6), respectively. Because of its convenience and good sensitivity, the diaper UTI test may be useful in the screening of pediatric UTI.

152,152,21655042,"To evaluate the reproducibility of ImageJ software in analyzing the color of the optic disc. One hundred twelve normal participants (56 males and 56 females) were enrolled in this study. The image of the optic disc was taken using Kowa digital disc photo-graphy, and the gray scales of the nasal rim (NR), brightest cupping center (BCC) and largest inferior retinal vein (IRV) were calculated using histogram in ImageJ. Three different observers calculated the gray scales three separate times. Reproducibility was assessed using the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The mean age of the participants was 50.6 years old (range, 11 to 82 years). The mean gray scales of the nasal rim were 91.81, 94.91, and 93.24; those of the brightest cupping center were 174.84, 179.94, and 177.76; and those of the largest inferior retinal vein were 61.85, 53.48, and 56.73 for observers 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Inter-observer reproducibility for NR, BCC and IRV was considered good based upon ICC values of 0.944, 0.860, and 0.789 for observers 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Significant age-related differences between the values of the brightest cupping center were noted, and the gray scale score was decreased in the older participants (p < 0.001). The gray scale of the brightest cupping center diminished with age. ImageJ can be a useful objective tool with high reproducibility in the analysis of optic disc color.

The aim of this study was to determine the colour of pain presence and absence. Patients aged between 4 and 14 and referred to a dentist for the first time due to toothache had a short-term pain of 1 month caused by deep cavities. The children chose paintings from the box of 24 standard colours (Crayola, Spain) and the circles were painted. Pain was rated by children on the Visual Analoge Scale. Normality and variance were tested using the one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Associations were performed by using the Pearson correlation coefficient.

154,154,26443044,"According to the American Society of Echocardiography, coronary artery (CA) imaging is recommended in pediatric examinations to identify CA anomalies. A review of the authors' center's echocardiographic studies revealed that CA images were often nondiagnostic. The aim of this study was to utilize quality improvement methodology to increase the percentage of first-time pediatric studies with definitive CA identification from a baseline of 45% to a goal of at least 75% in 9 months. A scoring system was developed to characterize the completeness of CA imaging. One point was scored for demonstration of each of the following: right CA origin by two-dimensional imaging, right CA origin by color flow Doppler imaging, left CA origin by two-dimensional imaging, and left CA origin by color flow Doppler imaging. A score of 4 was considered to represent definitive imaging. A baseline was obtained on 100 first-time echocardiograms with normal findings. During the intervention, 10 randomly selected first-time studies with normal findings were scored weekly for assessment of CA imaging. Interventions were focused on the following domains: excellence in image quality, shared ownership, transparency, and effective communication. Key interventions included labeling CA images, requiring two-dimensional and color Doppler images, optimization of settings, and elimination of macros for CA reporting. The percentage of definitive CA identification increased from 45% to 82.5% over 4 months and was sustained for 7 months. Accurate reporting of incomplete CA imaging increased from 17% to 77.5%.

155,155,28696831,"Development of children's cognitive and perceptual skills depends heavily on object exploration and experience in their physical world. For children who have severe physical impairments, one of the biggest concerns is the loss of opportunities for meaningful play with objects, including physical contact and manipulation. Assistive robots can enable children to perform object manipulation through the control of simple interfaces. Touch sensations conveyed through haptic interfaces in the form of force reflection or force assistance can help a child to sense the environment and to control a robot. A robotic system with forbidden region virtual fixtures (VFs) was tested in an object sorting task. Three sorting tasks-by color, by shape, and by both color and shape-were performed by 10 adults without disability and one adult with cerebral palsy. Tasks performed with VFs were accomplished faster than tasks performed without VFs, and deviations of the motion area were smaller with VFs than without VFs. For the participant with physical impairments, two out of three tasks were slower with the VFs. This implies that forbidden region VFs are not always able to improve user task performance.

156,156,17993825,"To investigate the use of the prosthetic iris-tinted soft contact lens, the SEED Opaque, during the past 5 years. The records of 42 outpatients (48 eyes) for whom the prosthetic soft contact lens was prescribed in the contact lens clinic of Juntendo University Hospital from July 2001 to June 2005 were investigated. An investigation was conducted in regard to the tint patterns of the prosthetic soft contact lens and the presence or absence of a transparent part in the middle, as a brown iris with a clear pupil or a solid pupil. The diagnosis, purpose of prescription, age when that lens was prescribed, complications, and changes in corrected visual acuities were analyzed retrospectively from the medical records. The mean age at the first prescription, total number of years of wearing prosthetic contact lenses, total number of prescriptions, and mean period to use each SEED Opaque lens were compared. The mean age at the first prescription of solid-pupil lens wearers was significantly younger than that for clear-pupil lens wearers (P<0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). The solid-pupil type had been prescribed for 30 eyes, all for cosmetic purposes. The clear-pupil type had been prescribed for five eyes for cosmetic purposes and for 13 eyes for improvement of visual function. Complications were shown in 40% of wearers. Contact lens-induced papillary conjunctivitis was highest, followed by punctate superficial keratopathy, superficial punctate keratitis, and corneal erosion. In comparison of corrected visual acuities before and after wearing the clear-pupil cosmetic soft contact lens, significant improvement was observed (P<0.05, paired t test). Although the SEED Opaque lens is a conventional soft contact lens, it is tailor-made for each patient. So it is possible to adjust the color and size of the cosmetic part and the pupil diameter. Further, corrected visual acuities could improve with the clear-pupil type for patients who had prescribed for improvement of visual function.

Then, we aimed to identify and describe dietary intake patterns of children aged 6 years as well as to assess their association with socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, early feeding practices and BMI z-score at 6 years. We used principal components analysis to identify dietary intake patterns of 3,427 children from the 2004 Pelotas (Brazil) birth cohort study. We used multiple linear regression models to evaluate whether socioeconomic and demographic characteristics (socioeconomic position, mother's age at birth, and child's sex and skin colour), early feeding practices (exclusive breastfeeding duration and age of introduction of complementary foods), and BMI z-score at 6 years were associated with dietary intake patterns. We identified seven dietary components of children's dietary intake patterns, namely: fruits and vegetables, snacks and treats, coffee and bread, milk, cheese and processed meats, rice and beans and carbohydrates. Dietary patterns were socially patterned, since six dietary components were associated with socioeconomic position. Moreover, high intake of snacks and treats and less fruits and vegetables were associated with children born to teenage mothers, with those exclusively breastfed for less than one month, and with those who started on complementary feeding before 4 months. Finally, overweight and obese children at 6 years presented lower intake of four out of seven dietary components, but we need to be cautious in interpretation due to limitations on food consumption reporting and due to possible reverse causality. Dietary intake patterns in children are strongly influenced by socioeconomic characteristics. Other factors such as younger maternal age at birth, and both early weaning and early introduction of complementary feeding appear to be related with 'unhealthier' patterns. Overweight and obese children presented lower intake of four out of seven dietary components, but further studies would be interesting to understand the longitudinal effect of children's feeding practices on BMI and adiposity.

159,159,33726682,"Healthcare workers (HCWs) in South Africa widely use job-aids as practical tools to enhance the provision of HIV services, thereby improving patient-provider interactions during the care process. Job-aids are visual support materials that provide appropriate information using graphics and words in a simple and yet effective manner. We explored the mechanism through the KidzAlive Talk tool storybook (Talk tool), a child-centred job-aid for HCWs that facilitates child-participation during HIV consultations in primary healthcare (PHC) clinics implementing the KidzAlive model. The study was conducted in PHC clinics across four districts; namely: uMkhanyakude, Zululand, uMgungundlovu, and eThekwini in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa. We conducted in-depth interviews with children (n = 30), their primary caregivers (PCGs) (n = 30), and KidzAlive trained and mentored HCWs (n = 20). Data were collected in both English and isiZulu languages through user-specific, structured in-depth interviews. All the interviews were audio-recorded (with participants' assent and consent, respectively). Data were transcribed verbatim, prior to translating the isiZulu transcripts to English. Translations were done by a member of the research team competent in both languages. Electronic data were imported to NVivo 10 for analysis and subsequently analysed using a thematic analysis method followed by a constant comparative and modified grounded theory analysis method. The findings identified the following barriers to child-participation: Primary caregiver limiting the child's involvement due to fear of traumatising them; HCWs' limited knowledge and skills to deliver child-centred HIV care; childhood developmental stage-related limitations and healthcare institutional paternalism. The Talk tool addresses the above barriers by using simple language and terminology to cater for children at various stages of development; alleviating HCWs' and PCGs' fear of possible psychological harm to the child; using storytelling and colourful cartoon illustrations for child edutainment; Being versatile by allowing for multiple utility and tackling institutional paternalism that limit child-involvement in the process of care.

160,160,33319353,"Caries is one of the most prevalent and preventable conditions worldwide. If identified early enough then non-invasive techniques can be applied, and therefore this review focusses on early caries involving the enamel surface of the tooth. The cornerstone of caries detection is a visual and tactile dental examination, however alternative methods of detection are available, and these include fluorescence-based devices. There are three categories of fluorescence-based device each primarily defined by the different wavelengths they exploit; we have labelled these groups as red, blue, and green fluorescence. These devices could support the visual examination for the detection and diagnosis of caries at an early stage of decay. Our primary objectives were to estimate the diagnostic test accuracy of fluorescence-based devices for the detection and diagnosis of enamel caries in children or adults. We planned to investigate the following potential sources of heterogeneity: tooth surface (occlusal, proximal, smooth surface or adjacent to a restoration); single point measurement devices versus imaging or surface assessment devices; and the prevalence of more severe disease in each study sample, at the level of caries into dentine. Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist undertook a search of the following databases: MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 30 May 2019); Embase Ovid (1980 to 30 May 2019); US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov, to 30 May 2019); and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 30 May 2019). We studied reference lists as well as published systematic review articles. We included diagnostic accuracy study designs that compared a fluorescence-based device with a reference standard. This included prospective studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of single index tests and studies that directly compared two or more index tests. Studies that explicitly recruited participants with caries into dentine or frank cavitation were excluded. Two review authors extracted data independently using a piloted study data extraction form based on the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2). Sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported for each study. This information has been displayed as coupled forest plots and summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) plots, displaying the sensitivity-specificity points for each study. We estimated diagnostic accuracy using hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) methods. We reported sensitivities at fixed values of specificity (median 0.78, upper quartile 0.90). We included a total of 133 studies, 55 did not report data in the 2 x 2 format and could not be included in the meta-analysis. 79 studies which provided 114 datasets and evaluated 21,283 tooth surfaces were included in the meta-analysis. There was a high risk of bias for the participant selection domain. The index test, reference standard, and flow and timing domains all showed a high proportion of studies to be at low risk of bias. Concerns regarding the applicability of the evidence were high or unclear for all domains, the highest proportion being seen in participant selection. Selective participant recruitment, poorly defined diagnostic thresholds, and in vitro studies being non-generalisable to the clinical scenario of a routine dental examination were the main reasons for these findings. The dominance of in vitro studies also means that the information on how the results of these devices are used to support diagnosis, as opposed to pure detection, was extremely limited. There was substantial variability in the results which could not be explained by the different devices or dentition or other sources of heterogeneity that we investigated. The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) was 14.12 (95% CI 11.17 to 17.84). The estimated sensitivity, at a fixed median specificity of 0.78, was 0.70 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.75). In a hypothetical cohort of 1000 tooth sites or surfaces, with a prevalence of enamel caries of 57%, obtained from the included studies, the estimated sensitivity of 0.70 and specificity of 0.78 would result in 171 missed tooth sites or surfaces with enamel caries (false negatives) and 95 incorrectly classed as having early caries (false positives). We used meta-regression to compare the accuracy of the different devices for red fluorescence (84 datasets, 14,514 tooth sites), blue fluorescence (21 datasets, 3429 tooth sites), and green fluorescence (9 datasets, 3340 tooth sites) devices. Initially, we allowed threshold, shape, and accuracy to vary according to device type by including covariates in the model. Allowing consistency of shape, removal of the covariates for accuracy had only a negligible effect (Chi There is considerable variation in the performance of these fluorescence-based devices that could not be explained by the different wavelengths of the devices assessed, participant, or study characteristics. Blue and green fluorescence-based devices appeared to outperform red fluorescence-based devices but this difference was not supported by the results of a formal statistical comparison. The evidence base was considerable, but we were only able to include 79 studies out of 133 in the meta-analysis as estimates of sensitivity or specificity values or both could not be extracted or derived. In terms of applicability, any future studies should be carried out in a clinical setting, where difficulties of caries assessment within the oral cavity include plaque, staining, and restorations. Other considerations include the potential of fluorescence devices to be used in combination with other technologies and comparative diagnostic accuracy studies. La caries es una de las afecciones más frecuentes y prevenibles en todo el mundo. Si se identifican con suficiente antelación, se pueden aplicar técnicas no invasivas y, por lo tanto, esta revisión se centra en las caries tempranas que afectan la superficie del esmalte del diente. La piedra angular de la detección de la caries es una exploración dental visual y táctil; sin embargo, existen métodos alternativos de detección, entre los que se incluyen los dispositivos basados en la fluorescencia. Hay tres categorías de dispositivos basados en la fluorescencia, cada una de ellas definida principalmente por las diferentes longitudes de onda que utilizan; estos grupos se han llamado fluorescencia roja, azul y verde. Estos dispositivos podrían apoyar la exploración visual para la detección y el diagnóstico de la caries en una etapa temprana de descomposición. Los objetivos principales fueron determinar la exactitud de la prueba diagnóstica de dispositivos basados en la fluorescencia para la detección y el diagnóstico de la caries del esmalte en niños o adultos. Se planificó investigar las siguientes fuentes potenciales de heterogeneidad: superficie dental (oclusal, proximal, superficie lisa o adyacente a una restauración); dispositivos de medición de punto único frente a dispositivos de imagen o de evaluación de superficie; y la prevalencia de enfermedades más graves en cada muestra de estudio, a nivel de caries en la dentina. MÉTODOS DE BÚSQUEDA: El documentalista del Grupo Cochrane de Salud Oral (Cochrane Oral Health Group) realizó una búsqueda en las siguientes bases de datos: MEDLINE Ovid (1946 al 30 de mayo de 2019); Embase Ovid (1980 al 30 de mayo de 2019); Registro de ensayos en curso de los Institutos Nacionales de Salud de los Estados Unidos (ClinicalTrials.gov, hasta el 30 de mayo de 2019); y la Plataforma de Registro Internacional de Ensayos Clínicos de la Organización Mundial de la Salud (hasta el 30 de mayo de 2019). Se estudiaron las listas de referencias y las revisiones sistemáticas publicadas. CRITERIOS DE SELECCIÓN: Se incluyeron diseños de estudios de exactitud diagnóstica que compararon un dispositivo basado en la fluorescencia con un estándar de referencia. Esto incluyó estudios prospectivos que evaluaron la exactitud diagnóstica de una única prueba índice y estudios que compararon directamente dos o más pruebas índice. Se excluyeron los estudios que reclutaron explícitamente a participantes con caries en la dentina o en la cavitación franca. OBTENCIÓN Y ANÁLISIS DE LOS DATOS: Dos autores de la revisión extrajeron los datos de forma independiente mediante un formulario de extracción de datos de estudios piloto basado en la Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS‐2). De cada estudio se informaron la sensibilidad y la especificidad con intervalos de confianza (IC) del 95%. Esta información se ha presentado en forma de diagramas de bosque (forest plot) emparejados y gráficos de curva resumen de rendimiento diagnóstico (SROC), que muestran los puntos de sensibilidad‐especificidad de cada estudio. La exactitud diagnóstica se calculó mediante métodos de modelo jerárquico de curva resumen de rendimiento diagnóstico (HSROC). Se informaron sensibilidades a valores fijos de especificidad (mediana 0,78, cuartil superior 0,90). Se incluyeron un total de 133 estudios, 55 no informaron los datos en el formato 2 x 2 y no se pudieron incluir en el metanálisis. En el metanálisis se incluyeron 79 estudios que proporcionaron 114 conjuntos de datos y evaluaron 21 283 superficies dentales. Hubo alto riesgo de sesgo en el dominio de selección de los participantes. La prueba índice, el estándar de referencia y los dominios de flujo y tiempo mostraron que una alta proporción de los estudios tenían un bajo riesgo de sesgo. Las preocupaciones relacionadas con la aplicabilidad de la evidencia fueron altas o poco claras en todos los dominios, y la mayor proporción se observó en la selección de los participantes. El reclutamiento selectivo de los participantes, los umbrales diagnósticos mal definidos y el hecho de que los estudios in vitro no se puedan generalizar al escenario clínico de una exploración dental de rutina fueron las principales razones de estos hallazgos. El predominio de los estudios in vitro también hizo que la información sobre la forma en que se utilizan los resultados de esos dispositivos para apoyar el diagnóstico, en contraposición con la detección pura, fuera muy limitada. Hubo una variabilidad significativa en los resultados que no se pudo explicar por los diferentes dispositivos o dentición u otras fuentes de heterogeneidad que se investigaron. El odds ratio diagnóstico (ORD) fue 14,12 (IC del 95%: 11,17 a 17,84). La sensibilidad estimada, con una especificidad media fija de 0,78, fue 0,70 (IC del 95%: 0,64 a 0,75). En una cohorte hipotética de 1000 puntos o superficies dentales, con una prevalencia de caries del esmalte del 57%, obtenida de los estudios incluidos, la sensibilidad estimada de 0,70 y la especificidad de 0,78 daría lugar a 171 puntos o superficies dentales con caries del esmalte no detectados (falsos negativos) y 95 incorrectamente considerados con caries temprana (falsos positivos). Se utilizó la metarregresión para comparar la exactitud de los diferentes dispositivos para la fluorescencia roja (84 conjuntos de datos, 14 514 puntos dentales), la fluorescencia azul (21 conjuntos de datos, 3429 puntos dentales), y la fluorescencia verde (nueve conjuntos de datos, 3340 puntos dentales). Inicialmente, se permitió que el umbral, la forma y la exactitud variaran según el tipo de dispositivo, incluyendo covariables en el modelo. Permitiendo la homogeneidad de la forma, la eliminación de las covariables para la exactitud tuvo sólo un efecto insignificante (Ji Existe una considerable variación en la ejecución de estos dispositivos basados en la fluorescencia que no se pudo explicar por las diferentes longitudes de onda de los dispositivos evaluados, los participantes ni las características de los estudios. Los dispositivos basados en la fluorescencia azul y verde parecieron superar a los basados en la fluorescencia roja, pero esta diferencia no estuvo respaldada por los resultados de una comparación estadística formal. La base de evidencia fue considerable, pero sólo fue posible incluir 79 estudios de 133 en el metanálisis, ya que no se pudieron extraer o derivar las estimaciones de los valores de sensibilidad o especificidad o ambos. En cuanto a la aplicabilidad, todo estudio futuro se debería realizar en un ámbito clínico, en el que las dificultades de la evaluación de la caries dentro de la cavidad oral incluyen la placa, la tinción y las restauraciones. Otras consideraciones son el potencial de los dispositivos de fluorescencia para ser utilizados en combinación con otras tecnologías y estudios comparativos de exactitud diagnóstica.

How-ever, for dose determination, the average deviation (25.8% vs 1.7%) and median deviation (1% vs 0%) from recommended dosage were both higher for the group using conventional methods compared with the group using the color-coded method. The Wilcoxon rank sum test indicated that the median deviation was significantly different between the 2 groups (P<.001). Similar results were obtained for dose measuring. The average deviation (29% vs 0.5%) and the median deviation (17.2% vs 0%) from recommended dosage were higher for the group using conventional methods compared with the group using the color-coded method. The median deviation was also significantly different between the 2 groups (P<.001). This study suggests a marked improvement in caregivers' ability to correctly determine and measure an over-the-counter medication for their child using a color-coded method compared with conventional methods.

162,162,29758979,"Anaemia is predicted as one of the serious communal health issue in the world. The deficiency exists most common among children and women. A substantial issue prevails in providing quality healthcare services to rural communities, which remains a challenge to health service providers throughout the world. Traditionally physician and health workers recognized anaemia from certain clinical findings, such as pallor of the conjunctivae, nail beds, lips, tongue, and oral mucosa. Confirmation of anaemic condition through physical examination of Dorsum of a tongue or lower bulbar conjunctiva is a subjective analysis. Invasive methods have a possibility to spread infection through the needle. The existing non-invasive techniques need costly equipment and qualified technicians. Growing developments in science and technologies play an important role in medicine. This proposal introduces a new non-invasive diagnostic tool correlating the hemoglobin with conjunctiva pallor colour scores and classification using neural networks. In this study, the eye images were obtained using a mobile camera were processed using the HSI model, which estimates different colour scores of the selected region. These scores were correlated with laboratory haemoglobin value. Feedforward neural network and Elman neural network were used for classifying anaemic and non-anaemic cases. This proposed tool will be useful for the health workers to identify the mass screening of anaemia in rural areas.

Conventional EEG tracings from 21 consecutive critically ill children were scored for electrographic seizures. Four 2-hour long segments from each subject were converted to 8-channel color density spectral array displays, yielding 84 images. Eight encephalographers received color density spectral array training and circled elements thought to represent seizures. Images were reviewed in random order (Group A) or with information regarding seizure presence in the initial 30 minutes and with subject images in order (Group B). Sensitivity, specificity, and interrater reliability were calculated. Factors associated with color density spectral array seizure identification were assessed. Seizure prevalence was 43% on conventional EEG. Specificity was significantly higher for Group A than Group B (92.3% vs. 78.2%, P < 0.00). Sensitivity was not significantly different between Groups A and B (64.8% vs. 75%, P = 0.22). Interrater reliability was moderate in both groups. Ten percent of images were falsely classified as containing a seizure. Seizure duration ≥2 minutes predicted identification (P < 0.001).

The process of tissue expansion can mimic the effect of surgical delay to include more perforasomes into the perforator flap. By combining the perforasome theory with the technique of tissue expansion, large and various expanded perforator flaps can be achieved.  From July 2007 to July 2014, we performed eight different types of expanded perforator flaps in a total of 83 cases: 41 supraclavicular artery perforator flaps, 11 superficial cervical artery perforator flaps, 15 lateral thoracic perforator flaps, 6 internal mammary artery perforator flaps, 6 thoracoabdominal perforator flaps, 2 facial artery perforator flaps, 1 posterior interosseous perforator flap, and 1 ulnar collateral artery perforator flap. During the follow-up period, the survival rate, color, texture, and retraction of the flaps were assessed.  The dimensions of the flaps ranged from 8 × 6 to 25 × 25 cm. Minor flap necrosis occurred in 20.5% of the cases, and severe flap necrosis developed in 2.4% of the cases. The donor sites were closed primarily in all but three cases. During the follow-up period (average, 13 months; range, 8-18 months), no flap contracture was observed with a good color and texture match.  By combining the concept of perforasome with the technique of tissue expansion, flaps with large dimensions and reliable blood supply can be achieved, allowing a more flexible design to reconstruct various and challenging skin lesions.

This study aims to examine the changes in all the outpatient clinical encounters during the pandemic compared to the baseline, with particular attention to psychiatric encounters and diagnoses. This study analyzed 3-year (January 2019 to December 2021) longitudinal clinical encounter data from 3,394 children in the Boston Birth Cohort, a US urban, predominantly low-income, Black and Hispanic children. Outcomes of interest were completed outpatient clinical encounters and their modalities (telemedicine vs. in person), including psychiatric care and diagnoses, primary care, emergency department (ED), and developmental and behavioral pediatrics (DBP). The study children's mean (SD) age is 13.9 (4.0) years. Compared to 2019, psychiatric encounters increased by 38% in 2020, most notably for diagnoses of adjustment disorders, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). In contrast, primary care encounters decreased by 33%, ED encounters decreased by 55%, and DBP care decreased by 16% in 2020. Telemedicine was utilized the most for psychiatric and DBP encounters and the least for primary care encounters in 2020. A remarkable change in 2021 was the return of primary care encounters to the 2019 level, but psychiatric encounters fluctuated with spikes in COVID-19 case numbers. Among this sample of US BIPOC children, compared to the 2019 baseline, psychiatric encounters increased by 38% during 2020, most notably for the new diagnoses of adjustment disorder, depression, and PTSD. The 2021 data showed a full recovery of primary care encounters to the baseline level but psychiatric encounters remained sensitive to the pandemic spikes.

However, these studies have not adequately addressed the effects of lighting on school children in the classroom environment. In the present study, the effect of variable lighting (VL) i.e., lighting that is variable in illuminance and color temperature, was studied in the classroom using a variety of student performance and attitude measures. Two classrooms each in two separate schools were studied over a period of nine months; one class in each school served as an intervention group, and a parallel class in each school served as a control group. The effects of the individual VL programs were assessed using standardized test modules. The overall effect was measured using standardized surveys of students and teachers given at the beginning and the end of the project. The results showed that the students made fewer errors, particularly fewer errors of omission, on a standardized test of attention under the VL ""Concentrate"" program. Reading speed, as measured using standardized reading tests, rose significantly. Reading comprehension also improved, but this improvement was not statistically significant. In contrast, the achievement motivation of the students and the classroom atmosphere did not change over the nine-month period. Overall, the students and teachers rated VL positively and found it useful during lessons. These results are in line with previous research findings. Thus, VL represents an environmental factor that can be useful to optimize general learning conditions in schools in the future.

Prospective, descriptive study involving all children presenting to a pediatric ED between 5 and 16 years of age inclusive with acute pain. Children were excluded if they 1) were intoxicated or had altered sensorium, 2) were clinically unstable, 3) were non-English-speaking, or 4) were developmentally delayed. Written informed consent was obtained. Children were asked to mark their current pain severity on the standardized Color Analogue Scale (CAS) and Faces Pain Scale (FPS). After each pain control intervention the child was asked to repeat these measurements and to describe whether his or her pain was ""much less,"" ""a little less,"" ""about the same,"" ""a little worse,"" or ""much worse"" compared with before. This process was repeated until the child was discharged from the ED or had a score of zero. The main outcome measure was the smallest change on the CAS or FPS necessary to cause the child to describe his or her pain as a ""little less."" This was defined as the clinically significant change in pain. The ""ideal"" change in pain was defined as the amount of change necessary for the child to describe the pain as ""much less"" or at which point the child thought he or she no longer required any medicine to help the pain go away. One hundred twenty-one children were enrolled with a mean age of 9.8 years (SD +/- 3.15). Males accounted for 56%. Pain was traumatic in 65% and nontraumatic in 35%. A total of 153 pain comparisons were made using the CAS and 154 using the FPS. Only three children complained that their pain got worse (two a little worse and one much worse). Pain was described as ""the same"" in 20.

Only a few pediatric cases have been published in the literature. In this report, we present an unusual case of a pediatric patient with a urethral caruncle, along with a review of the literature. A 9-year-old Mongolian girl was referred to our hospital with a 2-week history of frequent adherence of a small amount of blood to her underwear. We found a sessile smooth margin, a clear boundary and an elastic, soft red tumor over the entire circumference of the urethral meatus. At the beginning, because of the child's age, urethral prolapse was suspected. There was no response after 3 weeks of conservative treatment with steroid ointment. With the patient under general anesthesia, a partial tumor resection was performed for the purpose of histological examination. The tumor excision was limited to about 1/2 laps of the urethral meatus to prevent the development of urethral stricture. On the basis of clinical and histopathological examinations, a diagnosis of a urethral caruncle was made. Post-operatively, steroid ointment application to residual masses was continued, and these disappeared about 6 months later. Our patient was free of recurrence and had had no complications after 3 years of follow-up. Urethral caruncles are rare in children, and the possibility of malignancy is slight during this period. Biopsy of the mass is not required for diagnosis. It should be indicated only if the mass has other characteristics that raise suspicion of malignancy. In previously reported cases, all of the tumor was removed. However, the trigger of the caruncle in childhood is chronic inflammation. Conservative therapy with steroid ointment should be the core treatment. However, it may be necessary to proceed to treatment because caruncles take a long time to heal.

The clinical parameters compared were heart rate; body temperature; heart, lung, and abdominal auscultation; otoscopy; throat and oral examination; and skin examination. A total of 690 patients with clinical stability and various symptoms who were seen in the emergency department of 2 Brazilian pediatric hospitals were eligible to enter this study. The primary outcome was concordance between measurements from a telemedicine physical examination using a mobile medical device and measurements from a conventional in-person physical examination. The secondary outcome was the specificity and sensitivity of the digital device, considering the conventional in-person consultation as the gold standard. Among 690 patients, the median (IQR) age at study entry was 5 (1-9) years; 348 (50.4%) were female, and 331 (48.0%) presented with a chronic disease. Regarding the primary outcome, the concordance values were 90% or greater for skin examination (94% for rash, 100% for hemorrhagic suffusion, and 95% for signs of secondary infection), characteristics of the mucosa (98% for hydration and 97% for coloring), and heart (95% for murmur, 97% for rhythms, and 98% for sounds), lung (91% for adventitious sounds, 97% for vesicular sounds, and 90% for fever), and abdominal (92% for abdominal sounds) auscultations. Concordance values were lower for otoscopy (72% for the ear canal and 86% for the tympanic membrane), throat and oral examination (72%), and rhinoscopy (79% for mucosa and 81% for secretion). The specificity was greater than 70% (ranging from 74.5% for the ear canal to 99.7% for hemorrhagic suffusion) for all variables. The sensitivity was greater than 52% for skin examination (58.0% for rash and 54.8% for signs of secondary infection), throat and oral examination (52.7%), and otoscopy (66.1% for the ear canal and 64.4% for the tympanic membrane). In this study, measurements from remote physical examination with a mobile medical device had satisfactory concordance with measurements from in-person physical examination for otoscopy, throat and oral examination, skin examination, and heart and lung auscultation, with limitations regarding heart and lung auscultation in infants and abdominal auscultation in children of all ages. Measurements from remote physical examination via a mobile medical device were comparable with those from in-person physical examination in children older than 2 years.

190,190,10063656,"Anaemia in pregnancy is a common and severe problem in many developing countries. Because of lack of resources and staff motivation, screening for anaemia is often solely by clinical examination of the conjunctiva or is not carried out at all. A new colour scale for the estimation of haemoglobin concentration has been developed by WHO. The present study compares the results obtained using the new colour scale on 729 women visiting rural antenatal clinics in Malawi with those obtained by HemoCue haemoglobinometer and electronic Coulter Counter and with the assessment of anaemia by clinical examination of the conjunctiva. Sensitivity using the colour scale was consistently better than for conjunctival inspection alone and interobserver agreement and agreement with Coulter Counter measurements was good. The Haemoglobin Colour Scale is simple to use, well accepted, cheap and gives immediate results. It shows considerable potential for use in screening for anaemia in antenatal clinics in settings where resources are limited. In developing country settings, screening of pregnant women for anemia may be limited to inspection of the conjunctiva for the presence of pallor. The potential for anemia diagnosis of a new color scale for the estimation of hemoglobin (Hb) was assessed in a study conducted at three rural hospitals and two health centers in southern Malawi. The Hemoglobin Color Scale, recently developed by the World Health Organization, is simple to use, inexpensive, and gives an immediate result. A total of 729 pregnant women underwent conjunctiva examination, HemoCue hemoglobinometer reading, electronic Coulter Counter analysis, and at least one Hemoglobin Color Scale reading (n = 1066 observations). Each of these tests was performed by a different trained nurse-midwife to reduce the potential for bias. According to the Coulter Counter measurements, 58.1% of participants had Hb levels of 11 g/dl or less, 32.0% were 10 g/dl or less, and 4.0% were 8 g/dl or less. Sensitivity was 80.0-96.6% for HemoCue, 33.2-62.1% for conjunctiva examination, and 50.0-81.6% for the Hemoglobin Color Scale. Positive predictive values were 46.8-68.1% for HemoCue, 1.2-75.0% for conjunctival examination, and 11.0-66.2% for the color scale. The highest sensitivity for the color scale was obtained at a cut-off point of 10 g/dl and the highest positive predictive value at 11 g/dl. Agreement of the Hemoglobin Color Scale readings to within +or- 1 g/dl of the Coulter Counter measurement was obtained in 40% of cases; agreement to within 2 g/dl occurred in 67% of cases. The positive predictive value of the Hemoglobin Color Scale increases with increases in the prevalence of severe anemia.

Parents (N = 78; 90% female) of children (33% female; 46% Black; 38% Latino) aged 5-17 years (M = 9.5 years) reported on their own coping and depressive symptoms, their child's asthma control, and full and partial days of school missed due to asthma. Parents' secondary control coping (i.e., coping efforts to accommodate/adapt to asthma-related stressors) was negatively correlated, and disengagement coping (i.e. coping efforts to avoid/detach from stressors) was positively correlated, with their depressive symptoms. Secondary control coping was also correlated with fewer partial days of school missed. Primary control coping (i.e., coping efforts to change stressors) was not associated with depressive symptoms or asthma outcomes. Parents' depressive symptoms were also positively correlated with poorer asthma control and partial days of school missed. Regression models showed direct and indirect effects of secondary control and disengagement coping on asthma outcomes via depressive symptoms, after controlling for demographic factors.

Intelligence, language, memory, attention, executive function, and mathematics ability were assessed using selected tests from NEPSY, WISCR, TeaCh, WRAT3 - expanded, and Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices. The child's environment at home was measured using the Middle Childhood HOME inventory. Socioeconomic status was determined from a combination of household, crowding, possessions, and sanitation. We compared the characteristics of the cases and controls and used random effects regression models (using the matched pair as the cluster) to examine the relationship between cognition and epilepsy. We found that there was no significant difference in IQ, but children with epilepsy had lower scores on tests of memory (p<0.05), language (p<0.05), and attention (p<0.01) compared with their controls. In random effects models, epilepsy status had a significant effect on memory (coefficient=-0.14, CI: -0.23, -0.05), language (coefficient=-0.13, CI: -0.23, -0.04), and mathematics ability (coefficient=-0.01, CI: -0.02, -0.00).

197,197,34125863,"In recent decades reported findings regarding gender differences in reading achievement, cognitive abilities and maturation process in boys and girls are conflicting. As reading is one of the most important processes in the maturation of an individual, the aim of the study was to better understand gender differences between primary school students. The study evaluates differences in Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Electroencephalography (EEG), Electrodermal Activities (EDA) and eye movement of participants during the reading task. Taking into account that colour may affect reading skills, in that it affects the emotional and physiological state of the body, the research attempts to provide a better understanding of gender differences in reading through examining the effect of colour, as applied to reading content. The physiological responses of 50 children (25 boys and 25 girls) to 12 different background and overlay colours of reading content were measured and summarised during the reading process. Our findings show that boys have shorter reading duration scores and a longer Saccade Count, Saccade Duration Total, and Saccade Duration Average when reading on a coloured background, especially purple, which could be caused by their motivation and by the type of reading task. Also, the boys had higher values for the Delta band and the Whole Range of EEG measurements in comparison to the girls when reading on coloured backgrounds, which could reflect the faster maturation of the girls. Regarding EDA measurements we did not find systematic differences between groups either on white or on coloured/overlay background. We found the most significant differences arose in the HRV parameters, namely (SDNN (ms), STD HR (beats/min), RMSSD (ms), NN50 (beats), pNN50 (%), CVRR) when children read the text on coloured/overlay backgrounds, where the girls showed systematically higher values on HRV measurements in comparison to the boys, mostly with yellow, red, and orange overlay colours.

198,198,33664005,"Biliary atresia (BA) is a major cause of hepatic failure and consequent liver transplantation in pediatrics. If BA is not diagnosed early and the proper surgical intervention is not performed before the age of 3 months, the survival of the affected infant is significantly reduced. In 1994, a stool color card (SCC) for early detection of BA was developed and used in Japan, a country where the parents' socioeconomic and education levels are high. We aimed to assess the value of using the SCC as a screening tool for early diagnosis of BA at a tertiary referral center in Egypt (a low/middle-income country). This prospective study enrolled 108 infants (56 females) aged 1 day to 4 months who presented with cholestasis to the Hepatology Unit of Cairo University Children's Hospital from January 2018 to August 2019. In most of our patients, the mothers were the main caregivers and the parents' socioeconomic and education levels were generally modest or low. We utilized the SCC courtesy of the Perinatal Services BC (Vancouver, Canada) with an Arabic translation. This SCC contains nine colored stool photos: the first six are ranked as abnormal colors and the last three are ranked as normal. We found that almost all referring physicians were unfamiliar with or unaware of the SCC concept. Twenty-six of our babies' mothers were illiterate and 36 had not completed their primary school education. In spite of this low education level, 43 mothers of babies who were finally confirmed to have BA correctly matched a stool color of BA on the SCC with their babies' stools, and 56 mothers of babies who were finally confirmed not to have BA correctly matched a stool color not of BA with their babies' stools. Only nine mothers made a wrong match. Therefore, the overall ""lay"" mothers' sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis of BA using the SCC were 93.48% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82.1%-98.63%) and 90.32% (95% CI 80.12%-96.37%), respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the use of the SCC (with an Arabic translation) in a low/middle-income country. Despite the referring physicians' unfamiliarity with the SCC and the mothers' relatively low education level at our center; SCC proved to be a simple, efficient, highly sensitive, specific, and applicable method for early diagnosis of BA. Therefore, SCC screening might increase motherś (as well as physicianś) awareness of BA, and we recommend that it be more publicized and used as a mass neonatal screening tool in low/middle-income countries such as Egypt.

200,200,25312750,"Picky or fussy eating is common in early childhood and associated with a decreased preference for a variety of foods. The aim of the current study was to test experimentally which sensory food feature influences food acceptance, which, in turn is an indication for fussy eating, in young children (32 - 48 months). Another aim was to evaluate if the behavioural measurement of food acceptance is related to parental reports of their child's fussy eating behaviour, parental feeding styles and children's BMI. In a repeated-measures-design, three sensory features were manipulated separately (i.e., colour, texture and taste) while keeping the other two features constant. The baseline measurement consisted of a well-liked yoghurt, which was presented before each manipulation variant. The number of spoons that children (N = 32) consumed from each variant were registered as behavioural indication for food acceptance. Parental reports of children's eating behaviour and parental feeding styles; and children's BMI were also measured. The manipulation of food texture caused a significant decrease in intake. Colour and taste manipulations of the yoghurt did not affect children's intake. Parental reports of children's fussy eating behaviour and parental feeding styles were not related to the behavioural observation of food acceptance. The behavioural measurement of food acceptance and parental accounts of fussy eating were not related to children's BMI. Food texture but not taste or colour alternations affected food acceptance, at least when consuming variations of a well-liked yoghurt. This knowledge is important for further research on picky-eating interventions. Parental reports of fussy eating did not concur with the behavioural observation of food acceptance. Further research is warranted to test whether these findings generalize to other food types. ",200,Bits and pieces.

The measures included the parent and teacher Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF); the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS), Free Sorting Test and Color Word Interference Test; and the Children's Kitchen Task Assessment (CKTA), a new performance measure. Twenty-two children with SCD were recruited from one hematology clinic and 22 community children, matched on characteristics of age, gender, and race, were selected from a larger sample of controls for comparison. Parents and teachers completed rating scales. As hypothesized, children with SCD scored significantly lower than matched controls on Digit Span Forward; on 5 of the 9 D-KFES Color Word Interference and Sorting tasks; on CKTA organization, initiation, and task completion; and on the BRIEF's parent and teacher Metacognitive Index (MI) and Global Executive Composite (GEC) scores.

202,202,26892106,"Use of mobile (MP) and cordless phones (CP) is common among young children, but whether the resulting radiofrequency exposure affects development of cognitive skills is not known. Small changes have been found in older children. This study focused on children's exposures to MP and CP and cognitive development. The hypothesis was that children who used these phones would display differences in cognitive function compared to those who did not. We recruited 619 fourth-grade students (8-11 years) from 37 schools around Melbourne and Wollongong, Australia. Participants completed a short questionnaire, a computerised cognitive test battery, and the Stroop colour-word test. Parents completed exposure questionnaires on their child's behalf. Analysis used multiple linear regression. The principal exposure-metrics were the total number of reported MP and CP calls weekly categorised into no use ('None'); use less than or equal to the median amount ('Some'); and use more than the median ('More'). The median number of calls/week was 2.5 for MP and 2.0 for CP. MP and CP use for calls was low; and only 5 of 78 comparisons of phone use with cognitive measures were statistically significant. The reaction time to the response-inhibition task was slower in those who used an MP 'More' compared to the 'Some' use group and non-users. For CP use, the response time to the Stroop interference task was slower in the 'More' group versus the 'Some' group, and accuracy was worse in visual recognition and episodic memory tasks and the identification task. In an additional exploratory analysis, there was some evidence of a gender effect on mean reaction times. The highest users for both phone types were girls. Overall, there was little evidence cognitive function was associated with CP and MP use in this age group. Although there was some evidence that effects of MP and CP use on cognition may differ by gender, this needs further exploration. CP results may be more reliable as parents estimated children's phone use and the CPs were at home; results for CP use were broadly consistent with our earlier study of older children.

The aim of this quality improvement initiative was to test the implementation of a colour-coded universal protocol in a Guatemalan hospital staffed by US and Guatemalan providers. From 2013 to 2016, a US and Guatemalan team implemented a universal protocol at a Guatemalan surgical centre for children undergoing general surgical or urologic procedures. The protocol was a two-step patient identification and documentation checklist, with the first step of all chart element verification in the preoperative area, after which a blue hat was placed on the patient as a visual cue that this was completed. The second step included checklist confirmation in the operating room prior to the procedure. We tested protocol implementation over three phases, identifying implementation barriers and modifying clinical workflow after each phase. We measured the error rate in documentation or other universal protocol steps at each phase and made modifications based on iterative analysis. Over the course of programme implementation, we substantially decreased the rate of errors in documentation or other universal protocol elements. After the first phase, 30/51 patients (58.8%) had at least one error. By the third phase, only 2/43 patients (4.6%) had any errors. All errors were corrected prior to surgery with no adverse outcomes. Care teams of providers from different countries pose potential challenges with patient safety.

207,207,31276758,"To evaluate the feasibility of coronary vessel wall visualization using three-dimensional turbo spin-echo black blood imaging (3D-TSE) in children with Kawasaki disease. Nine patients (6 girls and 3 boys; mean age ± standard deviation, 5.6 ± 3.3 years; range, 1.4-10.3 years) were included. Coronary magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) with an axial slice orientation and 3D-TSE with axial and sagittal slice orientations (3D-TSE-axi and 3D-TSE-sag) were acquired for the whole heart. Coronary vessel walls were evaluated separately in aneurysm and normal-proximal regions. The internal diameter and wall thickness of the reformatted cross-sectional images were measured in both the regions. Reproducibility between MRA and 3D-TSE was evaluated via interclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Bland-Altman plots. In total, 164 points (aneurysmal regions, 73; normal-proximal regions, 64; normal-distal regions, 27) were evaluated. The ICC for 3D-TSE-axi was higher than that for 3D-TSE-sag (aneurysmal regions, ICC = 0.88 and 0.81; normal-proximal regions, ICC = 0.90 and 0.32, respectively).

The construction of the grammar scores was inspired by the Index of Productive Syntax (IPSyn), modified for German and computerised. The detailed results provide a comprehensive profile of a child's syntactic and morphological strengths and weaknesses. Analysis of data collected from 348 monolingual German children who formed part of the norming sample, aged between 2;6 and 6;11 years of age, revealed age-related changes in these scores.

215,215,27437048,"Physicians caring for children with serious acute neurologic disease must process overwhelming amounts of physiological and medical information. Strategies to optimize real time display of this information are understudied. Our goal was to engage clinical and engineering experts to develop guiding principles for creating a pediatric neurology intensive care unit (neuroPICU) monitor that integrates and displays data from multiple sources in an intuitive and informative manner. To accomplish this goal, an international group of physicians and engineers communicated regularly for one year. We integrated findings from clinical observations, interviews, a survey, signal processing, and visualization exercises to develop a concept for a neuroPICU display. Key conclusions from our efforts include: (1) A neuroPICU display should support (a) rapid review of retrospective time series (i.e. cardiac, pulmonary, and neurologic physiology data), (b) rapidly modifiable formats for viewing that data according to the specialty of the reviewer, and (c) communication of the degree of risk of clinical decline. (2) Specialized visualizations of physiologic parameters can highlight abnormalities in multivariable temporal data. Examples include 3-D stacked spider plots and color coded time series plots. (3) Visual summaries of EEG with spectral tools (i.e. hemispheric asymmetry and median power) can highlight seizures via patient-specific ""fingerprints."" (4) Intuitive displays should emphasize subsets of physiology and processed EEG data to provide a rapid gestalt of the current status and medical stability of a patient. A well-designed neuroPICU display must present multiple datasets in dynamic, flexible, and informative views to accommodate clinicians from multiple disciplines in a variety of clinical scenarios.

A quality improvement project sought to reduce lost OR time due to cancelation. Key drivers of the process included effective 2-way communication with families, compliance with fasting rules, and decision-making on patient illness before the day of surgery. A multidisciplinary team conducted serial tests of change addressing the various key drivers. Interventions were simplified, colorful, personalized preoperative instruction sheets and text-message reminders to caregivers' cellphones, as well as a defined institutional decision-making pathway to permit rescheduling before the day of surgery in case of patient illness concerns. After initial smaller-scale testing, the interventions were implemented across all patients and sites. Data were collected from the hospital information technology system and analyzed by using control charts and statistical process control methods. Mean OR time lost due to DoSC was decreased from a baseline of 5.7 to 3.6 hours/day in testing with a subset of surgical services at the hospital's base campus, and then from 6.6 hours to 5.5 hours/day when implemented across all services at both surgical sites. By applying quality improvement methods, significant reductions were made in time lost due to DoSC. The impact can be significant by improving institutional resource utilization.

A relatively longer period after V-PDT is needed to accurately assess the final response of PWS microcirculation to the treatment. In this study, we intended to use laser speckle imaging (LSI) to assess the tissue perfusion changes of PWS at follow-up after V-PDT and preliminarily analyze the relationship between perfusion change and color bleaching. Seventeen patients with 40 PWS lesions were scanned by LSI before and 3-6 months after they received V-PDT. The speckle flow indices of PWS lesions and normal skin before and at follow-up after V-PDT were recorded. We also performed analyses on the correlation between perfusion changes and color bleaching. Before V-PDT, the 40 PWS lesions showed higher perfusion than the normal skin (1,421 ± 463 and 1,115 ± 386 perfusion unit (PU), respectively, P < 0.01). The PWS lesions scanned at follow-up showed decreased perfusion level compared to the preoperative values (1,282 ± 460 and 1,421 ± 463 PU, respectively, P < 0.01). After V-PDT, the perfusion change rates coincide well with the color bleaching rates (correlation coefficient, 0.73). In conclusion, the LSI system is capable of imaging PWS perfusion precisely, and it has shown promising results in assessing the changes of tissue perfusion of V-PDT for PWS, with objective and quantitative data, real-time images, and a shorter detection time.

The emissions include a myriad of toxic air pollutants and carbon dioxide (CO₂), which is the most important human-produced climate-altering greenhouse gas. Synergies between air pollution and climate change can magnify the harm to children. Impacts include impairment of cognitive and behavioral development, respiratory illness, and other chronic diseases-all of which may be ""seeded"" in utero and affect health and functioning immediately and over the life course. By impairing children's health, ability to learn, and potential to contribute to society, pollution and climate change cause children to become less resilient and the communities they live in to become less equitable. The developing fetus and young child are disproportionately affected by these exposures because of their immature defense mechanisms and rapid development, especially those in low- and middle-income countries where poverty and lack of resources compound the effects.

This study aimed to identify early life (perinatal and during the first year of life) predictors of low cognitive performance at age 6. A birth cohort study started in the city of Pelotas, southern Brazil, in 2004 and children were followed from birth to age six. Information on a broad set of biological and social predictors was collected. Cognitive ability-the study outcome-was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC). IQ scores were standardized into z-scores and low IQ defined as z < -1. We applied bootstrapping methods for internal validation with a multivariate logistic regression model and carried out external validation using a second study from the 1993 Pelotas Birth Cohort. The proportion of children with IQ z-score < -1 was 16.9% (95% CI 15.6-18.1). The final model included the following early life variables: child's gender; parents' skin color; number of siblings; father's and mother's employment status; household income; maternal education; number of persons per room; duration of breastfeeding; height-for-age deficit; head circumference-for-age deficit; parental smoking during pregnancy; and maternal perception of the child's health status. The area under the ROC curve for our final model was 0.8, with sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 74%. Similar results were found when testing external validation by using data from the 1993 Pelotas Birth Cohort. The study results suggest that a child's and her/his family's social conditions are strong predictors of cognitive ability in childhood. Interventions for promoting a healthy early childhood development are needed targeting children at risk of low IQ so that they can reach their full cognitive potential.

Data were retrospectively abstracted from 839 patients in Rochester, Minnesota, at birth, 4 to 6, and 10 to 12 years. Height was plotted on LBT to determine estimated weight and corresponding color zone. Patient's weight-based color zone was obtained by plotting measured weight on LBT. Degrees of discrepancy between length-based and actual weight-based color zones were assessed. Total of 544, 520, and 143 subjects were analyzed at birth, 4 to 6, and 10 to 12 years, respectively, with a subset of 103 subjects measured longitudinally at more than 1 age strata. Among infants, all LBT color zones were the same as actual weight-based color zones. In children aged 4 to 6 years, 70% (n = 361) of LBT-estimated color zones were the same as actual weight-based color zones; LBT underestimated 19% (n = 99) by 1 color zone, 0.5% (n = 3) were underestimated by 2 color zones, 0.5% (n = 3) exceeded weight limit on LBT, and 10% (n = 54) were overestimated by 1 color zone. In adolescents aged 10 to 12 years, 40.6% (n = 58) of LBT-estimated color zones were the same as actual weight-based color zones; LBT underestimated 3.5% (n = 5) by 1 color zone, 44.1% (n = 63) exceeded weight limit on LBT, 11.2% (n = 16) were overestimated by 1 color zone, and 0.6% (n = 1) were overestimated by 2 color zones. Overall, LBT reasonably estimates appropriate color zones for drug dosing. However, LBT tends to underestimate color zones among younger obese children and adolescents.

234,234,21926033,"The proposition that synthetic food colors can induce adverse behavioral effects in children was first enunciated in 1975 by Feingold [Why Your Child Is Hyperactive. New York:Random House (1975)], who asserted that elevated sensitivity to food additives underlies the signs of hyperactivity observed in some children. Although the evidence suggested that some unknown proportion of children did respond to synthetic food colors, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) interpreted the evidence as inconclusive. A study published in 2007 [McCann et al. Food additives and hyperactive behaviour in 3-year-old and 8/9-year-old children in the community: a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Lancet 370:1560-1567 (2007)] drew renewed attention to the hypothesis because of the study's size and scope. It led the FDA to review the evidence, hold a public hearing, and seek the advice of its Food Advisory Committee. In preparation for the hearing, the FDA reviewed the available evidence and concluded that it did not warrant further agency action. In this commentary I examine the basis of the FDA's position, the elements of the review that led to its decision and that of the Food Advisory Committee, and the reasons that this is an environmental health issue. The FDA review confined itself, in essence, to the clinical diagnosis of hyperactivity, as did the charge to the committee, rather than asking the broader environmental question of behavioral effects in the general population; it failed to recognize the significance of vulnerable subpopulations; and it misinterpreted the meaning of effect size as a criterion of risk. The FDA's response would have benefited from adopting the viewpoints and perspectives common to environmental health research. At the same time, the food color debate offers a lesson to environmental health researchers; namely, too narrow a focus on a single outcome or criterion can be misleading.

A sample of 370 children (182 boys and 188 girls) in the second and third years of kindergarten. Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration, 6th Edition (VMI-6). Data for preschool children from an ongoing project were retrieved. AI models were trained to use photographs of activity products to predict total score on the VMI-6. R2 values were used to identify the variance in VMI-6 standardized scores explained by predicted scores from the activities. That is, R2 values reflected associations between activity performance and VMI. The R2 values for the combination of origami and copying were the largest (.390-.577). These R2 values were larger than those for each individual activity (.340-.473) and similar to those for the combination of all three activities (.400-.550). Because moderate R2 values were found between performance of the three activity products and VMI, the three activities have high potential for use in identifying children's level of VMI or as teaching materials to facilitate the development of children's VMI. Furthermore, combining origami and copying activities is recommended for teachers and clinicians who need to address VMI.

However, the wealth of scientific placebo research is conceptualized in a biomedical context, i.e. based on placebos provided with a biomedical treatment rationale, whereas little is known about effects and mechanisms of placebos provided with a psychological treatment rationale. This has important repercussions not only on placebo research, but also on attempts to establish specificity of psychological interventions, such as psychotherapy. Therefore, we set out to assess the effects and possible components of placebos provided with a psychological treatment rationale in three experiments on healthy subjects. We show that placebos provided with a psychological treatment rationale are effective in short- as well as mid-term, but only when provided by a trustworthy, friendly and empathetic experimenter. These findings indicate that placebos are effective outside the medical context and thus need be controlled for in non-medical trials. Furthermore, it highlights and confirms the importance of a plausible psychological treatment rationale in the context of a therapeutic alliance for psychological interventions, such as psychotherapy.

Assessment of patients' severity of dehydration is integral to appropriate care and management. Urine colour has been shown to have a high correlation with overall assessment of hydration status. This study tests the feasibility of measuring dehydration severity in dengue fever patients by comparing urine colour captured by mobile phone cameras to established laboratory parameters. Photos of urine samples were taken in a customized photo booth, then processed using Adobe Photoshop to index urine colour into the red, green, and blue (RGB) colour space and assigned a unique RGB value. The RGB values were then correlated with patients' clinical and laboratory hydration indices using Pearson's correlation and multiple linear regression. There were strong correlations between urine osmolality and the RGB of urine colour, with r = -0.701 (red), r = -0.741 (green), and r = -0.761 (blue) (all p-value <0.05). There were strong correlations between urine specific gravity and the RGB of urine colour, with r = -0.759 (red), r = -0.785 (green), and r = -0.820 (blue) (all p-value <0.05). The blue component had the highest correlations with urine specific gravity and urine osmolality. There were moderate correlations between RGB components and serum urea, at r = -0.338 (red), -0.329 (green), -0.360 (blue). In terms of urine biochemical parameters linked to dehydration, multiple linear regression studies showed that the green colourimetry code was predictive of urine osmolality (β coefficient -0.082, p-value <0.001) while the blue colourimetry code was predictive of urine specific gravity (β coefficient -2,946.255, p-value 0.007).

So far, limited data is available regarding the best radiologic approach to monitor children after liver transplantation. To harmonize the imaging of pediatric liver transplantation, the European Society of Pediatric Radiology Abdominal Taskforce initiated a survey addressing the current status of imaging including the pre-, intra-, and postoperative phases. This paper reports the responses related to postoperative imaging. An online survey, initiated in 2021, asked European centers performing pediatric liver transplantation 48 questions about their imaging approach. In total, 26 centers were contacted, and 22 institutions from 11 countries returned the survey. All sites commence ultrasound (US) monitoring within 24 h after liver transplantation. Monitoring frequency varies across sites, ranging from every 8 h to 72 h in early, and from daily to sporadic use in late postoperative phases. Predefined US protocols are used by 73% of sites. This commonly includes gray scale, color Doppler, and quantitative flow assessment. Alternative flow imaging techniques, contrast-enhanced US, and elastography are applied at 31.8%, 18.2%, and 63.6% of sites, respectively. Computed tomography is performed at 86.4% of sites when clarification is needed. Magnetic resonance imaging is used for selected cases at 36.4% of sites, mainly for assessment of biliary abnormalities or when blood tests are abnormal. Diagnostic imaging is extensively used for postoperative surveillance of children after liver transplantation. While US is generally prioritized, substantial differences were noted in US protocol, timing, and monitoring frequency.

246,246,38039798,"Language can affect cognition, but through what mechanism? Substantial past research has focused on how labeling can elicit categorical representation during online processing. We focus here on a particularly powerful type of language-relational language-and show that relational language can enhance relational representation in children through an embodied attention mechanism. Four-year-old children were given a color-location conjunction task, in which they were asked to encode a two-color square, split either vertically or horizontally (e.g., red on the left, blue on the right), and later recall the same configuration from its mirror reflection. During the encoding phase, children in the experimental condition heard relational language (e.g., ""Red is on the left of blue""), while those in the control condition heard generic non-relational language (e.g., ""Look at this one, look at it closely""). At recall, children in the experimental condition were more successful at choosing the correct relational representation between the two colors compared to the control group. Moreover, they exhibited different attention patterns as predicted by the attention shift account of relational representation (Franconeri et al., 2012). To test the sustained effect of language and the role of attention, during the second half of the study, the experimental condition was given generic non-relational language. There was a sustained advantage in the experimental condition for both behavioral accuracies and signature attention patterns. Overall, our findings suggest that relational language enhances relational representation by guiding learners' attention, and this facilitative effect persists over time even in the absence of language. Implications for the mechanism of how relational language can enhance the learning of relational systems (e.g., mathematics, spatial cognition) by guiding attention will be discussed.

249,249,11722856,"This qualitative study explored the knowledge, perceptions, and autonomy of 7- and 12-year-old children relative to the management of their asthma. A total of 32 children with moderate to severe asthma were interviewed using an open-ended drawing interview and a semi-structured interview. The triangulation of results from these two methods revealed developmental differences. Younger children identified medicines by shape, color, or lay terms, relied on adults to manage their asthma, and did not recognize warning symptoms of an attack. Older children mastered biomedical terminology and used medicines independently, although they sometimes asked for the assistance of an adult. All children perceived benefits and non-monetary costs of asthma medicines. However, they lacked understanding of the categories and role of asthma medicines. This study suggests that long-term control and quick-relief metered dose inhalers should be identifiable by consistent color-coding, and that professionals should tailor asthma education and information to children's stages of cognitive development.

A retrospective observational study of children attending an Australian tertiary children's hospital. From 49,565 patients extracted from the database, 37,114 children with age and weight and 37,091 children with age and height recorded were included in the analysis. Best Guess was the most accurate, with the smallest overall mean difference 0.86 kg. For <1 year old, Broselow tape was the most accurate (mean difference -0.43 kg), Best Guess was the most accurate for ages 1-5 years and 11-14 years (mean difference 0.27 and 0.20 kg respectively), and the updated APLS formula was the most accurate for 6-10 year-old (mean difference 0.42 kg). The Broselow tape was able to only classify 48.9% of children into the correct weight colour band. For an age-based weight estimation, in infants less than one year the new APLS formula is the most accurate and over one year the Best Guess formulae should be used.

Ninety-seven children, 38 males and 59 females, between the ages of 5 to 13 years (median 7.7 years) undergoing RPE procedures with the Hyrax, Dentaurum, Newtown, PA, appliance were surveyed. The appliance was expanded with either one or two turns (1/4 mm/turn) per day based on the provider's preference. The child's pain response was measured no more than 5 minutes after each turn for the entire period of expansion using both the Facial Pain Scale and the Color Analog Scale. Ninety-eight percent of the children reported at least some pain during RPE. The highest levels of pain were reported during the first 10 turns with the greatest intensity during the first 6 turns and a steadily decreasing amount of pain thereafter. Pain medication was taken after 7% of the expansion turns in the study with the majority of children taking the medication during the first 6 turns. Forty-eight percent of the children took pain medication at least once during the expansion phase of RPE. There was no difference in either reported pain or use of pain medication based on age, sex, or stage of dentition. During the first 10 turns, children whose rate of expansion was two turns/day were more likely to report pain and take pain medication than children whose rate of expansion was one turn/day, thereafter there were no differences. The vast majority of children undergoing the active phase of rapid palatal expansion with a Hyrax appliance report pain.

We conducted a search until May 2019, obtaining 16 articles from which 30 independent studies were extracted, which were considered as units of analysis. Four outcome measures were extracted from each study: retention, marginal integrity, anatomic form, and absence of recurrent caries. Separate meta-analyses were carried for each outcome and multiple meta-regression model was applied. The outcomes with the highest mean success rates were absence of recurrent caries and anatomic form. The type of material significantly influenced success rates. The best materials were resin-based material plus total-etching adhesion and resin-modified glass ionomer cement (RMGIC), and the worst high viscosity glass ionomer cement (HVGIC). Atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) had a lower success rate than the conventional cavity form. RMGIC had the best clinical performance and HVGIC the worst. The form of the cavity, blinding and the experience of the operator were the variables that influenced success rates. Proximal primary molar restorations should be performed with RMGIC as it combines good mechanical performance of the resins together with the prevention of secondary caries of glass ionomers.

A total of 220 teeth (one per person) were analysed using a microwave oven digestion procedure and lead content was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. Tooth lead content followed a logarithmic-normal distribution and it increased with the prevalence of caries. Tooth lead concentrations were positively correlated with all the considered dental health factors except the pH of saliva, for which there was a significant negative correlation. Coloured teeth and teeth subject to abrasion showed the highest lead content. The highest number of colonies of SL and MS in saliva paralleled the highest lead tooth levels. Teeth obtained from irregular brushers presented higher tooth lead contents than subjects with a regular toothbrushing frequency. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between tooth lead levels and dental plaque surface, Salivalis lactobacilli number, dental abrasion and dental colour.

Prior studies have identified an underlying role of inhibitory control in the manifestation of childhood-onset psychiatric symptoms. This study investigated the inhibitory control abilities of children within a severe, childhood psychiatric sample. A medical chart review was conducted for 100 children who received a neuropsychological evaluation during a children's psychiatric inpatient program hospitalization from 2010 to 2014. Three measures neurocognitive of inhibitory control, Stroop Color-Word Score, CPT-II Commission Errors, and WCST Failure to Maintain Set were used in the present study. The presence of externalizing behaviors at hospital admission was classified as poor behavioral/self-control. Forty-eight percent of the sample displayed evidence of inhibitory control impairment on neurocognitive measures, with 40% displaying response inhibition impairment and only 5-7% displaying interference control impairment. Similarly elevated rates of impairment were found in those children without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Depressive disorders were associated with interference control, while ADHD was associated with interference control and response inhibition. Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis found that response inhibition predicted a prolonged hospitalization in an older males subgroup but not in the younger males or females subgroups. Current findings suggest that inhibitory control impairments are highly prevalent in the children's psychiatric inpatient setting and associated with specific psychiatric disorders, although the influence of these impairments on subsequent outcome may be limited to a select portion of children.

The aim of this study was to determine whether accuracy of parental perception of children's weight status and reports of related behaviors changed following a brief pediatrics resident intervention. Parents (N = 115) of children aged 4 to 12 years enrolled in Medicaid completed baseline questionnaires with providers about prior communication of weight status and/or body mass index (BMI), perceptions of their children's weight, and children's dietary and physical activity behaviors, and children were weighed and measured. Trained residents used a toolkit to communicate weight status to parents (via color-coded BMI charts) and counseled about mutually chosen healthy behaviors. Questionnaires were repeated at 1 and 3 months, and measurements were repeated for children with BMI > or =85%. At baseline, 42% of parents of overweight children believed their children were at healthy weight. Most (n = 96; 83%) parents completed 1-month questionnaires, and 56% completed 3-month follow-up questionnaires. Improvements in fruit and vegetable consumption, sweet drinks, unhealthy snacks, frequency of restaurant food, lower-fat milk, and screen time occurred among both overweight and healthy weight children. There were also increases in discussions with providers about weight/BMI and parental accuracy of overweight assessment.

268,268,12601559,"A computer-based version of the self-report Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was developed with colourful graphics illustrating each question. One hundred and two children referred to child and adolescent mental health services were recruited and randomly allocated to complete either the new computer-based version or the paper original. A further 112 children from local schools were recruited and completed the computer-based version of the scale. All children who took part in the study were aged between 8 and 15 years. The paper version of the SDQ is recommended for use in children aged 11 and over and, in this age group, the computer-based questionnaire was able to discriminate between the clinical and community sample (ROC = 0.761, 95 % CI 0.676-0.846). Comparison of the paper-based SDQ and computer-based SDQ within the clinic sample found trends towards better test-retest reliability, inter-rater reliability and significantly better user satisfaction in the computer version compared to the paper-based version. The computer-based SDQ has the added advantage of results being automatically added to a spreadsheet out of view from the user reducing the chance of operator error in coding and entering the data.

275,275,30399064,"A ""brief resolved unexplained event"" refers to sudden alterations in an infant's breathing, color, tone, or responsiveness that prompt the parent or caregiver to seek emergency medical care. A recently published clinical practice guideline encourages discharging many of these infants home from the emergency department if they have a benign presentation. The goal is to avoid aggressive inpatient investigations of uncertain benefit. The present research explored parents' reactions to the prospect of returning home with their infant following such an event. The study used qualitative research methods to analyze semistructured, audio-recorded interviews of parents who had witnessed a brief resolved unexplained event between 2011 and 2015 and taken their infant to the emergency department of an academic teaching hospital. A total of 22 parent interviews were conducted. The infants included 8 boys and 14 girls aged 3.6 ± 3.5 months (mean ± SD). Qualitative analysis of interview transcripts revealed a near-universal apprehension about the child's well-being, ambivalence about the best course of action after the evaluation in the emergency department, and need for reassurance about the unlikelihood of a recurrence. Parents did not, however, answer the main research question with a single voice: attitudes toward the return-home scenario ranged from unthinkable to extreme relief. Two-thirds of parents expressed at least some reservations about the idea of returning home. Successful implementation of the 2016 guideline will require close attention to the parent's point of view. Otherwise, parental resistance is likely to compromise clinicians' best efforts.

Outcomes included parental-reported versus actual understanding of BMI, the odds (obtained by generalized estimating equations) of answering parallel questions correctly by using standard versus color-coded charting, and odds of answering questions correctly on the basis of numeracy and literacy. Many parents (60%) reported knowing what BMI was, but only 30% could define it even roughly correctly. When parents used color-coded charts, they had greater odds of answering parallel BMI charting questions correctly than when they used standard charts (mean, 88% vs 65% correct; pooled adjusted odds ratio, 4.32; 95% confidence interval, 3.14-5.95; P < .01). Additionally, parents with lower numeracy (K-5 level) benefited more from color-coded charts (increased from 51% to 81% correct) than did higher numeracy parents (high school level or greater), who performed well with both charts (89% vs 99% correct).

The purpose of these measurements was to determine whether the visual colour impression of a fresh traumatic extravasation can give information on the localisation of the haemorrhage in a certain tissue layer. After visual assessment of the colour of the bruise, the spectral reflectance curves and the CIE-L*a*b* colour values were determined with the help of a diode array spectrophotometer. The localisation and size of the haemorrhages in the cutis and/or subcutis were evaluated morphologically after incision of the skin. It was confirmed that there is a relationship between the colour impression and the localisation of the bruise. Bruises localised near the surface have a more reddish appearance while bruises in deeper layers give a more bluish colour impression. An explanation may be found in the optical characteristics of skin. Blood localised in the subcutis appears blue on the surface due to scattering processes in the dermis (Rayleigh scattering), as the blue wavelengths of the light are scattered (and thus reflected) to a greater extent than the red wavelengths.

The current study is a prospective, controlled, and randomized trial (RCT). School-aged children who required venipuncture were involved in the study. Pediatric patients were randomly assigned to four groups: the TICK-B group, the cough trick group, the inflation of balloons, and the control groups. Before and after the procedure, the children and their parents were interviewed. Wong-Baker (FACES) Pain Rating Scale was applied to measure the severity of pain. Children's Fear Scale was applied to measure children's fear. This study involved the 160 children (mean age, 8.39-2.18 years). The severity of pain and fear levels among the children during and after the procedure were significantly different (p = 0.001). Pain and fear were significantly decreased in children in the intervention groups compared with those in the control group (p < 0.05). In the TICK-B group, participants reported significantly less pain and fear during the venipuncture procedure than in the cough trick, balloon inflation, and control groups (P = 0.001, p = 0.001, p = 0.001) and after the procedure (p = 0.001, p = 0.002, p = 0.002). There was a similar significance found in the level of fear during the procedure (p = 0.001, p = 0.002, p = 0.006), and after the procedure (p = 0.001, p = 0.008, p = 0.015).    Conclusion: TICK-B was the most effective method for decreasing the pain and fear of children associated with venipuncture procedures. Furthermore, the distraction technique of coughing and inflating balloons also proved efficacious in decreasing the pain and fear of children during venipuncture.    Trial registration: The study has been registered with ClinicalTrials.org under the number NCT04983303. It was retrospectively registered on July 26, 2021. What is Known: • Venipuncture, one of the most painful and uncomfortable procedures for children, caused great fear and discomfort during the procedure.

286,286,38216682,"Liver transplantation is the state-of-the-art curative treatment for end-stage liver disease. Imaging is a key element in the detection of intraoperative and postoperative complications. So far, only limited data regarding the best radiological approach to monitor children during liver transplantation is available. To harmonize the imaging of pediatric liver transplantation, the European Society of Pediatric Radiology Abdominal Taskforce initiated a survey addressing the current status of imaging including the pre-, intra- and postoperative phase. This paper reports the responses related to intraoperative imaging. An online survey, initiated in 2021, asked European centers performing pediatric liver transplantation 48 questions about their imaging approach. In total, 26 centers were contacted, and 22 institutions from 11 countries returned the survey. Intraoperative ultrasound (US) is used by all sites to assess the quality of the vascular anastomosis in order to ensure optimal perfusion of the liver transplant. Vessel depiction is commonly achieved using color Doppler (95.3%). Additional US-based techniques are employed by fewer centers (power angio mode, 28.6%; B-flow, 19%; contrast-enhanced US, 14.3%). Most centers prefer a collaborative approach, with surgeons responsible for probe handling, while radiologists operate the US machine (47.6%). Less commonly, the intraoperative US is performed by the surgeon alone (28.6%) or by the radiologist alone (23.8%). Timing of US, imaging frequency, and documentation practices vary among centers. Intraoperative US is consistently utilized across all sites during pediatric liver transplantation. However, considerable variations were observed in terms of the US setup, technique preferences, timing of controls, and documentation practices. These differences provide valuable insights for future optimization and harmonization studies.

Currently, only conventional imaging techniques are employed; however, alternative imaging modalities using visible and non-visible light may provide additional information. We sought to determine the image modality preferences of paediatricians and the between-observer agreement therein. Nine paediatricians who work in child protection independently compared five image modalities (conventional colour, conventional grey-scale, cross-Polarised, ultraviolet, and infrared) of four bruises, with a compliance rate of 95%. All images were taken using a standardised set of protocols with Nikon D90 cameras and 105-mm macro-lenses. The paediatricians almost unanimously chose cross-Polarised as their preferred modality for all four bruises when assessing boundary, shape, colour, size, and absence of light reflectance. Conventional colour and grey-scale imaging were typically ranked second and third. Ultraviolet and infrared were consistently ranked in the least two favourable positions. Between-observer agreement on ranking order was high, with coefficients of concordance ranging from 0.76 to 0.96. Combinations of imaging modalities chosen to give the most complete picture of the bruise predominantly consisted of cross-Polarised and conventional (colour and grey-scale).

Nurses performed FoCUS on 2018 children aged five to 15 years, and assessed any valvular regurgitation. An experienced pediatric cardiologist assessed the quality of ultrasound images and measured any recorded regurgitation. The assessment of the presence of regurgitation and measurement of the longest jet by the nurse and cardiologist was compared, using the Bland-Altman method.

ETT position was confirmed by physical examination, pulse oximetry, and in some patients, arterial blood gases and chest roentgenograms. ETT position was also assessed using the Capno-Flo after six breaths after intubation and was read as positive if the color changed from purple to yellow (tracheal tube position) and negative if the strip remained purple (esophageal tube position). The Capno-Flo ambu-bag was used continuously during transport and evaluated by the nurses or respiratory therapists, who also completed a brief questionnaire. Two esophageal and 37 tracheal tube positions were correctly identified by the device. There were no false-positive or false-negative results; the device was 100% sensitive and specific for the initial reading. It sometimes took longer to obtain this initial reading (> six breaths) in three patients. During transport, most personnel (36/38) noted minimal or no color change during inspiration and expiration, and therefore, it was not helpful in the continued verification of ETT position.

I performed a search of the American National Library of Medicine's PubMed with the following key words: ""local anesthetic"" and ""methemoglobinemia."" Two-hundred-forty-two episodes (40.1% published in year 2000 or after) were found. Chocolate-colored blood suggests methemoglobinemia but other colors may be found. A discrepancy between the pulse oximeter saturation (< or = 90%) and the arterial oxygen partial pressure (> or = 70 mm Hg) was present in 91.8% of the episodes. The difference between oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry and co-oximetry varied from -6.2% to 44.7%. Plain prilocaine may induce clinically symptomatic methemoglobinemia in children older than 6 mo at doses exceeding 2.5 mg/kg. In adults, the dose of prilocaine should be kept lower than 5.0 mg/kg, which is reduced to 3.2 mg/kg in the presence of renal insufficiency and to 1.3 mg/kg if other oxidizing drugs are used concurrently. A single spray of benzocaine may induce methemoglobinemia. Clinical symptoms may be observed at relatively low methemoglobin values, including coma at 32.2 and 29.1% in children and adults, respectively. Rebound methemoglobinemia (benzocaine on mucous membranes) with methemoglobin values as high as 59.9% may occur up to 18 h after methylene blue administration. Complications of methemoglobinemia include hypoxic encephalopathy, myocardial infarction, and death. Benzocaine should no longer be used. Prilocaine should not be used in children younger than 6-mo-old, in pregnant women, or in patients taking other oxidizing drugs. The dose should be limited to 2.5 mg/kg.

Final colour is considered an important outcome after superficial removal techniques such as curettage, dermabrasion or laser ablation, and is often compared with colour at birth. To quantify the natural history of CMN lightening over time, and explore phenotypic and genotypic predictors of colour change. A longitudinal cohort study was undertaken of 110 patients with CMN (mean follow-up 5·3 years). Accurate colour-space measurements were taken from professional serial photographs of CMN and normal skin. Changes in colour over time were modelled using multiple logistic regression, against phenotypic and genotypic variables. Lightening of CMN was significantly associated with lighter normal skin colour (P < 0·001) and with MC1R variant alleles (red/blonde hair gene) (P < 0·001), but not with CMN colour in the first 3 months of life, NRAS genotype or projected adult size of CMN. Importantly, the final colours of adjacent treated and untreated areas of CMN were indistinguishable. Final CMN colour in childhood is related to the genetically determined skin colour of the individual, is unrelated to the colour of CMN at birth, and is unaffected by superficial removal. What's already known about this topic? Final colour of congenital melanocytic naevi (CMN) is considered an important outcome after superficial removal techniques such as curettage, dermabrasion or laser ablation, and is often compared with colour at birth. The phenomenon of spontaneous lightening in CMN, in which naevi lighten gradually and sometimes dramatically during childhood, has been described but not systematically studied. What does this study add? Final CMN colour in childhood is significantly associated with the individual's normal skin colour, and with MC1R genotype, and is therefore genetically determined. Final CMN colour is not predictable from CMN colour in the first 3 months of life. Superficial removal techniques do not alter the final colour of CMN.

303,303,18274044,"In the event of a terrorist attack or natural disaster, large numbers of children may be separated from their families and caregivers. Many of these children will present for treatment at emergency departments or be evacuated to relocation sites. Depending on their age, some children may not be able to give their name or may be too frightened to give any information, making identification difficult. At the same time, parents will instinctively rush to hospitals to find their children. In the process, parents may unintentionally obstruct medical care, overwhelm an already stressed staff, and violate patient privacy as they frantically search for their children. Currently, there is no system in the United States that effectively expedites the reunification of children with their families when children can not be identified by healthcare or public health personnel. We propose the creation of a system that employs advanced imaging and feature-extraction technology. We envision a system in which digital images of individual children are captured as they enter a facility, with these images then being automatically transmitted and posted on a secure Web site. Features of each image, such as hair and eye color, would be automatically indexed and cataloged. With the help of trained professionals, parents could enter their child's features into the system and receive a limited set of images for identification, allowing for rapid reunification of the family. Additional advanced features of such a system will be explored. If successful, the use of such a system would address an important unmet need in pediatric emergency preparedness.

FDA conducts food safety education programs in schools and regular market surveys of foods containing prohibited artificial colors. However, the consumption of foods containing FDA-prohibited artificial colors among school children is understudied. This study aimed to assess the consumption of foods containing FDA-prohibited artificial colors among middle-school children in Nay Pyi Taw Union Territory, Myanmar. A cross-sectional study was conducted at eight public schools in Nay Pyi Taw Union Territory in 2017. The schools were selected using simple random sampling with a drawing method. In total, 776 students (359 boys and 417 girls) participated in face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire and photos of foods containing artificial color published by FDA. A multiple logistic regression was performed to estimate adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for consumption of such foods. In total, 519 (66.9%) children consumed foods with the FDA-prohibited colors. It was revealed that students at suburban schools were nearly five times more likely to consume foods containing FDA-prohibited artificial colors (AOR = 4.84; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.99-7.82) compared to those at urban schools. In addition, being in the seventh grade (AOR = 3.38; 95% CI 2.30-4.98), availability of prohibited food in school canteen (AOR = 6.16; 95% CI 2.67-14.22), and having a less educated father (AOR = 1.76; 95% CI 1.06-2.92) were positively associated with consumption of the foods with the prohibited colors. More than half of the students consumed foods with the prohibited colors. Consumption was more frequent among students from suburban schools, those with unsafe foods accessible at their school canteen, seventh graders, and students with a less educated father. The findings highlighted that school food safety programs, which focus on preventing consumption of foods containing FDA-prohibited artificial colors, are urgently required.

This was a multicenter, prospective, cross-sectional study. A convenience sample of pediatricians and other front-line physicians who treat acutely injured children in the United States and Canada were eligible for participation. Using a web-based education and assessment platform, physicians deliberately practiced with a spectrum of 300 pediatric burn and bruise injury image-based cases. Participants were asked if there was a suspicion for abuse present or absent, were given corrective feedback after every case, and received summative diagnostic performance overall (accuracy), suspicion for abuse present (sensitivity), and absent (specificity). Of the 93/137 (67.9%) physicians who completed all 300 cases, there was a significant reduction in diagnostic error (initial 16.7%, final 1.6%; delta -15.1%; 95% CI -13.5, -16.7), sensitivity error (initial 11.9%, final 0.7%; delta -11.2%; 95% CI -9.8, -12.5), and specificity error (initial 23.3%, final 6.6%; delta -16.7%; 95% CI -14.8, -18.6). Based on 35 627 case interpretations, variables associated with diagnostic error included patient age, sex, skin color, mechanism of injury, and size and pattern of injury. The education intervention substantially reduced diagnostic error in differentiating the presence vs absence of a suspicion for abuse in children with burn and bruise injuries.

The purpose of this study is to determine the accuracy and time interval for the Capno-Flo monitor to detect acute airway obstructions and hypopharyngeal extubations in an intubated animal model. Five anesthetized, non-paralyzed, mechanically ventilated Yorkshire minipigs. Complete and partial airway obstruction was simulated with complete and partial cross-clamping of the endotracheal (ET) tube. Placement of the ET tube into the hypopharynx was performed to simulate accidental extubation. In addition to the Capno-Flo colorimetric indicator, both sidestream (SS) and mainstream (MS) capnography were used to monitor end-tidal CO2 and comparison. The time intervals for the capnograph wave to flatten and for the monitor to display ""zero"" were recorded after each airway alteration. Each experiment was carried out for 180 seconds, and a total of 25 trials was performed. Complete obstruction produced a color change in the Capno-Flo monitor in 9+/-2 seconds and flattening of the SS and MS waveform in 8+/-2 seconds and 6+/-2 seconds, respectively. The SS and MS monitors displayed zero in 49+/-7 seconds and 19+/-1 seconds, respectively. Partial obstruction did not produce color change, a flattening of the wave, or a monitor display of zero. Hypopharyngeal extubation produced a color change in 10+/-2 seconds, flattening of the SS and MS waveform in 7+/-2 seconds and 7+/-1 seconds, respectively. The SS and MS monitors displayed ""zero"" in 76+/-16 seconds and 18+/-3 seconds, respectively. The Capno-Flo identified all complete airway obstructions and hypopharyngeal extubations rapidly.

This qualitative study is based on 26 interviews with key actors, and 170 publicly available documents, including 22 obtained through freedom of information (FOI) requests related to four purposively selected PPPs aiming to improve health. We found that the four PPPs studied had minimal public information available on their implementation and impact. The private partners tend to dictate the design, information management, and implementation of the programs, while promoting their brands. Few independent evaluations of the PPPs exist, and none reported on their effectiveness or public health benefits. Good governance principles, such as accountability, transparency, fairness, participation, integrity, and credibility, were barely followed in each of the cases studied. Public officials did not automatically question the conflict of interest (CoI) of such arrangements. When there were COI, the potential risks these posed did not always outweigh the financial benefits of working with the F&BI and its allies.

The mean MIs and RMIs were significantly different for vitiligo and ND. The mean RMI of ND lesions was 74+/-13, which was significantly higher than that of vitiligo lesions (50+/-24). No ND lesion had an RMI of <50%. This study shows that the Mexameter, an objective pigment-measuring device, can be used to achieve a more accurate diagnosis of hypopigmentary disorders, and that the relative melanin index (RMI), which represents the relative pigment levels, might be a more effective parameter than the melanin index (MI) itself for comparing pigmentation differences.

317,317,9655406,"A generally accepted method to assess the clinical outcome of laser treatment of portwine stains is not available. This paper describes the development and evaluation of a comprehensive questionnaire for the assessment of the following portwine stain characteristics: color (hue and lightness), sharpness of boundary, pigmentation, size, shape, skin surface-structure, and hypertrophy of underlying tissue. The questionnaire was applied to photographs of 70 patients with previously untreated portwine stains in the head/neck area. Photographs were taken before treatment and after five treatments of the entire portwine stain with a flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser. Each photograph was evaluated separately by a panel of five professionals: the treating physician, two plastic surgeons, a dermatologist, and a clinical photographer. Treatment results were assessed by comparing ratings before and after treatment. Agreement among raters was acceptable for all portwine stain characteristics, as was shown by weighted kappa analysis. The reliability of the answers was further improved by taking the average rating of the five panel members. The scores thus obtained were very reliable, with Cronbach alpha coefficients of 0.8 on average. After five treatments of the entire portwine stain, the most considerable changes were measured in the ratings for color (lightening of the stain by 33 percent), boundary (sharpness reduced by 38 percent), and size (13-percent decrease). Using the questionnaire can be helpful in the design of comparative clinical trials on portwine stain treatment and may facilitate comparison of treatment results between different treatment centers and/or different lasers.

A self-administered questionnaire was used. Almost 18% of girls and over 25% of boys reported eating in front of the TV every day. Although, overall, the boys' eating pattern was less healthy than the girls', all of the children's food choices deteriorated with increased frequency of eating in front of the TV. Compared with girls, boys gave more importance to coloured and attractive foods, and to selecting foods similar to those eaten by others. Over 50% of children reported always receiving negative weight-related comments from family members. For boys, significant correlations were found between the frequency of eating in front of the TV, the importance given to a food's appearance, and their requests to parents for advertised foods. Significance was at the p<0.05 level for all findings. These results suggest that gender should be considered in attempts to understand children's food motivations and behaviours. The findings also indicate the need to document children's eating environments, and to inform children and their families about eating behaviours that may be associated with a given environment.

Parents identified numerous barriers to their participation in such programs and reported any intervention targeting them should be able to be completed in their home, be non-judgemental, easy to read, time-efficient, easy to use, fun, colourful and interactive. Parents recommended practical communication skills (such as how to talk with children, how to raise the topic and what topics to talk about) be addressed in the intervention. They also recommended a range and combination of strategies to promote and maintain parent involvement, such as providing small rewards for the children of parents who participate.

326,326,16061568,"Access to resuscitation equipment is a critical component in delivering optimal care in pediatric arrest situations. Historically, children's hospitals and clinics have used a standard pediatric resuscitation cart (""standard cart"") in which drawers are organized by intervention (eg, intubation module, intravenous module), requiring multiple drawers to be opened during a code. Many emergency departments, however, use a pediatric resuscitation cart based on the Broselow tape (""Broselow cart"") in which each drawer is color coded and organized by patient length and weight ranges; each drawer contains all necessary equipment for resuscitation of a patient in that specific length/weight range. A literature review has revealed no studies examining the utility of either cart. To compare which resuscitation cart organization (standard versus Broselow) allows for faster access to equipment, more accurate selection of appropriately sized equipment, and better user satisfaction. Methodology. We performed a prospective, randomized, controlled, crossover trial in which 21 pediatric health care providers were assigned the role of obtaining the appropriate equipment during 2 standardized, simulated codes alternately using either a standard or Broselow cart. Time to and accuracy of the selection of appropriate medical equipment along with posttesting satisfaction were measured. All simulations were performed in the Center for Advanced Pediatric Education at Stanford University Medical Center (Stanford, CA), a training facility designed to replicate the real medical environment with the technology to allow for videotaping of scenarios. Of the 21 subjects, 62% found the Broselow cart ""easy"" or ""very easy"" to use versus 33% for the standard cart. Of the 21 subjects, 67% preferred the Broselow cart, 10% preferred the standard cart, and 23% indicated no preference. Intubation supplies and nasogastric tubes were found significantly faster when using the Broselow cart (mean time: 29.1 and 20 seconds, respectively) versus the standard cart (mean time: 38.7 and 38.2 seconds, respectively). Correct equipment was provided a statistically significant 99% of the time with the Broselow cart versus 83% of the time with the standard cart. Ten percent of the subjects had prior experience with the Broselow cart versus 62% having experience with the standard cart. Despite less prior experience with the Broselow cart, subjects in this study found it easier to use and preferred it over the standard cart. In addition, subjects located intubation equipment and nasogastric tubes significantly faster when using the Broselow cart, and correct equipment was provided significantly more often with the Broselow cart. These data suggest that sites caring for pediatric patients should consider modeling their resuscitation carts after the Broselow cart to enhance provider confidence and patient safety.

327,327,11922509,"A digital pediatric echocardiography laboratory, without videotape redundancy was established at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin in December 1998. To characterize the experience, 1198 consecutive patient studies were reviewed-50% from the first 2 months after establishing the digital protocol and 50% from the last 2 months available. Each study was stored using a protocol that was based on capture of single beat clips of relevant two-dimensional/color Doppler imaging and static frame spectral Doppler tracings. Studies were digitally compressed using a DICOM-compatible JPEG algorithm at 20:1 and edited with deletions of redundant clips to minimize archival storage needs. Study quality was uniformly excellent, and no errors were attributable to the digital protocol or compression-related loss of information. The average study required 21.5 +/- 11.4 MB of storage space with 35.4 +/- 12.3 total clips/study captured. Studies reviewed from the earlier experience were not significantly larger (23.6 +/- 14 vs 19.7 +/- 8.1 MB, 35.6 +/- 12.5 vs 35.2 +/- 12 clips) than those done recently. Studies in patients with isolated ventricular septal defect used comparable storage (23.7 +/- 8.9 MB, 42.8 +/- 11.5 clips) to that of the group as a whole.

Derivation phase: Two hundred twenty-one children undergoing ET intubation for elective surgery had their body length and leak pressures measured. The 205 children who had leak pressures between 10 and 40 cm H2O constituted the derivation set. The body length for a given ET tube size was derived from the interquartile range of patient lengths in this derivation set. Sizes for other resuscitative equipment items were chosen by a panel of experts using a modified Delphi technique. This information was placed by length on a color-coded tape. Validation phase: The tape was validated by using it to select ET tube size in another group of 203 children undergoing elective surgery. Criteria for acceptable fit in this group included leak pressure as above and the anesthesiologists' decision to accept the tube size or to retintubate. In the validation phase, length-based ET tube selections were compared with age-based rules: (age + 16)/4, and (age + 18)/4.

The Farnsworth lights are larger and brighter than many aviation signals and it has a higher pass rate than the lantern tests used in other countries. Moreover, applicants can pass by making no errors on 1 run of 18 lights, which is too small a sample. There were 3 runs of the Farnsworth lantern given to 100 male subjects with DCV. The effect on pass rate of changing the number of runs and the pass criterion was assessed. There were 20 subjects who passed the Farnsworth lantern test. Their average error rate over three runs was 3.9%; two had an error rate of 13% and five confused red and white signals, the colors used in approach path signals. One subject passed by having zero errors on run 1 but made 13% errors on the next two runs. If all subjects are given two runs after a practice run, 15% pass if the pass criterion is < or = 1 error and 11% pass if it is zero errors.

335,335,9519923,"Previous reports of telemedicine consultations have demonstrated that the technology is effective but inefficient. Little attention has been directed to the use of telemedicine in a primary care practice, especially the use of the medical peripheral devices. We used a functioning primary care practice as a telemedicine test bed, providing unselected patients in the study group. The goal was to study the performance of a new generation of a compact set of medical peripheral devices specifically designed for telemedicine examinations. In a 3-week field trial, 2 second-generation camera systems were used by physician faculty and residents in family practice to examine the skin, ears, and pharynx of 34 patients, ranging in age from 10 months to 78 years. Evaluations by the clinicians and patients were obtained. The average duration of an examination using these systems was 2 minutes. Patients' response was uniformly positive. A ""pistol grip"" video otoscope obtained an acceptable image, unless canal debris obscured the view. The system that provided pneumatic otoscopy was preferred, with some modifications necessary to obtain an airtight seal. The preferred skin camera was one that provided an image of a size that clinicians were most accustomed to viewing, although stability of this handheld camera was a problem. This camera also worked well to visualize the pharynx, especially in children with symptoms of pharyngitis. Color was deemed important in all 3 anatomical areas, and using auto-white balance and excluding fluorescent lights were preferred. Thus, the second-generation telemedicine peripheral devices were effective for use in a group of unselected primary care patients. These camera systems can be used by nursing personnel and require a minimum of time per examination.

336,336,8457360,"The aim of this study was to determine the value of pneumatic otoscopy in diagnosing otitis media with effusion in primary care. Pneumatic otoscopy was carried out for 111 children aged one to 16 years and the results obtained compared with those obtained from tympanometry. The children were those who had attended for a regular ear, nose and throat check up in the health centre of a school for the deaf during the period November 1989 to January 1990. Pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry with the GSI 28 instrument (Grason-Stadler) were carried out by a trained ear, nose and throat nurse. All relevant features determined using otoscopy--the colour, position and mobility of the tympanum--and an overall assessment were recorded. The results of tympanometry were evaluated independently of the otoscopic findings. In the population examined the predictive values of positive and negative results of pneumatic otoscopy for diagnosing effusion were high; the sensitivity was low. Serious retraction of the eardrum and absence of mobility under positive pressure were the most predictive features but the colour of the tympanum did not show any relation to effusion. In the youngest age group (one to five years) 56% of the children had abnormal otoscopic findings in either one or both ears (odds ratio for this group versus remaining children 3.75; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.75 to 15.2). The odds ratios of past and present history of upper respiratory tract infection with respect to abnormal results from otoscopy were 2.41 (95% CI 1.05 to 5.53) and 2.95 (95% CI 1.17 to 7.45), respectively. Pneumatic otoscopy carried out by an experienced health care worker is of high diagnostic value when compared with the results of tympanometry.

337,337,22298552,"Glass ionomer sealants are an alternative to resin-based sealants, especially for use in partially erupted permanent molars. The authors conducted a study to compare the retention, marginal staining and cariostatic properties of a glass ionomer sealant with those of a resin-based sealant during a 24-month period. We included in this study 39 patients aged 5 through 9 years who had bilateral partially erupted first permanent molars. One of us (S.B.) placed a resin-based sealant (Delton Plus FS+, Dentsply Professional, York, Pa.) (group D) on a partially erupted first molar in one quadrant of the maxilla or mandible and a glass ionomer sealant (GC Fuji Triage White, GC America, Alsip, Ill.) (group T) in the other quadrant. Two masked and calibrated investigators (S.A.A., J.C.) evaluated the sealants for retention, marginal staining and carious lesions at three, six, 12 and 24 months. The authors used a multinomial regression for statistical analysis (P < .05). The recall rate was 69.2 percent at 24 months. Two sealants from group D and three from group T were lost completely. Complete retention rates at 24 months were 40.7 and 44.4 percent for groups D and T, respectively. The authors found no statistically significant difference in retention rates between groups at each recall examination (P > .05). For marginal staining, sealants in the resin-based group exhibited statistically higher marginal staining than did sealants in the glass ionomer group (P < .05). Although the authors detected no caries in teeth in group T, teeth in group D in which the sealant was lost completely experienced demineralization. Resin-based and glass ionomer sealants exhibited similar retention rates at 24 months. However, marginal staining was lower in the glass ionomer group, and the authors found no caries in teeth in this group. Consequently, glass ionomer sealants may be a better choice when salivary contamination is expected. Sealing during tooth eruption presents a particular challenge owing to difficulty in isolating the tooth. Glass ionomers may be a better material for sealing partially erupted molars.

339,339,19465808,"This study investigated whether a difference exists in the ability to obtain quality mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data from hair shafts due to specific melanin content differences. Eumelanin, the pigment in darker hairs, protects nuclear DNA in the skin by absorbing and scattering UV radiation. In contrast, sensitized pheomelanin, the predominate melanin in red hairs and some blond hairs, is unable to prevent DNA damage in skin upon exposure to UV radiation. It has been reported in the literature that darker hairs (predominate eumelanin content) have a higher mtDNA sequencing success rate than lighter colored hairs. However, others have reported to the contrary when different methodologies are used. In this study, 2-cm hair fragments were cut from dark brown, red, and gray white hairs and typed using standard casework mtDNA sequence analysis methods. All 30 hair fragments produced quality mtDNA sequence data on first attempt from the second half of hypervariable region 1. These results are likely due to the apparent shielding of mtDNA by the hard protein of the hair shaft fiber from radiation-induced damage, regardless of melanin type, after 10-months minimal solar exposure. Nonetheless, this study may serve as a guide for future quantitative studies that investigate hair mtDNA photodamage in circumstances of increased solar, chemical, environmental, or mechanical damage.

To determine if VAs reduce the risk of a bicyclist-MV collision. Cases were bicyclists struck by a MV and assessed at Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, emergency departments (EDs) from May 2008 to October 2010. Controls were bicyclists with non-MV injuries. Participants were interviewed about their personal and injury characteristics, including use of VAs. Injury information was collected from charts. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for VAs during daylight and dark conditions, and adjusted for confounders using logistic regression. Missing values were imputed using chained equations and adjusted OR estimates from the imputed data were calculated. There were 2403 injured bicyclists including 278 cases. After adjusting for age, sex, type of bicycling (commuting vs. recreational) and bicyclist speed, white compared with black (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.28, 0.95), and bicyclist self-reported light compared with dark coloured (OR 0.67; 95% CI 0.49, 0.92) upper body clothing reduced the odds of a MV collision during daylight.

During dark conditions, crude estimates indicated that reflective clothing or other items, red/orange/yellow front upper body clothing compared with black, fluorescent clothing, headlights and tail lights were estimated to increase the odds of a MV collision. An imputed adjusted analysis revealed that red/orange/yellow front upper body clothing colour (OR 4.11; 95% CI 1.06, 15.99) and tail lights (OR 2.54; 95% CI: 1.06, 6.07) remained the only significant risk factors for MV collisions.

In the CCB and CC groups, stained dentin was completely removed. In the CD groups, pink-stained dentin was retained according to the manufacturers' instructions. Cavities before and after caries removal were measured with the DIAGNOdent. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Fisher's PLSD multiple comparison test at alpha=0.05. Regression analyses were performed between DIAGNOdent readings and scores obtained from the clinical parameters. The DIAGNOdent readings after caries removal were: primary-CCB (13.2+/-10.4), primary-CC (14.3+/-16.7), primary-CD (9.0+/-5.2), permanent-CCB (22.7+/-13.4), permanent-CC (10.6+/-6.8) and permanent-CD (9.7+/-9.0). Significant differences were identified between the permanent-CCB and all other groups. Correlation coefficients between DIAGNOdent readings and clinical parameters were low.

A prospective study at BC Women's Hospital recruited consecutive healthy newborns through six incrementally more intensive screening approaches. Under the baseline ""passive"" strategy, families received ISCCs at maternity, with instructions to monitor infant stool colour daily and return the ISCC by mail at age 30 days. Additional strategies were: ISCC mailed to family physician; reminder letters or telephone calls to families or physicians. Random telephone surveys of ISCC non-returners assessed total card utilization. Primary outcome was ISCC utilization rate expressed as a composite outcome of the ISCC return rate and non-returned ISCC use. Markov modelling was used to predict incremental costs and life years gained from screening (passive and reminder), compared with no screening, over a 10-year time horizon. 6,187 families were enrolled. Card utilization rates in the passive screening strategy were estimated at 60-94%. For a Canadian population, the increase in cost for passive screening, compared with no screening, is $213,584 and the gain in life years is 9.7 ($22,000 per life-year gained).

Whereas the children with normal hearing showed robust effects of contextual facilitation-improved speech perception for the final words in a sentence-the deaf children with CIs on average showed no such facilitation. Regression analyses indicated that for the deaf children with CIs, Forward Digit Span scores significantly predicted accuracy scores for all 3 positions, whereas performance on the Stroop Color and Word Test, Children's Version (Golden, Freshwater, & Golden, 2003) predicted how much contextual facilitation was observed at the final word. The pattern of results suggests that some deaf children with CIs do not use sentence context to improve spoken word recognition.

350,350,11241872,"A generic method, called normal fusion, for integrated three-dimensional (3D) visualization of functional data with surfaces extracted from anatomical image data is described. The first part of the normal fusion method derives quantitative values from functional input data by sampling the latter along a path determined by the (inward) normal of a surface extracted from anatomical data; the functional information is thereby projected onto the anatomical surface independently of the viewpoint. Fusion of the anatomical and functional information is then performed with a color-encoding scheme based on the HSV model. This model is preferred over the RGB model to allow easy, rapid, and intuitive retrospective manipulation of the color encoding of the functional information in the integrated display, and two possible strategies for this manipulation are explained. The results first show several clinical examples that are used to demonstrate the viability of the normal fusion method. These same examples are then used to evaluate the two HSV color manipulation strategies. Furthermore, five nuclear medicine physicians used several other clinical cases to evaluate the overall approach for manipulation of the color encoded functional contribution to an integrated 3D visualization.

Diagnostic evaluation following clinical screening indicated that the differences among the tests were primarily due to false alarms, which were greatest without the recommended illuminant and least with the APT-5. These results demonstrate the importance of controlled illumination in color vision testing, either by using the recommended illumination with the AO-HRR or a self-illuminated test such as the APT-5.

Anthropometrically the swimmers appear to fall within fairly narrow limits but are physically more mature than their peers. Physiologically there is greater diversity within the group representing perhaps the varying demands of the swimming events practised. All values for the physiological parameters measured are high compared with children of similar ages. For the future it is hoped to relate performance in swimming to the variables measured and to assess any changes which occur thus perhaps colouring the profiles presented here. ,353,"A study of potential Olympic swimmers: I, the starting point","Bagnall KM, Kellett DW.",Br J Sports Med. 1977 Sep;11(3):127-32. doi: 10.1136/bjsm.11.3.127.,Bagnall KM,Br J Sports Med,1977,1977/09/01,PMC1859570,,10.1136/bjsm.11.3.127

Primary and permanent teeth with dentin caries were stained with Caries Check (CC), containing 1% acid red in polypropylene glycol (MW=300) or Caries Detector (CD), containing 1% acid red in propylene glycol (MW=76). Primary-CC, primary-CD, permanent-CC and permanent-CD groups were prepared. In the CC groups, stained dentin was completely removed. In the CD groups, pink-stained dentin was retained according to the manufacturers' instructions. Cavities before and after caries removal were measured with the DIAGNOdent. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Fisher's PLSD multiple comparison test at alpha=0.05. Regression analyses were performed between DIAGNOdent readings and scores obtained from the clinical parameters. For all groups, there were no significant differences in the DIAGNOdent readings before treatment. The DIAGNOdent readings after caries removal were: primary-CC (16.0+/-17.6), primary-CD (9.6+/-5.2), permanent-CC (11.0+/-7.0) and permanent-CD (7.1+/-3.8). Significant differences were identified between the permanent-CC and primary-CD, and permanent-CC and permanent-CD subgroups but not for the primary subgroups. Correlation coefficients between DIAGNOdent readings and clinical parameters were low. When dentin stained with Caries Check was completely removed, the DIAGNOdent readings were higher than those recorded when palely-stained pink dentin was retained with the Caries Detector, with significant difference observed for the permanent teeth. Caries Check may be used clinically to avoid excessive removal of caries-affected or sound dentin in permanent teeth but not in primary teeth.

365,365,15928683,"To test the validity of a colour food photography atlas for quantifying portion size eaten compared with weighed foods. The colour food photography atlas was prepared by cooking, weighing and taking digital photographs of three portion sizes of 434 foods and beverages typical of the Italian diet. In all, 448 male and female volunteers aged 6-60 y from a wide variety of social backgrounds completed 9075 assessments of food portions eaten at lunch and dinner in relation to a set of colour food photographs during 8 weeks of investigation. The amounts of foods eaten by individuals in five different cafeterias in Pavia, Northern Italy, were weighed by trained investigators at the time of serving and, within 5-10 min of the end of the meal, each subject was asked to quantify all foods consumed with reference to one of the three food photographs or in terms of virtual portions among those shown in the photographs. Multiple regression analysis shows that weights of portion sizes chosen from the set of photographs are significantly associated (P<0.05) to weights of eaten portions (beta=0.81; R(2)=0.70) and are independent of age, gender and BMI. The differences between mean weights of the portions chosen by individuals from photographs and mean weights of eaten foods are significant for all food categories (P<0.05), except for bread. However, because of the very large number of observations, the mean differences are very small (range: from +23.2 g (+11.2%) for first courses to -1.3 g (-2.7%) for bread). Bland-Altman plots show that first courses limits of agreement are wide because the dispersion is increasing while weights are rising. The use of a series of three photographs and virtual portion sizes being associated with relatively small errors, our findings support the validity of using this colour food photography atlas as a tool for quantifying food portion size in epidemiological dietary surveys on different age groups of Italian subjects.

For the European Union, there are over 90,000 new cases of melanoma annually. Although melanoma only accounts for about 1% of all skin cancers, it causes most of the skin cancer deaths. Melanoma is considered one of the fastest-growing forms of skin cancer, and hence the early detection is crucial, as early detection is helpful and can provide strong recommendations for specific and suitable treatment regimens. In this work, we propose a method to detect melanoma skin cancer with automatic image processing techniques. Our method includes three stages: pre-process images of skin lesions by adaptive principal curvature, segment skin lesions by the colour normalisation and extract features by the ABCD rule. We provide experimental results of the proposed method on the publicly available International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) skin lesions dataset. The acquired results on melanoma skin cancer detection indicates that the proposed method has high accuracy, and overall, a good performance: for the segmentation stage, the accuracy, Dice, Jaccard scores are 96.6%, 93.9% and 88.7%, respectively; and for the melanoma detection stage, the accuracy is up to 100% for a selected subset of the ISIC dataset.

Masticatory performance was tested in two groups: systemically healthy fully dentate young adults and children in mixed dentition. Median particle size was assessed using a comminution test, and a two-colour chewing gum mixing ability test was applied for MP analysis. Validity was tested with Pearson correlation, and reliability was tested with intra-class correlation coefficient, Pearson correlation and Bland-Altman plots.

375,375,14724870,"Evaluation of tube position is important after in-hospital and prehospital emergency intubation. Colorimetric breath indicators are devices for immediate control of tube positioning by showing a color change according to end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) concentrations. We hypothesized that colorimetric breath indicators can yield reliable results for confirmation of tube position. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a new colorimetric breath indicator (Colibri, ICOR AB, Bromma, Sweden) in 147 patients during general anesthesia, in critically ill patients, during transport to in-hospital interventions, and in a study design after insertion of a second tube into the esophagus in long-term ventilated patients. The Colibri was attached between the respective airway and ventilatory tubing. Seventy-three patients were investigated during general anesthesia, 39 patients were observed during long-term ventilation with an average duration of 33 hours, in 15 patients during transport to an intervention for up to 4 hours, and in 20 long-term ventilated patients at the medical intensive-care unit after insertion of a second tube intentionally into the esophagus with the help of a laryngoscope. The Colibri worked well in all groups investigated and showed no false results in the group with tubes inserted into the trachea and esophagus. Data suggest that the Colibri might serve as a valuable tool for evaluating and controlling tube position.

Dietary exposure to synthetic colours for an average primary school student was considerably lower than the threshold for acceptable daily intake (ADI) for their ages, except for sunset yellow FCF. Data obtained showed that the average daily intake of sunset yellow FCF (E110) was 51% over the ADI threshold in 9-year-old boys.

The malacia disorders are an important cause of respiratory morbidity in children, but no methods are currently available to measure these lesions or the airway lumen accurately. A new measurement technique is described here. The magnification power of a paediatric videobronchoscope was defined and a simple and user friendly computer based program (Image J) was used to develop an objective technique (colour histogram mode technique, CHMT) for measurement of the airway lumen. In vivo intra-observer and inter-observer repeatability coefficients for repeated area measurements from 28 images using the Bland-Altman method were 0.9 mm2 and 1.6 mm2, respectively. The average intraclass correlation coefficient for repeated measurements of area was 0.93. In vitro validation measurements using a 2 mm diameter tube resolved radii measurements to within 0.1 mm (coefficient of variability 8%). An ""acceptable result"" was defined in 92% of 734 images completed with the CHMT alone and 8% with its modification. The success rate for two of three images being within 10% of each other's area was 100%. Measurements of cricoid cross sectional areas from 116 patients compared with expected airway areas for age derived from endotracheal tube sizes were comparable.

Twelve pediatric residents evaluated 10 study patients and 6 control subjects in a masked manner in 2 separate sessions, using the Brückner reflex or the MTI photoscreener, evaluating for asymmetric (abnormal) or symmetric (normal) red reflexes between the 2 eyes. Each study patient had asymmetric red reflexes and the amblyogenic risk factor of anisometropia or microstrabismus. Each control subject had symmetric red reflexes. The pediatric residents had a mean correct score of 82% (69%-100%) using the MTI photoscreener versus a mean correct score of 65% (44%-81%) using the Brückner reflex (McNemar test: alpha < 0.01). The sensitivity of the MTI photoscreener evaluation was 89% in comparison to 61% for the Brückner reflex. The specificities for the MTI photoscreener versus the Brückner reflex were similar at 69% and 71%, respectively. Pediatric residents were better at detecting asymmetric red reflexes in patients with anisometropia and microstrabismus when evaluating MTI photoscreener photographs than when evaluating the red reflexes by the Brückner reflex. The MTI photoscreener may be a more sensitive method than the Brückner reflex to screen for the common amblyogenic risk factors of anisometropia and microstrabismus by easier detection of red reflex asymmetry.

380,380,30110332,"The purpose of this research was to assess how the motor learning skills in 7-years old soccer players can be improved by preventing an internal focus of attention via the use coloured shoes. We painted the classic black soccer shoes in six areas corresponding to six regions of the foot with which it is possible to interact with the ball. Thirty-four 7-years-old soccer players were randomized to two groups (Coloured n = 17 and Black, n = 17) to perform four basic football manoeuvres/tasks: reception (RECP), passing (PASS), ball management (MAGT), and shooting (SHOT). We found highly significant differences (P<0.001) in all four performance tests: mean(sd) RECP: 0.82(0.07) vs. 0.45(0.12); PASS: 0.85(0.07) vs. 0.47(0.09); MAGT: 0.91(0.09); SHOT: 1.00(1.00) vs. 0.44(0.16). Colored shoes appear to draw children's attention away from body centered cues without explicit verbal communications. We propose that this cognitive adaptation enhanced the technical gesture by preventing the negative processes associated with action constraining when adopting an internal focus attention (perhaps by allowing the foot to adapt to surfaces and movements more naturally than conditions that promote a focus on the body movement). Consequently, this type of coloured footwear could be used during childhood to allow children to enhance the performance of basic football exercises through preventing action constraining and promoting intuitive (non-body centered) action knowledge.

Mothers are used to dealing with diarrhoea and have an ample repertoire of home-based practices, traditional treatments, and western-style medicine to manage diarrhoeal episodes. However, programme planners often overlook and/or underestimate this knowledge, and by so doing they constrain the possible impact of educational messages and intervention programmes designed to treat diarrhoea and to promote oral rehydration therapy. This study addresses the ""popular epidemiology"" of diarrhoea, in an effort to highlight data that may prove useful for planners of diarrhoea-management programmes. We found that when mothers assess the severity of diarrhoea they consider an increase in the usual number of stools passed per day, as well as the colour, smell and liquid content of the stools. However, they also place special consideration on how much the episode of diarrhoea interfered with their daily activities. When considering the worsening or improvement of their child during the episode, they rely on symptoms related to changes in the child's usual wellbeing, while the more important signs that they recognise are focused on the child's eyes. In relation to fluid and food, we found that herbal tea and rice-based beverages were most commonly used, and that during diarrhoea, mothers were more prone to modify the usual diet fed to the child than to withhold food.

We have previously shown that during pattern-reversal stimulations lasting 2 minutes the amplitude of the visual evoked potential increases in migraine with and without aura between attacks, whereas it decreases in healthy volunteers. Red light was found to increase visually evoked EEG fast activity only in children with migraine with aura. Wearing rose-tinted glasses for 4 months decreased attack frequency in parallel with a reduction of the visually evoked EEG fast activity. We compared the change in amplitude of the visual evoked potential using five different tinted glasses in 12 patients with migraine with aura and in 10 healthy volunteers. During continuous stimulation at 3.1 Hz, five blocks of 50 responses were sequentially averaged using red, yellow, green, blue, and grey glasses and without glasses in a random order and analyzed in terms of latencies and N1-P1 amplitudes. Amplitude changes were calculated for each block by comparison with the first block in every condition and analyzed statistically using Zerbe's method. In healthy volunteers, the visual evoked potential amplitude increased with red glasses compared to without glasses (P = .05) or with green glasses (P = .03). In patients with migraine with aura, no significant difference was detected using colored glasses. Our findings in healthy volunteers are in line with earlier reports of increased excitability of the human visual cortex when exposed to red light. The lack of such a pattern in patients with migraine with aura suggests that the visual cortex is interictally hypoexcitable rather than hyperexcitable, which is consistent with studies of transcranial magnetic stimulation.

The anatomical location and the extent of CST involvement within the infarcts were visualized on three-dimensional colour-coded diffusion tensor tractography (DTT). With regard to the CST, all patients were divided into three clinical subgroups: Group 1 (intact type), Group 2 (partial involvement type) and Group 3 (whole involvement type). Subsequently, the severity of the motor deficit of each patient was determined according to the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores at the acute/early subacute phase (<3 days after onset of symptoms), early chronic phase (8-14 days) and outcome (30-60 days). NIHSS scores of Group 1 (12/28) were significantly lower than those of Group 2 (9/28) at the acute phase or early subacute phase (U = -2.816, p<0.01), and those of Group 2 were significantly lower than those of Group 3 (7/28) (U = -3.136, p<0.01).

394,394,9391295,"To determine whether the proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) method could be applied to estimate the magnitude of ventricular septal defect (VSD) shunt flow. Prospective analysis of clinical, echocardiographic, and angiographic data. University hospital. 14 children with VSD. Colour Doppler images of VSD shunt flow were obtained in parasternal long axis view, four chamber view or both, adjusted to provide the best imaging of flow. The VSD shunt flow rate and shunt volume were calculated as follows: shunt flow rate (SFR) = 2 pi r2 V/BSA in ml/s/m2; shunt volume = SFR x shunt duration time. The shunt volume, shunt fraction, and pulmonary to systemic flow ratio (Qp:Qs) were confirmed by cardiac catheterisation. There was a correlation between shunt variables determined by PISA and those by catheterisation, including shunt volume (r = 0.78, P = 0.001) and shunt fraction (r = 0.74, P = 0.003). Qp:Qs was also significantly correlated with SFR (r = 0.79, P = 0.0007). The SFR was significantly different between the four patients with Qp:Qs < 2.0 (mean (SD) 54 (33) ml/s/m2) and the 10 patients with Qp:Qs > 2.0 (186 (69) ml/s/m2) (P = 0.004). These data suggest that the PISA method is a reliable non-invasive investigation for the quantitative assessment of VSD shunt flow and provides important information for decisions regarding surgical repair.

To develop guidelines for optimal treatment, we evaluated the number of Q-switched ruby laser treatments required to eliminate the pigmentation of such lesions classified by colour. Over a period of 6 years, we evaluated 151 Japanese patients with naevus of Ota who had been treated with the Q-switched ruby laser at a low energy level (wavelength 694.3 nm; pulse duration 28 x 10-9 s; energy fluence 5 J/cm2; spot size 6.5 mm) every 2 months. Each lesion was classified by colour as brown (n = 22), brown-violet (n = 42), violet-blue (n = 81) and blue-green (n = 6). The 22 predominantly brown lesions attained an excellent (100-95%) or good (95-75%) cosmetic result following three laser treatments in all patients who received this number of treatments. In the 42 brown-violet lesions, 25 of the 29 good or excellent results were achieved after four treatments; the 13 less successful results were in patients who had one to three treatments. In the 81 violet-blue lesions, 54 of the 65 good or excellent results were achieved after four treatments and 64 of 65 after five treatments, whereas all 16 less good results were in patients who had only one to three treatments. However, in the six blue-green lesions, six or more treatments were required to achieve a similarly favourable result. At the end of treatment, the area was virtually free of scarring, and its texture resembled that of the surrounding normal skin. We have confirmed that the use of the Q-switched ruby laser at a low energy level can eliminate the pigmentation of naevus of Ota. While the desired improvement can be obtained within 1 year, the number of treatments appears to depend on the predominant colour of the lesion.

402,402,3767230,"The capacity of the skin to stretch and expand, as shown in pregnancy, has been used by Radovan who, in 1976, introduced skin expanders made of silicone. These are empty balloons of different sizes and shapes which are surgically placed under the skin and gradually filled with saline. The saline solution is introduced through a valve with a syringe and a 21 G needle. Skin expansion usually requires 6 to 8 weeks to be completed. Transient redness of the skin is frequently observed. A thin capsule can be found around the expander but does not need to be removed. The excess skin can be utilized as advancement flap, rotation flap or even two-stage distant flap. Our experience is based on 33 expansions performed in 26 patients (table I). Giant naevi were the most frequent lesions treated (20 cases), and face, scalp and neck were the most frequent localizations (27/33 cases) (table II). Complications occurred in 21 p. 100 of the cases, and 5 expanders had to be removed. Nevertheless, expansion could be completed in most cases, sometimes after replacement of the prosthesis. The results of repair surgery using expanded skin have always been satisfactory: in colour and texture the expanded skin was similar to that of adjacent areas, and sensation was preserved. Skin expansion in fact made it possible to perform local flaps--which usually represent the best solution for skin replacement--by creating hyperlaxity in areas adjacent to the pathological areas. There has been no retraction of the expanded skin, and the scars have shown no tendency to hypertrophic reaction or distension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) ",402,[Cutaneous expansion by inflatable implant],"Marchac D, Larrègue M.",Ann Dermatol Venereol. 1986;113(4):329-37.,Marchac D,Ann Dermatol Venereol,1986,1986/01/01,,,

The incidental observation of normally invisible CSF flow from the peritoneal end of a ventriculo-peritoneal (V-P) shunt on colour Doppler during a conventional abdominal ultrasound examination in one of our patients suggested that colour Doppler imaging might be of potential interest. Using a 10-5 MHz broad-band linear array transducer, conventional 2D and Doppler (spectral and colour-coded) ultrasonography was performed in 17 patients with V-P shunts, who were aged 3 months to 12 years. In all, 20 examinations were performed, because 2 patients had repeat examinations before and after shunt revision. In 13 examinations (65%) CSF flow was identified through the shunt tube. Flow velocities between 5 and 7 cm/s were measured. No flow was seen in 7 examinations (35%), 3 of which (15%) were performed before revisions for a blocked shunt. Further in vitro studies with simulated shunt/ventricular system model demonstrated that although clear CSF is not ultrasonically visible, the presence of particulate matter, such as choroid plexus debris, can generate a satisfactory Doppler signal with the probe insonating over the length of the tubing. In the presence of clear CSF, turbulence generated at junction points of the shunt system or at the exit of the peritoneal tube can be visualised well with Doppler ultrasonography, presumably due to generation of microbubbles. The clinical implications for the management of shunt obstruction are discussed.

This study was conducted to identify some clinical loading tests capable of evaluating cardiac reserve and predicting future occurrences of MI in children with Kawasaki disease. Two-dimensional left ventricular short-axis echocardiograms were processed by fast Fourier transformation (FFT) analysis, which yielded phase images and amplitude images, to evaluate objectively regional wall motion. The phase images obtained from five cases for each of normal coronary arteries, dilated coronary artery lesions, and stenosed arterial lesions had nearly homogeneous color levels of the lower scales, while those obtained from the cases with MI showed the areas composed of several different color levels, and the sites of these lesions corresponded to those of SPECT. The amplitude images obtained from five cases for each of the normal coronary arteries, dilated lesions, and dilated with stenosed lesions showed successive transformation of the color from inside to outside throughout the entire circumference. The cases with MI showed a decrease in the color change at the sites of lesion outlined by SPECT. Three-dimensional displays of MI also showed a decrease in the contraction ratios at the sites of infarction. It was concluded that analyses of color images processed by FFT in the three-dimensional display is helpful for objectively evaluating abnormal left ventricular wall motion.

ACDS is applicable to the majority of infants and children, in spite of the risk of motion artefacts. It is a valuable addition to conventional paediatric ultrasound and colour Doppler sonography. In conjunction with new modalities like three-dimensional sonography, harmonic imaging and ultrasound contrast agents it promises to continuously widen sonographic diagnostic potential.

Very often even the form of viable or devitalised teeth in children is wanted to be changed. The modern composite materials allow this to be done by vestibular veneers satisfying even the highest requirements in this respect. THE AIM of the study was to address the matter of the restoration of traumatised permanent children's teeth by composite veneers. The study included 30 traumatized permanent anterior teeth in children which, after dealing with the trauma, were restored by means of composite veneers. The teeth were first prepared using a suitable method and the composite veneers were fabricated during the same visit. The patients were evaluated at one, three and six months. The colour, margin integrity, surface structure, and anatomic form were rated using the California Dental Association's criteria. CONCLUSIONS. Restoration of traumatized permanent teeth in children with vestibular veneers yields very good clinical results. The composite veneers is an alternative method in restoration of such teeth in children.

In cases where the tumor cannot be entirely removed in one step (e.g. giant hairy naevus, haemolymphangioma) expansion brings quality skin within the most visible areas, enabling complete excisions by re-expansion or skin graft to be contemplated.

The application of term ""hemorrhage"" in respect to foci of reddish (brownish) coloring of the CL tissue was shown to be not always justifiable. Thus, genuine hemorrhages to the CL tissue are not altogether possible in children and teenagers owing to the original avascularity of their hyaline cartilage tissue; as for women, they are possible only in the dorsal CL sections. The reddish coloring results often from the imbibition of the CL tissue by hemoglobin at the places of contact of the cartilage surface with blood. Such false ""hemorrhages"" can occur not only in trauma but also in nonviolent death and also as artifacts of sectional examinations. It was established experimentally that 10 to 12 minutes are sufficient for postmortal hemorrhage to set on.

Eighty children (4-10 years of age) and their guardians were recruited from a pediatric emergency department. A survey and color photographs of the same male and female physicians wearing face shields and surgical masks were distributed. The parents were asked to decide which set of physicians they would prefer to care for their children and with which set of physicians they thought their children would be most comfortable. The children then were asked to decide which set of physicians they would prefer to take care of them and why. The children also were asked whether they found any of the physicians frightening and, if so, why. Fifty-one percent of parents preferred the pictures of physicians wearing face shields, and 62% thought that their children would choose the physicians in the face shields because their faces were visible and therefore less frightening. However, 59% of children stated that either set of physicians would be fine and neither was frightening; if given a choice, 49% would choose physicians in face shields. Physicians and parents have a perception that surgical masks are frightening to all children. Our study has shown that this perception is not completely true. Face shields may be a better choice, however, because both parents and children would prefer this option.

504,504,9925861,"To evaluate the reproducibility and the accuracy of pediatric radiologists' assessments of chest radiographs with respect to the presence or absence of heart defects in children with an asymptomatic heart murmur. Ninety-eight children, ages 1 month to 15 years (median, 30.1 months), referred for evaluation of a heart murmur were consecutively included. They all had a standard chest radiograph and a color Doppler echocardiograph (CDE) performed. Six specialists in pediatric radiology evaluated the chest radiographs independently on two occasions 6 months apart. The radiologists were asked to classify each set of films into one of two categories: heart disease or no heart disease. The outcome of the CDE was considered the definite diagnosis. kappa statistics were used to analyze the reproducibility of the radiologic assessments. Sensitivity, specificity, and the predictive value of a positive and a negative test were used for evaluation of the accuracy of the radiologic assessments. Mean intra- and interobserver kappa values were all <0.6, and the majority were <0.4. Mean sensitivity was 0.3 (range: 0.17-0.52), mean predictive value of a positive test was 0.4, implying that 60% of the positive assessments were falsely positive. Mean specificity was 0.86 (range: 0.75-0.93) and the mean predictive value of a negative test was 0.80 implying that 20% of the negative assessments were falsely negative. We found a low reproducibility, as well as a low accuracy, of the radiologic assessments of the chest radiographs of children with an asymptomatic heart murmur with respect to the presence or absence of heart disease. A false-positive radiologic assessment of the chest radiograph with respect to heart defects causes unnecessary anxiety and further examinations, whereas a false-negative assessment might result in omission of relevant investigations and proper identification of the heart defect. We cannot recommend the use of chest radiographs in the initial evaluation of the asymptomatic child with a heart murmur. If a heart defect cannot be excluded by clinical examination a CDE must be performed.

507,507,570560,"Interobserver reliability of physical signs elicited and diagnoses made on middle ear examination were studied. Effect on reliability of variation in observer knowledge, patient age and instrument were defined. Two board-certified, color-seeing pediatric specialists who worked in the same clinic examined consecutively 350 ears with the same otoscope for each case. Over a period of four months, four different otoscopes were used to examine at least 50 ears with each. The following groups of findings were graded independently by the pediatrician according to pre-set criteria: color, landmarks and light reflex. Diagnosis was also recorded. At no time did the observers discuss their findings or diagnoses. Degree of interobserver agreement was expressed by the reliability coefficient (values given below) and the K coefficient. Overall agreement on findings ranged from 0.50 for landmarks to 0.85 for air-fluid level. Overall agreement for diagnoses was 0.72. Specific agreement on physical findings ranged from 0.0 for presence of air-fluid level to 0.85 for absence of air-fluid level. Specific agreement on diagnoses ranged from 0.08 on serous otitis to 0.56 on otitis media and 0.61 on normal. After the age of one year, agreement did not increase with age. Agreement did not change significantly with different instruments or as the study progressed. We concluded that equivalence of observer knowledge strongly increases agreement, while patient age less than one year decreases agreement, and type of instrument does not affect agreement.

508,508,33320363,"This paper reports findings from the first longitudinal study on the evolution of the physical phenotypes of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial FAS (PFAS) from early childhood through adolescence. The sample consisted of 155 children (78 males and 77 females) born to women recruited at an antenatal clinic serving a Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) population in Cape Town, South Africa. Two expert FASD dysmorphologists, blind regarding prenatal alcohol exposure, independently evaluated each child's growth and dysmorphology at 4 clinics conducted over an 11-year period. Case conferences were held to reach consensus regarding which children had FAS or PFAS growth and physical features using the Revised Institute of Medicine (2005) guidelines. The prevalence of the physical phenotype was stable across the 4 ages for about half of the children with FAS and about one-third of those with PFAS but more variable for the others. Test-retest reliability was substantial for the FAS phenotype, but poorer for PFAS. Two distinct patterns were seen: a ""strong phenotype"" that was consistently identified and a less consistent one in which dysmorphic features and/or anthropometric deficits fluctuated or diminished with age. The physical phenotype was most apparent during early childhood and least apparent during puberty, due to differences in timing of the growth spurt and the evolving adult face. Short palpebral features and small head circumference diminished with age, flat philtrum fluctuated, while thin vermilion and weight and height restriction were stable. Key facial features that characterize FASD in early childhood diminish or evolve in some individuals, making diagnostic examinations that rely on these characteristics most sensitive during early childhood and school age. Moreover, puberty poses classification problems due to variability in timing of the growth spurt. Given that several features and small head circumference diminished with age, many individuals would be misdiagnosed if only examined at a later age.

A clinic-based sample of children with CP (n = 116; 76 males, 40 females; mean age 6 y 3 mo, SD 12 mo) was followed longitudinally in three yearly measurements. Children's capabilities were assessed with the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Functional Skills Scale (PEDI-FSS). Averaged for the total group, significant increases over time were shown in PEDI-FSS scores in all three domains. For self-care, the course was best predicted by a model including level of gross motor function (measured by the Gross Motor Function Classification System) and intellectual capacity (measured by Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices). For mobility, the course was best predicted by a model containing only level of gross motor function. For social function, the course was best predicted by a model comprising level of bimanual function (measured by the Manual Ability Classification System) and paternal educational level. Generally, the increase in capabilities was greater if level of functioning was higher, except for level of paternal education. The findings indicate that there are different sets of determinants for the course of different domains of daily activities. Such different sets of determinants may help to set realistic expectations and to create appropriate treatment plans for different domains of daily activities in school-age children with CP.

Despite tremendous potential for early life interventions at multiple levels of this ecosystem to improve children's life course health trajectories, this potential has not been fully explored. In fact, Life Course Health Development is a low priority for both health care and research funding. Representing the work of the Life Course Intervention Research Network, this supplement to Pediatrics reports on the first steps taken to define the emerging discipline of life course intervention research. Articles cover the characteristics of life course interventions together with a research framework and core competencies for this work. Topics include family, community, and youth engagement as vital components of grounding this work in health equity, family health development and its measurement, supporting children after prematurity, and new approaches to early childhood mental health. Schools and telehealth are considered innovative platforms for life course interventions, whereas cross-sector partnerships are recognized as key components of interventions to address childhood adversity. Researchers apply a Life Course Health Development lens to juvenile justice issues, including the minimum age law, and consider potential trade-offs whereby ""striving"" (education and income mobility) can limit ""thriving"" (health mobility) for people of color and those raised in low-income families.

Ear frameworks, including the helix, anthelix, concha, and tragus, were prepared using autologous rib cartilage. Based on the surface area of the normal adult auricle, the silicone expander was tentatively shaped and sized into a rotated semiellipse and expanded with 70 cc saline. Auricular reconstruction on the framework was completed at the time of insertion in four of the seven patients, requiring no elevation of the ear. The reconstructed auricle was satisfactory in both color and texture and had nearly normal sensation. Mild complications were noted in three of the seven patients. However, no resorption of the inserted rib cartilage has been observed 14 months to 2 years and 5 months after the operation. Slight shrinkage of the expanded skin was noted in each patient.

Physician interpretation of emergency echocardiograms is often delayed during weekends, evenings or night hours. This delay places undue responsibility on less qualified personnel to interpret echocardiograms of vital importance. Digital quad-screen cine-loop format was transmitted over standard telephone lines. Clinical data and conventional and telemedicine interpretations were collected prospectively for 187 emergent or semiemergent tele-echocardiograms after regular working hours. Indications for the echocardiogram included assessment of left ventricular function, ischemia, pericardial effusion, valvular disease, heart donor status and arrhythmia. Three off-site echocardiographers received the standard echocardiogram and spectral, gray-scale and color flow Doppler images in cineloop format using a laptop computer. Laptop interpretation showed 19 technically limited studied, 153 abnormal studies and 54% with wall motion abnormalities. Overall mean agreement rate between telemedicine laptop interpretation and conventional workstation interpretation performed in blinded manner for serious disorders with classic echocardiographic findings (pulmonary hypertension, left ventricular thrombus, aortic dissection, severe valvular insufficiency and large pericardial effusion) was 99.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 96% to 99%). For serious wall motion abnormalities, the agreement rate was 96.3% (95% CI 92% to 99%).

517,517,12264588,"To enhance and assure the mobility of auxillary health workers, CIMDER, the Rural Development Multidisciplinary Research Centre in Cali, Colombia, has developed a number of simple health instruments. 2 plastic coated tricolored cardboard strips, adapted from an African model, are used to determine the nutritional status of infants through 12 months, and from 12 months to 6 years, by measuring upper arm circumference. The strips provide a reliable indication of whether a child is well-nourished, in danger of malnutrition, or malnourished. The health worker is also equipped with reactive paper which can detect blood or urine problems. Each health worker was selected from the community which she serves and receives 14 weeks of training. Working closely with the community, such as encouraging mothers to monitor their child's nutritional status, is a key to the success of the CIMDER program. Mothers, especially, have become involved in planning and implementing health related programs through participation in Family Health Units, which are supported by the health worker. Other developments which have assisted the health aide and the community include the ""health post,"" a box containing first-aid for minor injuries, poisonings, burns, fractures, dislocations, enemas, and drugs for treatment of common diseases. Simple home made water chlorinators have been developed to deal with contaminated water problems. Records on each patient are kept enabling the worker to establish 23 basic health indicators for each individual. A health manual has been developed for use as a primer for the worker and used by her to teach leaders in the Family Health Units, who will be responsible for the continuation of the program after the final departure of the health worker.

Based on current definitions of violence and child maltreatment, exposure to racial discrimination should be considered as a form of violence that can significantly impact child outcomes and limit the ability of parents and communities to provide support that promotes resiliency and optimal child development. In this article, a conceptual model of the effects of racial discrimination in children of color is presented. The model posits that exposure to racial discrimination may be a chronic source of trauma in the lives of many children of color that negatively influences mental and physical outcomes as well as parent and community support and functioning. Concurrent exposure to other forms of violence, including domestic, interpersonal and/or community violence, may exacerbate these effects. The impact of a potential continuum of violence exposure for children of color in the US and the need for future research and theoretical models on children's exposure to violence that attend to the impact of racial discrimination on child outcomes are discussed.

Clinical pharmacogenetic implementation guidelines are available for many medications commonly prescribed to children. Frequencies of medication prescription and actionable genotypes (genotypes where a prescribing change may be indicated) inform the potential value of pharmacogenetic implementation. To assess potential opportunities for genotype-guided prescribing in pediatric populations among multiple health systems by examining the prevalence of prescriptions for each drug with the highest level of evidence (Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium level A) and estimating the prevalence of potential actionable prescribing decisions. This serial cross-sectional study of prescribing prevalences in 16 health systems included electronic health records data from pediatric inpatient and outpatient encounters from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2017. The health systems included academic medical centers with free-standing children's hospitals and community hospitals that were part of an adult health care system. Participants included approximately 2.9 million patients younger than 21 years observed per year. Data were analyzed from June 5, 2018, to April 14, 2020. Prescription of 38 level A medications based on electronic health records. Annual prevalence of level A medication prescribing and estimated actionable exposures, calculated by combining estimated site-year prevalences across sites with each site weighted equally. Data from approximately 2.9 million pediatric patients (median age, 8 [interquartile range, 2-16] years; 50.7% female, 62.3% White) were analyzed for a typical calendar year. The annual prescribing prevalence of at least 1 level A drug ranged from 7987 to 10 629 per 100 000 patients with increasing trends from 2011 to 2014. The most prescribed level A drug was the antiemetic ondansetron (annual prevalence of exposure, 8107 [95% CI, 8077-8137] per 100 000 children). Among commonly prescribed opioids, annual prevalence per 100 000 patients was 295 (95% CI, 273-317) for tramadol, 571 (95% CI, 557-586) for codeine, and 2116 (95% CI, 2097-2135) for oxycodone. The antidepressants citalopram, escitalopram, and amitriptyline were also commonly prescribed (annual prevalence, approximately 250 per 100 000 patients for each). Estimated prevalences of actionable exposures were highest for oxycodone and ondansetron (>300 per 100 000 patients annually). CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 substrates were more frequently prescribed than medications influenced by other genes. These findings suggest that opportunities for pharmacogenetic implementation among pediatric patients in the US are abundant. As expected, the greatest opportunity exists with implementing CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 pharmacogenetic guidance for commonly prescribed antiemetics, analgesics, and antidepressants.

This makes early intervention targeting EF impairments important to prevent long-term negative outcomes. Cognitive training is a potential ADHD treatment target. The present study aimed to explore the efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of a cognitive training program (targeting child's multiple EF components and involving parent support in daily life), as a nonpharmacological intervention for children with ADHD. Forty-four school -age children with ADHD and their parents participated in 12 sessions of EF training (last for 12 weeks) and 88 health controls (HC) were also recruited. Training effects were explored using both neuropsychological tests (Stroop color-word test, Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test, trail making test, tower of Hanoi, and false-belief task) and reports of daily life (ADHD rating scale-IV, Conners' parent rating scale, and behavior rating inventory of executive function [BRIEF]) by analysis of paired sample t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The differences on EF performances between children with ADHD after training and HC were explored using multivariate analysis. The results (before vs. after EF training) showed that after intervention, the children with ADHD presented better performances of EF both in neuropsychological tests (word interference of Stroop: 36.1 ± 14.6 vs. 27.1 ± 11.1, t = 4.731, P < 0.001; shift time of TMT: 194.9 ± 115.4 vs. 124.8 ± 72.4, Z = -4.639, P < 0.001; false-belief task: χ2 = 6.932, P = 0.008) and reports of daily life (global executive composite of BRIEF: 148.9 ± 17.5 vs. 127.8 ± 17.5, t = 6.433, P < 0.001).

Currently the principal applications for using US in patients with JIA include: detection of synovitis, tenosynovitis, enthesitis and cartilage and bone abnormalities. US is also used to guide needle injection. To date, the role of US in therapy monitoring has not been fully established.

The collected data were analyzed into five figures; according to the children's performance in the school and the highest percentage were in the no failure category, or in the high achiever category constituting 38.77% to each one. The percentage of children who lives with both parents is 79.5%. Most of the affected children are the 2nd in order in their families representing 40.8% of children under study. The number of diseased children who use YouTube are 23, their percentage is the highest constituting 46.94%. Seven conclusions were drawn in this novel study, among them are; that most of the affected children are 2nd in order in their families, and the highest percent of the affected children with vitiligo are those who use YouTube.

The parents were questioned for details of the children's history. An initial office examination was done to detect visual function, pupil color, lens morphology, corneal clarity, and presence of gross anterior segment anomaly. If the fundus was visible, it was examined in cooperative children after mydriasis. Under general anesthesia, each child was examined by UBM. The parameters detected by UBM included anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, zonular fiber length, ciliary process length, anterior chamber angle, and lens morphology. A-scan biometry was also performed to detect anterior chamber biometric characteristics.

This study aimed to compare the frequency of ideal sun protection use between parents with lighter- and darker-skinned children and explore their attitudes and beliefs on sun safety and their choice of sun protection. Parents of children aged 6 months to 6 years completed self-administered questionnaires about sun protection practices for their children. Parents assessed their child's Fitzpatrick phototype and were divided into lighter- (Fitzpatrick phototype I-III) and darker-skinned (Fitzpatrick phototype IV-VI) groups. Sun safety guidelines from the Canadian Dermatology Association were used to qualify ideal sun protection. A total of 183 parents were included. Overall, 31 parents (17%) used ideal sun protection for their children. As their children grew older, parents were less likely to use ideal sun protection (odds ratio = 0.69, 95% confidence interval = 0.53-0.90). Parents in the lighter-skinned group were more likely to use ideal sun protection for their children (odds ratio = 7.4, 95% confidence interval = 2.7-20.1), believe that sun exposure was harmful (odds ratio = 17.2, 95% confidence interval = 4.0-74.9), and perceive value in sun protection (odds ratio = 11.4, 95% confidence interval = 3.3-39.0); the darker-skinned group believed that darker skin tones provided more sun protection (odds ratio = 12.4, 95% confidence interval = 6.1-25.4).

537,537,38979777,"Echocardiography is considered essential during cannulation placement and manipulations. Literature evaluating transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) usage during pediatric VV-ECMO is scant. The purpose of this study is to describe the use of echocardiography during VV-ECMO at a large, quaternary children's hospital. A retrospective, single-year cohort study was performed of pediatric patients on VV-ECMO via dual-lumen cannula at our institution from January 2019 through December 2019. For each echocardiogram, final cannula component (re-infusion port (ReP), distal tip, proximal port and distal port) positions were evaluated by one echocardiographer. For TTEs with ReP in the right atrium, two echocardiographers independently evaluated ReP direction using 2-point (Yes/No) and 4-point scales, which were semi-quantitative protocols using color Doppler images to estimate ReP jet direction to the tricuspid valve. Cohen's kappa or weighted kappa was used to measure interrater agreement. During study period, 11 patients (64% male) received VV-ECMO with 49 TTEs and one transesophageal echocardiogram performed. The median patient age was 4.3 years [IQR: 1.1-11.5] and median VV-ECMO run time of 192 h [90-349]. The median time between TTEs on VV-ECMO was 34 h [8.3-65]. Most common position for the ReP was the right atrium (n = 33, 67%), and ReP location was not identified in five TTEs (10%). For ReP flow direction, echocardiographers agreed on 82% of TTEs using 2-point evaluation. There was only moderate agreement between echocardiographers on the 2-point and 4-point assessments (k = .54, kw = .46 respectively). TTE is the predominant cardiac ultrasound modality used during VV-ECMO for pediatric respiratory failure.

The appearance of the scar, including scar type and scar size as well as scar colour, was assessed by the physician. A reduction of the increase of scar width was seen in the Contractubex-treated group as compared with the untreated group. Further, physiological scars and skin-coloured scars were more frequent in the treated group than in the untreated group. Hypertrophic or keloidal scars were less frequent in the treated group. No differences in scar length and scar height were seen.

544,544,38031172,"In line with the European Paediatric Regulation, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) asks for investigation of a medicine's acceptability in paediatric medicines development. A standardised acceptability testing method combining the outcome of ""swallowability"" and ""palatability"" assessments to a ""composite endpoint on acceptability"" was recently developed. Before this method's suitability for selection of the most acceptable drug formulation of a new medicine for children can be broadly recommended, the acceptance and relevance of such established acceptability needs the critical review and input from young patients with understanding of the medicines development methodology. The benefit of involving patients in drug product development, clinical research and innovation is well established. During a focus group meeting with the KIDS Barcelona (young people advisory group, age 16-23 years) the suitability of the ""composite endpoint on acceptability"" methodology was assessed. Via electronic questionnaires the importance of involving patients in the medicines development and in the acceptability method development was investigated. Questions on how best to determine palatability and swallowability were asked. The relevance of all EMA-listed acceptability elements was assessed via coloured and numbered stickers and questionnaires. The results showed that the involvement of young people in the medicines and acceptability method development was rated high. The group worked out that a 5-point smiley Likert Scale is preferred for assessing acceptability by 6-11 year old patients, while a Visual Analogue Scale is preferred for collecting adolescents' opinion. The ranking of the EMA-listed acceptability elements showed that palatability and swallowability are the most relevant parameters, while colour of the medicine was rated as least relevant. These results, established face-to-face, were confirmed in a repeat of the ranking through an electronic questionnaire, completed by the participants individually and remotely, 5 weeks later. This work reinforced the need and value to involve young people in the medicines lifecycle, and specifically in this acceptability method development. As next step other focus group meetings with more young people from different European countries are planned. Before a new medicine is authorized, its acceptability by children must be investigated according to law. An acceptability testing method combining the outcomes of “swallowability” and “palatability” assessments was recently developed. During a focus group meeting with KIDS Barcelona (young people advisory group, age 16–23 years) their opinion on the suitability of the method and the relevance of patient engagement in the medicines development process were assessed with paper-based and electronic questionnaires. Questions on how best to determine palatability and swallowability were asked. The importance of different elements that typically affect acceptability was rated. The order of relevance of those listed acceptability elements was assessed using coloured and numbered stickers and questionnaires. The results showed that the involvement of young people in the medicines and acceptability method development was rated high. The group worked out that a 5-point smiley Likert Scale that allows for marking a choice between total agreement and total disagreement is preferred for assessing acceptability by 6–11 year old patients. A Visual Analogue Scale (scale consisting of a 10 cm long line on which a mark has to be placed at the desired position, between total agreement and total rejection) is preferred for collecting adolescents’ (12–18 years) opinion. The ranking of acceptability elements showed that palatability and swallowability of a new medicine are the most relevant parameters, and colour the least.

Measured weight was compared to Broselow-predicted weight, and the percentage difference was calculated. Accuracy was defined as agreement on Broselow color-coded zones, as well as agreement within 10% between the measured and Broselow-predicted weights. A cross-validated correction factor was also derived. The mean percentage differences were -2.4, -11.3, and -12.9% for each weight-based group. The Broselow color-coded zone agreement was 70.8% in children weighing less than 10 kg, but only 56.3% in the 10- to 18-kg group and 37.5% in the > 18-kg group.

Hence, a cross sectional study was conducted among school children in Gurage Zone, Southern Ethiopia from April 15 to June 20, 2018. Socio-demographic data was collected on a face to face interview using structured questionnaire. All study participants underwent color vision evaluation using Ishihara's pseudo isochromatic test 38 plate editions. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 23. A total of 844 (471 boys and 373 girls) school children were screened for colour vision. The overall prevalence of colour vision deficiency was 4.1%, comprised of 3.6% in boys and 0.6% in girls. Out of 35 color blind subjects, 15 (42.9%) and 20 (57.1%) were the victims of protan and deutan defects respectively. Majority of the colour blind subjects were not aware of their colour vision status.

Music medicine has been proposed to reduce distress, anxiety, and pain. There has been no other study that evaluates effects of music medicine (MusiCure) in children after minor surgery. Numbers of participants who required analgesics, individual doses, objective pain scores (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability [FLACC]), vital signs, and administration of anti-emetics were documented during postoperative recovery stay. Self-reported pain (Coloured Analogue Scale [CAS]), distress (Facial Affective Scale [FAS]), and anxiety (short State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI]) were recorded before and after surgery. In conjunction with the completed intervention semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted. Data were recorded from 80 children aged 7-16. Forty participants were randomized to music medicine and another 40 participants to a control group. We found evidence that children in the music group received less morphine in the postoperative care unit, 1/40 compared to 9/40 in the control group. Children's individual FAS scores were reduced but no other significant differences between the two groups concerning FAS, CAS, FLACC, short STAI, and vital signs were shown. Children experienced the music as 'calming and relaxing.'

This study explored parents' attitudes about inclusion of political engagement discussion in well-child care. Because voting is an expression of empowerment, we hypothesized that voting would be related to higher parenting self-efficacy. We administered a brief questionnaire to a convenience sample of parents/guardians at well-child visits at an urban hospital. The questionnaire included 10 Likert scale questions touching on parenting efficacy; beliefs about political engagement; voting behaviors; and demographics. Analysis included descriptive statistics, correlations, and factor analysis. Among the 70 respondents 84% were mothers; 55% self-identified as low income; 62% self-identified as a ""person of color."" Voting in the 2020 national election was reported by 37%. Most parents (54%) said they would feel comfortable discussing voting with a doctor. Factor analysis identified two main factors: self-efficacy and engagement. Engagement, but not self-efficacy, was related to voting behavior. Contrary to our hypothesis, PE did not appear related to parenting self-efficacy. Notably, more than half of parents felt comfortable discussing PE with their child's doctor.

558,558,26152499,"Pediatric lung diseases are a common clinical problem. Besides the clinical examination and laboratory tests, imaging studies are the mainstay in the diagnostics of pediatric lung diseases. Thorough consideration of radiation protection based on optimized equipment also includes the protection of relatives and medical staff. The high impact of radiation protection in children necessitates a different choice of imaging modalities compared to adults. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as adjunct or complementary imaging methods are of greater value than computed tomography (CT). The suspicion of pneumonia is the most common reason for chest imaging examinations in children. An anteroposterior or posteroanterior view chest X-ray is sufficient in most cases and sometimes in combination with ultrasound. The latter can also be used alone for follow-up examinations if the clinical presentation does not change. Additionally, ultrasound is applied to examine unclear structures seen on chest X-rays, such as the thymus or pulmonary sequestration in adjunct with color-coded duplex sonography. A chest X-ray is also the method of choice to examine the various forms of respiratory distress syndrome, such as wet lung disease or surfactant deficiency syndrome in newborns. Fluoroscopy is used in older children with suspected ingestion and/or aspiration of foreign bodies and CT is mostly used for staging and follow-up of thoracic and pulmonary structures in pediatric oncology. Recent technical advances, e.g. iterative reconstruction, have dramatically reduced the CT dosage. Apart from some indications (e.g. tumors and sequestration) MRI is rarely used in children; however, its potential for functional analyses (e.g. perfusion and ventilation) may increase the application in the near future.

Bruises were imaged by standard protocols in conventional, cross-polarized, IR and UV lights. Bruises were assessed in vivo for contrast, uniformity and diffuseness, and these characteristics were then compared across image modalities. Color images (conventional, cross polarized) were segmented and measured by ImageJ. Bruises of grey scale images (IR, UV) were measured by a 'plug in' of ImageJ. The maximum and minimum Feret's diameter, area and aspect ratio, were determined. Comparison of measurements across imaging modalities was conducted using Wilcoxon rank sum tests and modified Bland-Altman graphs. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Twenty five children had 39 bruises. Bruises that were of low contrast, i.e. difficult to distinguish from surrounding skin, were also more diffuse, and less uniformity in vivo. Low contrast bruises were best seen on conventional and cross-polarized images and less distinctive on IR and UV images. Of the 19 bruises visible in all modalities, the only significant difference was maximum and minimum Feret's diameters and area were smaller on IR compared to conventional images.

Understanding biomarkers of exposure to multiple toxic metals is important to characterize cumulative burden and to distinguish potential exposure sources in such environmental justice neighborhoods impacted by industrial operations. Exposure to metal mixtures has not been well-characterized among children residing in the United States, and is understudied in communities of color. In this study we used toenail clippings, a noninvasive biomarker, to assess exposure to arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), antimony (Sb), selenium (Se), and vanadium (V). We used nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) to identify ""source"" signatures and patterns of exposure among predominantly working class Latinx children residing near an industrial corridor in Southeast Los Angeles County. Additionally, we investigated the association between participant demographic, spatial, and dietary characteristics with identified metal signatures. Through NMF, we identified three groupings (source factors) for the metal concentrations in children's toenails. A grouping composed of Sb, Pb, As, and Cd, was identified as a potential industrial source factor, reflective of known airborne elemental emissions in the industrial corridor. We further identified a manganese source factor primarily composed of Mn, and a potential dietary source factor driven by Se and Hg. We observed differences in the industrial source factor by age of participants, while the dietary source factor varied by neighborhood. Utilizing an unsupervised dimension reduction technique (NMF), we identified a ""source signature"" of contamination in toenail samples from children living near metalworking industry.

Cases from the United States and the world representing academic, private, military, and federal sectors were reviewed. Ninety percent of patients were adults (54 of 60), and male patients outnumbered female patients 2 to 1. Ages were from 1 to 79 years (mean, 42 years). Forty-three cases were lymph nodes (72%), 14 were bone marrow or peripheral blood (23%), and 3 were from other sites (5%). Twenty-seven of the consultant diagnoses were benign (27 of 60). Twenty-nine were malignant (non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin disease, and ""other malignancy"" groups), and 4 were nondiagnostic. Glass slide/paraffin tissue blocks were available in only 35 (58%) of 60 cases. The concordance rate for diagnostic telehematopathology cases with subsequent glass slide/paraffin block follow-up was 91% (29 of 32 cases). The discordance rate was 9% (3 of 32). This finding shows a high degree of diagnostic accuracy for consultative telehematopathology. Of 118 images analyzed, 58 were considered very good/good (49%), 32 were poor/very poor (27%), and 28 were fair (24%). Poor images had suboptimal resolution, color, or technical quality of transmission, and most poor images were low-power images. Additional case problems included insufficient immunoperoxidase stain availability, selection, and labeling; transmitted field selection; specimen preparation and staining; presence or absence of accompanying clinical data; and availability of ancillary studies such as flow cytometric, cytogenetic, and molecular data. From this analysis, the following recommendations are offered. To optimize telehematopathology consultation, include any additional information that have a significant influence on the final consultant diagnosis. Include any pertinent clinical information, laboratory data, special stains, immunoperoxidase stains, and molecular data. Select representative and diagnostically significant low-power and high-power fields for an accurate diagnosis. Label every immunostain or special stain submitted. Always send glass slides and tissue blocks when requested by the consultant. Optimize telemedicine microscopy and computer equipment with appropriate technical expertise, training, and support. In conclusion, the field of telepathology offers an exciting and potentially powerful solution to the problem of national and global subspecialty consultation.

All the mothers were familiar with measles and identified fever and rash as its major symptoms. Since they tended to believe that modern medication keeps the rash from appearing, which they thought necessary for recovery, many mothers thought that a child with measles should not go to a health facility. Mothers considered lentil and a cereal soup as necessary to bring out the rash. The only white-colored food allowed during measles is breast milk. Mothers would not allow a child with measles to be taken out of his or her house. All the mothers were familiar with whooping cough and its key feature--a chronic cough. None of the mothers knew that vaccination would prevent whooping cough. An acceptable treatment for whooping cough was use of leaves of Lippia adoensis and garlic or milk of a black donkey. The mothers considered infection of the uvula and/or the tonsils to be natural since all children develop these throat infections. Treatment consists of a traditional healer cutting the uvula with a wire or scratching the tonsils with the fingers. Herbs are applied to the resultant wounds. Only two mothers knew about pneumonia. They had taken their children to a health center, where they were told that their children had it. Even after the interviewers had thoroughly explained the symptoms of pneumonia, 10 mothers did not recognize it as an illness entity. Mothers did not know about the symptoms of fast breathing or chest indrawing. Only a few mothers would take their child with these symptoms to a health center. Traditional treatments would be used (e.g., massaging the chest with butter). Regardless of ARI, most mothers would take their child to the health center only as a last resort.

In congenital hypothyroidism (CH), thyroid imaging permits a precise characterization of the aetiology, which is important for genetic counselling and clinical management. CH may be due to thyroid dysgenesis (ectopia, hypoplasia and athyrosis) or occurs in eutopic glands. In the latter, hypothyroidism may be either transient, especially after iodine overload, or due to permanent autosomal recessive dyshormonogenesis. Thyroid scintigraphy (TS) with either 99mTcO4 or 123I will identify ectopic thyroid tissue, which is the commonest cause of CH. However, recent reports favour the use of 123I, which enhances the accuracy of the aetiological classification. In cases of eutopic thyroid, the measurement of 123I uptake before and after perchlorate administration evaluates the organification process.

570,570,1746713,"In 87 patients a new computerized EEG monitor was used in clinical anesthesia. Following aperiodic analysis, the Lifescan shows the computerized EEG in a striking color visualization allowing recognition of changes in the course of the EEG and of interhemispheric differences. The computerized EEG can be read after a brief training period. The changes caused by different clinical situations are visualized in detail. Different changes were observed with the anesthetics used. During induction with thiopentone a sudden increase in activity was obvious. During a lighter level of anesthesia with thiopentone beta activity was easily recognizable. During induction with high-dose fentanyl frequency was slowed over a long period and activity was increased. The monitor shows the changes in the lower frequency range in detail. A bimodal pattern occurred with a higher dosage of enflurane. During lightening of anesthesia with enflurane a typical pattern indicated return to consciousness. When nitrous oxide was administered during anesthesia with halothane, and to a lesser degree during anesthesia with enflurane or isoflurane, remarkable slowing and decrease in activity occurred. The monitor allowed detailed recognition of the different patterns obtained with the various anesthetics. In some cases it was possible to say what dosage of the anesthetic used had been given or what depth of anesthesia had been achieved. The effect of combined anesthesia, however, was difficult to judge. In carotid artery surgery a quick unilateral decrease in activity and slowing of frequency indicated cerebral ischemia and quickly disappeared after insertion of a shunt. This change was particularly obvious with the new monitor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) ",570,[The potentialities of EEG analysis using the Lifescan in anesthesiology],Erdmann K.,Anaesthesist. 1991 Oct;40(10):570-6.,Erdmann K,Anaesthesist,1991,1991/10/01,,,

572,572,22711200,"To understand the practical difficulties encountered while performing hepatic artery anastomosis by microsurgical technique in living donor liver transplantation. We undertook a retrospective study of 10 cases of hepatic artery anastomosis done at the level of bifurcation of the right hepatic artery and proximal when the plastic surgery team was called in for assistance. All the anastomoses were performed under an operating microscope (up to 24× magnification). In seven of these cases, anterior wall anastomosis was performed primarily, and in three cases, posterior wall approach was chosen. The main indications of calling in the plastic surgery team were to overcome these technical hurdles: (1) in cases where the caliber of the vessel was less than 2 mm in size; (2) dissection (separation of mucosa and adventitia) of the recipient vessel wall; (3) donor pedicle being so short that possibility of revision of the anastomosis seemed unlikely, necessitating single, sure-shot anastomosis without a chance of revision. The problems encountered by our microsurgical team were: (1) a special set of instruments was warranted because of the depth of the hepatic artery; (2) anastomosis had to be done in standing, stooped position with unsupported hands; (3) excessive movements due to respiration and profuse fluid collection in the field added to the hurdles encountered. All patients were prospectively followed by color Doppler ultrasound protocol for the first 5 days after surgery. Hepatic artery thrombosis was encountered in one case on postoperative day 10, which was successfully treated by thrombolytic therapy, but unfortunately the patient died of multiorgan failure on posttransplant day 30.

573,573,34537405,"The color change of topical intranasal fluorescein has been used to confirm the presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during endoscopic endonasal surgery. We aimed to validate the use of topical intranasal fluorescein for CSF detection. Blood, CSF, saliva, and normal saline were combined with decreasing fluorescein concentrations (from 10% to 0.1%). The solutions were photographed in high definition on nasal pledgets and in 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes. The color difference (ΔE) was objectively measured via the International Commission on Illumination coordinates. Four otolaryngologists who were unaware of the study parameters also evaluated the samples for perceptible color differences. The human eye cannot detect color differences at an International Commission on Illumination ΔE of <5. All otolaryngologists agreed a color difference could be seen with blood across all fluorescein concentrations. However, a perceptible color difference between the experimental samples that excluded blood was not appreciable. Objectively, the ΔE was <5 on average for all nonblood samples when mixed with 5% and 10% fluorescein in the Eppendorf experiment. The ΔE for the nonblood samples was >5 for the remaining tested. Similarly, the average ΔE for the nonblood samples in the pledget experiment was >5 across all fluorescein concentrations. The blood ΔE was consistently >50 throughout all fluorescein concentrations in the Eppendorf experiment and >20 throughout the pledget experiment, correlating with the subjective ease of discernment between blood and the control sample in both groups. Color change alone is not sufficient to determine a difference between CSF, saliva, and saline. Blood, however, is readily identified using this method. Adjunct characteristics, in addition to the color change, are necessary to properly identify an active CSF leak.

574,574,9854834,"Cervical muscles of 15 cases of compression of the neck and the other traumatized skeletal muscles from 54 autopsy cases were examined histologically and immunohistochemically. Round and thick fibers, that is, opaque fibers were observed in the muscles beneath the compression marks on the neck, whereas in areas where no force had been applied, such fibers did not exist. Furthermore, opaque changes appeared around cavities, which formed within severely compressed injured muscle tissue. The pattern of appearance of opaque fibers in the cases of compression of the neck were mainly divided into two types, 'diffuse' pattern and 'focal' pattern. In both blunt and sharp force injuries, the production of opaque fibers were common in the area directly where damage had been inflicted. In stab wounds especially, the appearance of opaque fibers and wavelike fibers, which fanned out and showed a different color from the other areas, was limited to the marginal zone. These results suggest that there is a close relationship between opaque changes and force. Opaque fibers are probably produced by damage to muscles due to extremely applied force. The high incidence of opaque fibers beneath compression marks on the neck should be regarded as a useful indication of strangulation and/or hanging. Furthermore, the distribution and direction of force to the neck might be presumed by the pattern of opaque fibers in cervical muscles, to a certain extent.

575,575,33387290,"The asthma stepwise treatment approach recommended is based on monitoring patients' symptoms. The Asthma Research in Children and Adolescents (ARCA) cohort was created to provide evidence about the evolution of persistent asthma. This manuscript describes the development of an electronic health tool, comprising a mobile health application for patients with asthma and its associated online platform for pediatricians to monitor them. The development process followed 7 phases: the first 5 (Conceptualization, Preparation, Assessment scheduling, Image and user interface, and Technical development) defined and designed the tool, followed by a testing phase (functionality assessment and pilot test with ARCA patients), and a last phase which evaluated usability. Since the target population was aged 6-16 years, three versions were designed within the same smartphone application: parents/proxy, children, and adolescents. The online platform for pediatricians provides real-time information from the application: patients' responses over time with color-coded charts (red/amber/green, as in traffic lights). The pilot test through semi-structured phone interviews of the first 50 participants included in the ARCA study (n = 53) detected their misunderstandings. Pediatricians were trained to emphasize that the application is free of charge and requires monthly answers. Median of the System Usability Scale scores (n = 85), ranging 0 (negative)-100 (positive), was > 93 in the three age versions of the application.

576,576,31279771,"Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare metabolic disorder with a worldwide prevalence of 1 in every 185,000 live births. However, certain populations display a significant overexpression of the disorder where incidence is reported to be 1 in every 52,541 new-borns. The first-line therapy for MSUD involves a strict dietary leucine restriction and oral supplementation of isoleucine and valine. The dose administered to patients requires strict tailoring according to age, weight and blood levels. In current clinical practice, however, practitioners still have to prepare extemporaneous formulations due to the lack of suitable oral treatments for MSUD. Herein, we evaluate the first time use of 3D printing in a hospital setting for the preparation of personalised therapies with the aim of improving safety and acceptability to isoleucine supplementation in paediatric patients suffering from MSUD. This investigation was a single-centre, prospective crossover experimental study. Four paediatric patients with MSUD (aged 3-16 years) were treated at the Clinic University Hospital in Santiago de Compostela, Spain which is a MSUD reference hospital in Europe. The primary objective was to evaluate isoleucine blood levels after six months of treatment with two types of formulations; conventional capsules prepared by manual compounding and personalised chewable formulations prepared by automated 3D printing. A secondary investigation was to evaluate patient acceptability of 3D printed formulations prepared with different flavours and colours. Isoleucine blood levels in patients were well controlled using both types of formulations, however, the 3D printed therapy showed mean levels closer to the target value and with less variability (200-400 µM). The 3D printed formulations were well accepted by patients regarding flavour and colour. The study demonstrates for the first time that 3D printing offers a feasible, rapid and automated approach to prepare oral tailored-dose therapies in a hospital setting. 3D printing has shown to be an effective manufacturing technology in producing chewable isoleucine printlets as a treatment of MSUD with good acceptability.

We performed a review of the frequency of this artifact across pediatric studies, noting differences by scanner manufacturer, acquisition protocol, as well as weight and position of the subject. We also evaluated the ability of automated and quantitative methods to detect this artifact. We found that the artifact may be present in over 50% of data in certain protocols and is not limited to one scanner manufacturer. While a specific scanner had the highest incidence, low body weight and positioning were also associated with appearance of the artifact for both scanner types evaluated, making children potentially more susceptible than adults. Visual inspection remains the best method for artifact identification. Software for automated detection showed very low sensitivity (10%). The artifact may present inconsistently in longitudinal studies. We discuss a published case report that has been widely cited and used as evidence to set policy about diagnostic criteria for determining vegetative state. That report attributed longitudinal changes in anisotropy to white matter plasticity without considering the possibility that the changes were caused by this artifact. Our study underscores the need to check for the presence of this artifact in clinical studies, analyzes circumstances for when it may be more likely to occur, and suggests simple strategies to identify and potentially avoid its effects.

Time to successful intravenous cannulation, success at first attempt, and potential predictors for difficult cannulation (age, gender, skin color, BMI or weight-to-age z-score, the child being awake or anesthetized, operator profession and surgical specialty) were recorded. Regression models were constructed to find significant predictors. Success at first attempt was 73% and 81%, respectively. In the operating room age, operator and surgical specialty were predictive for a successful first attempt and time to successful cannulation. No significant predictive factors were found for the outpatient care unit. BMI or weight-to-age was not related to difficult intravenous cannulation.

A total of 120 children were diagnosed with testicular torsion disease, with 57 cases affecting the left testicle and 63 cases affecting the right testicle. Ultrasound examinations revealed no blood flow signal in 78 cases, a significant reduction in blood flow in 38 cases, and no change in 4 cases. Among the pediatric patients who underwent manual reduction, 79 cases had a favorable prognosis. Surgical reduction was performed in 41 cases, with 35 cases successfully treated and 6 cases resulting in testicular removal. Follow-up examinations conducted 6 months to 1 year postoperatively showed testicular atrophy in 4 out of 35 cases with preserved testicles, while the 6 cases that underwent testicular resection had good outcomes.

587,587,37548911,"Preventing new parents who use drugs from bonding with and bodyfeeding their babies undermines public health. Because U.S. culture treats substance use as a moral failing rather than a health concern, punitive responses to perinatal substance use continue to dominate. This is particularly true for families of color, who are more likely to be targeted by the family regulation system. These approaches fail to protect families, and cause their own, separate harm. This article will lay out existing evidence surrounding bodyfeeding. Then, it will debunk harmful mythologies about drug use and human milk, and compare the risks associated with using drugs while bodyfeeding to those inherent in family separation. Finally, it will make the case for harm-reduction approaches over criminal ones. The health risks associated with family separation are only rarely weighed against those associated with drug exposure through human milk. Our objective for this paper is to contribute new ways of framing the importance of keeping families together at birth, even when perinatal substance use is detected. This manuscript is not based upon clinical study or patient data, and exclusively references studies and research publications that have been approved by the appropriate ethics committee and which have therefore been performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. Significant research data support the position that the risks associated with family separation are arguably greater than those associated with exposure to substance use in human milk. Harm reduction approaches should be favored over criminal approaches when perinatal substance use is detected or confirmed. The harms of family separation have already been well-documented by public health and social science researchers. The risks associated with substance use and human milk have also been the subject of significant academic research. However, the authors have not come across any articles that weigh the health risks associated with family separation against those associated with drug exposure through human milk.

588,588,12429875,"To determine whether dietary restraint modifies stress-induced eating in youth. Snacking was measured in boys (9.5 +/- 0.3 years) and girls (9.0 +/- 0.3 years), with and without dietary restraint, across a control day after reading children's magazines and/or coloring, and on a stress day after giving a videotaped speech, with order of conditions counterbalanced. Children were divided into four groups based on dietary restraint and changes in perceived stress: low-restraint/low-reactive (n = 9), low-restraint/high-reactive (n = 13), high-restraint/low-reactive (n = 10), and high-restraint/high-reactive (n = 8). Body composition was estimated by skinfolds. Energy intake of snack foods was influenced differently by dietary restraint and stress reactivity in the stress and control conditions (p < 0.01). After being stressed, low-restraint/low-reactive children ate fewer snacks and high-restraint/high-reactive children ate more snacks compared with the control condition. After covarying for percentage of body fat, the interactions remained (p < 0.01). Girls ate less than boys (p < 0.001), but sex did not influence eating in control and stress conditions. Dietary restraint occurs in children and may influence the effect of stress on eating. Interpersonal stress decreases snacking in low dietary restrained youth but increases snacking in high dietary restrained children, perhaps because of stress-induced disinhibition.

589,589,21519532,"The present study investigated whether teacher ratings and parent ratings of inattentive or hyperactive/impulsive symptoms were differently associated with intelligence or cognitive performance in Korean children. Six hundred sixty-seven children were recruited from nine schools in five Korean cities. The teachers and parents of 580 of these children (9.0±0.7 years old, 333 boys and 306 girls) completed the Korean version of the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scales (K-ARS), and the children performed the abbreviated form of the Korean Educational Development Institute-Wechsler Intelligence Scales (KEDI-WISC) and a neurocognitive battery consisting of the continuous performance test, the Children's Color Trails Test, and the Stroop Color-Word Test. Diagnosis of full-syndrome and subthreshold attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were based on the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version-IV (DISC-IV). The level of agreement between teacher and parent ratings was low (r=0.21-0.26) in children with full-syndrome and subthreshold ADHD and low to moderate (r=0.31-0.41) in the normative sample. Teacher-rated ARS showed significant correlations with most sub-scores of KEDI-WISC and the neurocognitive battery both in the normative sample (r=-0.50-0.37) and in children with full-syndrome and subthreshold ADHD (r=-0.26-0.29). Correlations between parent-rated ARS and cognitive tests were lower and were found in fewer subscales of tests. These results suggest the importance of considering the teacher's report of a child's school functioning during the assessment of ADHD.

590,590,18591524,"Established noninvasive pharmacologic means of alleviating pain and anxiety in children undergoing intravenous cannulation are time-consuming, and thus impractical for routine use in the emergency department. Vapocoolant sprays provide transient skin anesthesia within seconds of application. We compared the effect of a new vapocoolant spray to placebo on pain due to intravenous cannulation in children. In this double-blind randomized controlled trial, which we conducted between June 1 and Sept. 12, 2006, 80 children aged 6-12 years received either vapocoolant spray or placebo before cannulation. Children rated their pain using a 100-mm colour visual analogue scale. Secondary outcomes included success rate on first attempt at cannulation and pain ratings by the children's parents, nurses and child life specialists. We found a modest but significant reduction in pain with the use of vapocoolant spray (mean difference 19 mm, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6-32 mm; p < 0.01). Cannulation on first attempt was more often successful with the use of vapocoolant spray (85.0%) than with placebo (62.5%) (mean difference 22.5%, 95% CI 3.2%-39.9%; p = 0.03). The number needed to treat to prevent 1 cannulation failure was 5 (95% CI 3-32). Parents (p = 0.04), nurses (p = 0.01) and child life specialists (p < 0.01) considered the children's pain to be reduced with the use of vapocoolant spray. The vapocoolant spray in our study quickly and effectively reduced pain due to intravenous cannulation in children and improved the success rate of cannulation. It is an important option to reduce childhood procedural pain in emergency situations, especially when time precludes traditional interventions. (http://ClinicalTrials.gov trial register no.

591,591,32376107,"Vaccination coverage is low in Nigeria, partly due to poor demand for the vaccines. Till date, there is limited understanding of what works to improve demand for vaccination. A Vaccine Indicator and Reminder (VIR) band was designed to be worn on a child's ankle to serve as a constant reminder to parents/caregivers on when to bring their children for vaccinations. This study assessed the acceptability of the band as a wearable reminder for infant vaccination in Kebbi State, Nigeria. A total of 503 infants who met the eligibility criteria were enrolled between August 2017 and February 2018. The intervention involved 1) sensitisation and mobilisation of community gatekeepers to advocate for immunisation; 2) engaging traditional birth attendants (TBAs) to refer mothers for vaccination and VIR bands; and 3) training facility-based health workers to secure the band on an eligible child. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were conducted at baseline (May 2016) and end-line (July 2018) with purposively selected participants. These interviews were analysed thematically. There was general acceptability of the band at all levels, especially among community members who likened it to a ""wristwatch"" that constantly reminds mothers when next to vaccinate their children. The strong support from community leaders, TBAs and participating health workers increased acceptability of the band. Similarly, the VIR band's aesthetics, ease of use and perceived benefits contributed to its acceptability. Wearing the VIR band was not perceived as an impediment because similar accessories are worn on new-borns. However, there were concerns about wearing accessories on the ankle, the red indicator colour, and the malfunctioning of some bands. This study demonstrates that cultural adaptability of interventions and engagement with community structures are important in facilitating acceptability of new innovations. Further studies will evaluate the effectiveness of VIR band in improving vaccination coverage.

Toxic exposures, including air pollution, are disproportionately high in communities of color and frequently co-occur with chronic economic deprivation. We examined whether the association between child IQ and prenatal exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons differed between groups of children whose mothers reported high vs. low material hardship during their pregnancy and through child age 5. We tested statistical interactions between hardships and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, as measured by DNA adducts in cord blood, to determine whether material hardship exacerbated the association between adducts and IQ scores. Prospective cohort. Participants were recruited from 1998 to 2006 and followed from gestation through age 7 years. Urban community (New York City) A community-based sample of 276 minority urban youth EXPOSURE MEASURE: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-DNA adducts in cord blood as an individual biomarker of prenatal polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exposure. Maternal material hardship self-reported prenatally and at multiple timepoints through early childhood. Child IQ at 7 years assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. Significant inverse effects of high cord PAH-DNA adducts on full scale IQ, perceptual reasoning and working memory scores were observed in the groups whose mothers reported a high level of material hardship during pregnancy or recurring high hardship into the child's early years, and not in those without reported high hardship. Significant interactions were observed between high cord adducts and prenatal hardship on working memory scores (β = -8.07, 95% CI (-14.48, -1.66)) and between high cord adducts and recurrent material hardship (β = -9.82, 95% CI (-16.22, -3.42)). The findings add to other evidence that socioeconomic disadvantage can increase the adverse effects of toxic physical ""stressors"" like air pollutants. Observed associations between high cord adducts and reduced IQ were significant only among the group of children whose mothers reported high material hardship.

593,593,9652179,To report our experience with transcatheter PDA closure using detachable spring coils. Suitable patients who presented between March 1996 to July 1997 were selected for coil occlusion of PDA after the diagnosis is confirmed on colour doppler echocardiography. Twenty-seven patients underwent an attempt at transcatheter closure of PDA with coils. Twenty-one were native ducts while 6 were residual ductal leaks following surgical ligation (4) and Rashkind umbrella occlusion (2). The patients' age ranged from 20 months to 39 years (median 5.5 years) and weighed from 10.5 kg to 49 kg (median 21 kg). The PDA diameter ranged from 1.3 mm to 5 mm (mean 2.4 mm). Twenty-four patients had coils successfully deployed (one coil in each patient) and all had PDA diameter of < or = 3.5 mm. Seventeen had complete occlusion on echocardiographic colour doppler assessment within 24 hrs. Follow-up colour doppler assessment showed complete occlusion in all 24 patients by 6 months. There were no cases of coil embolisation or any other complications. Unsuccessful coil deployment was encountered in 3 patients with PDA diameter of > or = 4 mm. The detachable coil system allows for complete control over coil release and therefore deployment is precise and complications are minimised. Transcatheter closure of PDA with the detachable coil is a safe and effective method especially for small ducts (< or = 3.5 mm). ,593,Transcatheter closure of patent ductus arteriosus using detachable spring coils,"Chee AK, Heng JT, Wong KY.",Singapore Med J. 1998 Feb;39(2):64-8.,Chee AK,Singapore Med J,1998,1998/07/04,,,

All children admitted to the ward for scorpion stings were included. Data was collected by questionnaire. Requested items were age, sex, type of scorpion, sting location, and clinical development. Over the 6 months of the survey, a total of 44 cases of scorpion sting were recorded on the ward. The majority of the cases (52%) were recorded in July. The main types of scorpion identified according to colour were black (18%), yellow (18%), and brown (5%). In 59% of the cases, the type of scorpion was not identified. 6-15 year-old children represented 50% of the cases. The lower limb was the main site of stings (66%).

Medical experts do not recommend them, and public health experts raise concerns about misleading labeling practices. In the U.S., the toddler drink category includes two types of products: transition formulas, marketed for infants and toddlers 9-24 months; and toddler milks, for children 12-36 months old. The objective of this study was to evaluate toddler drink labeling practices in light of U.S. food labeling policy and international labeling recommendations. In January 2017, we conducted legal research on U.S. food label laws and regulations; collected and evaluated toddler drink packages, including nutrition labels and claims; and compared toddler drink labels with the same brand's infant formula labels. We found that the U.S. has a regulatory structure for food labels and distinct policies for infant formula, but no laws specific to toddler drinks. Toddler drink labels utilized various terms and images to identify products and intended users; made multiple health and nutrition claims; and some stated there was scientific or expert support for the product. Compared to the same manufacturer's infant formula labels, most toddler drink labels utilized similar colors, branding, logos, and graphics. Toddler drink labels may confuse consumers about their nutrition and health benefits and the appropriateness of these products for young children. To support healthy toddler diets and well-informed decision-making by caregivers, the FDA can provide guidance or propose regulations clarifying permissible toddler drink labels and manufacturers should end inappropriate labeling practices.

605,605,37775921,"To quantify the impact of prematurity on chromatic discrimination throughout childhood, from 2 to 15 years of age. We recruited two cohorts of children, as part of the TrackAI Project, an international project with seven different study sites: a control group of full-term children with normal visual development and a group of children born prematurely. All children underwent a complete ophthalmological exam and an assessment of colour discrimination along the three colour axes: deutan, protan and trytan using a DIVE device with eye tracking technology. We enrolled a total of 1872 children (928 females and 944 males) with a mean age of 6.64 years. Out of them, 374 were children born prematurely and 1498 were full-term controls. Using data from all the children born at term, reference normative curves were plotted for colour discrimination in every colour axis. Pre-term children presented worse colour discrimination than full-term in the three colour axes (p < 0.001). Even after removing from the comparison, all pre-term children with any visual disorder colour discrimination outcomes remained significantly worse than those from full-term children.

606,606,35698104,"Violence against women (VAW) is a major public health problem that grew worse during the COVID-19 pandemic. While all services were impacted by changing pandemic guidance, VAW shelters, as congregate settings with multiple funders and regulators, faced unique challenges. We conducted a qualitative analysis of interviews with 26 women's shelter staff and eight women accessing care, as well as 10 focus groups (five each at two time points approximately a year apart) involving 24 leaders from VAW and related services in Ontario, Canada. We identified eight overlapping themes specific to government and public health COVID-19 regulations and their application in women's shelters. Overall, inconsistency or lack of clarity in rules, and how they were communicated, caused significant stress for women using, and staff providing, services. Staff and leaders were very concerned about rules that isolated women or replicated other aspects of abusive relationships. Women wanted to understand what options were available and what was expected of them and their children in these spaces. Leaders sought clarity and consistency from their various government funders, and from public health authorities, in the face of ever-evolving directives. As in the broader public, there was often the perception that the rules did not apply equally to everyone, for example, for women of colour using VAW services, or those whose first language was not English. In the absence of consistent pandemic guidance and how to implement it, many VAW services devised tailored solutions to balance safety from COVID-19 with women's physical and emotional safety from abuse and its impacts. However, this was difficult and exhausting. A key policy implication is that women's shelters are a distinct form of congregate housing; they are very different in terms of services provided, size, type and age of facilities from other congregate settings and this must be reflected in public health directives. Better communication and synchronization of policies among government funders and public health authorities, in consultation with VAW sector leaders, would mean protocols tailored to minimize harm to women and children while protecting health and safety.

All 415 individuals considered were evaluated by expert dysmorphologists and categorized as (i) healthy control (HC), (ii) fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), or (iii) heavily prenatally alcohol exposed (HE) but not clinically diagnosable as FAS; 3D facial photographs were used to build models of facial form to support discrimination studies. Surface curvature-based delineations of facial form were introduced. (i) Facial growth in FAS, HE, and control subgroups is similar in both cohorts. (ii) Cohort consistency of agreement between clinical diagnosis and HC-FAS facial form classification is lower for midline facial regions and higher for nonmidline regions. (iii) Specific HC-FAS differences within and between the cohorts include: for HC, a smoother philtrum in Cape Coloured individuals; for FAS, a smoother philtrum in Caucasians; for control-FAS philtrum difference, greater homogeneity in Caucasians; for control-FAS face difference, greater homogeneity in Cape Coloured individuals. (iv) Curvature changes in facial profile induced by prenatal alcohol exposure are more homogeneous and greater in Cape Coloureds than in Caucasians. (v) The Caucasian HE subset divides into clusters with control-like and FAS-like facial dysmorphism. The Cape Coloured HE subset is similarly divided for nonmidline facial regions but not clearly for midline structures. (vi) The Cape Coloured HE subset with control-like facial dysmorphism shows orbital hypertelorism. Facial curvature assists the recognition of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and helps explain why different facial regions result in inconsistent control-FAS discrimination rates in disparate ethnic groups.

The ophthalmology program, which is part of Hungary's comprehensive health care screening program, plays an important role in the national implementation of these. Summary of the results of Hungary's comprehensive health care screening program's ophthalmology program, which has been going on for 12 years. The ophthalmological data of 168 522 people aged between 12 and 99 years who participated in the national screening program were analyzed in nine categories: the presence of eye disease, the use of glasses, the refractive power of the glasses, refractive errors (myopia, anisometropia), the functional vision questionnaire, dry eye, colour vision, educational and communication activities. 18.1% of the participants reported having an eye disease, which was much more common in women and the elderly. The proportion of people who wore glasses reached 66%, with roughly one-third of them lacking appropriate glass strength. Myopia was the most common (58.7%) in people aged 18 to 35. Anisometropia was found in 6.5% of people. Women were more likely than men to have dry eyes (26.1%). Men had a higher rate of colour vision deficiency (5.7%) than women (0.7%). As blindness is 80% preventable, national screening tests and comprehensive educational activities that contribute to the early detection and treatment of eye diseases are important. It is critical to call attention to the significant growth in the prevalence of myopia in young people as well as the urgent need for the effective implementation of preventive measures. The importance of proper glasses must also be brought to the attention of the general population because incorrect glasses cause visual problems. The national ophthalmology screening and educational activity should be continued in the future, with the goal of reducing the incidence of eye diseases associated with visual impairment and increasing the proportion of people who wear appropriate glasses. To stop the spread of myopia, a national preventive and treatment program should be launched. Orv Hetil. 2023; 164(7): 253-259. Bevezetés: A vakság megelőzése és a látásrehabilitáció fejlesztése az Egészségügyi Világszervezet VISION 2020 és World report on vision programjainak kiemelt célja.

Célkitűzés: A Magyarország átfogó egészségvédelmi szűrőprogramja keretében 12 éve zajló szemészeti program eredményeinek összefoglalása. Módszer: Az országos szűrőprogram keretében megjelent 168 522 fő, 12 és 99 év közötti korú személy szemészeti adatait dolgoztuk fel kilenc kategóriában: szembetegség fennállása, szemüvegviselés, a szemüveg törőereje, fénytörési hibák (rövidlátóság, anisometropia), funkcionális látási kérdőív, száraz szem, színtévesztés, felvilágosító és kommunikációs tevékenység. Eredmények: A résztvevők 18,1%-a jelezte szembetegség fennállását, amely nőkben és idősekben lényegesen gyakrabban fordult elő. A szemüvegesek aránya elérte a 66%-ot, és a szemüveg közel egyharmaduknál nem volt megfelelő erősségű. Rövidlátóságot a leggyakrabban (58,7%-ban) a 18–35 éves korosztályban észleltünk. Az anisometropia előfordulása átlagosan 6,5% volt. Száraz szemet nőkben gyakrabban észleltünk (26,1%), mint férfiakban (20,1%). A színtévesztés férfiak esetében gyakoribb (5,7%) volt, mint nőknél (0,7%). Megbeszélés: Mivel a vakság 80%-ban megelőzhető, nagy jelentőségűek az országos szűrővizsgálatok, valamint a széles körű felvilágosító tevékenység, amelyek hozzájárulnak a szembetegségek korai felismeréséhez és kezeléséhez. Fontos felhívni a figyelmet a rövidlátóság gyakoriságának erős növekedésére és a megelőzési lehetőségek hatékony bevezetésének sürgető szükségességére. A jó szemüveg fontosságára is rá kell irányítani a lakosság figyelmét, mert a hibás szemüvegek látási nehézségeket okoznak.

609,609,33922926,"Reading is one of the essential processes during the maturation of an individual. It is estimated that 5-10% of school-age children are affected by dyslexia, the reading disorder characterised by difficulties in the accuracy or fluency of word recognition. There are many studies which have reported that coloured overlays and background could improve the reading process, especially in children with reading disorders. As dyslexia has neurobiological origins, the aim of the present research was to understand the relationship between physiological parameters and colour modifications in the text and background during reading in children with and without dyslexia. We have measured differences in electroencephalography (EEG), heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activities (EDA) and eye movements of the 36 school-age (from 8 to 12 years old) children (18 with dyslexia and 18 of control group) during the reading task in 13 combinations of background and overlay colours. Our findings showed that the dyslexic children have longer reading duration, fixation count, fixation duration average, fixation duration total, and longer saccade count, saccade duration total, and saccade duration average while reading on white and coloured background/overlay. It was found that the turquoise background, turquoise overlay, and yellow background colours are beneficial for dyslexic readers, as they achieved the shortest time duration of the reading tasks when these colours were used. Additionally, dyslexic children have higher values of beta (15-40 Hz) and the broadband EEG (0.5-40 Hz) power while reading in one particular colour (purple), as well as increasing theta range power while reading with the purple overlay. We have observed no significant differences between HRV parameters on white colour, except for single colours (purple, turquoise overlay, and yellow overlay) where the control group showed higher values for mean HR, while dyslexic children scored higher with mean RR. Regarding EDA measure, we found systematically lower values in children with dyslexia in comparison to the control group. Based on the present results, we can conclude that both pastel and intense background/overlays are beneficial for reading of both groups and all sensor modalities could be used to better understand the neurophysiological origins in dyslexic children.

The sample included 28 females with Rett syndrome (RTT) and 32 age-matched typically developing controls. We used a classic search task, in conjunction with eye-tracking technology. Each trial included the target and several distractors. The distractors varied in number and differed from targets in either a ""single feature"" (color or shape), creating a pop-out effect, or in a ""conjunction of features"" (color and shape), requiring serial search. Children searched for the target in arrays containing five or nine objects; trials ended when the target was fixated (or 4000 ms elapsed). Children with Rett syndrome had more difficulty finding the target than typically developing children in both conditions (success rates less than 50% versus 80%) and their success rates were little influenced by display size or age. Even when successful, children with RTT took significantly longer to respond (392 to 574 ms longer), although saccadic latency differences were observed only in the single-feature condition. Both groups showed the expected slowing of saccadic reaction times for larger arrays in the conjunction-feature condition. Search failures in RTT were not related to symptom severity. Our findings provide the first evidence that selective attention, the ability to focus on or select a particular element or object in the environment, is compromised by Rett syndrome.

Retrospective review was carried out of US results in 39 consecutive patients, from 2011 to 2013, with biliary complications after LT, documented by PTC. According to US biliary dilation, patients were classified as: mild, moderate, and severe, and according to laboratory findings as: normal or abnormal serum bilirubin and level of serum GGT. Data were correlated with PTC findings, divided in three groups: mild, moderate, and severe/occlusive BDS. There was no statistically significant correlation between the US findings and the laboratory findings and between US findings with PTC. There was a statistically significant correlation between GGT and cholangiography. In our series, abnormal US could not predict the severity of BDS on PTC. Bilirubin results were not able to predict the US findings either. GGT results demonstrated a statistically significant correlation with the severity of BDS found on PTC. These findings emphasize the role of GGT in the evaluation and decision of biliary interventions in pediatric liver transplant recipients.

This study was carried out to show that temporal encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) has a positive neuropsychological impact on pediatric MMD patients. Fifty-five participants diagnosed with MMD from 2008 to 2014 were included in this retrospective study. The mean age at the preoperative evaluation was 9.5 years and the mean age at postoperative evaluation was 10.4. The average interval of initial and follow-up test was 10 months. K-WISC-III, Rey-Kim memory test, Children's Color Trails test (CCTT), Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), and Advanced Test of Attention (ATA) were used to evaluate patient's neurocognitive profile. In this study, preoperative and postoperative neuropsychological fields were compared. Prior operation, pediatric MMD patients showed 54.2% deficit of inattention but only around 2.5% deficit in verbal memory recall function. There was a significant increase of performance IQ and PO score component of PIQ improved almost 10 scores after surgery. For memorial function, there was an improvement of approximately 10 scores in MQ after the surgery. This study also showed parietal activation following surgical treatment which enhanced the ability to interpret visual materials, to register and to retrieve visual information. Interestingly, despite the parietal cover surgery, there was a significant improvement of performance on WCST and CCTT measuring the prefrontal executive function. Concerning failure to maintain set, no significant postoperative improvements were made. However, simple and selective visual attention on ATA was significantly improved postoperatively. The results from neuropsychological field comparison testifies the effectiveness of temporal EDAS in pediatric MMD patients. The surgery not only enhances the blood flow in operative regions, but it also improves the broad cerebral function including frontoparietal domains. Such alteration leads to overall advancement in cognitive function which are impaired due to MMD.

626,626,20132362,"A totally non-invasive transperineal urodynamic technique using Doppler ultrasonography has been developed. Normal urine doesn't have blood cells so urine was thought not to produce Doppler effects. However, basic studies confirmed that the decrease of pressure at high velocity (Bernoulli effects) caused dissolved gas to form microbubbles, which are detected by Doppler ultrasonography. Subjects sat and a probe was advanced via remote control to achieve gentle contact with the perineal skin. The digital uroflow data signals and the color Doppler ultrasound video images were processed on a personal computer. This method was viable to diagnose the degree of bladder outlet obstruction. The advantage of being rapid, effective, and equipped with no special attachments allows it to surpass any other non-invasive urodynamic methods. The difference between the echocardiogram and the ultrasound urodynamic system is only the frequency of obtaining velocity information: more than 50 times per minute vs once every several hours, respectively. Although the ultrasound urodynamic system is more difficult to develop than the echocardiogram, one principle is shared by both methods. The patient can void freely without interruptions, there is no contact between the penis and the equipment and it is specifically directed toward non-invasive diagnosis. The development of non-invasive Doppler ultrasound videourodynamics will dramatically expand understanding of voiding function.

Although studies in adult patients have shown that the site of feeding (stomach vs. small intestine) may be associated with aspiration pneumonia, there are no such reports in critically ill pediatric patients. We hypothesized that in intubated pediatric patients, there was no difference in the frequency of aspiration between nasogastric and postpyloric enteral feeding. Randomized, prospective clinical study. Single pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care children's hospital. Forty-four intubated patients (< or = 18 yrs old). Intubated patients were randomized to receive either nasogastric (n = 27) or postpyloric (n = 17) enteral feeding. Feeding tube placement by the bedside nurse was confirmed by abdominal radiograph. Methylene blue was added at a standard dilution to an age-appropriate formula. Tracheal secretions were suctioned every 8 hrs, tested for blue color by observation, and analyzed via spectrophotometry. Patients were followed until feeds were stopped for anticipated extubation. Aspiration pneumonia was defined using criteria of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Methylene blue was detected in two patients in the postpyloric group by spectrophotometry. None of the patients met the CDC criteria for aspiration. There was no difference in the frequency of aspiration between the two groups (p < .07). The time until beginning feedings in the postpyloric group was greater than that for the nasogastric group (18-24 hrs vs. 6 hrs, p < .05). The postpyloric group required more abdominal radiographs compared with the nasogastric group (three radiographs vs. one, p < .05). Use of nasogastric feeding shortens the time needed to reach nutritional goals and reduces the number of radiographic studies.

628,628,37055154,"We aimed to determine why the Eagle Books, an illustrated series for American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) children to address type 2 diabetes, remain viable long after their release. We sought to answer 2 questions: Why did the books maintain popularity? What factors have sustained them? Type 2 diabetes burgeoned in the US after World War II, compounding a long legacy of injustices for AIAN peoples. By the 1980s, their rates soared above those of White people. Concerned for future generations, Tribal Leaders suggested that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Indian Health Service use traditional storytelling to teach children about staying healthy. Public health interventions are most effective when culture and history are integrated into health education, particularly stories to address a relatively new disease for AIAN peoples. From 2008 through 2013, we conducted a case study among 8 tribal communities to evaluate the uptake of the Eagle Books across Indian Country. To understand the Eagle Books' sustained appeal, in 2022 we reanalyzed the original case study themes and analyzed for the first time themes that emerged from evaluation results in the Eagle Books' program literature. These were programs that had independently evaluated their use of the Eagle Books and published their findings. Outcomes demonstrated continuous application of the Eagle Books in diverse community interventions, influencing children's healthy choices. Community implementers described sustainability components, such as the books' versatility, flexibility of use, and availability online and in print. Historical, social, economic, and environmental health determinants intersect with biological and behavioral factors to weave a complex web of causation for type 2 diabetes, beginning early in life.

Alterations in amelogenesis, caused by chemical and physical trauma that occur during the antenatal, perinatal and postnatal time periods, may result in developmental defects in deciduous and permanent tooth enamel, as demonstrated in animal studies. These defects can be clinically visible and result in a variety of morphological and functional problems in the dentition. Since enamel does not remodel after formation, it may serve as a permanent record of insults during organ development.Our primary purpose was to investigate any possible relationship between intrauterine exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (phenols and phthalates) and developmental defects in enamel in children, while also accounting for fluoride exposure. Our secondary purpose was to report descriptively on findings from comprehensive dental examinations performed on 356 children that were drawn from the general paediatric population. A cohort of children from the Utah Children's Project (N = 356) that had full medical exams, comprehensive medical and family histories and available biospecimens were given extraoral and intraoral examinations. They also completed an oral health questionnaire. Standardized intraoral photographs were taken of the teeth and viewed by standardised examiners and the dental observations were recorded for a full inventory of findings, including: tooth morphology, caries, restorations, colorations, attrition, erosion, fractures and hypomineralization. Perinatal maternal urine samples were assessed for the concentration of fluoride, phenols and phthalates, including bisphenol A (BPA).Pairwise statistical analyses were done to correlate the dental findings with one another and with the presence of environment chemicals found in the urine samples. Hypomineralization was the most common finding (96% of children; 37% of deciduous teeth, 42% of permanent teeth), consistent with molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH) described in other human populations. No consistent correlations were seen between dental findings and the presence of phenols and phthalates in prenatal urine, but the number of samples available for the assessment was limited (n = 35).In conclusion, we found a high proportion of dental hypomineralization in a population based paediatric cohort, but did not find an association with prenatal exposure to phenols and phthalates.

Outcome measures included triage score assignment, criteria making the patient emergent, proportion of emergent or urgent triage assignments, and times to examination, disposition, and admission. Altering pediatric triage criteria resulted in a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the number of patients triaged as emergent (2% vs 15%) or urgent (48% vs 55%).

To avoid incurring limitations in the user mental scheme, this study uses two complementary methodologies: focus group and semantic differential. The (qualitative) focus group methodology provides exploratory information and concepts. The (quantitative) semantic differential methodology then uses these concepts to extract the conceptual structures that users employ in their assessment of the space. Of the total 175 subjects, 31 took part in focus groups and 144 in semantic differential. Five independent concepts were identified: privacy, functionality and professional nature, spaciousness, lighting, and cleanliness. In relation to the importance of the overall positive assessment of the space, the perception of privacy and sensations of dominance and pleasure are fundamental. Six relevant design aspects were also identified: provide spacious surroundings, facilitate sufficient separation between the different posts or cots, use different colors from those usually found in health-care centers, as some aversion was found to white and especially green, design areas with childhood themes, use warm artificial light, and choose user-friendly equipment.

Groups more vulnerable to mental health disorders such as depression include Black, Indigenous, and persons of color and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer/questioning, who in recent years have the highest rate of suicide attempts (Black teens, sexual minority youth), the highest increases in suicide rates (Black children and youths), and the highest suicide rates (American Indian/Alaskan native). They frequently experience more adverse childhood events, which increases the risk of depression and suicide attempts. Pediatricians are most likely to care for these vulnerable youths, who often are less engaged in specialty mental health care for a variety of reasons, including stigma and barriers to access. By offering behavioral and mental health care to vulnerable populations in primary care, mental health equity may be achieved. Screening for depression and assessment for suicide are within the scope of pediatric practice and among the competencies recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and The American Board of Pediatrics.

638,638,26469119,"Sonoelastography is a novel technique that uses ultrasound waves to assess the elasticity of tissues noninvasively. It provides an ultrasound-based method to detect and display the relative stiffness of tissue. The main principle of sonoelastography is the measurement of tissue distortion in response to external compression. Changes in elasticity and tissues deformation elicited by compression are measured, processed and then shown in real time presentation with color-coded elastograms. Most of the elastography applications are well known and have been described in detail in adults, e.g. evaluation of liver fibrosis or thyroid nodules. Similarly, most of sonoelastographic studies are based on groups of adults. The purpose of this review article is to bring this technology closer to pediatric clinicians and to summarize some of its current clinical applications that are being pursued. In this part we take into consideration utility of elastography in evaluation pathologies of musculoskeletal system, lymphatic nodes, thyroid, kidneys in pediatric patients and also elastography of placenta.

639,639,9145116,"Atypical craniofacial clefts present a surgical challenge. Little is published about their treatment because of their rarity. Such is the nature of Tessier no. 4 clefts and others with shortened oculoalar and oculo-oral distances requiring multiple operative interventions. The soft-tissue abnormalities include a cleft of the lip with possible extension into the check, orbital dystopia, and globe abnormalities and a decreased oculo-oral distance. Typically, multiple local cheek and nasal flaps are used to close the soft-tissue defects, elevate the medial canthus, and protect the globe. However, this approach creates traction on the lower eyelid, suboptimal location of the scar, and poor color match between the flaps. We present two cases of Tessier no. 4 clefts and one case of a multiply clefted (Tessier nos. 1/13, 2/12, 3/11) child with the typical contracted oculoalar and oculo-oral distances. Reconstruction with a superiorly based nasolabial flap transposed 90 degrees under the eye was performed in all three as a primary procedure.

Cell lineage classification derived from flow cytometry and cytochemical stains were in agreement in all cases. Definitive diagnoses were feasible using flow cytometry results alone in 120 of 122 patients (98.4%) as compared with only 99 of 122 patients (81.2%) when only cytochemical staining results were considered. In two patients with inconclusive flow cytometry results, cytochemical staining alone provided information sufficient for diagnosis. Results from this study indicate that with few exceptions, flow cytometry studies alone provide sufficient information for diagnosis and management of acute leukemia in children.

641,641,19225393,"Categorizing difficulties anesthesiologists have in obtaining informed consent may influence education, performance, and research. This study investigated the trainees' perspectives and educational needs through a qualitative analysis of narratives. The Program to Enhance Relational and Communication Skills-Anesthesia used professional actors to teach communication skills and relational abilities associated with informed consent. Before attending the program, participants wrote about a challenging informed consent experience. Narratives were analyzed by two researchers following the principles of grounded theory. The researchers independently read the narratives and marked key words and phrases to identify reoccurring challenges described by anesthesiologists. Through rereading of the narratives and discussion, the two researchers reached consensus on the challenges that arose and calculated their frequency. Analysis of the 39 narratives led to the identification of three types of challenges facing anesthesiologists in obtaining informed consent. Ethical challenges included patient wishes not honored, conflict between patient and family wishes and medical judgment, patient decision-making capacity, and upholding professional standards. Practical challenges included the amount of information to provide, communication barriers, and time limitations. Relational challenges included questions about trainee competence, mistrust associated with previous negative experiences, and misunderstandings between physician and patient or family. The ethical, practical, and relational challenges in obtaining informed consent colored trainees' views of patient care and affected their interactions with patients. Using participant narratives personalizes education and motivates participants. The richness of narratives may help anesthesiologists to appreciate the qualitative aspects of informed consent.

642,642,35583535,"Supracondylar humerus fractures (SHF) are the second most common fracture in children and the most common fracture in children under seven years. Subtle neurovascular lesions in displaced SHF may be underdiagnosed clinically, but their sequelae can mean life-long symptoms. Here we show that color-coded duplex ultrasound (DUS) could help to identify these patients. We reviewed records of 229 children who had recovered from SHF. Ninety patients were available for detailed questionnaires, in-depth neurovascular examinations, and DUS. In 90 examined patients, only two had been known to have suffered from vascular complications before our study. Only one still complained spontaneously about perfusion-induced symptoms. Qualitative changes in blood flow in duplex-sonography were detectable in both. Another two patients showed similar changes in blood flow at the fracture site. Both reported load-induced pain and paresthesia on detailed inquisition when no vascular impairments had been known before. Thus, duplex-sonography identified two patients with vascular affections that had not been noticed before in routine clinical examinations. DUS can be a sensitive tool in diagnosing vascular impairments in patients with SHF. It could reduce diagnostic insecurity, especially in anesthetized or otherwise hard to examine children, and thus help avoid the therapeutic delay that otherwise might foster life-long sequelae for the patients.

For eight patients, four non-growing and four growing, the pre- and post-treatment scans were superimposed. Fast voxel-based superimposition was performed, with registration at the anterior cranial base. This superimposition process took 10-15s. The fit of the cranial base superimposition was verified by qualitative visualization of the semi-transparent axial, sagittal, and coronal cross-sectional slices of all corresponding anatomical structures. Virtual 3D surface models of the skull were generated via threshold segmentation, and superimposition errors in the reoriented models and the results of treatment for the treated cases were evaluated by 3D surface distances on colour-coded maps.

The aim of this study was to explore the parameters considered integral to scar assessment when completing photographic scar evaluation. First, opinions were sought from 38 burn health professionals in 2 tertiary pediatric hospitals who participated in focus groups where in-person and in-photograph scar rating were completed using three burn scar rating scales (modified Vancouver scar scale, Manchester scar scale, and patient and observer scar assessment scale) presented with a standard format and instructions. Second, 36 occupational therapists and physiotherapists from Australia and New Zealand completed questionnaires. Third, 10 healthcare consumers from 1 tertiary pediatric hospital participated in face-to-face or telephone interviews. Parameters believed to be assessed using photographic evaluation of burns scarring were vascularity, surface area, color, contour, height, and overall opinion. However, surface area was considered questionable as an indicator of scar maturity. These parameters mostly differ from those considered important in a burn scar outcome measure when rating scars in-person: height/thickness, vascularity, color, pliability, joint function, and patient/client opinion. A categorical scale with visual descriptors, as well as specific strategies to improve photographic technique, may go some way to addressing the perceived difficulty in rating these parameters using burn scar photographs.

The coordinating centre distributed frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and fresh whole blood (WB) samples from healthy donors, reagents, and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to participants who performed experiments by their own equipment, in order to mimic a real-life scenario. Operators returned raw and locally analysed data to ISS for central analysis and statistical elaboration. Harmonised and reproducible results were obtained by sharing experimental set-up and procedures along with centralising data analysis, leading to a reduction of cross-centre variability for naïve/memory subset frequencies particularly in the whole blood setting.

CWH were less likely to complete either subtest and performed worse on the object subtest compared to Tanzanian children without HIV. Compared to the US cohort, the Tanzanian cohort was less likely to complete both subtests - in particular the colors subtest - and showed more variability in responses at younger ages. After approximately age 6, however, the trajectory of improvement between the United States and Tanzania was similar. CWH performed worse on this per-literacy test, indicating literacy skill development in CWH needs further study. The differences between US and Tanzanian results likely reflect variability in when children learn to name colors and objects.

Based on interviews with leaders in IECMHC practice, implementation, and evaluation, a theoretical framework was created to articulate how IECMHC is hypothesized to affect expulsion by first reducing the influence of implicit bias on disciplinary decisions. Implications for practice and research are provided. Los pequeños niños de raza negra -especialmente los varones- están bajo un riesgo desproporcionado en cuanto a la suspensión y expulsión de lugares donde se les presta cuidado y educación tempranos. La Consulta de Salud Mental en la Infancia y la Temprana Niñez (IECMHC) es un acercamiento asociado con niveles más bajos de expulsión que los que se esperan, pero se desconocen los mecanismos a través de los cuales la misma pudiera influir en la expulsión prescolar. Este artículo reflexiona sobre los paralelos entre IECMHC y las intervenciones creadas para reducir los prejuicios implícitos. Con base en entrevistas con los líderes en la práctica, implementación y evaluación de IECMHC, se creó un marco de trabajo para articular cómo IECMHC se plantea como hipótesis para afectar la expulsión por medio de reducir primero la influencia de los implícitos prejuicios sobre las decisiones disciplinarias. Se aportan las implicaciones para la práctica y la investigación. Les jeunes enfants de couleur - surtout les garçons - sont à risque disproportionné de suspension et d'expulsion d’établissements d’éducation et de crèches. La Consultation de Santé Mentale du Nourrisson et de la Petite Enfance (abrégé en anglais ECMHC) est une approche liée à des taux d'expulsion moins élevés que les taux d'expulsion auxquels on s'attend, mais les mécanismes au travers desquels elle pourrait influencer l'expulsion des crèches sont méconnus. Cet article porte sur les parallèles entre la IECHMH et les interventions créées afin de réduire les préjugés implicites. Basé sur des entretiens avec des praticiens de la pratique de l'IECMHC, sa mise en place et son évaluation, une structure théorique a été créée afin d'articuler la manière dont on suppose que l'IECHHC affecte l'expulsion en réduisant d'abord l'influence des préjugés implicites sur les décisions disciplinaires. Des implications pour la pratique et la recherche sont présentées. Suspendierungsprävention: theoretischer Rahmen für die Rolle von Beratungen zur psychischen Gesundheit bei Säuglingen und Kleinkindern in Bezug auf die Bewältigung impliziter Vorurteile Kleinkinder of Color - insbesondere Jungen - sind einem unverhältnismäßigen Risiko ausgesetzt, suspendiert und aus Frühförderungs- und Bildungskontexten ausgeschlossen zu werden. Die Beratung zur psychischen Gesundheit von Säuglingen und Kleinkindern (Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health Consultation; IECMHC) ist ein Ansatz, der mit Suspendierungsraten assoziiert ist, die niedriger sind als die erwarteten Werte. Allerdings sind die Mechanismen unbekannt, welche einen Einfluss auf die Suspendierungen im Vorschulalter haben könnten. Diese Arbeit geht auf die Parallelen zwischen IECMHC und Interventionen zur Verringerung impliziter Vorurteile ein. Basierend auf Interviews mit Führungskräften in der Praxis, Implementierung und Evaluation von IECMHC wurde ein theoretischer Rahmen geschaffen, der eine Erklärung für den Einfluss von IECMHC auf die Suspendierungsraten darstellen soll. Es wird die Hypothese aufgestellt, dass der Einfluss impliziter Vorurteile auf Disziplinarentscheidungen verringert wird.

655,655,22376316,"Maps can portray trends, patterns, and spatial differences that might be overlooked in tabular data and are now widely used in health research. Little has been reported about the process of using maps to communicate epidemiological findings. Population weighted raster maps show colour changes over the study area. Similar to the rasters of barometric pressure in a weather map, data are the health occurrence--a peak on the map represents a higher value of the indicator in question. The population relevance of each sentinel site, as determined in the stratified last stage random sample, combines with geography (inverse-distance weighting) to provide a population-weighted extension of each colour. This transforms the map to show population space rather than simply geographic space. Maps allowed discussion of strategies to reduce violence against women in a context of political sensitivity about quoting summary indicator figures. Time-series maps showed planners how experiences of health services had deteriorated despite a reform programme; where in a country HIV risk behaviours were improving; and how knowledge of an economic development programme quickly fell off across a region. Change maps highlighted where indicators were improving and where they were deteriorating. Maps of potential impact of interventions, based on multivariate modelling, displayed how partial and full implementation of programmes could improve outcomes across a country. Scale depends on context. To support local planning, district maps or local government authority maps of health indicators were more useful than national maps; but multinational maps of outcomes were more useful for regional institutions. Mapping was useful to illustrate in which districts enrolment in religious schools--a rare occurrence--was more prevalent. Population weighted raster maps can present social audit findings in an accessible and compelling way, increasing the use of evidence by planners with limited numeracy skills or little time to look at evidence. Maps complement epidemiological analysis, but they are not a substitute. Much less do they substitute for rigorous epidemiological designs, like randomised controlled trials.

A survey was administered to a random sample of 600 pediatricians and family physicians in Michigan addressing usual practice for BMI charting, barriers, perceived influence of BMI chart innovations on the likelihood of increasing use of BMI and participating in training regarding obesity management. The response rate was 52%. Few respondents report that they generally use BMI charts for preschoolers (24%). The most frequently endorsed barrier was time and complexity involved in explaining BMI (70%). Respondents endorsed innovations such as color-coded charts (60%), and the inclusion of management recommendations (61%) as strong influences on the likelihood of using BMI more often. Frequently endorsed training modalities were workshops (47%), online (45%), and DVD (43%).

657,657,39251366,"Venipuncture is one of the most commonly performed medical procedures in paediatric care, but it can also be one of the most painful and distressing experiences for patients. Finding effective strategies to manage pain and fear associated with venipuncture is crucial for improving the paediatric patient experience and promoting positive health outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a combined approach using a topical analgesic cream (TKTX cream) and a distraction technique (Trace Image and Colouring for Kids-Book, TICK-B) in reducing pain intensity and fear levels in children undergoing venipuncture procedures. We conducted this randomised controlled trial among 176 children aged 6-12 years undergoing venipuncture. Participants were randomly assigned to four groups: TICK-B, TKTX cream, TICK-B+TKTX cream and a control group. Pain and fear were measured using the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale and Children's Fear Scale. The study was carried out from 20 February 2024 to 1 June 2024 at the emergency unit of Heevi paediatric teaching hospital in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. In the intervention groups, TICK-B was applied for 2-3 min before needle insertion, and TKTX cream was applied 20 min before the venipuncture procedure. All outcome measures were evaluated 2-3 min after the completion of the venipuncture procedure. The combined TICK-B (colouring book) and TKTX cream (topical anaesthetic) intervention was the most effective in reducing both pain intensity (mean score 2.80 vs 7.24 in the control, p<0.001) and fear levels (mean score 0.93 vs 2.83 in the control, p<0.001) during and after venipuncture procedures compared with individual interventions and control. The combined TICK-B distraction and TKTX cream topical anaesthetic intervention was the most effective in reducing pain intensity and fear during and after venipuncture in children, providing a practical strategy for healthcare providers to optimise needle procedure management.

A mixed-methods design of qualitative interviews and a quantitative survey was used. The setting was a sports medicine concussion clinic. The sample included 2 independent groups of 30 children (females n = 36, males n = 24) each aged 12 to 17 years, with postconcussion headache and pediatric concussion expert clinicians (n = 5). During phase 1 of the study, subjects were interviewed individually about their headaches and their ideas for an electronic diary. A prototype was developed using these children's interview data. In phase 2 of the study, both children and clinicians piloted the prototype. Clinicians' survey data regarding the feasibility and utility of the diary were examined using thematic and descriptive analyses. The phase 1 sample recommended a diary with calendar and clock functions, head views, menus (eg, pain descriptors), soft colors, a choice of pain assessment scales, and the ability to personalize it. All of the children thought that the new Headache Electronic Diary for Children With Concussion (HED-CC) would be helpful to track their headache and reported that other children with concussions would be likely to use it. Participants recommended improvement of the head views and clock function. In phase 2 of the study, all clinicians reported that the new HED-CC measure was feasible and useful for the assessment and documentation of headache. The new HED-CC provides for thorough assessment and documentation of postconcussion headache. Proactive, real-time measurement helps children remember the details of their headache pain and correlating events/circumstances. An appealing, age-appropriate measure increases the likelihood of children's symptom tracking and data accuracy. The HED-CC will improve clinicians' understanding of postconcussion headache and guide treatment. Additional testing with a larger sample is required to establish clinical application benefits and improve reliability/validity of the new measure.

Therapists use guided discovery to enable children to find their own solutions. Although CO-OP is recommended in a group setting, studies are needed to support its effectiveness. A single-case study design with multiple baselines across participants and four systematic replications will be used. In each of the five groups, four children (aged 8-12 years) will be randomly included at the baseline. The baseline includes 5-8 measurements, and the CO-OP intervention stage is comprised of 10 sessions. The follow-up stage includes five measurements. Prior to baseline, each child in each of the five groups will choose five activities of which three will be carried out during the intervention sessions. Children's performance in each of these activities will be scored using the Performance Quality Rating Scale (PQRS) as the main measure.

Whereas prediction performance varied with distinct clinical endpoints and classification models, equivalent performance metrics were observed for one- and two-color measurements in both internal and external validation. Furthermore, overlap of selected signature genes correlated inversely with endpoint prediction difficulty.

671,671,31568142,"Children with perinatal HIV (pHIV) may display distinct long-term cognitive phenotypes. We used group-based trajectory modeling to identify clusters of children with pHIV after similar developmental trajectories and predictors of belonging to select cognitive trajectory groups. Participants included children, 4-17 years of age, with pHIV in Thailand and Cambodia. Cognitive measures included translated versions of Intelligence Quotient tests, Color Trails Tests and Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration conducted semiannually over 3-6 years. The best fit of trajectory groups was determined using maximum likelihood estimation. Multivariate logistic regression identified baseline factors associated with belonging to the lowest scoring trajectory group. Group-based trajectory analyses revealed a 3-cluster classification for each cognitive test, labeled as high, medium and low scoring groups. Most trajectory group scores remained stable across age. Verbal IQ declined in all 3 trajectory groups and the high scoring group for Children's Color Trails Test 1 and 2 showed an increase in scores across age. Children in the lowest scoring trajectory group were more likely to present at an older age and report lower household income. Group-based trajectory modeling succinctly classifies cohort heterogeneity in cognitive outcomes in pHIV.

The study sample was composed of offspring of patients with psychotic disorders (n = 30), the high risk group (HR), and age and sex matched healthy controls (n = 32) the Control Group (CG). The psychiatric diagnoses were established by using the KD-SADS. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire adolescent and parent forms (SDQ-A, SDQ-P) were used. General functioning status were evaluated by The Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) and Global Functioning Scale: Social and Role Functioning. Wisconsin Cart Sorting Test, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, California Verbal Learning Test, Stroop Colour and Word Test and Trail Making Tests A and B were used to assess neurocognitive abilities; to assess social cognition and empathy skills DANVA-2 and Bryant Empathy Scale were used, respectively. Among HR 53.33% had at least one psychopathology. SDQ-A, SDQ-P scores were significantly higher, and CGAS, social and role functioning scores were significantly lower in HR. Neurocognitive test scores were significantly worse except for SCWT scores in the HR. No significant differences were obtained in social cognition. A variety of the neurocognitive abilities were significantly correlated with the role functioning. In regression analyses, the most predictive scores were WCST total correct scores and role functioning score.

Computed tomography (CT)-guided needle localization and methylene blue marking allow thoracoscopic resection of nonvisible nodules. Malignant disease was diagnosed in three patients aged 2, 2.5, and 11 years. Pulmonary nodules seen on chest CT, representing either metastatic disease or infection developed in each patient. All lesions were 1 to 2 cm deep to the pleural surface, precluding thoracoscopic visualization. A Homer mammographic needle was placed near the lesion using CT guidance under general anesthesia. The pleura overlying the lesion was also marked with methylene blue. Under the same anesthetic, patients went to the operating room where the lesions were thoracoscopically resected. Needle localization and methylene blue staining accurately localized the lesion in all cases. Thoracoscopic resection provided a diagnosis of metastatic disease or infection in all cases. There were no complications.

674,674,11106046,"Primary vesicoureteral reflux is a predisposing factor for urinary tract infections in children. The first-choice technique for the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux is voiding cystourethrography, followed by cystoscintigraphy; cystoscintigraphy, however, has the advantage of only minor irradiation of the patient, but it does not allow the morphological evaluation of bladder and vesicoureteral reflux grading. Colour-Doppler cystosonography with echocontrast is a recently introduced method for imaging vesicoureteral reflux. The aim of our study is to evaluate the role of colour-Doppler cystosonography with echocontrast in the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux. Twenty children (11M, 9F) aged between 0.4 and 4.9 y underwent colour-Doppler cystosonography using a diluted solution of Levovist (Schering, Germany), after filling up the bladder with saline. In all patients, vesicoureteral reflux diagnosis and grading had been performed previously by voiding cystourethrography within 5 d from ultrasonography. Our data showed high accuracy in the detection of medium to severe vesicoureteral reflux (grades III-V), confirmed by radiological features in 9/9 patients. Conversely, in the 11 patients with mild vesicoureteral reflux (grades I-II), this technique showed extremely low sensitivity, allowing diagnosis in only four cases. Colour-Doppler cystosonography, because of the absence of ionizing radiations, has great advantages, particularly in patients needing prolonged monitoring. Despite experiences reported in the literature, this technique has a role in the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux. Our group chooses colour-Doppler cystosonography for the follow-up of medium-severe grade vesicoureteral reflux already diagnosed by radiology and/or scintigraphy.

675,675,20476714,"The removal of teeth amongst the Maasai is a traditional practice as part of an initiation or to make space for feeding in an event of diseases locking the jaw. Removal of deciduous canine tooth buds (DCB) among infants below 2 years has been reported in several studies to be common mainly amongst communities in East Africa, Ethiopia and Sudan. The main reason for the practice revolves around the belief that tooth buds or 'maggots' are false teeth, nylon or worms and are responsible for diarrhoea, vomiting, fever and growth retardation in children, amongst other illnesses. The main objective of this study was to assess the socio-cultural factors which contribute to this practice. The main methods of data collected included Focus Group Discussions (FGD) with mothers of children in that age group and Traditional Birth Attendants (TBA). In-depth interviews (IDI)were conducted with key informants versed with Maasai traditions whereas observations were done within the manyattas where participants live. Proceedings at both the FGD and the IDI were recorded on paper and were analysed thematically. The study showed that the removal of canine tooth buds amongst children that started initially with calves--that diseases that cause diarrhoea in calves were brought about by the canine tooth buds that were turning reddish in colour--is deeply rooted and practised in the community despite sensitisation interventions mounted jointly by the University of Nairobi, Kenya Medical Research Institute and the Kenya Medical Training College, among others.

Prospective observations during CPR in a university children's hospital. Forty children (28 male, 12 female) aged 1 week to 10 years (25 children aged < or = 1 year, mean age 27.2 months, median 7 months), weighing 2.5 to 40 kg (31 children weighing < or = 15 kg, mean 10.94 kg, median 7 kg) who underwent a total of 48 endotracheal intubations during CPR. After intubation, ETT position was verified by usual clinical methods including direct visualization. The device was attached between the ETT and ventilation bag, the patient was manually ventilated, and a first reading was obtained. Any color change from purple (Area A, end-tidal CO2 < 0.5%) to tan or yellow (Area B or C, end-tidal CO2 > or = 0.5%) was considered to be positive for airway intubation. CPR was conducted as per Pediatric Advanced Life Support guidelines. A second reading was obtained when the decision to discontinue CPR was made. All nine esophageal tube positions were correctly identified by the detector. Thirty-three of 39 tracheal tube positions were correctly identified (P < .001). For verifying ETT position, the device had a sensitivity of 84.6%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 60%. Readings were obtained at the end of CPR in 25 patients. All 13 patients who regained spontaneous circulation and survived to ICU admission had a second reading in the C range, while none of the 12 patients with a second reading in the A or B range survived. Both the first and second end-tidal CO2 readings in the C range correlated significantly with short-term survival (P = .01 and P < .001, respectively). Two patients were eventually discharged from the hospital. During CPR a positive test confirms placement of the ETT within the airway, whereas a negative test indicates either esophageal intubation or airway intubation with poor or absent pulmonary blood flow and requires an alternate means of confirmation of tube position. The detector may be of prognostic value for return of spontaneous circulation and short-term survival.

677,677,29428869,"Mercury exposure in the Brazilian Amazon region has been an important concern since the 1980s, when gold mining activities contaminated many Amazonian river basins and the fish therein. Mercury exposure in humans can lead to changes in neural function. The visual system has been used as a functional indicator of methylmercury (organic) and mercury vapour (inorganic) toxicity. Children are particularly vulnerable to this metal exposure. To compare the color vision of children from riverine communities of mercury-exposed (Tapajós basin) and non-exposed Amazonian rivers (Tocantins basin). The study sample was 176 children, aged 7-14 years old. Children from two locations in the mercury-exposed Tapajós river basin, Barreiras (n = 71) and São Luiz do Tapajos (n = 41), were compared to children from Limoeiro do Ajuru (n = 64), a non-exposed area in the Tocantins river basin. No caregiver reported that any children had contact with mercury vapour during their lifetime, and probably most of the mercury in their bodies was obtained by fish consumption. Because of this, we decided to evaluate the mercury exposure by total mercury levels in hair samples, a good marker for organic mercury, and not in the urine, a marker for inorganic mercury. Color vision was assessed by the Lanthony Desaturated D-15 test. We used the Vingrys and King-Smith method (1988) to quantify the hue ordering test. The primary visual outcomes from this analysis were C-index (magnitude of the hue ordering error) and angle of the hue ordering. The Tapajós children had a higher mean hair mercury level (mean: 4.5 μg/g; range: 0.26-22.38 μg/g) than that of Tocantins children (mean: 0.49 μg/g; range: 0.03-1.91 μg/g) (p < 0.05). Mean difference was approximately 4.01 μg/g with a 95% confidence interval of 2.79-5.23. The results of the Lanthony D-15d test showed no significant difference between the C-index mean values of the Tapajós and Tocantins groups (p > 0.05). There was a weak linear correlation in the average C-index obtained from both eyes and the total mercury concentration. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that the location of the community and the age had a greater influence on the visual outcomes than the sex of the children and within-locale variation in mercury concentration. Our results suggest a difference in one aspect of vision, that is, color vision, between children living in two different river basins in the Brazilian Amazon. The association may be related to Hg exposure but also appeared related to the location of the community and age.

678,678,9248039,"We examined blood samples of 214 forensic autopsy cases, excluding fire victims, on a CO-oximeter system in order to evaluate post-mortem oxymetric profiles with reference to the causes of death. Oxyhemoglobin (O2-Hb) levels in the left and right heart blood, respectively, ranged from 0 to 97.7% and from 0 to 92.1%, showing no apparent correlation with the post-mortem intervals or rectal temperatures. In nearly 60% of the cases, O2-Hb was lower than 10%. A high O2-Hb level (over 50%) in the left heart blood was most frequently observed in death from cold exposure and occasionally in fatalities from blunt injuries and stab/incised wounds with or without medical care. O2-Hb in the heart blood was usually very low (under 10%) in fatalities from asphyxiation, drowning, poisoning and natural diseases. A greatest oxymetric variation was observed in death from injuries, probably due to varied causal mechanisms of death. In most cases, the differences between blood O2-Hb levels in the heart and iliac vessels were within 15%; whereas O2-Hb in the cerebral venous blood was usually evidently higher than that in the right heart blood. An inverse relation of O2-Hb levels to total hemoglobin contents was observed slightly for the blood in the heart and iliac vessels, and more obviously for the cerebral venous blood. The above post-mortem oxymetric profiles were considered to at least partially reflect the final balance of oxygen uptake and consumption in dying process, possibly also affected by the circulatory status, giving an objective index to the color of cadaveric blood (hypostasis), although it should be assessed in consideration of post-mortem interference and total hemoglobin contents. In any case, however, post-mortem oxymetry seemed to have a limited value owing to severe systemic hypoxia which would be a common final state before death from various fatal traumas and diseases, maybe except for those with extremely short agony.

This qualitative study was conducted in Mbale district, Uganda from February to March 2020. Eight focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with 56 primary school-age children, stratified by age (6-9 and 10-13 years), sex (male and female), and school status (in school and out of school). All FGDs were conducted in either Lumasaaba or Luganda. The FGDs were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and translated into English. Data were coded, and overarching themes were identified using thematic framework analysis. Two themes identified were (1) Children's perceptions and experiences with AODs. The participants understood alcohol by its consistency, colour, odour, and by brand/logo. They described the types and quantities of AOD consumed by school-age children, brewing processes for homemade alcoholic drinks, and short and long-term consequences of the use of alcohol. (2) Contributing factors to childhood drinking included: Stress relief for children who experienced multiple adversities (orphaned, poverty-stricken, and hailing from broken homes), fitting in with friends, influence from families, and media exposure that made alcohol look cool. Children would start drinking at an early age) or were given alcohol by their parents, sometimes before they could start talking. In the community, alcohol and other drugs were cheap and available and children could drink from anywhere, including in the classroom. Children eligible for primary education in Uganda can easily access and use AOD. Several factors were identified as contributing to alcohol and other drug use among children, including availability and accessibility, advertising, lack of parental awareness and supervision, peer influence, adverse childhood experiences, socioeconomic factors, and cultural norms. There is a need for multi-sectoral action for awareness of childhood AOD use and deliberate consideration of children in the planning, design, and implementation of research, policies, and programs for prevention and early intervention.

Observational, prospective study enrolling consecutive patients at a tertiary multi-disciplinary paediatric hospital. A total of 211 percutaneous, non-tunnelled CVCs were analysed. Data regarding potential risk factors for CVC-related VT were collected. Compression ultrasonography with colour Doppler was used to diagnose VT. Overall, 30.3% of children developed CVC-related VT, with an incidence rate of 29.6 (confidence interval, 22.5-36.9) cases/1000 CVC days. Upper body CVC location, multiple lumen CVCs, and male gender were independent risk factors for VT in multivariate analysis. All upper body VTs were in the internal jugular vein (IJV). The occurrence of CVC-related VT did not affect length of paediatric ICU or hospital stay. In patients with VT, femoral CVCs, young age, paediatric ICU admission, and a ratio of CVC/vein diameter >0.33 were associated with VT being symptomatic, occlusive, or both. IJV VT was often asymptomatic and non-occlusive. Paediatric non-tunnelled CVCs are frequently complicated by VT.

685,685,7861636,"""At first glance the lungs may seem uncomplicated, but many wise men have gone astray in their labyrinths."" These words were written by Dr. A.A. Liebow, a famous pathologist, in a foreword to the first edition of Pathology of the Lung by H. Spencer. This same thought can also be applied to the field of medicolegal autopsies. 1. The gross appearance of the lungs in medicolegal autopsies Plucks consisting of the lungs, neck organs, the esophagus and the aorta were removed from human cadavers and after taking photos of the frontal and rear view, the lungs were carefully examined to reveal whether the lung shows characteristic morphological changes depending on causes of death. Based on their appearance, the lungs were classified into the 3 following types: a collapsed, a non-collapsed and an inflated type, each of these types reflecting the probable cause of death. The collapsed type of lung was seen in cases of death from exanguination, and the lung falling into shrinkage due to traumatic pneumo- and/or hemo-thorax was also classified into the collapsed type. The non-collapsed type of lung was seen in cases whose lungs were thermo-coagulated and in a case of death from a pulmonary embolism. Also, the deflating lungs of drowning victims before falling into collapse, were classified into a non-collapsed type. The inflated type of lung consisted of lungs that showed ballooning soon after death by drowning, and lungs that had inflated due to emphysema or edema from various causes. This lung study has reconfirmed that the lungs show hypostatic changes more clearly than any other organs of the body, and in the absence of skin color changes reflecting hypostasis, the settling of the blood in the lung could be detected in most cases. 2. Early histopathological lung changes induced by shock One hundred and thirty medicolegal cases were reviewed to detect early histopathological changes of the lung induced by shock. In many cases of death from various causes, pulmonary edema and hemorrhage were noted, but the incidence of such changes did not reveal any significant differences among the causes of death. When death had resulted from a hemorrhage or occurred during a state of shock, megakaryocytes in the pulmonary vessels tended to increase. However, if death from such causes had occurred shortly after the event, no increase in megakaryocytes was noted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) ",685,[Some findings of the lung in medicolegal autopsy cases],Ohya I.,Nihon Hoigaku Zasshi. 1994 Dec;48(6):379-94.,Ohya I,Nihon Hoigaku Zasshi,1994,1994/12/01,,,
686,686,33405290,"To determine whether hearing aid (HA) use affects social perceptions of general public adults and age-matched peers and if so, determine if effects are modulated by lack of societal representation of pediatric HAs. A 10-year-old boy was presented in six photographic conditions with and without HAs and eyeglasses (a worn sensory aid with wider societal representation). HAs were presented in neutral skin tone and bright blue colors. Photographic conditions were embedded into web-based surveys with visual analog scales to capture social perceptions data and sourced to 206 adults (age 18-65) and 202 peers (age 10) with demographic characteristics representative of the general US population. Mean differences in scores for each condition compared to control images were computed using two-tailed t-tests. In both adult and child respondents, HAs were associated with decreased athleticism, confidence, health, leadership, and popularity. Glasses were associated with decreased athleticism and popularity but increased intelligence, overall success, and in the child respondents, friendliness. When worn in combination, the beneficial effects of glasses were mitigated by brightly colored but not neutrally colored HAs. Negative effects of pediatric HAs on social perceptions may be influenced by poor societal representation of HAs. These results suggest that greater representation of pediatric HAs is necessary to make society more inclusive for children with hearing loss. 4 Laryngoscope, 131:E2387-E2392, 2021.

The authors obtained CT and MR images of 22 crayons from three manufacturers and three non-pigmented crayons cast by the authors. CT attenuation of the crayons and diameter of the MRI susceptibility signal dropout were plotted versus brand and color. All crayons demonstrated a longitudinal central hypo-attenuating tract. Crayon attenuation varied by brand and color. All of the crayons demonstrated a signal void on T1 and T2 imaging and signal dropout on susceptibility-weighted imaging, the diameter of which varied by brand and color.

688,688,30838731,"The main photochemical pathway in phototherapy for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is the production and elimination (in bile or urine) of cyclobilirubin, which is a structural photoisomer of bilirubin, and which is most efficiently produced by green light. Green light-emitting diode (LED) phototherapy, however, has not been evaluated in the clinical setting because it is not recommended in American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines. We therefore compared the efficacy of green LED phototherapy and blue LED phototherapy in patients with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. In this prospective randomized controlled trial, neonates with hyperbilirubinemia were randomly allocated to a green LED or blue LED phototherapy group. Both groups underwent 24 h of phototherapy, and blood was sampled before and after 24 h of phototherapy. Total serum bilirubin (TSB) was measured using enzymatic methods and bilirubin photoisomers were measured on high-performance liquid chromatography. Thirty-four infants were randomized (green, n = 16; blue, n = 18). TSB decreased significantly from 15.3 ± 1.5 to 13.9 ± 1.5 mg/dL in the green LED group (P < 0.01) and from 16.2 ± 1.3 to 14.5 ± 1.7 mg/dL in the blue LED group (P < 0.01) after 24 h of phototherapy.

Successful occlusion of ductus; frequency, pattern, and prognosis of residual shunts; Doppler velocities in left pulmonary artery and aorta; volume loading of the left heart. Including reocclusions the overall rate of successful occlusion was 96%. A total of six devices embolised at the time of operation (4.3%) with no sequelae. There were no anatomical factors that predicted a poor outcome, but suboptimal positioning of the device led to a significantly higher incidence of residual shunts (p < 0.001).

690,690,32701550,"Capillary refill time is a noninvasive method to assess tissue perfusion to determine shock status. Capillary refill time is defined as the time required to regain skin color after blanching pressure is applied. Although common methods to measure capillary refill time depend on clinicians' visual assessment, a new approach using a pulse oximeter waveform analysis exists, referred to as full finger reperfusion time. We aim to evaluate reproducibility and validity of the novel full finger reperfusion time measurement using clinicians' visual capillary refill time assessment as a reference standard. Prospective observational study. PICUs and operating suites at a large academic children's hospital. Ninety-nine children 1-12 years old with various skin color tones. Each child had 10 measurements, including five full finger reperfusion time and five clinician capillary refill time, alternating second and third digits. Eighteen children had prolonged capillary refill time (> 2 s) and four children with capillary refill time greater than 3 seconds. Four-hundred eighty-five data pairs were analyzed. Intraclass correlation coefficient of full finger reperfusion time within each patient was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.68-0.83), demonstrating good reproducibility. Correlation coefficient between full finger reperfusion time and clinician capillary refill time was moderate: r = 0.37 (p < 0.0001; 95% CI, 0.29-0.44) for the pairs and r = 0.52 (p < 0.0001; 95% CI, 0.36-0.65) for patient average. Bland-Altman plot showed a consistent difference between full finger reperfusion time and clinician capillary refill time (full finger reperfusion time 1.14 s longer). Weak association was found between force and full finger reperfusion time (β = -0.033 ± 0.016; 95% CI, -0.065 to -0.0016; p = 0.04), finger thickness (β = -0.20 ± 0.089; 95% CI, -0.37 to -0.19; p = 0.03), except for color tone (p = 0.31). Finger temperature was associated with full finger reperfusion time (β = -0.18 ± 0.041; 95% CI, -0.26 to -0.0999; p < 0.0001). Full finger reperfusion time demonstrated good reproducibility. Full finger reperfusion time showed moderate correlation with clinician capillary refill time. Full finger reperfusion time was 1.14 seconds longer than capillary refill time.

692,692,19119694,"The value of echocardiography in the diagnosis and follow-up of most cardiovascular diseases is well established, even though the ever-increasing demand for the use of this technique is not always justifiable. The ""Appropriatezza ECO Milano"" project was developed among hospitals in Milan (Italy) to foster a rational use of echocardiography. The aim of this study was to evaluate and improve appropriateness of requests for two-dimensional color Doppler echocardiography, considering indications, prescription behaviors and clinical utility in both the outpatient and inpatient settings. Following several meetings, a consensus was reached whereby a multicenter, observational study would be undertaken. We assessed the value of each request in agreement with the 2003 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/American Society of Echocardiography guidelines. An ad hoc Microsoft Access database was developed to collect study data, which refer to May 2007. Eleven hospitals participated in the study. 4130 echocardiographic examinations were considered (2300 performed in men and 1830 performed in women; mean age 64 +/- 16 years); 1701 examinations were performed in hospitalized patients and 2429 in outpatients. The incidence of pathological findings was higher in hospitalized patients (73%) than in outpatients (53%) (Pearson chi2 = 29, p<0.001). A higher additional clinical value was found in hospitalized vs non-hospitalized patients (48 vs. 35%, Pearson chi2 = 99; p <0.001). In both settings, the majority of echocardiographic examinations were requested by cardiologists (inpatients 36%, outpatients 54%). The most appropriate examinations were performed more frequently in class I or class IIA hospitalized patients (73%) than in outpatients (52%) (Pearson chi2 = 277, p<0.001). Furthermore, the least accurate the indication, the less the clinical utility found in examinations requested from hospitals and outpatient clinics (64 vs 61% in class I patients, Pearson chi2 = 413, p<0.001; 5 vs 11% in class III patients, Pearson chi2 = 584, p<0.001). Conclusions. Our data confirm an inadequate level of appropriateness of requests for two-dimensional color Doppler examinations in either inpatients or outpatients. After over 10 years of passively observing and recording this trend, a timely resolution of these issues is topical in order to improve the implementation of criteria and to guarantee cost-effective and high-quality cardiovascular care.

693,693,10190408,"Although cardiologists who treat adults have been evaluating pediatric patients using echocardiography since the early 1980s, the diagnostic accuracy of such studies has never been tested. To prospectively assess diagnostic accuracy of pediatric echocardiograms performed in adult laboratories (adult-lab echos) compared with evaluations of the same patients in pediatric laboratories (pediatric-lab echos), we gathered data from 66 patients, ages 1 day to 18 years (median 19 months), who underwent adult-lab echos in community hospitals or private offices before evaluation by a pediatric cardiologist; subsequently, 65 underwent pediatric-lab echos in a university hospital laboratory. Echocardiographic diagnoses were compared with (1) diagnoses proved by catheterization or surgery (25 patients), and (2) echocardiographic diagnoses verified by blinded duplicate-observer review (41 patients). Eighteen patients had no cardiac disease; 42 had simple lesions, 5 had intermediate lesions, and 1 had a complex lesion. In 25 patients with 46 procedure-proven diagnoses, the most important error per adult-lab echo was major in 11 (44%), moderate in 7 (28%), and minor in 3 (12%); in pediatric-lab echos it was major in 0 (0%), moderate in 1 (4%), and minor in 1 (4%). In 41 patients with 62 duplicate-observer-verified diagnoses, the most important error per adult-lab echo was major in 5 (12%), moderate in 12 (29%), and minor in 5 (12%); pediatric-lab echos had no errors. In 35 of 66 adult-lab echos (53%), the most important error was major or moderate. Of these, 71% were interpretive, 17% technical, and 11% both. Error incidences were not related to patient age, study year, use of color Doppler, or complexity of diagnoses. In 29 of these 35 patients, pediatric-lab echos resulted in altered clinical management, including 12 surgeries and 2 averted surgeries. In 3 of the 29, delayed diagnoses were associated with fixed pulmonary vascular disease, hypoxemic spells, and vascular collapse with severe metabolic acidosis.

We evaluated possible longitudinal associations between the use of MPs and CPs in a cohort of primary school children and effects on their cognitive function. Data on children's socio-demographics, use of MPs and CPs, and cognitive function were collected at baseline (2010-2012) and follow-up (2012-2013). Cognitive outcomes were evaluated with the CogHealth™ test battery and Stroop Color-Word test. The change in the number of MP/CP voice calls weekly from baseline to follow-up was dichotomized: ""an increase in calls"" or a ""decrease/no change in calls"". Multiple linear regression analyses, adjusting for confounders and clustering by school, were performed to evaluate the associations between the change in cognitive outcomes and change in MP and CP exposures. Of 412 children, a larger proportion of them used a CP (76% at baseline and follow-up), compared to a MP (31% at baseline and 43% at follow-up). Of 26 comparisons of changes in cognitive outcomes, four demonstrated significant associations. The increase in MP usage was associated with larger reduction in response time for response inhibition, smaller reduction in the number of total errors for spatial problem solving and larger increase in response time for a Stroop interference task. Except for the smaller reduction in detection task accuracy, the increase in CP usage had no effect on the changes in cognitive outcomes. Our study shows that a larger proportion of children used CPs compared to MPs.

The strategy of modern facial restoration emphasizes enhancement of aesthetic appearance as significantly as mitigation of functional impairment. Criteria for success are (1) an undistracted ""normal"" look at conversational distance, (2) facial balance and symmetry, (3) distinct aesthetic units fused by inconspicuous scars, (4) ""doughy"" skin texture appropriate for corrective makeup, and (5) dynamic facial expression. Since 1985, the author has successfully restored 17 severely disfigured burned faces by replacement of entire aesthetic units with microvascular ""prepatterned"" composite flaps blended into the facial canvas by cosmetic camouflage techniques. The series includes hemiface (2), neck/jaw (5), chin/lower lip (3), cheek/malar (5), peri-orbital (2), nose (3), upper lip (4), and ear reconstructions (4). Flaps represented are free preauricular (1), radial forearm (6), ulnar forearm (1), free scapular (6), ilio-osteocutaneous (2), temporoparietal (8), vascularized forehead island (3), supraclavicular (1), and SMAS (1). Important to outcome is extensive initial intraoperative ""sculpting"" to simulate normal planes and contours. Seams are placed at junctions of facial components. Three-dimensional imaging is used to assess architectural asymmetries, and bone grafts are aided by computer-generated acrylic models. Adjunctive procedures include tensor fasciae latae slings, intraoperative tissue expansion, suction-assisted lipectomy, and scar management. After restoration of facial form and texture, flesh color make-up and/or tattooing of beard, lips, scars, eyebrows, etc., aid to hide scars and pigment the skin to harmonize with the rest of the face. In all cases, facial integrity has been aesthetically restored and, in most instances, with makeup, is near normal in social settings at conversational distances.

Intracranial NECs in the pediatric population are rare. The authors describe the presentation, radiographic imaging, and pathologic findings of an 11-year-old boy with a right oculomotor nerve NEC. A literature review was performed to identify additional cases of pediatric intracranial NECs published in the English language, over the past 30 years (1990-2020). The authors discuss the presentation, investigations, management, and prognosis of this interesting entity. We describe an 11-year-old boy who presented to neurosurgical attention with disconjugate gaze, anisocoria, and ptosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a lobulated, cystic, and peripherally enhancing mass involving the right oculomotor nerve. The patient underwent pterional craniotomy for drainage of the cyst and subtotal resection of the cyst wall. The tan-colored mass was displacing the basilar artery, compressing the cerebral peduncle, and adherent to the inferior surface of the tentorium. The lesion was within the oculomotor nerve and splitting the fibers, and the cystic contents were thick and mucinous. Histopathological examination of the specimen demonstrated a thin fibrous cyst wall with scattered inflammatory cells and lined by simple columnar epithelium containing mucin. The lining cells were immunoreactive with epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and pan-keratin AE1/AE3. The diagnosis of a NEC was rendered. A comprehensive literature review of pediatric intracranial NECs yielded 46 additional lesions published in the literature, involving the skull base, posterior fossa, cerebral convexity, and cranial nerves. NECs present with local mass effect and less commonly, with aseptic meningitis or intracystic hemorrhage. Maximal safe GTR remains the mainstay management, although cyst drainage and marsupialization, cyst shunting, and fenestration of cystic contents into the ventricle or basal cisterns have been reported with variable success. CNS NECs are rare congenital entities; although they occur less frequently in the intracranial components compared to the spine, their diagnosis and management should be considered for intracranial cystic lesions.

Delayed diagnosis and surgical intervention with Kasai portoenterostomy after 3 months of age is significantly associated with poor prognosis for native liver survival. A national Taiwan infant stool color card (SCC) screening program has entirely eliminated late Kasai portoenterostomy >90 days of age and improved native liver survival. A recent large-scale prospective cohort study in British Columbia, Canada, indicated that distribution of SCC on the maternity ward was feasible, led to high utilization rate, and was cost-effective. The aim of the present study was to assess the generalizability of this screening strategy in another Canadian jurisdiction with a different sociodemographic profile. An SCC was distributed to families of newborns discharged at St Mary's Hospital Center, Montreal, Quebec. Families were instructed to monitor their infant's stool color for 21 days and then complete and mail the SCC to the study center. Phone surveys to families who did not return cards were used to estimate total card utilization rate. Two thousand two hundred forty-six infants were eligible for inclusion; 99.9% were enrolled. Mail SCC return rate was 63.3%. No cases of BA were identified. All of the 118 families who completed the phone survey reported that they had utilized the SCC. Conservative and optimistic estimates for total card utilization rates were 82% and 100%, respectively.

Our goal was to describe their normal sonoanatomy in healthy children, according to age and gender. We studied 41 consecutive healthy children (20 girls, 21 boys; age 2-15 years) divided into four age groups: 2-4 years (n=9), 5-7 years (n=11), 8-12 years (n=12), and 13-15 years (n=9). Longitudinal ultrasound axis of the MCP and MTP joints were obtained. The evolution of the cartilage thickness and vascularisation of these joints were studied according to age and gender. The MCP or MTP joints were the statistical unit. At all sites, on B-mode images, cartilage thickness was associated with age (p<0.0001). Cartilage thickness at different sites was significantly greater in boys than in girls (p≤0.05). Blood vessels were seen within the cartilage, with differences across age groups. This study provides children's age- and gender-specific sonoanatomy data of MCP and MTP and confirms the importance of using colour Doppler or Power Doppler to study cartilage vascularisation.

The aim of this study was to assess whether nursing staff within a children's hospital were able to accurately identify bilious vomiting and if a deficiency existed, whether educational posters could rectify this problem. A primary audit was conducted in the Royal Aberdeen Children's Hospital evaluating the ability of nursing staff to identify bile vomit and its significance. Educational posters were distributed and a secondary audit was conducted after six months to complete the audit cycle. The second audit also compared the knowledge of different medical professionals. In the primary audit, 41% of nurses selected the colour yellow, compared with 18% of nurses in the second audit with approximately 70% selecting dark-green. Thirty-three percent of nurses in the primary audit confirmed intestinal obstruction as the cause of bile vomiting, compared with 64% of nurses in the secondary audit. In conclusion, this study identified a deficiency in the recognition of bile vomiting among nurses, but demonstrates that the use of educational posters can significantly improve knowledge.

704,704,16780241,"The Farnsworth lantern test has long been used to assess the color vision of those seeking to enter the aviation industry and other occupations that require recognition of signal lights. A new version of the Farnsworth lantern, the Optec 900, is now produced because the original version is no longer manufactured. This paper reports the pass/ fail rates of a production model of the new version compared with an original one. There were 100 male subjects with abnormal color vision who were given 3 runs with each lantern test. Their color vision deficiency was diagnosed using a battery of tests including the D15 test and the Nagel anomaloscope. A total of 19% passed the new lantern test compared with 24% for the original Farnsworth using the usual fail criteria. The pass rates become 17% and 21%, respectively, when adjusted for the expected proportions of the types of abnormal color vision. There was agreement between the two lantern tests for 89% of subjects: 8% passed the old Farnsworth and failed the new version, and 3% failed the original Farnsworth and passed the new. There was a practice effect: when one lantern was passed and the other failed, the lantern passed was, with one exception, given second. Both lantern tests passed subjects who made no errors on the first run who subsequently made many errors when given further runs. Only 4% of subjects made no errors on all runs. The Optec 900 can be considered equivalent to the Farnsworth lantern and might be preferred because it is slightly more stringent, reducing the risk of passing those who will make errors with signal lights. The practice of passing applicants who make no errors on the first run should be abandoned since 10% of those who pass in this way make many errors when additional runs are given.

This technology is applied for the first time to the right heart and in children. 3D-RT-VCFDE was performed in 61 image sets of flow through the aortic (AV), mitral (MV), pulmonary (PV), and tricuspid (TV) valves of 34 children. These were compared with stroke volumes of the right (RV) and left (LV) ventricles and ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow determined using the Fick method in 31 children with atrial shunts. The mean age was 8.0 ± 3.3 years, and the mean weight was 27.8 ± 10.0 kg. The mean temporal resolution for flow analyses was ≥ 22 volumes per second. In conditions with no shunt, the correlations were: AV with MV flows (r = 0.98), PV with TV flows (r = 0.96), RV stroke volume with PV flow (r = 0.95), and with TV flow (r = 0.93), LV stroke volume with AV flow (r = 0.87), and with MV flow (r = 0.89). Fick ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow correlations were: PV/AV ratio (r = 0.84), TV/MV ratio (r = 0.87), and RV/LV ratio (r = 0.70). Stroke volume determined using automated 3D-RT-VCFDE is feasible in children and in the right side of the heart.

Reviewing all histopathology records at one hospital over a five year period revealed that there were 1000 patients who had had skin biopsies. General practitioners had carried out skin biopsies for 55% of these patients. Hospital specialists excised significantly more lesions that had increased in size (P < 0.001) or changed in colour (P < 0.001). General practitioners excised more lesions that had bled (P < 0.001). Hospital specialists excised more of the 15 melanomas diagnosed (80%) (P < 0.05), and general practitioners excised more squamous papillomas (P < 0.01). Forty per cent of melanomas excised were not suspected by the clinician.

Focus groups with 29 parents or guardians were conducted to identify themes that informed development of survey items. The draft items were administered to a different group of 32 parents or guardians in cognitive interviews, and revised for subsequent field-testing. Thematic and narrative analyses were performed after the focus groups and key lay-oriented dimensions were uncovered, notably the relationship between oral health, systemic health and the life course. In the cognitive interviews, parents entered multiple responses to questions related to the look of their child's teeth, and their overall perception of tooth color. Parents also assessed their child's fear or discomfort with the dental experience, and other social and psychological concerns related to oral health status. The temporal dimensions of certain items were specified; for example, oral pain and mood items were revised to include duration of the symptom or mood state. As parents tended to confuse oral health maintenance and prevention, these two related concepts were separated into two items. Based on the qualitative work, we revised items in preparation for a field test.

We analyzed acetylcholinesterase histochemistry results of rectal biopsy specimens obtained from 85 children. The indications for biopsy were suspicion of Hirschsprung's disease in neonates and infants (Group 1; n=21) and older children (Group 2; n=17); megarectum (Group 3; n=44); and colostomy (Group 4; n=3). Specimens were taken at 5 and 10 cm using endoscopic forceps or excised with scissors at 2.5 cm above the dentate line. Acetylcholinesterase activity was evaluated using Karnovsky-Roots method. The diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease was confirmed in 17 children of the first group and in 3 of the second group. In the third group, 2 children were diagnosed with ultrashort-segment Hirschsprung's disease and 3 children with intestinal neuronal dysplasia. In one case, acetylcholinesterase reaction was false positive. Hirschsprung's disease was diagnosed in 2 children with colostomies; in one case acetylcholinesterase activity caused false-positive results. Colonic dysganglionoses were diagnosed in 78% of infants and in 14% of children over 1 year of age. The diagnostic specificity of acetylcholinesterase in Hirschsprung's disease was 92%. 1) The analysis of acetylcholinesterase activity in children's rectal biopsy specimens is a reliable method for diagnosing Hirschsprung's disease, especially in infants; 2) This method of examination is irreplaceable in diagnosing ultrashort-segment Hirschsprung's disease and remains the only method to confirm the diagnosis of this disease; 3) Acetylcholinesterase histochemistry is not sufficiently informative in diagnosing intestinal neuronal dysplasia type B, because authors applying other neurohistochemical investigation methods have reported higher incidence of this disease.

All participants with TBI were at least 5 years postinjury and participants in the Ortho group were at least 3 years postinjury. The PM task involved reporting words presented in blue during a category decision task in which words were presented in several different colors and participants were to determine which of two categories the word belonged. Participants were asked to make their choices as quickly as possible. After a 10- to 15-min intervening computer task in which all words were presented in black letters, a large proportion of participants with mild or severe TBI failed to indicate any blue words when they appeared. After a reminder to perform the PM task was given to all at the same point in the task, PM performance increased in the Ortho and Mild TBI groups, but remained comparably impaired in the Severe TBI group.

710,710,15858486,"We sought to describe agreement between parent proxy and student self-reported sun behaviors and sun protective practices in adolescents aged 10 to 14 years. We conducted a cross-sectional pilot study of students (n = 52) from two classrooms, grades 6 and 7, at a school system in Framingham, Mass. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaires. Students were asked to report their sun behaviors and sun protective practices. Proxy measures were obtained by asking parents to report sun behaviors and practices of their children. Agreement was measured using weighted kappa analysis for ordinal data. Mean differences (95% confidence intervals) were calculated. The response rate for student/proxy pairs was 96% (n = 50). Agreement between student and proxy was good for skin color, sunscreen use, number of sunburns in the past summer, and application of sunscreen while in other outdoor places (range kappa = 0.52-0.73). Lowest agreement was found for questions relating to wearing a shirt, wearing a hat, sitting in the shade, and frequency of parental sunscreen application to the students' backs (range kappa = 0.08-0.28). Mean differences in responses between student and proxy respondents were relatively small ranging from -0.39 to +0.25. The lack of a gold standard in the assessment of sun exposure and related sun protective practices limits the ability to validate these exposure measures in skin cancer studies. The assessment of sun exposure behaviors is especially problematic when relying on a child's ability to accurately recall these exposures. Parent proxy measures are often used as surrogate measures and for validation purposes. We found low to moderate student/proxy agreement in this pilot study suggesting that adolescents can effectively recall their recent sun behaviors and protective practices when compared with parent proxy measures.

Only four of 42 practitioners provided correct answers on the red reflex color. Thirty of 42 practitioners reported difficulties performing the red reflex test, mostly because they did not know the normality criteria and the purpose served by this test. Thirty-three of 42 practitioners declared that they found it difficult to know whether or not eyeball sizes were normal, mostly because they were unaware of the normality criteria. None of the practitioners provided the correct (to within ± 1 mm) mean horizontal cornea diameter in full-term newborns and adults.

The mean primary tooth decayed and filled surfaces (dfs) scores were calculated for all children at baseline and 6 and 12 months. At baseline, the mean dfs score for children examined by means of teledentistry was 2.19, and for the children examined by means of the traditional method, the mean was 1.27; the means were not significantly different.

718,718,23167852,"Reuniting children with their families after a disaster poses unique challenges. The objective was to pilot test the ability of a novel image-based tool to assist a parent in identifying a picture of his or her children. A previously developed image-based indexing and retrieval tool that employs two advanced vision search algorithms was used. One algorithm, Feature-Attribute-Matching, extracts facial features (skin color, eye color, and age) of a photograph and then matches according to parental input. The other algorithm, User-Feedback, allows parents to choose children on the screen that appear similar to theirs and then reprioritizes the images in the database. This was piloted in a convenience sample of parent-child pairs in a pediatric tertiary care hospital. A photograph of each participating child was added to a preexisting image database. A double-blind randomized crossover trial was performed to measure the percentage of database reviewed and time using the Feature-Attribute-Matching-plus-User-Feedback strategy or User-Feedback strategy only. Search results were compared to a theoretical random search. Afterward, parents completed a survey evaluating satisfaction. Fifty-one parent-child pairs completed the study. The Feature-Attribute-Matching-plus-User-Feedback strategy was superior to the User-Feedback strategy in decreasing the percentage of database reviewed (mean ± SD = 24.1 ± 20.1% vs. 35.6 ± 27.2%; mean difference = -11.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -21.5% to -1.4%; p = 0.03). Both were superior to the random search (p < 0.001). Time for both searches was similar despite fewer images reviewed in the Feature-Attribute-Matching-plus-User-Feedback strategy. Sixty-eight percent of parents were satisfied with the search and 87% felt that this tool would be very or extremely helpful in a disaster. This novel image-based reunification system reduced the number of images reviewed before parents identified their children.

Cadaveric temporal bones (CTB) are the gold standard surgical training model; however, many institutions do not have ready access to them and their cost can be significant: $300 to $500. Furthermore, pediatric cadaveric temporal bones are not readily available. Our objective is to develop a pediatric temporal bone model. Temporal bone model. Tertiary Children's Hospital. Pediatric patient model. We describe the novel use of a 3D printer for the generation of a plaster training model from a pediatric high- resolution CT temporal bone scan of a normal pediatric temporal bone. Three models were produced and were evaluated. The models utilized multiple colors (white for bone, yellow for the facial nerve) and were of high quality. Two models were drilled as a proof of concept and found to be an acceptable facsimile of the patient's anatomy, rendering all necessary surgical landmarks accurately. The only negative comments pertaining to the 3D printed temporal bone as a training model were the lack of variation in hardness between cortical and cancellous bone, noting a tactile variation from cadaveric temporal bones. Our novel pediatric 3D temporal bone training model is a viable, low-cost training option for previously inaccessible pediatric temporal bone training. Our hope is that, as 3D printers become commonplace, these models could be rapidly reproduced, allowing for trainees to print models of patients before performing surgery on the living patient.

We reviewed the population-based literature to assess international variation of BA incidence and outcomes, and to assess the evidence for seasonal variation in incidence, centralization of Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy, and newborn screening. We conducted a systematic review (registration number CRD42011001441) of observational or interventional research within MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database, which reported incidence, prevalence, or outcomes of infants with BA. Population-based studies, defined by inclusion of an entire population or representative sample, were included. Outcomes included overall survival, native liver survival (NLS), and time to Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy. Single- or multicenter studies were excluded unless those centers captured all potential patients within a jurisdiction. Two independent data extractors reviewed the abstracts and articles. A total of 40 studies were included following review of 3128 references. A wide range of incidence was reported internationally. Ten-year overall survival ranged from 66.7% to 89%. NLS ranged from 20.3% to 75.8% at 1 to 3 years and 24% to 52.8% at 10 years. Earlier age at Kasai was a predictor of improved NLS.

To determine whether LE cells are present in the bone marrow aspirates of SLE patients, but overlooked in routine bone marrow morphology review, bone marrow aspirates from 30 pediatric patients (15 with SLE and 15 with other diagnoses) evaluated by rheumatologists were reviewed. LE cells were found in the bone marrow aspirates of only 1 SLE patient and none in non-SLE patients. However, hematoxylin bodies were identified in 53% (8/15) of SLE patients. Neither hematoxylin bodies nor LE cells were found in the aspirates from patients with other disorders. Three additional pediatric patients identified prospectively were found to have hematoxylin bodies in the bone marrow aspirates. Although the diagnosis was not initially suspected, 2 of the 3 patients were subsequently diagnosed with SLE. All patients with hematoxylin bodies and SLE had antinuclear antibody titers ≥1:640 with a homogeneous staining pattern. In addition, bone marrow aspirates of 9 adult patients were reviewed, and neither LE cells nor hematoxylin bodies were identified. In summary, hematoxylin bodies were present in the bone marrow aspirates of many pediatric SLE patients, while LE cells were rare.

Her diet diary revealed that symptoms occurred after ingestion of colorful sweets such as candies and jellybeans. Open challenge tests with food additives and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were performed after elimination of these items. Skin prick tests using additives and NSAIDs, which were dissolved in saline, and prick- prick tests using candies and jellybeans, were carried out. Open challenge tests with Tartrazine, aspirin and acetaminophen were positive, whereas skin prick tests using additives and NSAIDs and prick-prick tests using candies and jellybeans were all negative. Consequently, intolerance to azo dyes and NSAIDs such as aspirin was diagnosed. However, she appeared to react to multiple chemical odors such as those of cigarette smoke, disinfectant, detergent, cleaning compounds, perfume, and hairdressing, all while avoiding additives and NSAIDs. On the basis of her history and the neuro-ophthalmological abnormalities, a diagnosis of severe MCS was made and she was prescribed multiple vitamins and glutathione.

A prototypic neuropsychological test, the Trail Making Test, was adapted for use with young children, the TRAILS-P, using a developmentally salient storybook format with colorful stimuli in differing conditions with varying executive demands. The TRAILS-P was administered to 103 normally developing preschoolers between 2 and 6 years of age; 30 of these children were retested within one month to determine test reliability. Correlations among latencies to complete each condition and condition errors generally were moderate to high, suggesting coherence in test content. There also was evidence for good test-retest reliability. Latency to complete the TRAILS-P conditions differed as a function of the interaction of condition type and age group. Although the youngest children generally took more time to complete all TRAILS-P conditions, 3-year-old children were disproportionately slow to complete the condition that required shifting between stamping stimuli of two classes, with distraction by the additional presence of irrelevant stimuli. In contrast, the number of errors differed only in the 5-year-olds relative to younger children.

Bilateral strabismus was noted at birth. Despite surgery to address strabismus, Carl continues to be unable to raise his eyes above midline, and his visual status, including visual acuity, depth perception, color perception, and visual fields, is unclear. A recent auditory brainstem response evaluation was consistent with normal hearing. Multiple variants of undetermined significance were reported on chromosomal microarray. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated multiple malformations in the brainstem and posterior fossa. Electroencephalogram was without evidence of seizure activity. There is no family history of genetic disorders, brain malformation, or learning/cognitive disability.Carl was not able to sit independently until 2 years of age and did not walk until 5 years. Now, he can walk short distances by himself but is often unsteady on his feet. He uses a wheelchair but does not propel himself despite a physical therapy assessment indicating that he has adequate strength to do so. Carl spoke his first word at 5 years, and his parents report that he currently uses approximately 50 words spontaneously and appropriately. His speech is difficult to understand because of articulation errors. He can identify colors and numbers but has not mastered concepts of size and comparison. Standard scores for the conceptual, social, and practical domains and the General Adaptive Composite were in the mid-50s on the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-3, as reported by the parents.At home, Carl spends much of his time watching videos on his iPad in his bedroom. At school, he tends to separate himself from others on the playground after lunch. Parents believe this to be due to communication difficulties and mobility limitations. Parents report that when he likes another classmate or family member, he will stay in the same room as that individual but will not try to interact. Teachers report that when a well-liked classmate sits near Carl, he will smile and say the classmate's name. He will not attempt to initiate or participate in conversation. A picture exchange communication system was introduced at school because of difficulties understanding his speech. Attempts have also been made to train him to use a keyboard to communicate. Carl has demonstrated limited interest in using either system. He has several repetitive behaviors such as hand flapping, body rocking, and rubbing his nose with a specific spoon. Repetitive, nonpurposeful vocalizations are reported at home and at school. Carl requires assistance with toileting and bathing because of refusal to complete the tasks otherwise. It is common for Carl to cover his ears in response to hearing specific sounds such as fire alarms and emergency sirens.The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition, Module 1 was administered to assess for behaviors consistent with a diagnosis of ASD. Carl scored within the severe range of symptoms and was diagnosed with ASD. Recommendations were made for completion of a functional vision assessment and implementation of home- and school-based applied behavior analysis programs.

The mean volume ratios of torsed to contralateral testis showed significant differences between the 0-6 h and the 12-24 h time groups as well as the 6-12 h and the 12-24 h time groups (P = 0.003 and P = 0.035, respectively), as well as significant differences between the viable and non-viable testes (P = 0.005). Regarding testicular heterogeneity, two novel grayscale sonographic findings were noted: (1) multiple hypoechoic lines that were termed 'testicular fragmentation' and (2) hyperechoic patches that were termed 'testicular patching'. The presence of these two findings were significantly increased as TT time duration increased (P < 0.001), and these findings were significantly associated with testicular non-viability (P < 0.001). Torsion degree was also noted to be significantly higher in the non-viable testes (P < 0.001). Presence of hydrocele or scrotal edema also showed significant differences between the TT time groups (P < 0.001). The results of this study demonstrated ultrasonographic findings related to time dependent changes in TT and provided prognostic information regarding testicular viability. Specific US grayscale findings in torsed testes (testicular fragmentation and testicular patching) were identified that provide prognostic information regarding time duration of testicular torsion and testicular viability. Testicular fragmentation and testicular patching significantly increased as TT time increased, with increasing risk for testicular non-viability.

The diff3 automatically classifies 11 categories of nucleated cells; qualitatively evaluates erythrocyte size, shape, and color; estimates platelet and leukocyte count; and generates a quantitative estimate of platelet number. The analyzer contains a system for signaling abnormal or suspicious slides for technologist review. As many as 14 slides can be processed in sequence without operator attendance. Throughput averages 33 slides/hour in no review mode. The analyzer produced similar in-run and day-to-day precision when examining a wide variety of blood smears. Morphologic evaluation of nucleated and non-nucleated blood cells correlated with that of technologists. The diff3's normal range compared closely with that obtained by senior technologists examining conventional smears. Band counts, while somewhat higher, did not lead to judgement errors in left-shift direction. The diff3's sensitivity to recognizing abnormal smears was virtually identical to that of technologists with a false-positive level only slightly greater than theirs; diff3's false negatives were equal in frequency to those experienced by technologists.

To evaluate the clinical effect of adding an antimicrobial finish to knitted silk garments on eczema severity and on pruritus in patients with AD. Thirty patients aged between 3 and 31 years (mean 14.2 +/- 7.7) were enrolled. The inclusion criterion was that the patients presented with active AD with eczematous lesions located on the arms without any sign of infection. Each participant was given a set of 4 pairs of knitted silk tubular sleeves marked with seams of different colours. Only one colour was treated with AEGIS AEM 5772/5. This information was unknown to both the clinicians and the patients/parents. At baseline (T0) and after 7 (T7), 14 (T14), 21 (T21) and 28 (T28) days, the patients were evaluated using the following methods: photographic assessment, local modified SCORAD index adapted for only the arm, and parent/patient assessment of pruritus measured with a visual analogue scale. The mean local SCORAD index of both the DermaSilk- and the unmodified-silk-covered arms decreased significantly between baseline (T0) and the end of study (T28). However, while the Derma-Silk group showed a constant decrease each week, the unmodified-silk group showed a significant decrease only in the first 2 weeks of the study. Also the decrease in pruritus values between T0 and T28 was greater for the DermaSilk group. This study demonstrates the importance of including the AEM 5772/5 finish to the specially knitted silk for a long-term improvement of atopic eczema symptoms.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether beads, specifically polystyrene microspheres (PSMS) compare to the use of primary leukocytes for single color based compensation when conducting polychromatic flow cytometry. To do so, we stained individual tubes of both PSMS and leukocytes with panel specific antibodies conjugated to fluorochromes corresponding to fluorescent channels FL1-FL10. We compared the matrix generated by PSMS to that generated using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Ideal for compensation is a sample with both a discrete negative population and a bright positive population. We demonstrate that PSMS display autofluorescence properties similar to PBMC. When comparing PSMS to PBMC for compensation PSMS yielded more evenly distributed and discrete negative and positive populations to use for compensation. We analyzed three donors' PBMC stained with our 10-color T cell subpopulation panel using compensation generated by PSMS vs.PBMC and detected no significant differences in the population distribution. Panel specific antibodies bound to PSMS represent an invaluable valid tool to generate suitable compensation matrices especially when sample material is limited and/or the sample requires analysis of dynamically modulated or rare events.

The purpose of this study was to describe the ultrasound characteristics of the epididymis in pediatric patients with testicular torsion, and to describe their potential role as prognostic criteria for testicular salvage outcomes. During a retrospective review of 217 pediatric patients with acute testicular torsion during 2009-2016, morphological features of the epididymis from scrotal ultrasounds (size, parenchymal characteristics, and vascular flow of both epididymis heads), as well as patient demographics, time duration, surgical outcomes, histopathology results, and follow-up periods were analyzed. Mean epididymis size and twisting degree were significantly higher in the torsed testes than in the contralateral epididymis (P < 0.001) (Summary table). Cystic structures in the epididymis were identified: a higher number of cysts was associated with testicular non-viability (P = 0.025) and higher twisting degree (P = 0.017). Histopathologic examination showed that these spaces were infiltrated connective tissue most likely formed by venous congestion and vessel rupture. Scrotal ultrasound can provide information on testicular morphology and viability, as well as morphological changes in the epididymis over time in pediatric patients with testicular torsion. These findings may provide potential prognostic information regarding testicular viability, as a higher number of cystic spaces in the epididymis was associated with a higher rate of testicular non-viability and a higher twisting degree. In addition, the epididymis size (volume) can change during the time course of the ischemic state. This was the first study to describe and analyze epididymis ultrasound findings in pediatric patients with testicular torsion and to correlate them with testicular salvage outcomes.

747,747,8747098,"Adverse behavioral responses to ingestion of any kind of candy have been reported repeatedly in the lay press. Parents and teachers alike attribute excessive motor activity and other disruptive behaviors to candy consumption. However, anecdotal observations of this kind need to be tested scientifically before conclusions can be drawn, and criteria for interpreting diet behavior studies must be rigorous. Ingredients in nonchocolate candy (sugar, artificial food colors), components in chocolate candy (sugar, artificial food colors in coatings, caffeine), and chocolate itself have been investigated for any adverse effects on behavior. Feingold theorized that food additives (artificial colors and flavors) and natural salicylates caused hyperactivity in children and elimination of these components would result in dramatic improvement in behavior. Numerous double-blind studies of the Feingold hypothesis have led to the rejection of the idea that this elimination diet has any benefit beyond the normal placebo effect. Although sugar is widely believed by the public to cause hyperactive behavior, this has not been scientifically substantiated. Twelve double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of sugar challenges failed to provide any evidence that sugar ingestion leads to untoward behavior in children with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or in normal children. Likewise, none of the studies testing candy or chocolate found any negative effect of these foods on behavior. For children with behavioral problems, diet-oriented treatment does not appear to be appropriate. Rather, clinicians treating these children recommend a multidisciplinary approach.

753,753,22700025,"A reunification tool that captures images of children at the time of the disaster would enable parents to locate their missing children, particularly if the children are unable to communicate their identity. This study assessed the ideal features and parameters of a photographic-based reunification tool. A convenience sample of federal, state, and hospital-based emergency management professionals were surveyed to elicit their preferences regarding an image-based reunification algorithm, to assess the parents' level of difficulty in viewing images with facial trauma, and to determine the minimum percentage of successful reunifications needed to justify adoption of a reunification tool. Of 322 emergency management professionals surveyed, 129 (40%) responded. Only 18% favored a photographic-based tool that would display images in which only the categories of age, gender, and facial features (eye, hair, and skin color) would exactly match the parent's description of the child. However, 72% preferred a broader, less-rigid system in which the images displayed would match all or most features in the parents' description of the missing child, allowing parents to view more of the image database. Most (85%) preferred a tool showing unedited images of living children, allowing parents to view facial trauma. However, more respondents reported that parents would find viewing unedited images with facial trauma somewhat or very difficult emotionally compared with edited images for both living (77% vs 20%, P < .001) and deceased children (91% vs 70%, P < .001.) In a disaster involving 1000 children, a tool that reunites a minimum of 10% of families would be adopted by over 50% of the participants. Participants were willing to accept a lower percentage of reunifications in a disaster involving 1000 children compared with disasters involving 10 (P < .001) or 100 children. (P < .001). Emergency management professionals identified desirable characteristics of a photographic-based reunification tool, including an algorithm displaying unedited photographs of missing children that loosely matches the parents' description, acknowledging the parents' emotional difficulty in viewing photographs with facial trauma.

A total of 102 restorations were placed in primary molars of 29 schoolchildren; 40 were of Vitremer, 38 of Z100 + Scotchbond Multipurpose, and 24 of amalgam (Dispersalloy). The restorations were evaluated clinically at baseline and after 6, 12, 18, 24 months, or until tooth exfoliation or patient drop-out, following the modified Cvar and Ryge criteria. Radiographs were taken at yearly intervals, and the radiograph of the last examination available was assessed and scored. The majority of the restorations examined clinically up to 18 months was good (Alpha according to Cvar and Ryge), and no statistically significant differences between the groups was observed. However, at the 19-24 months evaluation, Z100 rated better than Vitremer for surface appearance and color match. The prevalence of radiolucent defects at the cervical margin for the Z100 (47%) was significantly higher than for amalgam (11%) restorations (P = 0.002) and for Vitremer (13%) restorations (P = 0.008). The three materials evaluated (Vitremer, Z100 and Dispersalloy) presented satisfactory clinical performance during the time evaluated (approximately 2 years). Approximately half of the composite resin restorations presented radiographic defects that might require replacement at a later date. In contrast, glass ionomer and amalgam restorations presented significantly less radiographic defects at the time of the final examination.

Masked examiners assessed 143 children at 9.5 and 11 years of age (74 with IUCE and 69 demographically similar children without IUCE). Level of IUCE (Unexposed; Lighter, and Heavier) was documented by positive postpartum maternal reports and infant meconium assays. In covariate-controlled regressions, level of IUCE was not significantly associated with Stroop Interference or Rey Osterrieth Organization scores. However, in covariate controlled post-hoc tests comparing the Heavier exposed group to the combined Lighter/Unexposed group, children in the Heavier group had significantly poorer Stroop Interference scores, but there was no significant group difference for Rey Osterrieth Organizational scores. Children's average Organization scores in Unexposed, Lighter, and Heavier exposed groups were well below the test norm means.

The author chose those cases which were related to the conjectured bewitching and magical curing of mothers and young babies. This paper provides new approaches for both ethnography and medical history. The defenceless position of pregnant women against diseases always gave way for allegations, that when they became actually ill, it was someone who had cast a spell on them. There are different sorts of examples from cases that describe simpler symptoms to more extreme ones, which sometimes label almost appalled and even horrified mental and body pains of the patients. There are processes in which delactation is attributed to bewitching. This reflects the deep fear of the mother, since lack of milk easily ended with the death of the baby in those days. Another widely accepted fact was that the puerpera could attract the attention of diabolical, satanic creatures and people. The excruciating pains and the haunting of these women also appear often in the documents. Their contrasting, reverse desires and determined passions laid behind the induced abortions and the curing of infertility. Sometimes, in the latter, magical love stimulants were used. Probably, it was owing to the presumed defenceless of babies against evil forces that the inquiries of seduction occupy a strikingly big part in the documents. Sometimes parents could not produce any reliable explanation of the unpredictable illness of their child.

Myocardial Cx43 expression was obviously decreased in DCM group. Positive dyeing spots were different in size, distribution, color and disparity, some of them were distributed in the form of particle. Obvious change had not been observed in the cases of control group or with only slight changes in coloring degree and expressive area. The quantitative data showed that there was significant difference between two groups (p=0.0075) about Cx43 expressive area, but there was no difference between the left and right ventricles (p>0.05) in each group itself. And there was not difference between the two groups about average optical density of expression. Myocardial Cx43 expression is obviously reduced in the patients with DCM who die suddenly. The alteration of quantity and distribution of myocardial Cx43 expression is probably related to sudden death of the patients with DCM.

769,769,23573888,"Cases of rare-earth magnet ingestions have been increasingly reported in the literature. However, these descriptions have focused on the severity of the injuries, rather than the clinical presentation and/or therapeutic approach. We report a series of eight children, ranging in age from 2 to 10 years, who ingested powerful rare-earth magnets. The rare-earth magnets were marketed in 2009 under the trade name Buckyballs(®) (Maxfield & Oberton, New York, NY). They are about 5 mm in size, spherical, and brightly colored, making them appealing for young children to play with and place in their mouths. Three children presented within hours of ingestion, and the magnets were successfully removed via endoscopy in two, whereas the third child required laparoscopy. No fistulas were found in these children. A fourth child presented 2 days after ingestion with evidence of bowel wall erosion, but without fistula formation; the magnets were removed via laparoscopy. A fifth child ingested nine magnets in a ring formation, which were removed via colonoscopy without evidence of injury or fistula formation. The three remaining children presented late (5-8 days after ingestion) and were found to have associated fistulas. They were treated successfully with a combination of endoscopy and laparoscopy with fluoroscopy. None of the children in our series required an open surgical procedure. All children were discharged home without complications. This case series highlights the potential dangers of rare-earth magnet ingestion in children.

The reliability of neurobehavioral tests may be affected by racial or cultural backgrounds, but the widely used computerized neurobehavioral tests have been developed and standardized for Western children. It is thus necessary to assess the reliability of the existing computerized neurobehavioral tests for Korean children. For this reason, 254 healthy 7- to 8-year-old Korean children completed a neurobehavioral test-retest, with the test and retest held two months apart. Six neurobehavioral test items adapted from Korean Computerized Neurobehavioral Tests (KCNT) and modified to match the children's ability levels: Simple Reaction Time, Choice Reaction Time, Color Word Vigilance, Addition, Symbol Digit, and Finger Tapping Speed. The test reliability was assessed using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (r) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The ICCs ranged from 0.46 to 0.84 and were very similar to the Pearson coefficients. High reliability was detected in Symbol Digit (r=0.84, ICC=0.83), followed by the Finger Tapping Speed of the dominant hand (r=0.67, ICC=0.67) and of the non-dominant hand (r=0.65, ICC=0.65). The study findings suggest that the reliability of most computerized neurobehavioral tests is appropriate for epidemiological researches on Korean children, and that Symbol Digit and Finger Tapping Speed are more satisfactory bases for the periodic examination of neurobehavioral performance. These findings can also be useful in the future assembly of a neurobehavioral test battery, by providing more stable neurobehavioral test items for Korean children.

777,777,28450694,"BACKGROUND The diagnosis of post-liver transplant biliary strictures (BS) requires a high degree of clinical suspicion because of the diversity of symptoms and usually mild clinical presentation. If quickly treated, successful outcome is achieved most cases. The aim of our study was to analyze the value of diagnostic methods in BS after pediatric LTx. MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed clinical data of children with BS after liver transplantation, with the main focus on diagnostic methods, including imaging studies and histology. All patients underwent endoscopic, transhepatic, or surgical treatment of the stricture. RESULTS Sixty-seven patients after LTx performed at the median age of 9.1 years (0.4-18) developed BS, mostly within the first 12 months (40%). Laboratory findings at diagnosis were: bilirubin 4.65 (5.8±SD), GGTP 434 (382.9±SD), and ALT 126.5 (116.8±SD); 16 patients presented with bilirubin level <1 mg% and 4 with GGTP below 100 IU. Ultrasound scan (USS) visualized dilatation of the bile ducts in 53 (79%) patients. Overall sensitivity of hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HBS) was 93%, with dilatation of bile ducts in 69% and impaired excretion in 68% of patients. MRCP showed 100% accuracy in detecting biliary dilatation and a stricture was visualized in 39%. Liver histology was consistent with biliary obstruction in 66%. Treatment of BS was successful in the majority of cases, with 89% graft survival.

Here, we present data from a context-dependent relational memory task in which participants learned that individuals belonged in a single room in each of two buildings. Room assignment was consistent with an underlying contextual rule structure in which male and female participants were assigned to opposite sides of a building and the side assignment switched between buildings. In two experiments, neural correlates of performance on this task were evaluated using multiple neuroimaging tools: diffusion tensor imaging (Experiment 1), magnetic resonance elastography (Experiment 1), and functional MRI (Experiment 2). Structural and functional data from each individual modality provided complementary and consistent evidence that the hippocampus and the adjacent white matter tract (i.e., fornix) supported relational memory, whereas the ventromedial pFC/OFC (vmPFC/OFC) and the white matter tract connecting vmPFC/OFC to MTL (i.e., uncinate fasciculus) supported memory-guided rule use.

Children hospitalized with acute febrile illness, accompanied by caregivers available at the bedside for 24 hours soon after hospital admission. Caregivers were trained to recognize signs of critical illness using the Family-Assisted Severe Febrile Illness Therapy tool, which quantifies patients' work of breathing, mental status, and perfusion, producing color-coded flags to signal illness severity. Caregivers' Family-Assisted Severe Febrile Illness Therapy assessments were compared with healthcare professional assessments and to established Pediatric Early Warning Scores (PEWS). An initial study stage was followed by refinement of training and a larger second stage with intervention/control arms. A total of 107 patient/caregiver pairs were enrolled in the interventional arm; 106 caregivers underwent Family-Assisted Severe Febrile Illness Therapy training and were included in the analysis. Patient characteristics included median age 1.1 years (0.2-10 yr), 55 (52%) female, and diagnoses: pneumonia (64 [60%]), meningitis (38 [36%]), gastroenteritis (24 [23%]), and malaria (21 [20%]).

Because a limited sampling method for screening brains for axonal damage would be of value for medico-legal work, the authors have tested the findings of an earlier study which suggested that a standard set of three blocks from above and below the tentorium could reliably be used in routine practice as a basis for the diagnosis of DAI. A series of 22 previously diagnosed cases of DAI, with a range of survival times, was studied using immunohistochemistry with antibodies to beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta APP), the microglial-associated antigen CD68 (PG-M1) and for GFAP. Strict histological criteria were used to assess traumatic damage, and the evolution of the histological changes with increasing survival is described. In four cases, the sampling scheme employed yielded evidence of axonal damage in only one block, and a diagnosis of DAI could have been made in only 13/22 cases. In six of the shortest surviving cases, beta APP positivity in the corpus callosum and brainstem outlined areas of early ischaemia, as well as of traumatic damage, so that interpretation of immunolabelling was not always clearcut The findings suggest that DAI cannot be reliably diagnosed on a restricted number of blocks from vulnerable areas, and that the use of beta APP and PG-M1 immunocytochemistry may bring interpretative problems that can only be resolved by taking a larger series of tissue samples for histology.

Color tissue Doppler images were acquired before surgery, 8 and 24 hours postoperatively in 18 children undergoing open heart surgery. Clinically, all patients were hemodynamically stable and on low doses of inotropics without death or resuscitation events. Wall motion analysis revealed a significant drop of peak systolic velocities and SR postoperatively in both ventricles. On the next day, all parameters improved with regional differences. SR appeared to be more sensitive to changes than velocities. In conclusion, tissue Doppler imaging appears to be a sensitive marker of ventricular mechanics in children and may improve perioperative monitoring. It offers a method to quantitatively assess left and right ventricular performance and may help to compare different cardio-protective strategies.

788,788,19395142,"Intraosseous needle insertion for vascular access is a standard procedure used in paediatric resuscitation. The introduction of newer automated intraosseous devices has recently expanded its role to include resuscitation in patients of all ages. Managing resuscitation can be challenging and a misplaced intraosseous needle may confound effective resuscitation. Colour Doppler ultrasound has been recently proposed as a method to confirm intraosseous needle placement. The ability to rapidly determine the correct position of an intraosseous needle during resuscitation would allow the delivery of medication or fluid infusion into the vascular space to be verified, thus optimizing resuscitation. Furthermore, complications from intraosseous infusion extravasating into soft tissues, such as compartment syndrome, or tissue necrosis can be avoided. We describe the point-of-care sonographic technique and colour Doppler ultrasound findings of intraosseous needle confirmation in a case series of critically ill patients requiring resuscitation, highlighting the utility of this sonographic application. Colour Doppler ultrasound detected extraosseous flow in incorrectly positioned intraosseous needles, and intraosseous flow in correctly positioned intraosseous needles in six critically ill patients requiring resuscitation. The use of point-of-care colour Doppler ultrasound to determine the location of both manually inserted or automated placement of intraosseous access during resuscitation is feasible, can be rapidly performed, may verify delivery of resuscitative medications or infusions, and avoid complications from extravasation.

Staged single ventricle palliation with a superior cavopulmonary connection (SCPC) in infancy followed by a Fontan in early childhood relies on passive, unobstructed pulmonary blood flow and normal pulmonary vasculature. We hypothesized that patients with echocardiographic identification of retrograde flow in a branch pulmonary artery (PA) after SCPC or Fontan are at increased risk for adverse outcomes. We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients seen at Children's Wisconsin from 1999 to 2019. Inclusion criteria included a history of single ventricle congenital heart disease and surgical palliation with a superior cavopulmonary connection (SCPC). We created two cohorts based on transthoracic echocardiographic identification of branch PA flow patterns: those with color Doppler-defined pulmonary artery flow reversal (PA reversal cohort) and those with normal anterograde flow (Non-reversal cohort). We identified 21 patients in the PA reversal cohort and 539 patients in the Non-reversal cohort. The PA reversal cohort had increased hospital length of stay after SCPC palliation (p < 0.001) and decreased transplant-free survival (p = 0.032), but there was no difference in overall survival (p = 0.099). There was no difference in hospital length of stay after Fontan (p = 0.17); however, the PA reversal cohort was significantly less likely to progress to Fontan palliation during early childhood (p = 0.005).

This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving 5- to 16-year-old children who presented to the emergency department of a children's hospital with a chief complaint of acute abdominal pain that was thought by the pediatric emergency attending physician to require a surgical consultation. Subjects were randomized to receive intravenously administered morphine or normal saline solution. Clinical data and the emergency physician's confidence in his or her clinical diagnosis (0-100%) were recorded systematically with a standardized form. This was repeated 15 minutes after administration of the study medication. The surgeon assessed the child within 1 hour and completed a similar data collection sheet. Pain was assessed, with a color analog scale, before and after study medication administration. Each subject was monitored for 2 weeks after enrollment. One hundred eight children were enrolled; 52 received morphine and 56 received a placebo saline solution. There were no differences between groups in demographic variables or the degree of pain. There were no differences between groups in the diagnoses of appendicitis or perforated appendicitis or the number of children who were observed and then underwent laparotomy. The reduction in the mean pain score was significantly greater in the morphine group (2.2 vs 1.2 cm). The emergency physicians' and surgeons' confidence in their diagnoses was not affected by the administration of morphine.

792,792,18196380,"E. Bishop (“Bish”) Mumford was born in 1879 in Indiana [2] (most likely in or near New Harmony, the birthplace of both of his parents, who were committed to Robert Owen’s concept of that socialistic community established by Owen in 1826 [4]). He graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1901 and Johns Hopkins in 1905. He obtained postgraduate training at Boston Children’s Hospital and Gouverneur’s Hospital (a hospital originally established to provide care for low income patients of color) in New York. He returned to Indiana to establish a practice in children’s orthopaedics. His practice was interrupted by WW I, where he served as a captain in a base hospital in France. He returned after the war and in 1920 opened the Indianapolis Industrial Clinic with Dr. Jay Reed. He later was appointed to the faculty at the Medical College of Indiana and was one of the first surgeons appointed to the James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Crippled Children and the first surgeon appointed to the Veteran’s Administration Hospital of Indiana. He continued his appointments at these and other hospitals until his death. Dr. Mumford was one of the founding members of the AAOS, and was one of eight members listed as attending the business meeting of the Clinical Orthopaedic Society, October 30, 1931, where the concept of a new national organization was discussed [1]. While the record is not entirely clear, Mumford apparently served on the Executive Committee of the AAOS from 1931 (when according to Heck the AAOS was chartered [3]) until 1944, then as President-Elect, President from 1945–1946, and continued on the Executive Committee until 1950 [2]; that being the case, he would have served on the Executive longer than any of the original founders (and perhaps longer than anyone since). He is the only AAOS President to have served two terms: at the written request of the Office of Defense Transportation in 1944, the January, 1945 meeting was canceled, and he remained President during the subsequent year, presiding over the 1946 meeting. He was active in the AOA and the Clinical Orthopaedic Society (he served as Secretary-Treasurer, Vice-President, and President in 1933, the year of the first meeting of the AAOS), as well as the Indianapolis Board of Health, the American College of Surgeons and other organizations. Among all of his many clinical responsibilities and activities in the 1930s, he found time to assume from his father the management of his family’s 5800 acre farm in Indiana. The article we reproduce here expresses Mumford’s belief in early mobilization of injured joints. “The motion you gain through early mobilization of the joint,” he maintained, “you do not lose. The motion you lose through long fixation of the joint may be permanent.” This article, published in 1960, undoubtedly reflected concepts he developed through his long experience with industrial injuries.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the historical features, physical examination findings, laboratory tests, and ultrasound examinations in children with TT, as well as to identify the predictors of testicular salvage in children. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 136 males who presented with TT to our institution. Clinical findings, physical examinations, laboratory data, color Doppler ultrasound findings, operating results, and the results of follow-up were collected and analyzed. Patients with neonatal torsion, negative scrotal exploration, or testicular appendix torsion were excluded. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify predictors of testicular salvage. Receiver operator characteristics analyses were performed to determine the probability of a non-salvageable torsed testis based on time and degree of twisting. A total of 136 children with TT were identified. Patients were aged from 1 to 16 years, with a mean age of 9.7 years (median, 12; range, 1-16 years). The peak incidences of TT were found between ages of 12 and 14 years. Acute TT is significantly more common in the winter. Testicular salvage occurred in 49 (36%) cases. Of the 49 cases of testicular salvage, 5 patients developed subsequent testicular atrophy. Cutoff values of 13.5 h and 530 degrees of torsion would provide sensitivities of 96 and 61%, with specificity of 80 and 70%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that time to surgery and degree of testicular twist were correlated with the risk of a non-salvageable testis. Testicular salvage can be predicted by the duration of symptoms along with degree of twisting. Early scrotal exploration based on careful physical examination decreases the risk of misdiagnosis of spermatic cord torsion. A certain percentage of children with TT presenting with lower abdominal pain should have their testicles checked to make sure that they do not have torsion, especially those visitors in cold season.

The age of bruising has an important medico-legal significance and may be relevant in the investigations related to such crimes as child abuse, domestic violence and homicide. A colorimetric scale for forensic photography based on the colors of the bruise itself, has never been proposed due to the fact that photographic reproduction of color is unreliable and depends on several factors; the camera used, lighting, printer and photo-editing color calibration. The authors propose two colorimetric scales, both with and without linear measurements, and with 90° angulations, six bruise colors, and three circles with black and white calibrators, which are to be used for the forensic photography of injuries involving the epidermis of Caucasian subjects. The two scales could also be employed on living subjects during different stages of the healing process, or on cadavers in order to provide evidential documentation, image verification and analysis. Such an aid would provide a reliable standard condition and allow for color calibration. The colors represented on the scales would be an aid for the interpretation and objectivity required in estimating the age of the bruise, particularly when the analysis is made directly onto computer images prior to printing. The proposed colorimetric scales do not attempt to give a definitive account of the diverse scientific methods available for the assessment of the age of bruising. The observation of a large sample of blunt trauma and bite mark injuries employing the proposed colorimetric scales would be needed in order to verify and validate the use of these scales.

Moreover, visual acuity, visual field, stereopsis and colour were compromised when a cortical damage was present, while ocular motricity (and in particular fixation and saccades) were compromised in presence of subcortical brain damage. Structural MRI is valuable for understanding the relationship between brain lesion severity and visual function in children with CP.

This study aimed to describe the pattern of mortality from central nervous system (CNS) tumors in children in Brazil from 1979 to 2019. A descriptive study was carried out using data from the Mortality Information System (SIM) of the Ministry of Health, according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9 and ICD-10), between 1979 and 2019. The frequencies of the distribution of available variables were calculated: age (0 - 19 years), s skin color, tumor behavior, year and place of death (by region), ICD-10, and all of these, excluding skin color (by ICD-9). Mortality rates in general, mortality from neoplasms, and specific rates of CNS tumors were calculated considering the variables described above. In 40 years (1979 - 2019), there were 21,940 deaths due to brain tumors in children. A different pattern of the mortality rate of brain tumors was shown in children per age (increasing until age 5 - 9 years (28.9%) and then decreasing until age 15 - 19 years (20.2%)). The Southeast (44.3%), Northeast (23.4%), and South (17.5%) regions of Brazil had the highest rates; 94.7% of tumors were malignant, and 91.1% of deaths were observed in hospitals. To our knowledge, this is the first description of the mortality rate epidemiology of brain/CNS tumors in children in Brazil over 40 years.

In this sense, children are one of the groups within the population with a greater need for drug doses adapted to their requirements (age, weight, pathological state…), but most 3D printed oral dosages are solid forms and, therefore, not suitable for them. This work developed patient-tailored medicinal gummies, an alternative oral dosage form with eye-catching appearance and appropriate organoleptic characteristics. Four inks were formulated, characterised and 3D printed by means of syringe-based extrusion mechanism. Different tests were performed to ensure reproducibility of the process and validate work methodology for dosage unit fabrication applying basic manufacturing standards. Rheological test helped in evaluating inks printability. Visual characterization concluded that drugmies, apart from a high fidelity in the 3D model shape reproduction, had a bright and uniformly coloured appearance and a pleasant aroma, which made them highly appetising and attractive. The printed gummy oral dosages complied comfortably with the mass uniformity assay regardless of the formulated ink used or the 3D model selected for printing.

810,810,33044816,"Imaging of biological membranes by environmentally sensitive solvatochromic probes, such as Laurdan, provides information about the organization of lipids, their ordering, and their uneven distribution. To address a key drawback of Laurdan linked to its rapid internalization and subsequent labeling of internal membranes, we redesigned it by introducing a membrane anchor group based on negatively charged sulfonate and dodecyl chain. The obtained probe, Pro12A, stains exclusively the outer leaflet of lipid bilayers of liposomes, as evidenced by leaflet-specific fluorescence quenching with a viologen derivative, and shows higher fluorescence brightness than Laurdan. Pro12A also exhibits stronger spectral change between liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases in model membranes and distinguishes better lipid domains in giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs) than Laurdan. In live cells, it stains exclusively the cell plasma membranes, in contrast to Laurdan and its carboxylate analogue C-Laurdan. Owing to its outer leaflet binding, Pro12A is much more sensitive to cholesterol extraction than Laurdan, which is redistributed within both plasma membrane leaflets and intracellular membranes. Finally, its operating range in the blue spectral region ensures the absence of crosstalk with a number of orange/red fluorescent proteins and dyes. Thus, Pro12A will enable accurate multicolor imaging of lipid organization of cell plasma membranes in the presence of fluorescently tagged proteins of interest, which will open new opportunities in biomembrane research.

811,811,31441436,"In view of easy availability and increasing trend of consumption of fast foods and sugar sweetened beverages (fruit juices and drinks, carbonated drinks, energy drinks) in Indian children, and their association with increasing obesity and related non-communicable diseases, there is a need to develop guidelines related to consumption of foods and drinks that have the potential to increase this problem in children and adolescents. To review the evidence and formulate consensus statements related to terminology, magnitude of problem and possible ill effects of junk foods, fast foods, sugar-sweetened beverages and carbonated drinks; and to formulate recommendations for limiting consumption of these foods and beverages in Indian children and adolescents. A National Consultative group constituted by the Nutrition Chapter of the Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP), consisting of various stakeholders in private and public sector, reviewed the literature and existing guidelines and policy regulations. Detailed review of literature was circulated to the members, and the Group met on 11th March 2019 at New Delhi for a day-long deliberation on framing the guidelines. The consensus statements and recommendations formulated by the Group were circulated to the participants and a consensus document was finalized. The Group suggests a new acronym 'JUNCS' foods, to cover a wide variety of concepts related to unhealthy foods (Junk foods, Ultra-processed foods, Nutritionally inappropriate foods, Caffeinated/colored/carbonated foods/beverages, and Sugar-sweetened beverages). The Group concludes that consumption of these foods and beverages is associated with higher free sugar and energy intake; and is associated with higher body mass index (and possibly with adverse cardiometabolic consequences) in children and adolescents. Intake of caffeinated drinks may be associated with cardiac and sleep disturbances. The Group recommends avoiding consumption of the JUNCS by all children and adolescents as far as possible and limit their consumption to not more than one serving per week. The Group recommends intake of regional and seasonal whole fruits over fruit juices in children and adolescents, and advises no fruit juices/drinks to infants and young children (age <2y), whereas for children aged 2-5 y and >5-18 y, their intake should be limited to 125 mL/day and 250mL/day, respectively. The Group recommends that caffeinated energy drinks should not be consumed by children and adolescents. The Group supports recommendations of ban on sale of JUNCS foods in school canteens and in near vicinity, and suggests efforts to ensure availability and affordability of healthy snacks and foods. The Group supports traffic light coding of food available in school canteens and recommends legal ban of screen/print/digital advertisements of all the JUNCS foods for channels/magazines/websites/social media catering to children and adolescents.

A prospective descriptive study, using convenience sampling of children aged 5 and 12 years presenting to a pediatric emergency department (ED) with acute pain, was done. Children were asked to mark their pain severity on a previously validated CAS. After a pain intervention, the child was again asked to mark their pain intensity on the CAS and asked to describe the relative change in their pain. The main outcome measure was to quantify the smallest change required for the child to state that their pain was improved. One hundred twenty-six children with a mean age of 8.6 years (SD, 2.8 years) were enrolled. Males accounted for 56%. Pain was traumatic in 47.6% and nontraumatic in 52.4%. Of the 126 pain comparisons made, 28 children described their pain as ""the same"" and had a mean change in score of -0.10 cm (95% confidence interval [CI], -2.27 to 2.07 cm). Pain was judged to be a ""little less"" in 58 children, and the CAS score changed by a mean of -2.4 cm (95% CI, -3.15 to -1.72 cm). In the 29 children who judged their pain to be ""much less,"" the CAS score decreased by a mean of -5.4 cm (95% CI, -6.50 to -4.40).

Diagnostic accuracy comparison between commercially available seizure detection algorithms referenced to electroencephalography experts using quantitative electroencephalography trends. Multispecialty quaternary children's hospital in Canada. Critically ill children undergoing electroencephalography monitoring. Continuous raw electroencephalography recordings (n = 19) were analyzed by a neurophysiologist to identify seizures. Those recordings were then converted to quantitative electroencephalography displays (amplitude-integrated electroencephalography and color density spectral array) and evaluated by six independent electroencephalography experts to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the amplitude-integrated electroencephalography and color density spectral array displays for seizure identification in comparison to expert interpretation of raw electroencephalography data. Those evaluations were then compared with four commercial seizure detection algorithms: ICTA-S (Stellate Harmonie Version 7; Natus Medical, San Carlos, CA), NB (Stellate Harmonie Version 7; Natus Medical), Persyst 11 (Persyst Development, Prescott, AZ), and Persyst 13 (Persyst Development) to determine sensitivity and specificity in comparison to amplitude-integrated electroencephalography and color density spectral array. Of the 379 seizures identified on raw electroencephalography, ICTA-S detected 36.9%, NB detected 92.3%, Persyst 11 detected 75.9%, and Persyst 13 detected 74.4%, whereas electroencephalography experts identified 76.5% of seizures using color density spectral array and 73.7% using amplitude-integrated electroencephalography. Daily false-positive rates averaged across all recordings were 4.7 with ICTA-S, 126.3 with NB, 5.1 with Persyst 11, 15.5 with Persyst 13, 1.7 with color density spectral array, and 1.5 with amplitude-integrated electroencephalography. Both Persyst 11 and Persyst 13 had sensitivity comparable to that of electroencephalography experts using amplitude-integrated electroencephalography and color density spectral array. Although Persyst 13 displayed the highest sensitivity for seizure count and seizure burden detected, Persyst 11 exhibited the best trade-off between sensitivity and false-positive rate among all seizure detection algorithms. Some commercially available seizure detection algorithms demonstrate performance for seizure detection that is comparable to that of electroencephalography experts using quantitative electroencephalography displays. These algorithms may have utility as early warning systems that prompt review of quantitative electroencephalography or raw electroencephalography tracings, potentially leading to more timely seizure identification in critically ill patients.

818,818,3336795,"Nipple discharge is an important clinical entity ranking second only to a lump as the most common complaint among 7,588 patients having breast surgery (560/7,588, or 7.4%). In the office and clinic it is even more common, since many patients can be treated medically and do not require an operation. To be significant, a discharge should be true, spontaneous, persistent, and nonlactational. Nipple discharge can be milky, multicolored and sticky, purulent, clear (watery), yellow (serous), pink (serosanguineous), or bloody (sanguineous). Watery, serous, serosanguineous, and sanguineous discharges are surgically significant; while they are most often caused by intraductal papillomas or fibrocystic disease, they can be due to cancer or a precancerous mastopathy. Among 503 patients operated on for one of these types of discharge, 67 (13.3%) had cancer, and 36 (7.2%) had a precancerous mastopathy. Among the 67 patients with cancer, eight (11.9%) had no palpable mass, 11 (16.4%) had negative cytologic findings, and seven (10.4%) had a negative mammogram. The incidence of associated cancers increases when the discharge is, in order of increasing frequency, serous, serosanguineous, sanguineous, or watery, when it is accompanied by a lump, when it is unilateral and from a single duct, when there are positive cytologic or mammographic findings, and when the patient is more than 50 years of age. Milky discharge caused by galactorrhea is treated medically except when caused by a pituitary adenoma. Multicolored sticky discharge due to duct ectasia is also treated medically except in advanced cases. Purulent discharge caused by an abscess requires drainage and a biopsy of the abscess wall.

The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing gaps and inequities in the early childcare and education system, resulting in closures and decreased access to healthy foods that disproportionately impacted black, indigenous, and people of color, as well as rural and low-income communities. Closures and changes in operational capacity not only stressed the early childcare and education system and its workforce but also contributed to financial strain and food insecurity among families with young children.

Between January 2000 and December 2010, 69 COHb analyses were requested in our institution. In approximately 70% of the situations, circumstantial information included a Carbon Monoxide (CO) source at the death scene. More than half of the cases presented thermal lesions, cherry-red lividity, and cherry-red blood and viscera coloration were found in, approximately, 30% of the cases. Fourteen cases were recorded as CO poisonings. The highest number of poisonings occurred in 2000, with most of the cases in winter (53.8%), in 51-60 years-old male individuals. 69.2% of the poisonings were accidental and the remainder were suicides, being fires the most frequent sources of CO (38.5%). Cherry-red lividity was present in 61.5% of the cases, and all of them presented cherry-red blood and viscera coloration. Older individuals and those with thermal lesions presented lower COHb levels, and politrauma was the most frequent cause of death among the negative cases. It is possible to conclude that the forensic aspects of CO poisonings interact in a complex way, and differential diagnosis is not straightforward. This study also emphasizes the role played by public prevention campaigns and improvement of heating appliances in reducing the number of accidental CO poisonings, and the importance of preventing urban and forest fires, the major source of CO among us.

827,827,31206042,"Early warning scores are points-based or colour-coded systems used to detect changes in physiological parameters and prompt earlier recognition and management of deteriorating patients. Vital signs recorded within a coloured zone corresponding to degree of derangement ('trigger') should prompt an action. The report of the UK Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health recommends the use of modified versions in the obstetric population. Currently, there is limited research into the effects of early warning scores in low-resource settings where maternal mortality remains high, and there is a need for low-cost, simple methods to reduce this. A modified obstetric early warning system (MOEWS) was introduced for parturients who had undergone surgical intervention at Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital, a tertiary centre in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia. A guideline was developed to accompany the MOEWS, together with training of healthcare workers. Prior to introduction, the quality of postoperative monitoring was assessed through retrospective case note review. This was reassessed at 8 months and 11 months postimplementation, with assessment of response to 'triggers'. A questionnaire and qualitative interviews were undertaken to establish views of healthcare workers on its acceptability and usability. Recording of postoperative vital signs improved with the implementation of the MOEWS and was sustained at both monitoring periods. The number of patients with vital signs within the coloured zones ('trigger') was reduced, although documented action to these remained low. Staff were positive towards the MOEWS, its impact on patient care and felt confident using the system. The introduction of a MOEWS in an Ethiopian referral hospital in this study appeared to improve the monitoring of postoperative patients. With modifications to suit the setting and senior clinician involvement, coupled with regular training, the early warning score is a feasible and acceptable tool to cope with the unique demands faced in this low-resource setting.

829,829,38483609,"Socioeconomic position (SEP) may have different effects on cognitive development and family context could play a role in this association. This work aimed to analyse the role of socioeconomic positions, measured via various indicators collected longitudinally, in cognitive development at 7-11 years of age, evaluating the role of family context as a potential mediator. The study sample included 394 and 382 children from the INMA Gipuzkoa and Valencia cohorts, respectively. SEP indicators were assessed during pregnancy (family social class, parental education, employment, and disposable income) and at 7 (Gipuzkoa) and 11 (Valencia) years of age (At Risk of Poverty or Social Exclusion (AROPE)). Family context and cognitive development were measured with the Haezi-Etxadi Family Assessment Scale 7-11 (HEFAS 7-11) and Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (Raven's CPM), respectively. Linear regression models were developed to assess the relationships between (a) SEP-family context, (b) SEP-cognitive development, and (c) family context-cognitive development, adjusting for a priori-selected confounders. Simple and multiple mediation analyses were performed to explore the role of family context in the SEP-cognitive development relationship. Lower SEP was related with a lower cognitive score, this association being particularly robust for family social class. SEP indicators were related to subscales of family context, in particular those regarding cognitive stimulation, parental stress, and parenting. A relationship was also found between these three subscales and child cognitive development, mediating the effect of family social class on child cognition by 5.2, 5.5, and 10.8%, respectively, and 12.0% jointly.    Conclusion: Both family SEP and context contribute to a child's cognitive development. Equalising policies and positive parenting programmes could contribute to improving cognitive development in children.

What is New: • This work focuses on standard measurements of socioeconomic position but also other economic indicators such as the EHII and AROPE, and their effect on child cognitive development and family context. • Promotion of cognitive and linguistic development, parental stress and conflict, and parental profile fostering child development mediated the effect of family social class on cognitive development.

830,830,34477070,"Dear Editor, We present a case of proximal pyogenic granuloma in 4-year-old child. The patient presented to our Department due to a fast-growing lesion on the proximal part of the nail unit. The lesion had appeared over several weeks, and it was extremely painful for the child. On the day of the 1st visit, the lesion was not bleeding but was very painful during examination and photo-documentation. Clinically, it presented as an exogenous tumoral lesion of the proximal 1/3 of the nail, partially exulcerated with one part exhibiting coagulated hemorrhage and with uneven coloration (Figure 1). The lesion was not sharply demarcated. Dermoscopically, the majority of the lesion presented an unspecific dermoscopic structure, orange background color, and matched the criteria for a vascular lesion: few unspecific vessels and hemorrhage. The ""sticky fiber"" sign was also present (Figure 2). Since the lesion was fast-growing and due to the unspecific dermoscopic appearance, the child was referred to a pediatric surgeon and a complete excisional biopsy of the lesion was performed. The dermoscopy of pyogenic granuloma has been already described (1). The histology report confirmed pyogenic granuloma. Pyogenic granulomas of the nail unit are not a common finding, but our case confirms that even this location can be site of this type of benign lesion. It more commonly found in the periungual region and can be expected due to adverse effects of different kinds of systemic therapies. However, due to differential diagnosis that includes different types of tumors occurring at the nail unit, most importantly amelanotic melanoma and SCC, it is suggested to excise or take a biopsy of this type of lesion to be able to exclude aggressive tumor types, which are very rare but not impossible the in pediatric population (2). In cases of unquestionable diagnosis, several local treatments are available. Since the lesion presented a destructive nature in our case, we decided to perform excisional biopsy followed by histology, which in our case was both a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure.

For both Fresnel membrane prism and the conventional prism, the visual acuity when looking straight ahead. 4. Using Fresnel membrane prisms of the same power from different lots, the visual acuity varied significantly. The 30 delta prism caused the widest range in visual acuity. 5. When normal subjects are fitted with the higher powers of the Fresnel membrane prism, fusion and stereopsis are disrupted to such an extent that the use of this device to restore or to improve binocular vision in cases with large-angle deviations is seriously questioned. 6. Moreover, the disruption of fusion and stereopsis is abrupt and severe and does not parallel the decrease in visual acuity. The severely reduced ability to maintain fusion may be related to the optical aberrations, which, in turn, may be due to the molding process and the polyvinyl chloride molding material. 7. Through the flexibility of the membrane prism is a definite advantage, because of its proclivity to reduce visual acuity and increase aberrations its prescription for adults often must be limited to only one eye. 8. For the same reasons in the young child with binocular vision problems, the membrane prism presently available should be prescribed over both eyes only in powers less than 20 delta. When the membrane prism is to be used as a partial occluder (over one eye only), any power can be used. 9. The new Fresnel ""hard"" prism reduces visual acuity minimally and rarely disrupts binocularity, thus increasing the potential for prismotherapy to establish binocularity. This prism is currently available only for use as a trial set. Since the cosmetic appearance of the Fresnel ""hard"" prism is similar to that of the Fresnel membrane prism and it is easier to maintain, it would be the prism of choice (over all other types) for bilateral prescriptions in the young patient with emmetropia.

South Africa, like many other countries, initiated a multifaceted national response to the pandemic. Self-isolation and quarantine are essential components of the public health response in the country. This paper examined perceptions and preparedness for self-isolation or quarantine during the initial phase of the pandemic in South Africa. The analysis used data obtained from an online quantitative survey conducted in all nine provinces using a data-free platform. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyse the data. Of 55,823 respondents, 40.1% reported that they may end up in self-isolation or quarantine, 32.6% did not think that they would and 27.4% were unsure. Preparedness for self-isolation or quarantine was 59.0% for self, 53.8% for child and 59.9% for elderly. The odds of perceived possibility for self-isolation or quarantine were significantly higher among Coloureds, Whites, and Indians/Asians than Black Africans, and among those with moderate or high self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 than those with low risk perception. The odds were significantly lower among older age groups than those aged 18-29 years, and those unemployed than fully employed. The odds of preparedness for self-isolation or quarantine were significantly less likely among females than males. Preparedness for self, child and elderly isolation or quarantine was significantly more likely among other population groups than Black Africans and among older age groups than those aged 18-29 years. Preparedness for self, child and elderly isolation or quarantine was significantly less likely among those self-employed than fully employed and those residing in informal dwellings than formal dwellings. In addition, preparedness for self-isolation or quarantine was significantly less likely among those with moderate and high self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 than low risk perception. The findings highlight the challenge of implementing self-isolation or quarantine in a country with different and unique social contexts.

837,837,37730290,"Congenital heart defects are the most common and resource-intensive birth defects. As children with congenital heart defects increasingly survive beyond early childhood, it is imperative to understand longitudinal disease burden. The purpose of this study was to examine chronic outpatient prescription medication use and expenditures for New York State pediatric Medicaid enrollees, comparing children who undergo cardiac surgery (cardiac enrollees) and the general pediatric population. This was a retrospective cohort study of all Medicaid enrollees age <18 years using the New York State Congenital Heart Surgery Collaborative for Longitudinal Outcomes and Utilization of Resources database (2006-2019). Primary outcomes were total chronic medications per person-year, enrollees per 100 person-years using ≥1 and ≥3 medications, and medication expenditures per person-year. We described and compared outcomes between cardiac enrollees and the general pediatric population. Among cardiac enrollees, multivariable regression examined associations between outcomes and clinical characteristics. We included 5,459 unique children (32,131 person-years) who underwent cardiac surgery and 4.5 million children (22 million person-years) who did not. More than 4 in 10 children who underwent cardiac surgery used ≥1 chronic medication compared with approximately 1 in 10 children who did not have cardiac surgery. Medication expenditures were 10 times higher per person-year for cardiac compared with noncardiac enrollees. Among cardiac enrollees, disease severity was associated with chronic medication use; use was highest among infants; however, nearly one-half of adolescents used ≥1 chronic medication. Children who undergo cardiac surgery experience high medication burden that persists throughout childhood. Understanding chronic medication use can inform clinicians (both pediatricians and subspecialists) and policymakers, and ultimately the value of care for this medically complex population.

838,838,27637722,"To clarify cognitive processes underlining the development of reading in children speaking Japanese as their first language, we examined relationships between performances of cognitive tasks in the preschool period and later reading abilities. Ninety-one normally developing preschoolers (41 girls and 50 boys; 5years 4months to 6years 4months, mean 5years 10months) participated as subjects. We conducted seven cognitive tasks including phonological awareness tasks, naming tasks, and working memory tasks in the preschool period. In terms of reading tasks, the hiragana naming task was administered in the preschool period; the reading times, which is a composite score of the monomoraic syllable reading task, the word and the non-word reading tasks, and the single sentence reading task, was evaluated in first and second grade; and the kanji reading task (naming task) was tested in second grade. Raven's colored progressive matrices and picture vocabulary test revised were also conducted in first grade. Correlation analyses between task scores and stepwise multiple regression analyses were implemented. Tasks tapping phonological awareness, lexical access, and verbal working memory showed significant correlations with reading tasks. In the multiple regression analyses the performances in the verbal working memory task played a key role in predicting character naming task scores (the hiragana naming task and the kanji reading task) while the digit naming task was an important predictor of reading times. Unexpectedly, the role of phonological (mora) awareness was modest among children speaking Japanese. Cognitive functions including phonological awareness, digit naming, and verbal working memory (especially the latter two) were involved in the development of reading skills of children speaking Japanese.

839,839,30155660,"Although the suction force that moves blood into the left ventricle during early diastole is thought to play an important role in diastolic function, there have been a few studies of this phenomenon in normal children. Suction force is measured as the intraventricular pressure difference (IVPD) and intraventricular pressure gradient (IVPG), which is calculated as IVPD divided by left ventricular length. The purpose of this study was to determine the suction force in infants, children, and adolescents using IVPD and IVPG. We included 120 normal children categorized into five groups based on age: G1 (0-2 years), G2 (3-5 years), G3 (6-8 years), G4 (9-11 years), and G5 (12-16 years). The total, basal, and mid-apical IVPD and IVPG were calculated using color M-mode Doppler imaging of the mitral valve inflow using the Euler equation. The total IVPD increased with age from G1 to G5 (1.75 + 0.51 vs. 2.95 + 0.72 mmHg, respectively; p < 0.001), due to an increase in mid-apical IVPD with constant basal IVPD. Although total IVPG was constant, mid-apical IVPG was larger in G5 than in G1 (0.21 + 0.06 vs. 0.16 + 0.07 mmHg/cm, respectively; p = 0.006). Total, basal, and mid-apical IVPDs were significantly correlated with age and the parameters of heart size and mitral annular e'. Mid-apical IVPG correlated with age and e' positively, but basal IVPG did with age negatively and did not with e'. The suction force increased at the mid-apical segment, correlating with increasing heart size and developing left ventricular relaxation, even after adjustment for left ventricular length.

We conducted a prospective observational study in 2 pediatric emergency departments of children aged 4 to 17 years with painful and nonpainful conditions. We assessed their pain intensity using the FPS-R, CAS, and qualitative measures. Pain score cut points that best differentiated adjacent categories of pain were identified using a receiver operating characteristic-based method. Cut points were compared within subgroups based on age, sex, and ethnicity. We enrolled 620 patients, of whom 314 had painful conditions. The mean age was 9.2 years; 315 (50.8%) were in the younger age group (aged 4-7 years); 291 (46.8%) were female; and 341 (55%) were Hispanic. The scores best representing categories of pain for the FPS-R were as follows: no pain, 0 and 2; mild pain, 4; moderate pain, 6; and severe pain, 8 and 10. For the CAS, these were 0 to 1, 1.25 to 2.75, 3 to 5.75, and 6 to 10, respectively. Children with no pain frequently reported nonzero pain scores. There was considerable overlap of scores associated with mild and moderate pain. There were no clinically meaningful differences of scores representing each category of pain based on age, ethnicity, and race.

The purpose of this retrospective study was to characterize the features of these lesions as viewed on sonographic (US) and color Doppler US examination. During a 220-week period, 527 male patients 0-17 years old had been referred from the pediatric emergency department for scrotal US evaluation. Torsion of the appendix testis or appendix epididymis had been diagnosed in 19 (3.6%) patients, 3-14 years old (mean, 9.4 years); those patients became our study cohort. The clinical diagnoses in 15 of those patients had been suspected testicular torsion (n = 7), trauma (n = 4), suspected epididymitis and/or orchitis (n = 3), and suspected hydrocele (n = 1). The remaining four patients had been referred owing to nonspecific pain. None of the 19 patients had had the ""blue-dot sign"" on physical examination. In the 19 patients diagnosed with torsion of the intrascrotal appendages, color Doppler US demonstrated a round or oval avascular lesion with heterogeneous echotexture (n = 18), posterior enhancement (n = 13), and hyperemia of the surrounding structures (n = 15). All lesions (appendages) were adjacent (n = 16) or in close proximity (n = 3) to the upper pole of the testis. Fifteen of the appendages were adjacent to both the testis and the epididymis, four were adjacent to the epididymis alone, and none were adjacent to the testis alone. Owing to the close proximity of the upper pole of the testis, the epididymis, and the appendage, differentiation between testicular and epididymal appendages was not possible. Torsion of the intrascrotal appendages has a typical appearance on color Doppler US; thus, we believe that it is the method of choice for diagnosing torsion of the scrotal appendages and safely ruling out other disorders as well as avoiding unwarranted surgical intervention or antibiotic treatment.

To facilitate the engagement of children and adolescents in health care, the aim of this project is to develop an engagement game. A user-centred design was used to develop a patient engagement game in three steps: (1) identification of important themes for adolescents regarding their illness, treatment and hospital care, (2) evaluation of the draft version of the game and (3) testing usability in clinical practice. Adolescents (12-18 years) were engaged in all steps of the development process through focus groups, interviews or a workshop. These were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed in MAXQDA. (1) The important themes for adolescents (N = 15) were included: visiting the hospital, participating, disease and treatment, social environment, feelings, dealing with staff, acceptation, autonomy, disclosure and chronically ill peers. (2) Then, based on these themes, the engagement game was developed and the draft version was evaluated by 13 adolescents. Based on their feedback, changes were made to the game (e.g., adjusting the images and changing the game rules). (3) Regarding usability, the pilot version was evaluated positively. The game helped adolescents to give their opinion. Based on the feedback of adolescents, some last adjustments (e.g., changing colours and adding a game board) were made, which led to the final version of the game, All Voices Count. Working together with adolescents, All Voices Count, a patient engagement game was developed.

The clinical and radiographic signs of 97 teeth of the study group were recorded along a follow-up period that ranged between 12 and 75 months (mean >36 months). Children's age at time of injury ranged between 18 and 72 months (mean 40). The control group consisted of 102 non-discolored maxillary primary central incisors in 51 children older than 54 months with no history of dental trauma. In 50 teeth (52%) the color faded or became yellowish and in 47 (48%) it remained dark. Clinical signs of infection, that were diagnosed 5-58 months after the injury, were associated significantly more with dark than yellowish hues (83 and 17%, respectively). Teeth that had changed their color to become yellow presented more PCO than teeth with black/gray/brown coronal discoloration (78 and 6%, respectively). Arrest of dentine apposition was found in 15 teeth, one had yellow coronal discoloration and the remaining 14 had a dark shade. Eleven teeth showed inflammatory root resorption all with dark discoloration. Two atypical types of root resorption were observed: a surface resorption restricted to the lateral aspects of the apical half of the root while the root length remained unchanged and in the other expansion of the follicle of the permanent successor was observed. Expansion of the dental follicle was observed in 72% of all teeth with no significant difference between the various types of coronal discoloration but only half of the cases were associated with resorption of the root of the primary incisor. The various pathologic findings observed in the study group were either absent or rarely seen in the control group. It can be concluded that more than 50% of the primary incisors that retain their dark coronal discoloration acquired after dental injuries remain clinically asymptomatic till the eruption of the permanent successor even if they present accelerated root resorption. Asymptomatic traumatized primary incisors that retain their dark coronal discoloration may develop a sinus tract and inflammatory root resorption years after the injury.

Infectious forms, Behçet's disease and eosinophilic gastroenteritis are not included in this study. UC and CD are difficult to diagnose and to treat, and require a multispecialistic approach including pediatric gastroenterologists, surgeons, radiologists, endoscopists and pathologists. Progress in diagnostic techniques--i.e., nuclear medicine procedures, conventional, duplex and color-Doppler US, and endoscopy--has increased our knowledge of these diseases and it has made their diagnosis easier, opening new therapeutic perspectives. In our paper, after mentioning the major clinical and radiologic features of CIBD, we report on the patients hospitalized in the Gaslini Institute from 1984 to 1994. Thirty-six patients (age range: 3,9 to 14 years) were examined with several imaging techniques--i.e., plain radiography, US, contrast studies and CT--according to the clinical presentation and behavior of the disease. X-ray studies played the leading role in imaging mucosal disease spread (double contrast studies) and monitoring ""surgical"" complications (plain radiography). These techniques, which were always combined with US and, in some cases, CT, are also a major tool to study extraluminal CIBD spread--i.e., fistulas, pseudotumors, lymph nodes, abscesses and mesenteric changes. Color-Doppler US may play a critical role in the differential diagnosis of these and other small and large bowel pathologic conditions. The most typical CD patterns in bowel disease are listed in the paper, to give a contribution to the differential diagnosis of the chronic abdominal pain syndrome which is a very common condition in children.

To define the clinical and ultrasound criteria that best predict testicular torsion. The records of children hospitalized for acute scrotum from 1997 to 2002 were reviewed. The clinical and ultrasound findings of children who had a final diagnosis of testicular torsion were compared with those of children who had other diagnoses (torsion of the testicular appendix, epididymitis, and epididymo-orchitis). Forty-one children had testicular torsion; 131 had other diagnoses. Stepwise regression analysis yielded three factors that were significantly associated with testicular torsion: duration of pain < or =6 h; absent or decreased cremasteric reflex; and diffuse testicular tenderness. When the children were scored by final diagnosis for the presence of these factors (0-3), none of the children with a score of 0 had testicular torsion, whereas 87% with a score of 3 did. The ultrasound finding of decreased or absent testicular flow had a sensitivity of 63% and a specificity of 99%. Eight of ten children with testicular torsion and normal or increased testicular flow had a coiled spermatic cord on ultrasound. We suggest that all children with acute scrotal pain and a clinical score of 3 should undergo testicular exploration, and children with a lower probability of testicular torsion (score 1 or 2) should first undergo diagnostic ultrasound. Because the presence of testicular flow does not exclude torsion, the spermatic cord should be meticulously evaluated in all children with acute scrotum and normal or increased testicular blood flow.

Postoperatively, stenoses of the SCPC and branch pulmonary arteries can occur. If there are clinical concerns and echocardiography is insufficient for diagnosis, patients undergo invasive evaluation with exposure to radiation and anesthesia. The use of ultrasound enhancing agents (UEAs) to improve echocardiographic diagnostic capabilities has not previously been described in this population. A single-center, retrospective case review was conducted of children who underwent echocardiography with UEA, following SCPC, from March 1, 2020, to April 15, 2022, at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Twenty-two patients with hypoxemia or concern for obstruction following SCPC underwent UEA echocardiography. Extracted clinical data included patient demographics, echocardiographic images, angiography, surgical and transcatheter interventions, as well as available follow-up data. Six of the 22 UEA echocardiograms demonstrated stenosis or occlusion of either the SCPC or a pulmonary artery. All six patients underwent cardiac catheterization and five required intervention. Angioplasty was performed in each case with one requiring subsequent surgical revision. Sixteen of 22 UEA echocardiograms demonstrated no evidence of stenosis. Ten of these 16 patients improved, while six experienced persistent hypoxemia prompting referral for cardiac catheterization. Angiography confirmed the UEA echocardiographic findings (absence of stenosis) in four of these six patients. There were no adverse reactions related to UEA administration. Echocardiography with UEAs is a valuable and safe adjunctive imaging modality following SCPC, particularly when two-dimensional and color imaging is limited. This novel application of UEAs in complex patients with congenital heart disease provides an ""angiogram-like"" image, better delineating vessel walls and improving assessment of postoperative obstruction. As experience with UEAs increases in the congenital heart disease population, there may be opportunities to decrease invasive and costly procedures, while expediting the care of patients in need of intervention.

In order to perform a facial approximation that presents a true reflection of the child in question, information regarding differences in facial soft tissue at different ages, sexes and ancestry groups is needed. The aims of this study were to provide data on STT of South African Black and Coloured children and to assess differences in STT with respect to age, sex and ancestry. STT was measured using cephalograms of South African children (n=388), aged 6-13 years. After digitizing the images, STT measurements were taken at ten mid-facial landmarks from each image using the iTEM measuring program. STT comparisons between groups per age, sex and ancestry were statistically analyzed. The results showed that STT differences at lower face landmarks are more pronounced in age groups per ancestry as opposed to differences per age and sex. Generally, an increase in STT was seen between 6-10 year old groups and 11-13 year old groups, regardless of ancestry and sex, at the midphiltrum, labiale inferius, pogonion, and beneath chin landmarks.

The common eye disorders for which genetic testing is commonly requested are briefly discussed - anophthalmia, microphthalmia, coloboma, anterior segment dysgenesis, corneal dystrophies, cataracts, optic atrophy, congenital glaucoma, congenital amaurosis, retinitis pigmentosa, color blindness, juvenile retinoshisis, retinoblastoma etc. A protocol for genetic testing is presented. If specific mutations in a gene are common, they should form the first tier test, as the mutations in Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. If mutations in one gene are likely, sequencing of that gene should be carried out, e.g. GALT gene in galactosemia, RS1 gene in retinoshisis. Disorders with genetic heterogeneity require multi-gene panel tests, and if these show no abnormality, then deletion / duplication or microarray studies are recommended, followed in sequence by clinical exome (5000 to 6000 genes), full exome (about 20,000 genes or whole genome studies (includes all introns).

866,866,37899732,"An important goal of early childhood education is teaching emotional self-regulation within the context of a safe, stable, nurturing environment. Expulsion of young children ignores underlying emotional and behavioral concerns, disproportionately affects children of color (Black or Hispanic), males, children with disabilities, and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, and has long-term consequences on educational and life success. Addressing implicit bias and providing child mental health consultation (psychologists, social workers, developmental behavioral pediatricians, child psychiatrists, and child neurologists) to child care providers can prevent expulsion. Pediatricians and other providers within the medical home play an important part in preventing expulsion. However, pediatricians need more training in early childhood mental health and in understanding how systemic racism and implicit bias lead to preschool expulsion in children of color. By identifying children at risk for expulsion because of poverty, racial discrimination, toxic stress, insecure attachment, or history of trauma, the pediatrician can connect families with community resources that may ameliorate these effects. Pediatricians can provide information on social-emotional development in early childhood, promote positive parent-child relationships, and model and discuss age-appropriate and developmentally appropriate behavior management. Pediatricians can also guide parents toward high-quality child care programs that use mental health consultation and developmentally appropriate activities, both of which lessen the chance of child expulsion. Furthermore, behavioral health providers integrated into the medical home can provide consultation to child care providers on managing patients.

The incidence of AVMs in HHT pediatric populations is unknown. To describe the screening protocol performed in the first genotypically confirmed HHT pediatric population and to estimate the incidence of occult brain, lung and liver AVMs and the different disease phenotypes. Molecular analysis was performed on 35 children, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, who were family members of probands with a previously identified mutation. Clinical-instrumental examination was performed on the mutation positive cases. Nasal telangiectases were investigated by anterior rhinoscopy. Contrast echocardiography and high resolution thoracic multislice computed tomography (CT) were performed to detect pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs), and echo-color Doppler, and abdominal CT to detect hepatic arteriovenous malformations (HAVMs). Brain magnetic resonance imaging was utilized to detect cerebral angiopathic involvement. Molecular analysis demonstrated the mutation-carrier status in 22/35 children. Nineteen children, 12 of whom had epistaxis, positive to molecular testing underwent clinical evaluation.

We examined associations of EF with HIV infection, disease severity and other factors among youth with PHIV and perinatally HIV-exposed, uninfected youth (PHEU). Within the US-based Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study, 354 PHIV and 200 PHEU youth completed a standardized EF measure (Children's Color Trails Test, CCTT) and youth and/or caregivers completed a questionnaire measuring everyday EF (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, BRIEF). Covariates included HIV status, current and historical disease severity, demographic and caregiver variables and other cognitive measures. Analyses used linear and logistic regression and proportional odds models. No significant HIV status group differences were found on CCTT scores. Caregiver BRIEF ratings indicated significantly fewer problems for PHIV than PHEU youth. However, PHIV youth with past encephalopathy self-endorsed significantly greater metacognitive (ie, cognitive regulation) problems on the BRIEF and performed more slowly on the CCTT than PHEU youth. CCTT and caregiver BRIEF scores had significant associations with indicators of past and present disease severity. Both PHIV and PHEU had significantly worse scores than population means on CCTT and BRIEF; scores had significant associations with demographic covariates. Youth with PHIV show EF problems likely associated with risk factors other than HIV. However, cognitive slowing and self-reported metacognitive problems were evident in PHIV youth with a history of encephalopathy. Assessment and treatment of EF impairment may be important to identifying PHIV youth at particular risk for poor health and behavioral outcomes.

Of the 43 children, 18 (41.9%) were HP positive and 25 (58.1%) were HP negative. The PP HpSAT showed a sensitivity of 94.4% and a specificity of 100.0%. With the ICS HpSAT, equivocal results occurred in 5/42 (11.9%) of the tests due to a problem with the visual interpretation of the change in colour of the test-line. The ICS HpSAT had a sensitivity of 100.0% and a specificity of 76.0% when the test was considered positive in case of any change of colour of the test-line, which is the correct practice according to the manufacturer. The ICS HpSAT had a sensitivity of 100.0% and a specificity of 96.0% when the test was considered positive only in case of a ""significant change of colour"" of the test-line. Compared to the 13C UBT, the PP HpSAT shows a comparably good sensitivity and specificity, the ICS HpSAT has a comparably good sensitivity but lower specificity due to a high percentage of equivocal results when the test is used according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the ICS HpSAT has a comparably good sensitivity and specificity when a weakly positive test is considered negative for the diagnosis of HP infection in children.

We found four patients with these changes: three of these patients were children. The lesions occurred on the right index finger, right thumb, left middle finger, and right great toe, respectively. A slightly haphazard combination of colors ranging from dark brown to black, the important characteristic of subungual melanoma in situ, was observed in two cases. In the remaining two cases, although the haphazard combination of colors was not distinctive, many fine, dark longitudinal lines were seen within diffuse, light-brownish pigmentation. Serial histologic examination of the excised tissue specimens showed great proliferation of vacuolated melanocytes with variable nuclear atypicality along the entire basal layer in all cases. These histologic changes were compatible with those of atypical melanocytic hyperplasia or intraepidermal melanoma (in situ melanoma), which is an early lesion of subungual melanoma. An adult case is thought to be a definite example of a subungual melanoma in situ. We also made the diagnosis of melanoma in situ in the remaining three cases of children with rapidly growing pigmented nail streaks because their histopathologic features were distinguishable from those of the adult case.

The trial was conducted between February 2016 and April 2022 at primary care offices affiliated with 6 US institutions and was designed to evaluate whether symptom burden differed in subgroups defined by nasopharyngeal Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis on bacterial culture and by the presence of colored nasal discharge. Oral amoxicillin (90 mg/kg/d) and clavulanate (6.4 mg/kg/d) (n = 254) or placebo (n = 256) for 10 days. The primary outcome was symptom burden based on daily symptom scores on a validated scale (range, 0-40) during the 10 days after diagnosis. Secondary outcomes included treatment failure, adverse events including clinically significant diarrhea, and resource use by families. Most of the 510 included children were aged 2 to 5 years (64%), male (54%), White (52%), and not Hispanic (89%).

884,884,11937278,"Traumatic high-flow priapism caused by a pathologic influx from lacerated arteries to the cavernous bodies is usually treated by transcatheter arterial embolisation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a combined interventional approach with intraoperative perineal colour Doppler ultrasound (US) while performing the embolisation procedure. Our aim was to reduce radiation exposure and application of iodinised contrast media. To achieve an optimal position of the angiography catheter directly before or in the fistula, instead of several x-ray examinations with contrast media, a perineal colour Doppler US examination was performed while saline or US contrast media were injected through the catheter. The flow pattern allows the assessment of the occlusion of the fistula and the intact flow in the arteries that were not damaged. In four patients (unilateral fistula: 1, bilateral fistulas: 3) with traumatic high-flow priapism, this technique was performed combined with a conventional angiographic control of the embolisation. Seven embolisation sessions were performed. Only in one case, a dislocation of a microcoil required a second session. In all cases, the priapism disappeared immediately after the final session, leading to a restored erectile function.

885,885,33980614,"Pediatric kidney transplant recipients are distinguished from adult recipients by the need for many decades of graft function, the potential effect of CKD on neurodevelopment, and the changing immune environment of a developing human. The entire life of an individual who receives a transplant as a child is colored by their status as a transplant recipient. Not only must these young recipients negotiate all of the usual challenges of emerging adulthood (transition from school to work, romantic relationships, achieving independence from parents), but they must learn to manage a life-threatening medical condition independently. Regardless of the age at transplantation, graft failure rates are higher during adolescence and young adulthood than at any other age. All pediatric transplant recipients must pass through this high-risk period. Factors contributing to the high graft failure rates in this period include poor adherence to treatment, potentially exacerbated by the transfer of care from pediatric- to adult-oriented care providers, and perhaps an increased potency of the immune response. We describe the characteristics of pediatric kidney transplant recipients, particularly those factors that may influence their care throughout their lives. We also discuss the risks associated with the transition from pediatric- to adult-oriented care and provide some suggestions to optimize the transition to adult-oriented transplant care and long-term outcomes.

886,886,35152232,"Puff Bars, a brand of disposable e-cigarettes, have skyrocketed in popularity recently, presenting significant health and safety risks to adolescents. Puff Bars and other disposable e-cigarette products are attractive to children and teenagers because of their vibrant colors and flavors, low cost, and ease of access. This review examines the rise in Puff Bar popularity, describes notable health and safety concerns, and provides advice for parents and pediatricians in identifying and preventing adolescent Puff Bar use. Puff Bars have increased in popularity as their product design evaded strict regulations imposed on alternate e-cigarette products, such as Juul. In addition, Puff Bars' sweet and fruit flavors and marketing on social media have made their use pervasive among youth. Puff Bar use can lead to increased risk of e-cigarette product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) and potential exposure to carcinogens. Furthermore, the developmental risks of nicotine use during adolescence include negative effects on cognitive function and detriments to short-term memory. Puff Bars present a significant danger to adolescents, and it is imperative that parents and pediatricians are aware of the health risks involved with vaping. Pediatricians should explore e-cigarette use during patient visits, and parents must communicate these dangers to their children and be able to identify these products to regulate their use.

Interrater reliability for each finding was reported by using Fleiss' kappa (κ) for categorical variables and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for continuous variables. No examination finding had substantial agreement (κ/ICC > 0.8). Two findings (retractions, wheezing) had moderate to substantial agreement (κ/ICC = 0.6-0.8). Nine findings (abdominal pain, pleuritic pain, nasal flaring, skin color, overall impression, cool extremities, tachypnea, respiratory rate, and crackles/rales) had fair to moderate agreement (κ/ICC = 0.4-0.6).

Teachers polled students on helmet use and student volunteers counted children riding bicycles and noted helmet use. A total of 250 helmets were purchased, and helmet use was observed to increase among 5- to 14-year-old children from 0.75% to 12.8% during 9 months. Program effect was significantly greater on younger children, and girls used helmets more often than boys did. The cycling fatality in Goderich was associated with a dramatic increase in helmet use (to more than 50%), a significantly higher rate than in Kincardine. A second subsidy and rodeo did not further increase helmet use. A small community with limited resources can mount a bicycle helmet education and incentive program with high exposure and participation rates by children.

Diffusion tensor images and resting-state functional magnetic resonance images were analyzed. Cognitive skills were tested using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale; executive function was assessed based on a composite score calculated from the synthetic composite of the Children's Color Trails Test, STROOP Color and Word Test, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; attention function was evaluated using the Advanced Test of Attention (ATA); and the Hollingshead Four Factor Index of Social Status-Child was estimated. Twenty-one children born preterm with PGF (14 girls [66.7%]), 17 children born preterm without PGF (6 girls [35.3%]), and 44 children born full term (24 girls [54.5%]) were recruited. Attention function was less favorable in children with PGF than those without PGF (mean [SD] ATA score: children with PGF, 63.5 [9.4]; children without PGF, 55.7 [8.0]; P = .008). Significantly lower mean (SD) fractional anisotropy in the forceps major of the corpus callosum (0.498 [0.067] vs 0.558 [0.044] vs 0.570 [0.038]) and higher mean (SD) mean diffusivity in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus-parietal bundle (8.312 [0.318] vs 7.902 [0.455] vs 8.083 [0.393]; originally calculated as millimeter squared per second and rescaled 10 000 times as mean diffusivity × 10 000) were seen among children with PGF compared with children without PGF and controls, respectively.

Self-perceptions of skin color may influence health behaviours, including the adoption of practices protective against harmful solar ultraviolet radiation levels. Misperception of personal risk may have negative health implications. The aim of this study is to determine whether Munsell(®) color chart assessments align with child self-reported skin color. Two-trained investigators, with assessed color acuity, visually classified student inner upper arm constitutive skin color. The Munsell(®) classifications obtained were converted to Individual Typology Angle (ITA) values and respective Del Bino skin color categories after spectrocolorimeter measurements based on published values/data. As part of a written questionnaire on sun protection knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours, self-completed in class time, students classified their end of winter skin color. Student self-reports were compared with the ITA-based Del Bino classifications. A total of 477 New Zealand primary students attending 27 randomly selected schools from five geographic regions. The main measures were self-reported skin color and visually observed skin color. A monotonic association was observed between the distribution of spectrophotometer ITA scores obtained for Munsell(®) tiles and child self-reports of skin color, providing some evidence for the validity of self-report among New Zealand primary school children, although the lighter colored ITA defined groups were most numerous in this study sample. Statistically significant differences in ITA scores were found by ethnicity, self-reported skin color, and geographic residence (P < 0.001). Certain Munsell(®) color tiles were frequently selected as providing a best match to skin color. Assessment using Munsell(®) color charts was simple, inexpensive, and practical for field use and acceptable to children. The results suggest that this method may prove useful for making comparisons with other studies using visual tools to assess skin color. Alignment between the ITA distribution derived from the Munsell(®) assessment and child skin color self-reports could probably be improved, particularly with the addition of another 'light'/'white' color category in the self-report instrument.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the EMS nurse assessment, management, the utilisation of RETTS-p and patient outcome. A prospective, observational study was performed on 651 children aged < 16 years from January to December 2016. Statistical tests used in the study were Mann-Whitney U test, Fisher's exact test and Spearman's rank statistics.

902,902,23142939,"Vascular injuries in newborns are rare and most commonly occur in the process of obtaining vascular access for monitoring organ system functions or interventions in critical care. Care of vascular injuries in neonates poses several challenges, with the most significant arguably being the lack of clinical experience with such injuries. An algorithm for the management of arterial injuries in pediatric patients is investigated and reported. A retrospective chart analysis was performed on all patients consulted for the management of vascular injury by the plastic surgery service at Texas Children's Hospital between 1997 and 2005. The outcomes and procedures were reviewed. Thirty vascular insults in 28 patients were evaluated and treated by the senior author (J.D.F.) using this protocol. Thirty-seven percent (11 of 30) were approached surgically, including two cases treated with thrombolysis alone. The remaining 63 percent (19 of 30) were managed with more conservative interventions, including anticoagulation and clinical optimization. When color Doppler imaging was used preoperatively to locate and describe the characteristics of vascular injuries, visualized lesions coincided with the surgical findings in 100 percent (11 of 11 cases). Twenty-three limbs (77 percent) were salvaged completely using this algorithm, one was initially salvaged but later developed limb-length discrepancy requiring amputation, and one experienced complete limb loss. The remaining patients (five of 30) died as a result of complications of their primary medical conditions before limb salvage could be assessed. This evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed algorithm used to determine direction of care in the event of arterial injury in small children.

903,903,1987722,"Color-flow Doppler is used for special localization of cardiac flows. The transeptal jet in supracristal ventricular septal defect (VSD) is directed toward the pulmonary valve and is often difficult to distinguish from the right ventricular (RV) outflow tract flow. Pulsed- and continuous-wave Doppler can misread the VSD jet as a stenotic lesion in the RV outflow tract. This study describes the color-flow Doppler characteristics of supracristal VSD and determines if color-flow Doppler can differentiate supracristal VSD jets from RV outflow tract flow. The study group comprised 28 patients ranging in age from 3 days to 23 years (mean 6.4), with catheter-diagnosed supracristal VSD in 14, isolated pulmonary valve stenosis in 10 and RV infundibular obstruction in 4. The echocardiographic Doppler and color-flow Doppler data of all patients were reviewed without knowledge of catheterization diagnosis. In all patients with supracristal VSD, color-flow Doppler revealed an abnormal transeptal jet directed toward the pulmonary valve that occurred 5 to 10 ms before RV outflow tract flow was identified. VSD and RV outflow tract jet could be differentiated by pulsed- and continuous-wave Doppler alone in 10 of 14 patients (71%). In 4 patients, differentiation was possible only with color-flow Doppler and electrocardiographic gating. Associated aortic regurgitation, or a fistula, or both, were detected in 6 patients. Pulsed- and continuous-wave Doppler with or without color-flow Doppler correctly identified the level of obstruction in all patients with RV outflow tract lesions (14 of 14).

While the intestinal microbiome plays an important role in nutrition, little is known regarding the relationship of the microbiome and BMIp in children with CF. Pediatric patients (< 18 years old) with CF and healthy comparison patients (HCs) were enrolled in the study and stool samples obtained. BMIp was categorized as Green Zone (BMIp > 50th), Yellow Zone (BMIp 25th-49th) and Red Zone (BMIp < 25th). Intestinal microbiome assessment was performed via 16S rRNA gene sequencing; microbial richness, diversity, and differential species abundance were assessed. Stool samples were collected from 107 children with CF and 50 age-matched HCs. Compared to HCs, children with CF were found to have lower bacterial richness, alpha-diversity, and a different microbial composition. When evaluating them by their BMIp color zone, richness and alpha-diversity were lowest in those in the Red Zone. In addition, an unclassified amplicon sequence variant (ASV) of Blautia, a known butyrate-producing anaerobe, was of lowest abundance in children in the Red Zone. Children with CF have a dysbiotic intestinal microbiome with specific changes that accompany changes in BMIp. Longitudinal assessments of the microbiome and its metabolic activities over time are needed to better understand how improvements in the microbiome may improve nutrition and enhance long-term survival in children with CF.

A UR was visualized in 180 (99%) of the children. The URs had a mean length +/- standard deviation of 13 +/- 5 mm. Most of the URs were ovoid, and most demonstrated a moderate protrusion into the bladder cavity. The URs with a central echogenic area were larger than those without central echogenicity. In 36 (61%) of the 59 URs that were evaluated with color Doppler sonography, vascular signals were demonstrated within the lesion. The URs with internal vascular signals were significantly larger than those without internal vascular signals. The gray-scale and color Doppler sonographic characteristics of URs seem to be related to their size and their degree of involution rather than to the age of the child. We think that URs are present in almost all children.

We prospectively compared the transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) and serum bilirubin (TSB) measurements of newborns over a 3 month-period. Skin colour was assigned via reference colour swatches. Diagnostic measures of the TcB/TSB comparison were made and clinically relevant TcB cut-off values were determined for each skin colour group. 451 infants (51 light, 326 medium and 74 dark skin colour) were recruited. The association between TcB and TSB was high for all skin colours (rs>0.9). The Bland-Altman analysis showed an absolute mean difference between the two measures of 13.3±26.4 µmol/L with broad limits of agreement (-39.4-66.0 µmol/L), with TcB underestimating TSB in light and medium skin colours and overestimating in dark skin colour. Diagnostic measures were also consistently high across skin colours, with no clinically significant differences observed. The JM 103 is a useful screening tool to identify infants in need of serum bilirubin, regardless of skin colour.

Transcranial color-coded Doppler (TCCD) ultrasonography is an accepted noninvasive method with which to quantify intracranial blood flow in adults and children. The authors studied the applications of TCCD ultrasonography and the alterations of the flow velocity of the cerebral arteries in children with hydrocephalus. One hundred thirty-five children were divided into three groups: Group 1 comprised 40 infants with asymptomatic hydrocephalus who had well-functioning ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts; Group 2 comprised 10 children with symptomatic hydrocephalus who had malfunctioning shunts that were replaced; and Group 3 was a control group of 85 healthy infants. All patients underwent sequential measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocities (systolic and diastolic velocities) and resistivity index (RI). One group of patients underwent functional tests (compression of the anterior fontanelle and CO2 vasoreactivity) to determine hemodynamic changes in cerebral circulation. A significant statistical change in RI measurements, end diastolic CBF velocity, and percentage of change in RI was shown in patients with malfunctioning shunts, and in infants with a well-functioning VP shunt vasomotor reactivity was severely reduced. Transcranial color-coded Doppler ultrasonography can be used to perform follow-up assessments of normal and malfunctioning shunts in children with hydrocephalus; the functional tests are a noninvasive tool for evaluating the cerebral compliance and the cerebral autoregulation in infants with hydrocephalus. The autoregulatory capacity may partly or completely be lost in cases of long-term shunt-treated hydrocephalus, and loss of cerebral vasoreactivity may be responsible for long-term deficits commonly observed in children, which help explain some of symptoms related to slit ventricles.

Tissue Doppler analysis of regional wall motion revealed abnormal left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV) diastolic relaxation in the early postoperative phase after CPB. Initially, all segments were significantly altered, but by 24 h, regional differences became apparent: LV radial wall motion was recovered, while longitudinal fibers in LV and RV appeared to be less resilient. RV myocardial mechanics were most abnormal. Tissue Doppler analysis may deepen our understanding of myocardial recovery and offers a sensitive tool to compare different cardioprotective strategies.

919,919,37715763,"Gender diverse youth (GDY) have improved mental health when affirmed by parents, but little is known about the support parents of GDY seek, receive, and still need. This qualitative study explored experiences of parents of GDY to better understand their support needs. Parents of GDY submitted videos and were interviewed about their journey supporting their GDY. Data collection continued until thematic saturation was reached. Audio recordings from videos and interviews were transcribed and analyzed via an inductive thematic analysis using the rigorous and accelerated data reduction technique. In total, 25 parents of GDY (mean age 15 years, range 6-21 years) from 12 states provided video recordings and interviews; 36% were People of Color and 28% were fathers. We identified four themes and 12 subthemes. Theme 1: support through education included acknowledging ignorance about gender diversity and remedying ignorance. Theme 2: engaging community noted that support was multilayered and based around the family unit and pre-existing community. Theme 3: expanding community included acknowledgement that seeking new community was important for many to reduce feelings of isolation. It also highlighted that ""safe spaces"" for parents of GDY were not always safe for those of other marginalized groups, particularly People of Color. Theme 4: support in healthcare spaces centered experiences navigating medical and mental healthcare for GDY and feeling supported and unsupported in those spaces. Parents identified numerous ways they sought, received, and needed support to understand and affirm their GDY. These findings will aid development of targeted support interventions for parents of GDY. Further research is needed to evaluate the impact of these interventions on GDY health.

921,921,11919526,"Vomiting in children suffering from acute gastroenteritis interferes with the oral rehydration process and equally frustrates parents and health care providers. Adjuncts such as promethazine and metoclopramide are less than optimally effective and are associated with side effects. Ondansetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist marketed as Zofran, is a safe and effective antiemetic used extensively in oncology and postoperative patients. We evaluate the effect of the antiemetic ondansetron versus placebo on the clinical outcome of patients with vomiting from gastroenteritis in a pediatric emergency department. This was a randomized, prospective, double-blind clinical trial in a university-affiliated children's hospital ED. Children between the ages of 6 months and 12 years who had vomited at least 5 times during the preceding 24 hours were randomized to receive either oral ondansetron or a taste- and color-matched placebo. Oral rehydration was commenced 15 minutes later at 5 mL/min per standard oral rehydration protocols. Patients were discharged after they voided and continued standard oral rehydration at home with the introduction of a bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast (BRAT) diet after the first 24 hours. Any patient requiring admission was considered a treatment failure, and no further doses were given. Discharged patients were given 5 additional doses to be used every 8 hours, and they were contacted by telephone 24 and 48 hours after discharge to record the number of episodes of vomiting and diarrhea. The parents were also required to complete a diary of the same information, which was mailed to the investigators for confirmation of the telephone data. One hundred forty-five patients were enrolled, of whom 51% (n=74) were randomized to ondansetron. At baseline, age distribution, sex, and severity of illness did not differ between the ondansetron and placebo groups. During the observation period in the ED, the median number of episodes of vomiting was 0 in both groups, but the rank sum of vomiting episodes was significantly lower in the ondansetron group (P =.001). The number of episodes of emesis in the ED after enrollment ranged from 0 to 7 in the placebo group and 0 to 2 in the ondansetron group. During the 48 hours of follow-up, the median number of episodes of vomiting remained 0, with no statistically significant difference between the groups. There was no statistically significant difference in the rank sum of episodes of diarrhea in the ED between the groups (P =.622); however, during the next 48 hours, the patients in the ondansetron group had significantly more diarrhea than the placebo group. A lower proportion of patients receiving ondansetron compared with placebo required intravenous fluid therapy (P =.015). The admission rate was also lower in patients receiving ondansetron (P =.007). The revisit rate was higher in the ondansetron group compared with the placebo group (P =.047). Ondansetron was effective in reducing the emesis from gastroenteritis during the ED phase of oral rehydration and in lowering the rates of intravenous fluid administration and hospital admission.

922,922,24322889,"Precise quantification of left ventricular (LV) cavity dimensions assumes great importance in clinical cardiology. Pediatric guidelines recommend the left parasternal short axis (PSA) imaging plane for measuring LV cavity dimensions, while measuring from the long axis (PLA) plane is the convention in adult echocardiography. We sought to compare measurements obtained by two-dimensional (2D) and M-mode (MM) techniques in the two imaging planes. Healthy subjects were prospectively recruited for research echocardiography. Complete 2D, spectral and color flow Doppler examinations were performed in a non-sedated state. All subjects had structurally and functionally normal hearts. LV cavity dimensions were obtained in PLA and PSA views using 2D and MM yielding four measurement sets for each subject: PLA direct 2D; PLA 2D-guided MM, PSA direct 2D, PSA 2D-guided MM. A commercially available ultrasound system (Vivid E9, GE) was used and data stored digitally for subsequent analysis (EchoPAC BT11, GE). Acquisition and measurements were made by a single observer from at least three consecutive cardiac cycles, and averaged for each of the four categories. The study cohort consisted of 114 subjects (mean age 9 years, range 1-18; mean BSA 1.1 m(2), range 0.42-2.6). The smallest estimate of LV end-diastolic dimension (LVED) was obtained by PLA 2D, with larger estimates by PLA MM, PSA 2D, and PSA MM. Largest estimates of LV end-systolic dimension (LVES) are by 2D methods, with smaller estimates by both MM techniques. The smallest shortening fraction (SF) was by PLA 2D; other methods yielded larger SF. Temporal resolution is limited in 2D methodology and may account for the smaller LVED, larger LVES and smaller SF observed. Long axis methodology may predispose to off-center or non-perpendicular data acquisition and the potential for dimensional underestimation, particularly in diastole. Consistency in method for assessment of LV dimensions in children is an important factor for serial comparisons.

The purpose of our study was to determine if levels of cardiac troponin I are elevated, suggesting myocardial injury, in patients with acute rheumatic carditis. We identified all those patients with acute rheumatic fever, presenting between July 1998 and December 2000, who had clinical evidence of carditis, such as a new murmur of mitral or aortic regurgitation, and who had an echocardiogram, measurements of levels of cardiac troponin I, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and/or C-reactive protein performed at the time of presentation. Their charts were reviewed for demographic and clinical data. Echocardiograms were reviewed for severity of aortic and mitral regurgitation, and measurements made of left ventricular ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and end-diastolic dimension. We found 16 patients with acute rheumatic carditis, ranging in age from 2.0 to 16.1 years, with just over one-third having symptoms of congestive heart failure. All patients had evidence of acute inflammation. There was a significant relationship between symptoms and severity of mitral regurgitation. No patient had elevated levels of cardiac troponin I level. The fact that levels of cardiac troponin I are not elevated in the serum of children with acute rheumatic carditis suggests that there is minimal myocytic necrosis in this setting.

926,926,32516824," To compare B-flow sonography (BFS) with color Doppler sonography (CDS) for imaging of kidney transplant vascularization in children.  All children receiving a kidney transplantation who underwent a protocol-based ultrasound examination (Loqiq 9, GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA) using the BFS and CDS technique with equal settings and probe position between January 2013 and January 2016 were retrospectively assessed (n = 40). The obtained datasets were visually graded according to the following criteria: (I) delineation of the renal vascular tree (Grade 1 - clear demarcation of interlobar, together with arcuate and interlobular vessels; Grade 2 - clear demarcation of interlobar and cortical vessels, but no distinction of interlobular from arcuate vessels; Grade 3 - only clear demarcation of interlobar vessels, Grade 4 - insufficient demarcation) (II) delineation of cortical vessel density in ventral, lateral, and dorsal part of the transplant, (III) smallest vessel-capsule distance, and (IV) maximum cortical vessel count. Comparison between methods was performed using Fisher's exact and paired sample t-tests.  Applying a curved transducer (C1-6), BFS showed superior delineation of the renal vascular tree (p < 0.001), a lower vessel-capsule distance (p < 0.001), a higher cortical vessel count (p < 0.001), and a higher cortical vessel density in the superficial cortex (p = 0.01) than CDS. In the dorsal and lateral aspects of the transplant, cortical vessel density was lower with BFS (both p < 0.001). Using a linear high-resolution transducer (ML 6-15), no significant differences between the methods were found.  Improved imaging of kidney transplant vascularization can be achieved in children by adding BFS to a standard protocol. The BFS technique is especially beneficial for overall assessment of the renal vascular tree together with the extent of cortical vascularization on curved array images.   · Depiction of vascular tree and ventral cortical vessels is improved by BFS.. · The dorso-lateral cortex was better represented with CDS because of higher penetration.. · Additional monitoring with BFS improves the monitoring of transplant viability.. · Dammann E, Groth M, Schild R et al.

Sensitivity was 92% for 25 resected liver specimens from nine patients with all parenchymal margins grossly negative for disease. Four multifocal lesions were identified with two resected solely by ICG-avidity. ICG is a sensitive adjunct for identifying local and metastatic hepatoblastoma, including lesions not visualized on preoperative imaging, and delineating margins during liver resection. False positives limit specificity; however, there were no adverse outcomes from additional resections.

929,929,25261340,"Expectations and beliefs shape the experience of pain. This is most evident in context-induced, placebo analgesia, which has recently been shown to interact with the trait of magical thinking (MT) in adults. In children, placebo analgesia and the possible roles that MT and gender might play as modulators of placebo analgesia have remained unexplored. Using a paradigm in which heat pain stimuli were applied to both forearms, we investigated whether MT and gender can influence the magnitude of placebo analgesia in children. Participants were 49 right-handed children (aged 6-9 years) who were randomly assigned-stratified for MT and gender-to either an analgesia-expectation or a control-expectation condition. For both conditions, the placebo was a blue-colored hand disinfectant that was applied to the children's forearms. Independent of MT, the placebo treatment significantly increased both heat pain threshold and tolerance. The threshold placebo effect was more pronounced for girls than boys. In addition, independent of the expectation treatment, low-MT boys showed a lower tolerance increase on the left compared to the right side. Finally, MT specifically modulated tolerance on the right forearm side: Low-MT boys showed an increase, whereas high-MT boys showed a decrease in heat pain tolerance. This study documented a substantial expectation-induced placebo analgesia response in children (girls > boys) and demonstrated MT and gender-dependent laterality effects in pain perception. The findings may help improve individualized pain management for children. The study documents the first experimental evidence for a substantial expectancy-induced placebo analgesia response in healthy children aged 6 to 9 years (girls > boys).

We attempted both quantitative and qualitative analyses of the naevus of Ota to find out relations between histological patterns or parameters of melanin/melanocytes and lesion colours. Lesion colours were determined by one of the authors and were confirmed by a separate panel of dermatologists. Forty biopsy specimens of naevus of Ota were evaluated by both computer-assisted quantitative image analysis and a previously proposed conventional pattern analysis. The mean area fraction (AFmean) of melanin, the depth of the maximum area fraction of melanin (level of AFmax) and the depth of the deepest infiltrating melanocyte were significantly greater or deeper for bluish lesions than brownish lesions. Based on the qualitative pattern analysis we found that all the brownish lesions demonstrated superficial dermal melanin pigments, whereas bluish lesions tended to show more heterogeneous histological patterns. Eyelid lesions, all of which were bluish, revealed greater AF(mean) value than cheek lesions, presenting as either brownish or bluish colours. Quantitative analysis indicated that pigment density measures such as AFmean could be as important as the depth of melanocytes in the explanation of the lesion colours in naevus of Ota.

However, little attention is given to the impact of nutrition on skin integrity during critical illness. Skin integrity is at risk in critically ill children owing to necessary clinical therapies and challenges of providing nutrition therapy. We conducted a narrative literature review with three main thematic concepts to drive our literature search: the association of nutrition therapy with (1) skin integrity; (2) injury, wounds, and wound healing; and (3) differences of skin color. Using pertinent search and subject terms, PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, and SCOPUS databases were searched, yielding 316 articles. After removal of duplicates, articles were reviewed based on inclusion and exclusion criteria defined by the authors; only eight articles met the defined criteria to inform this review. Large and important gaps exist in the current literature regarding an association between nutrition therapy, skin injury, and wound healing. Little to no attention was found for associations with skin color. The resulting narrative review addresses these topics and subtopics with additional references included that are independent of the original search strategy. A dearth of evidence exists describing associations between nutrition and disruption of skin integrity in pediatric critical illness. Children with dark skin are at increased risk, as manifestation and identification of disruption to skin integrity may not be recognized.

The portal vein cavernous deformity was present either alone (in 8 patients) or with congenital hepatic fibrosis (in 4). Doppler sonography (color and spectral) was performed to assess the flow in the portal vascular territory, splenic vein, intrasplenic veins, and abdominal collaterals. Doppler sonography confirmed the venous flow waveform in the cavernous portal vein in all children with normal flow direction in the few intrahepatic portal vein branches and also in the intrahepatic veins. Splenomegaly was present in all. The intrasplenic veins were dilated in all but had normal flow direction except in 2 with spontaneous trans-splenic shunts.

936,936,35373956,"Compartment Syndrome (CS) has been recognized as a potential factor that worsens testicular viability after detorsion, especially in borderline cases of prolonged ischemia. Fasciotomy of the testicular tunica albuginea to relieve the pressure associated with CS has been proposed to accommodate edema after detorsion, embracing the raw fasciotomy area with tunica vaginalis flap (TVF) or graft. Fashioning the TVF can be tedious in cases of severe scrotal edema. Herein we present a technique that facilitates and expedites the procedure, maintaining the fasciotomy area decompressed. In testicular torsion, where the testis remains with dark coloration and questionable viability after detorsion a longitudinal releasing incision is made in the tunica albuginea (fasciotomy) to decrease compartmental pressure. If signs of parenchymal recovery (bleeding points, better color) are seen an orchio-septopexy is performed, suturing the incised albuginea's edges to the septum with a running suture, avoiding CS as well as re-torsion. Orchio-septopexy was performed in 11 cases with a mean age of 11.9 years (3-17). All cases had clinic follow-up and testicular Doppler US with a mean of 9.5 months (6-24). 6/11 cases (54%) were salvaged, with good vascularity in the Doppler US and maintained more than 50% testicular volume compared to the contralateral side. Orchio-septopexy after testicular fasciotomy is a simple and fast technique that can be utilized in cases of prolonged testicular ischemia and questionable viability. More than half of the testes recovered, encouraging us to propose its utilization as well as its validation by other surgeons.

The skin color of the forehead, cheek, upper inner arm, dorsum of hand, and anterior chest of 148 volunteers was measured using a spectrophotometer. Using a computer analysis program, L*a*b* values and the melanin and erythema indexes were presented at the same time. The averages of these data were shown according to gender, age, body parts, and correlations among the melanin and erythema indexes and L*a*b* color coordinates, and then they were analyzed.

While the correlation of the melanin index with the L* value was negative, it was positively correlated with the a* and b* values. While the erythema index showed a weak correlation with the b* value, its correlation was negative with the L* value and positive with the a* value. Our method of skin color measurement is useful.

Historical features did not differ among groups except for duration of symptoms. Of 13 patients with testicular torsion all had a tender testicle and an absent cremasteric reflex. When compared with the testicular torsion group, fewer patients with epididymitis had a tender testicle (69%) or an absent cremasteric reflex (14%). 62 (97%) patients with epididymitis had a tender epididymis and 43 (67%) had scrotal erythema/edema.

The multistage random sampling method was used and states and local government areas were already selected by virtue of their known status for iodine deficiency disorders (IDD). Schools were randomly chosen in each local government area and children aged 8-12 years in each school were determined. A percentage of the children was then included in the study to give a sample size greater than the minimum number allotted to the school. A total of 2372 schoolchildren (1420 males and 952 females) in 11 local government areas were examined; urine samples were collected from 537 children and analysed for urinary excretion of iodine. The method known as the Sandell-Kolthoff reaction was adopted, in which the iodide in the urine samples catalyses the reduction of ceric ammonium sulphate (yellow colour) to the cerous form (colourless) in the presence of arsenious acid. The degree of reduction in colour intensity of the yellow ceric ammonium sulphate is proportional to the iodine content in the urine sample. : The results from this study show that the median urinary iodine excretion for this sampled population in Nigeria, drawn mostly from IDD-endemic areas, is 14.65 microgram dl-1 with a mean value of 13.39 microgram dl-1. : This finding would suggest that Nigeria, in general terms, has achieved the goal of universal salt iodisation and should now focus its attention on constant monitoring in order to sustain this iodisation level.

948,948,22967157,"Simulation-based training, research and quality initiatives are expanding in pediatric anesthesiology just as in other medical specialties. Various modalities are available, from task trainers to standardized patients, and from computer-based simulations to mannequins. Computer-controlled mannequins can simulate pediatric vital signs with reasonable reliability; however the fidelity of skin temperature and color change, airway reflexes and breath and heart sounds remains rudimentary. Current pediatric mannequins are utilized in simulation centers, throughout hospitals in-situ, at national meetings for continuing medical education and in research into individual and team performance. Ongoing efforts by pediatric anesthesiologists dedicated to using simulation to improve patient care and educational delivery will result in further dissemination of this technology. Health care professionals who provide complex, subspecialty care to children require a curriculum supported by an active learning environment where skills directly relevant to pediatric care can be developed. The approach is not only the most effective method to educate adult learners, but meets calls for education reform and offers the potential to guide efforts toward evaluating competence. Simulation addresses patient safety imperatives by providing a method for trainees to develop skills and experience in various management strategies, without risk to the health and life of a child.

We established a multi-color CD34 assay containing CD133, CD45RA, CD10, CD38 and CD33. We examined PBSC, donor bone marrow (BMd) and BM of patients 1 year after allografting (BM1y) regarding their CD34 subset composition, which differed significantly amongst those materials: the early CD45RA(-)CD133(+)CD38(low) subpopulations were significantly more frequent in PBSC than in BMd, and very low in BM1y. Vice versa, clearly more committed CD34 stages prevailed in BM, particularly in BM1y where the proportion of multi-lymphoid and CD38(++) B-lymphoid precursors was highest (mean 59%). CD33 was expressed at different intensity on CD45RA(±)CD133(±) subsets allowing discrimination of earlier from more committed myeloid precursors. Compared with conventional CD34(+) cell enumeration, the presented multi-color phenotyping is a qualitative approach defining different CD34 subtypes in any CD34 source.

950,950,32406115,"We have recently argued that, because microbes have pervasive - often vital - influences on our lives, and that therefore their roles must be taken into account in many of the decisions we face, society must become microbiology-literate, through the introduction of relevant microbiology topics in school curricula (Timmis et al. 2019. Environ Microbiol 21: 1513-1528). The current coronavirus pandemic is a stark example of why microbiology literacy is such a crucial enabler of informed policy decisions, particularly those involving preparedness of public-health systems for disease outbreaks and pandemics. However, a significant barrier to attaining widespread appreciation of microbial contributions to our well-being and that of the planet is the fact that microbes are seldom visible: most people are only peripherally aware of them, except when they fall ill with an infection. And it is disease, rather than all of the positive activities mediated by microbes, that colours public perception of 'germs' and endows them with their poor image. It is imperative to render microbes visible, to give them life and form for children (and adults), and to counter prevalent misconceptions, through exposure to imagination-capturing images of microbes and examples of their beneficial outputs, accompanied by a balanced narrative. This will engender automatic mental associations between everyday information inputs, as well as visual, olfactory and tactile experiences, on the one hand, and the responsible microbes/microbial communities, on the other hand. Such associations, in turn, will promote awareness of microbes and of the many positive and vital consequences of their actions, and facilitate and encourage incorporation of such consequences into relevant decision-making processes. While teaching microbiology topics in primary and secondary school is key to this objective, a strategic programme to expose children directly and personally to natural and managed microbial processes, and the results of their actions, through carefully planned class excursions to local venues, can be instrumental in bringing microbes to life for children and, collaterally, their families. In order to encourage the embedding of microbiology-centric class excursions in current curricula, we suggest and illustrate here some possibilities relating to the topics of food (a favourite pre-occupation of most children), agriculture (together with horticulture and aquaculture), health and medicine, the environment and biotechnology. And, although not all of the microbially relevant infrastructure will be within reach of schools, there is usually access to a market, local food store, wastewater treatment plant, farm, surface water body, etc., all of which can provide opportunities to explore microbiology in action. If children sometimes consider the present to be mundane, even boring, they are usually excited with both the past and the future so, where possible, visits to local museums (the past) and research institutions advancing knowledge frontiers (the future) are strongly recommended, as is a tapping into the natural enthusiasm of local researchers to leverage the educational value of excursions and virtual excursions. Children are also fascinated by the unknown, so, paradoxically, the invisibility of microbes makes them especially fascinating objects for visualization and exploration. In outlining some of the options for microbiology excursions, providing suggestions for discussion topics and considering their educational value, we strive to extend the vistas of current class excursions and to: (i) inspire teachers and school managers to incorporate more microbiology excursions into curricula; (ii) encourage microbiologists to support school excursions and generally get involved in bringing microbes to life for children; (iii) urge leaders of organizations (biopharma, food industries, universities, etc.) to give school outreach activities a more prominent place in their mission portfolios, and (iv) convey to policymakers the benefits of providing schools with funds, materials and flexibility for educational endeavours beyond the classroom.

The diagnosis is usually confirmed by histopathology. Most of GCTs are benign, but some lesions may exhibit malignant criteria. This study is a retrospective case series including all children with histopathologically documented multiple GCTs who attended the dermatology department of the university hospitals between February 2008 and March 2021. The objective of our study was to raise awareness to this unrecognized and rare entity in such age group. The study included 9 patients (6 girls and 3 boys) with multiple GCTs. Their age ranged between 5 and 13 years. The lesions were skin-colored to light brown, firm, smooth-surfaced nodules. Most of the lesions were on the extremities, and their mean diameter was 160.5 mm2. None of the lesions exhibited any malignant criteria on histopathology. No extracutaneous or mucosal lesions were detected. Dermatologists should be aware of this rare condition in children because early recognition allows more conservative resection of the tumor and less invasive reconstruction of the defect.

953,953,9239294,"The objective of this study was to determine the nutritional quality of the pasta described above. The work was unique in the following aspects: 1) the drying process was a nonconventional method, consisting of a high-temperature short-time (HTST) process; 2) the nutritional quality of the wheat pasta was improved by the cowpea supplementation. Cowpea was especially chosen due to it being a staple food in the diet of the people in Northeast Brazil. Benefits attributed to the HTST drying process include a reduction in bacterial counts, shorter processing time and less energy consumption. In addition, there are reports in the literature of improved pasta firmness, color intensity, and cooking characteristics, when non Triticum durum materials plus drying are used. The pasta produced in this work was made using 100% soft wheat flour (SP), and soft wheat flour (SF) mixed supplemented with 10, 20 and 30% dehulled cowpea meal (CM); referred to as 10, 20 and 30% SP, respectively. The methods utilized in this project included: AACC methods for proximate analyses and trypsin inhibitor activity determination, atomic absorption spectrophotometry for mineral determination, a dye binding procedure for measuring available lysine, HPLC for amino acid quantification., FAO/WHO amino acid scoring patterns for chemical scores and AOAC for protein digestibility. The protein content of the past as supplemented with CM ranged from 11.3 to 14.2%, while the 100% SF pasta (SP) contained 10.9%. CM supplementation resulted in 52 to 113% more total lysine, and 26 to 82% more available lysine in the CM pasta compared to the SP. Chemical scores for SP were 45 and 59% for preschool and school-age children, respectively. Adding 30% CM to SP improved the above chemical scores to 89 and 100+, respectively. However, the addition of CM compromised the in vitro protein digestibility of SP from 4 to 6%. The addition fo 30% CM provided the SP with greater calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu): 44, 49, 91 and 402% respectively. Cooking the CM pasta resulted in a 50 to 90% retention of mineral content, with the greatest loss being for Cu. In the cooked 30% CM pasta, the contents of Fe, Zn and Ca were, respectively, 50, 67 and 243% greater than their content in the cooked SP.

Very little is known about the normal reaction of the growing heart to endurance stress. For this study, 26 healthy children (18 males) with a mean age of 12.61 years (range, 7.92-16.42 years) took part in an age-adapted triathlon circuit. The athletes were investigated by two-dimensional (2D) echocardiographic/speckle tracking, M-mode, pulse-wave Doppler, color Doppler, and color-coded tissue Doppler at 2-4 weeks before and immediately after the race. After the competition, cardiac output increased, mediated by an increase in heart rate and not by an elevated preload, according the Frank-Starling mechanism. Two-dimensional speckle tracking showed a reduced longitudinal strain in the right and left ventricles and additionally reduced circumferential strain in the left ventricle. The late diastolic inflow velocities were increased in both ventricles, indicating reduced diastolic function due to an impairment of myocardial relaxation. Immediately after endurance exercise, systolic and diastolic functions were attenuated in children and adolescents. In contrast to adult studies, this study could show a heart rate-mediated increase in cardiac output. The sequelae of these alterations are unclear, and the growing heart especially may be more susceptible to myocardial damage caused by intense endurance stress.

960,960,36113530,"Racism is a social determinant of health inequities. In Brazil, racial injustices lead to poor outcomes in maternal and child health for Black and Indigenous populations, including greater risks of pregnancy-related complications; decreased access to antenatal, delivery, and postnatal care; and higher childhood mortality rates. In this study, we aimed to estimate inequalities in childhood mortality rates by maternal race and skin colour in a cohort of more than 19 million newborns in Brazil. We did a nationwide population-based, retrospective cohort study using linked data on all births and deaths in Brazil between Jan 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2018. The data consisted of livebirths followed up to age 5 years, death, or Dec 31, 2018. Data for livebirths were extracted from the National Information System for livebirths, SINASC, and for deaths from the Mortality Information System, SIM. The final sample consisted of complete data for all cases regarding maternal race and skin colour, and no inconsistencies were present between date of birth and death after linkage. We fitted Cox proportional hazard regression models to calculate the crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the association between maternal race and skin colour and all-cause and cause-specific younger than age 5 mortality rates, by age subgroups. We calculated the trend of HRs (and 95% CI) by time of observation (calendar year) to indicate trends in inequalities. From the 20 526 714 livebirths registered in SINASC between Jan 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2018, 238 436 were linked to death records identified from SIM. After linkage, 1 010 871 records were excluded due to missing data on maternal race or skin colour or inconsistent date of death. 19 515 843 livebirths were classified by mother's race, of which 224 213 died.

The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of transperineal/transabdominal sonography in the diagnosis of vaginal foreign bodies were 81%, 53%, 82%, and 51%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of transabdominal sonography were 33%, 49%, 63%, and 21%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of transperineal sonography were 64%, 49%, 77%, and 33%, respectively. Abnormal findings were detected using x-ray in only 43 of the 181 cases (23.7%). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of x-ray were 24%, 91%, 88%, and 31%, respectively. The size of the foreign bodies ranged from 2 mm to 35 mm. For foreign bodies larger than 5 mm, the rate of sonographic accuracy reached 100%. For foreign bodies smaller than 5 mm, 32 false positive results, and 34 false negative results were identified. One hundred thirty-nine of 181 foreign bodies were less than 2 cm from the vaginal orifice (77%). All foreign bodies were hyperechoic compared with adjacent tissues. Some vaginal foreign bodies had characteristic echo patterns. With the exception of 1 patient with a detained AAA battery that caused vaginal ulceration, the other patients had a full recovery. Vaginal foreign bodies were hyperechoic compared with adjacent tissues and often had characteristic echo patterns. The use of combined transperineal and transabdominal ultrasonography might be helpful in diagnosing foreign bodies, especially when the size of the foreign body is larger than 5 mm. Therefore, ultrasonography might be preferred for the initial evaluation of suspected vaginal foreign bodies, because it is a noninvasive, radiation-free, and inexpensive technique.

A standardized definition of exacerbation could improve clinical care and research. To formulate a clinically useful definition of pulmonary exacerbation for pediatric non-CF bronchiectasis. A cohort of 69 children with non-CF bronchiectasis was prospectively followed for 900 child-months. The changes in clinical, systemic, and lung function parameters from 81 exacerbations were statistically evaluated using conditional logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic, sensitivity, specificity, and positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) to formulate a definition of a pulmonary exacerbation. Formation of major and minor criteria was statistically based and models were developed. Wet cough and cough severity (score ≥ 2) over 72-hr were the best predictors of an exacerbation with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 (95% CI 0.79-0.92) and 0.84 (95% CI 0.77-0.91), respectively. Sputum color, chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and chest signs were significant though minor criteria. Inclusion of serum C-reactive protein, amyloid-A, and IL6 to the definition improved its specificity and PPV. Our final combined model consisted of one major with one investigatory criterion (PPV 91%, NPV 72%); two major criteria (PPV 79%, NPV 91%); or one major and two minor criteria (PPV 79%, NPV 94%). Pulmonary exacerbation in children with non-CF bronchiectasis can be validly predicted using a standardized assessment of clinical features, with additional systemic markers improving predictive values.

In C5orf42-mutant patients, the infratentorial magnetic resonance (MR) images showed normal or minimally thickened and minimally elongated superior cerebellar peduncles (SCP), normal or minimally deepened interpeduncular fossa (IF), and mild vermian hypoplasia (VH). However, in other patients, all had severe abnormalities in the SCP and IF, and moderate to marked VH. Supratentorial abnormalities were found in one individual in other JBTS. In JBTS with all mutations, color-coded FA maps showed the absence of decussation of the SCP (DSCP). The morphological neuroimaging findings in C5orf42-mutant JBTS were distinctly mild and made diagnosis difficult.

We evaluated the clinical utility of a modified pediatric MTNS with children and adolescents. Study Design Case series with chart review. Setting Tertiary care children's hospital. Subjects and Methods This is a retrospective chart review of 46 patients ≤18 years of age presenting with a solitary or dominant thyroid nodule treated with surgical resection between September 2008 and December 2015. The cumulative MTNS for each nodule was calculated and compared with the final pathology. Results Of 46 patients, 10 (21.7%) were diagnosed with well-differentiated thyroid cancer (80% papillary thyroid carcinoma, 10% follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma, 10% follicular thyroid carcinoma). Malignant nodules were associated with a greater mean MTNS (benign, 5.72 ± 3.03; malignant, 16 ± 3.13; P < .05). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of malignancy were 100%, 94.4%, and 83.3% for scores ≥10 and 80%, 100%, and 100% for scores ≥11, respectively. In nodules with indeterminate cytology (Bethesda III and IV), the pediatric MTNS showed good differentiation between benign and malignant disease, with mean scores of 7.95 and 12.5, respectively ( P = .006). Conclusion This pilot study suggests that a comprehensive scoring system may help assess the risk of malignancy in pediatric thyroid nodules and differentiate nodules with indeterminate cytology into higher- and lower-risk categories.

The bowel wall thickness, wall echotexture and location of the involved portion were all recorded by grey scale ultrasound, while the presence of an intramural colour Doppler flow and arterial signal was evaluated by colour Doppler ultrasound. The colour Doppler flow was graded as ""absent"", ""mild"", or ""abundant"", and the resistive index was also calculated. Bowel wall thickening was observed in the bowel diseases demonstrating inflammation, vasculitis and ischaemia. Patients with ischaemia were significantly older than those with inflammation. The difference in bowel wall thickness was not significant among the disease categories. Differences in bowel wall echotexture, colour Doppler flow, arterial signal and resistive index among the disease categories were significant. The absence of a colour Doppler flow and of an arterial signal suggested ischaemia, while in younger patients, an abundant colour Doppler flow and a stratified echotexture suggested inflammation. The mean resistive index in the ischemic group was significantly higher than that in the inflammatory group.

Hypothesis With short-course training, clinical officers can accurately screen for rheumatic heart disease using focussed echocardiography. A total of eight clinical officers completed three half-days of didactics and 2 days of hands-on echocardiography training. Clinical officers were evaluated by performing screening echocardiograms on 20 children with known rheumatic heart disease status. They indicated whether children should be referred for follow-up. Referral was indicated if mitral regurgitation measured more than 1.5 cm or there was any measurable aortic regurgitation. The κ statistic was calculated to measure referral agreement with a paediatric cardiologist. Sensitivity and specificity were estimated using a generalised linear mixed model, and were calculated on the basis of World Heart Federation diagnostic criteria. The mean κ statistic comparing clinical officer referrals with the paediatric cardiologist was 0.72 (95% confidence interval: 0.62, 0.82). The κ value ranged from a minimum of 0.57 to a maximum of 0.90.

There are no studies on the reliability of this system nor on whether skin colour can influence applicability. This study aims to determine the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of the CGS to assess whether this scale could be used as a universal grading system across all skin colours. A survey consisting of 134 anonymised photographs of pin-site infections was sent out to orthopaedic surgeons specialising in limb lengthening and reconstruction and to patients or carers of individuals who had external fixators. For each photograph, the participants were asked to grade the infection using the CGS, rate their confidence in their chosen grade on a Likert scale and assign a treatment option. The participants were supplied with the CGS at the beginning of the survey, after the 45th and 90th photographs. The inter-rater reliability of the CGS between the surgeons, expressed as an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), was poor-to-moderate at both time points (ICC = 0.56 for baseline survey and ICC = 0.48 for follow-up). This was similar for the patient or caretaker group. There was a lower inter-rater reliability for grading of dark skin as opposed to light skin by surgeons but not for patients or caretakers. The inter-rater reliability of treatment decisions between the surgeons was poor at both time points (kappa = 0.30 and 0.22) with similar inter-rater reliability for dark (kappa = 0.26 and 0.23) compared with light skin (kappa = 0.29 and 2.6). This was similar for the patient or caretaker group. The surgeons' confidence (Table 4) in grading was low (median = 1). The patient or caretaker group's confidence in their grading was modest (median = 2).

This national survey aims to raise awareness of the PTC in paediatrics and contribute to a better understanding of age-related characteristics. Over 1 year (January-December 2008) new cases of PTC in childhood and adolescence from all paediatric hospitals in Germany were collected by the German Paediatric Surveillance Unit for rare diseases (ESPED). With a total of 61 cases, an annual incidence of 0.5 per 100 000 children <18 years was found. Children of all age groups were affected. A female preponderance and obesity was only found in adolescents. Clinical presentation was variable. Headaches represent the most common symptom affecting prepubertal children less frequently. A wide range of vision problems could be documented (papilledema, visual loss, double vision, visual field defects, disturbed colour and stereo vision). In 10 patients no papilledema was found. Comorbidities were reported in 23% of patients. 14 children gained remission after lumbar puncture without medication. Acetazolamide was the drug of choice, with relatively low dosages used. Escalation strategies were variable. 2 patients were treated invasively (sinus venous stent, LP shunt). PTC in childhood and adolescence appears to be as frequent as in the general population. Unspecific clinical characteristics and the broad spectrum of ophthalmologic findings emphasize the importance of a skilful neuroophthalmological investigation. Inconsistent therapeutic approaches are most likely due to a lack of diagnostic and therapeutic standards.

This study attempts to assess pediatric prescriber information needs for drug-drug interactions (DDIs) alerts and to evaluate the optimal presentation timing and presentation in the medication ordering process. Six case scenarios presented interactions between medications used in pediatric specialties of general medicine, infectious disease, cardiology, and neurology. Timing varied to include alert interruption at medication selection versus order submission; or was noninterruptive. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and independently analyzed to derive central themes. Fourteen trainee and attending clinicians trained in pediatrics, cardiology, and neurology participated. Coders derived 8 central themes from 929 quotes. Discordance exists between medication prescribing frequency and DDI knowledge; providers may commonly prescribe medications for which they do not recognize DDIs. Providers wanted alerts at medication selection rather than at order signature. Alert presentation themes included standardizing text, providing interaction-specific incidence/risk information, DDI rating scales, consolidating alerts, and providing alternative therapies. Providers want alerts to be actionable, for example, allowing medication discontinuation and color visual cues for essential information. Despite alert volume, participants did not ""mind being reminded because there is always the chance that at that particular moment (they) do not remember it"" and acknowledged the importance of alerts as ""essential in terms of patient safety.""

Literature review using PubMed, cross-referenced article citations, and the Internet. The history of corticosteroid use in clinical medicine has been colorful, noisy, and always controversial. Therapeutic corticosteroid indications that initially seemed rational have frequently been refuted on closer, rigorous clinical trial inspection. Although it may be prudent to provide stress-dose steroids to children with septic shock who are clinically at risk for adrenal insufficiency (chronic or recent steroid use, purpura fulminans, etomidate or ketoconazole administration, hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal disease), the safety and efficacy of stress-dose steroids as general adjunctive therapy for pediatric septic shock have not been established. Glucocorticoid administration does add potential risk to critically ill children. In particular, although adjunctive corticosteroids may hasten resolution of unstable hemodynamics in septic shock, this may occur at the metabolic cost of hyperglycemia. Clinical practice that fosters innovative therapy (off-label use) over research probably represents bad medical and social policy. Accordingly, pediatric critical care researchers have a responsibility to generate pediatric-specific evidence-based medicine for adjunctive corticosteroid therapy for severe sepsis in children.

Unfortunately, however, the actual descriptions are commonly penetrated with, and sometimes even motivated by, cultural norms and preferences, a problem that has colored scientific theorizing about behavioral control-the key concept for many psychological health interventions. We argue that ideologies have clouded our scientific thinking about mental health in two ways: by considering the societal utility of individuals and their behavior a key criterion for distinguishing between healthy and unhealthy people, and by dividing what actually seem to be continuous functions relating psychological and neurocognitive underpinnings to human behavior into binary, discrete categories that are then taken to define clinical phenomena. We suggest letting both traditions go and establish a health psychology that restrains from imposing societal values onto individuals, and then taking the fit between behavior and values to conceptualize unhealthiness. Instead, we promote a health psychology that reconstructs behavior that is considered to be problematic from well-understood mechanistic underpinnings of human behavior.

998,998,38969555,"The Set Brave Goals app is the first digital health app (DHA) aimed at helping children with spina bifida (SB) aged 8-17 years old to select and track their urinary and fecal continence goals. Developed by children, parents, providers and researchers, its usability, or appropriateness to a purpose (""user-friendliness""), remains unknown. In an alpha testing stage, our aim was to determine the usability of the app prior to clinical use. We recruited children with SB and their parents in clinic and via social media. A recruitment goal of 10 children exceeded industry standard of 5 participants (10 participants are expected to identify approximately 96% of usability problems). Participants downloaded and used the app for a week. They completed a questionnaire, including the System Usability Scale (SUS) and closed and open-ended questions. The SUS is a 10-item validated usability questionnaire most widely used in DHA usability testing (scores range from 0 to 100, 100 representing greatest usability). Median/mean SUS scores for DHAs are 68. Mann-Whitney-U and t-tests were used. Ten children with SB participated (median age: 14 years old, 6 female, 8 shunted, 8 using bladder catheterizations). Twenty parents participated (17 mothers, median age: 42 years old). Median SUS score was 77.5 for children and 73.8 for parents, corresponding to ""good"" to ""excellent"" usability (Summary Figure). There were no significant differences between child/parent scores (p = 0.69) or those for other DHAs (p = 0.11). It took a median 5-10 min to go through the app (2 parents felt it took too much time). All participants felt the app was easy to understand and use (100%). Most participants would recommend it to children and parents (children: 89%, parents: 80%), and believed it would be valuable to children (90%, 75%) and urologists (80%, 80%). Free text responses related to more varied color schemes, keeping free-text notes within the app and more flexible goal/alarm setting. These changes were incorporated into the app. Usability testing prior to clinical launch identified areas for app improvement. Although this study sample met industry standards, findings are limited by a small group of participants. The app will undergo further refinement during prospective beta testing. The Set Brave Goals app for children with SB has acceptable usability parameters. This justifies proceeding with wider use to formalize children's continence goal setting/tracking and testing its value to children with SB and their healthcare providers.

999,999,27029239,"Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is the largest cardiac cause of morbidity and mortality in the world's youth. Early detection of RHD through echocardiographic screening in asymptomatic children may identify an early stage of disease, when secondary prophylaxis has the greatest chance of stopping disease progression. Latent RHD signifies echocardiographic evidence of RHD with no known history of acute rheumatic fever and no clinical symptoms. Determine the prevalence of latent RHD among children ages 5-16 in Lilongwe, Malawi. This is a cross-sectional study in which children ages 5 through 16 were screened for RHD using echocardiography. Screening was conducted in 3 schools and surrounding communities in the Lilongwe district of Malawi between February and April 2014. Children were diagnosed as having no, borderline, or definite RHD as defined by World Heart Federation criteria. The primary reader completed offline reads of all studies. A second reader reviewed all of the studies diagnosed as RHD, plus a selection of normal studies. A third reader served as tiebreaker for discordant diagnoses. The distribution of results was compared between gender, location, and age categories using Fisher's exact test. The prevalence of latent RHD was 3.4% (95% CI = 2.45, 4.31), with 0.7% definite RHD and 2.7% borderline RHD. There was no significant differences in prevalence between gender (P = .44), site (P = .6), urban vs. peri-urban (P = .75), or age (P = .79). Of those with definite RHD, all were diagnosed because of pathologic mitral regurgitation (MR) and 2 morphologic features of the mitral valve. Of those with borderline RHD, most met the criteria by having pathological MR (92.3%). Malawi has a high rate of latent RHD, which is consistent with other results from sub-Saharan Africa. This study strongly supports the need for a RHD prevention and control program in Malawi.

1000,1000,33248659,"Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in blood samples can be used as useful biomarkers to diagnose various human diseases. This study describes the potential of a paper-based sensor array for detecting leukemia using blood VOCs. Blood samples were collected from 59 new leukemia cases and 47 healthy cases as a control group. Each blood sample was divided into two parts; one for a laboratory test and the other was used in our study. Samples were mixed with heparin and then transferred to a sterile container, and a sensor was stacked on its cap. This sensor array contains 16 nanoparticles deposited on a sheet of hydrophobic paper in a 4 × 4 array format. Containers were stored in an oven at 60 °C for 4.5 h. Then, the image of sensors was recorded by a scanner and compared to the image before exposing the blood vapor. The sensor responses were subjected to different multivariate statistical methods to develop models that discriminate between control and leukemia samples. The interaction of nanoparticles with the volatile metabolome of blood caused aggregation and consequently changing in the color of nanoparticles. The color changes resulted in a specific pattern for blood samples with leukemia, which is different from those obtained from healthy specimens. The discrimination analysis was approved by pattern recognition methods such as principal component analysis with 97% accuracy. Among 59 patients, the mean age was 6.02 ± 4.55 years (range 1-16 y). The mean total response was 652.83 ± 117.02. The rock curve showed an accuracy of 96% for classifying patients from the control group. The logistic regression model showed that 93.6% of healthy and 93.2% of patients were classified correctly by using this method. These statistics agree with the classification results obtained by principal component analysis. For every 5000-unit increase in platelet count, the chance of leukemia decreased by 9%. Additionally, the chance of being categorized as a patient decreased by 10% for every 20-unit increase in total response. The electronic nose using VOC's of blood is a non-invasive and inexpensive tool for detecting new cases of leukemia with high sensitivity and specificity. Platelet count is an essential para-clinical parameter determining the total response of the sensors. Follow up studies with a larger sample size are warranted to elucidate its clinical applicability.
