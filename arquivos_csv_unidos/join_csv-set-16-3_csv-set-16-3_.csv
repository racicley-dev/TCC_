2,2,36639598,"Patient-reported Outcome (PRO) measures may be used as the basis for out-patient follow-up instead of fixed appointments. The patients attend follow-up from home by filling in questionnaires developed for that specific aim and patient group (telePRO). The questionnaires are handled in real time by a specific algorithm, which assigns an outcome color reflecting clinical need. The specific questionnaires and algorithms (named solutions) are constructed in a consensus process with clinicians. We aimed to describe AmbuFlex' telePRO solutions and the algorithm outcomes and variation between patient groups, and to discuss possible applications and challenges. TelePRO solutions with more than 100 processed questionnaires were included in the analysis. Data were retrieved together with data from national registers. Characteristics of patients, questionnaires and outcomes were tabulated for each solution. Graphs were constructed depicting the overall and within-patient distribution of algorithm outcomes for each solution. From 2011 to 2021, 29 specific telePRO solutions were implemented within 24 different ICD-10 groups. A total of 42,015 patients were referred and answered 171,268 questionnaires. An existing applicable instrument with cut-off values was available for four solutions, whereas items were selected or developed ad hoc for the other solutions. Mean age ranged from 10.7 (Pain in children) to 73.3 years (chronic kidney disease). Mortality among referred patients varied between 0 (obesity, asthma, endometriosis and pain in children) and 528 per 1000 patient years (Lung cancer). There was substantial variation in algorithm outcome across patient groups while different solutions within the same patient group varied little. TelePRO can be applied in diseases where PRO can reflect clinical status and needs. Questionnaires and algorithms should be adapted for the specific patient groups and clinical aims. When PRO is used as replacement for clinical contact, special carefulness should be observed with respect to patient safety.

3,3,28550741,"Syndrome differentiation (SD) results in a diagnostic conclusion based on a cluster of concurrent symptoms and signs, including pulse form and tongue color. In Korea, there is a strong interest in the standardization of Traditional Medicine (TM). In order to standardize TM treatment, standardization of SD should be given priority. The aim of this study was to explore the SD, or symptom clusters, of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) using non-negative factorization methods and k-means clustering analysis. We screened 80 patients and enrolled 73 eligible patients. One TM dermatologist evaluated the symptoms/signs using an existing clinical dataset from patients with AD. This dataset was designed to collect 15 dermatologic and 18 systemic symptoms/signs associated with AD. Non-negative matrix factorization was used to decompose the original data into a matrix with three features and a weight matrix. The point of intersection of the three coordinates from each patient was placed in three-dimensional space. With five clusters, the silhouette score reached 0.484, and this was the best silhouette score obtained from two to nine clusters. Patients were clustered according to the varying severity of concurrent symptoms/signs. Through the distribution of the null hypothesis generated by 10,000 permutation tests, we found significant cluster-specific symptoms/signs from the confidence intervals in the upper and lower 2.5% of the distribution. Patients in each cluster showed differences in symptoms/signs and severity. In a clinical situation, SD and treatment are based on the practitioners' observations and clinical experience. SD, identified through informatics, can contribute to development of standardized, objective, and consistent SD for each disease.

The objective was to investigate the association between TSH and lipid profiles. We used a population-based cross-sectional study design and analyzed our results using multivariable regression models. The study was conducted in Germany. We analyzed data from 6622 children (ages 3-10 y) and 6134 adolescents (ages 11-17 y) drawn from the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS). Not applicable. Blood samples were collected, and serum TSH levels were measured using the electrochemiluminescence method. High and low serum TSH levels were defined according to age-specific reference limits for the assay. Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride levels were determined with enzymatic color analyses. We found a significant positive association between TSH and all non-HDL parameters (total cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglycerides) in children (β = 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53-1.27; β = 0.78, 95% CI, 0.44-1.13; and β = 0.90, 95% CI, 0.52-1.27, respectively) and in adolescents (β = 0.90, 95% CI, 0.47-1.32; β = 0.67, 95% CI, 0.29-1.05; and β = 0.92, 95% CI, 0.49-1.35, respectively) (P < .05).

We aimed to evaluate neurocognitive functions associated with lead in the blood and the interactions between lead and dopaminergic or noradrenergic pathway-related genotypes in youths with ADHD. A total of 259 youths with ADHD and 96 healthy controls (aged 5-18 years) enrolled in this study. The Korean Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime version was conducted for psychiatric diagnostic evaluation. Blood lead levels were measured, and their interaction with dopaminergic or noradrenergic genotypes for ADHD; namely, the dopamine transporter (DAT1), dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4), and alpha-2A-adrenergic receptor (ADRA2A) genotypes were investigated. All participants were assessed using the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS). Participants also completed the continuous performance test (CPT) and Stroop Color-Word Test (SCWT). Analysis of covariance was used for comparison of blood lead levels between ADHD and control groups. A multivariable linear regression model was used to evaluate the associations of blood lead levels with the results of ADHD-RS, CPT, and SCWT; adjusted for intelligence quotient (IQ), age, and sex. A path analysis model was used to identify the mediating effects of neurocognitive functions on the effects of blood lead on ADHD symptoms. To evaluate the effect of the interaction between blood lead and genes on neuropsychological functions, hierarchical regression analyses were performed. There was a significant difference in blood lead levels between the ADHD and control groups (1.4 ± 0.5 vs. 1.3 ± 0.5 μg/dL, p = .005). Blood lead levels showed a positive correlation with scores on omission errors(r = .158, p = .003) and response time variability (r = .136, p = .010) of CPT. In the multivariable linear regression model, blood lead levels were associated with omission errors (B = 3.748, p = .045). Regarding the effects of lead on ADHD symptoms, hyperactivity-impulsivity was mediated by omission errors. An interaction effect was detected between ADRA2A DraI genotype and lead levels on omission errors (B = 5.066, p = .041).

Most of reports concerning the forehead flap in nasal reconstructions deal with adults. Nasal reconstruction in infants raises some controversies, and very few articles report nasal reconstruction in the infants. A 15-month-old boy was presented after subtotal nasal amputation, after a dog bite. Microsurgical replantation was performed, but proved unsuccessful. The wound healed with debridement and local care. At age 2, nasal reconstruction was performed with autogenous ear cartilage and forehead flap. The reconstructed nose currently appears to be of good color, texture match, and functional. To our knowledge, few reconstructions of acquired nasal deformities using a forehead flap have been previously reported in infants. This 2-year-old patient may be among the youngest to have undergone this procedure. The forehead flap can be applied in very young children with reasonable expectations of excellent functional and esthetic outcome.

In health care settings specifically, social work is the key workforce tasked with responding to patient and family psychosocial needs, both of which have increased substantially since the emergence of COVID-19. There is a need to understand ways in which hospital social workers' roles, responsibilities, and integration within interprofessional teams have evolved in response to these challenges. In this qualitative study, focus groups were conducted with 55 social workers employed across multiple settings in a large, urban, pediatric hospital in Spring 2020. Thematic analyses revealed salient superordinate themes related to the pandemic's impact on social work practice and social workers themselves, institutional facilitators and impediments to effective social work and interprofessional practice, and social work perspectives on future pandemic recovery efforts. Within each theme, a number of interrelated subthemes emerged elucidating nuances of telehealth adoption in the context of remote work, the salience of social determinants of health, and the critical role of social work in social justice oriented pandemic preparedness and response efforts.

As part of a prospective, comparative, 2-center intervention study in northern (63°N) and southern (55°N) Sweden, dietary intake, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (S-25(OH) D), associated laboratory variables, and sociodemographic data were studied in 5 to 7-year-old children with fair and dark skin in November and December. Two hundred six children with fair/dark skin were included, 44/41 and 64/57 children in northern and southern Sweden, respectively. Dietary vitamin D intake was higher in northern than southern Sweden (P = 0.001), irrespective of skin color, partly due to higher consumption of fortified foods, but only met 50-70% of national recommendations (10 μg/day). S-25(OH) D was higher in northern than southern Sweden, in children with fair (67 vs 59 nmol/L; P < 0.05) and dark skin (56 vs 42 nmol/L; P < 0.001).

Although specialty treatment programs are uniquely positioned to deliver prevention care to children of adult clients, these programs may have limited capacity to implement prevention and early intervention care services, particularly in racial and ethnic minority communities. We merged data from program surveys and client records collected in 2015 to examine the extent to which program capacity factors are associated with the odds of delivering prevention and early intervention services for children of adult clients attending outpatient SUD treatment in low-income minority communities in Los Angeles County, California. Our analytic sample consisted of 16,712 clients embedded in 82 programs. Our results show that 85% of these programs reported delivering prevention care services, while 71% of programs delivered early intervention services. Programs with organizational climates supporting change and those that served a high number of clients annually were more likely to implement both prevention and early intervention practices. Programs accepting Medicaid payments and serving clients whose primary drug was marijuana were more than three times as likely to implement prevention services. Overall, our findings suggest both program- and client-level characteristics are associated with delivering preventive care offered to children of adult clients receiving SUD treatment in communities of color. As Medicaid has become a major payor of SUD treatment services and marijuana use has been legalized in California, findings identify capacity factors to deliver public health prevention interventions in one of the nation's largest public SUD treatment systems.

To characterize our patient group, to provide additional information and insight into this malignancy. A 16-year retrospective medical records review (from 1992 to 2009) was conducted of patients with a diagnosis of hypopigmented mycosis fungoides. All patients were seen in the department of dermatology at Howard University Hospital, an outpatient clinic in an urban academic institution. The review comprised of 20 patients. Inclusion required presence of hypopigmented skin lesions and a skin biopsy diagnostic for hypopigmented mycosis fungoides. Treatment modalities, including oral psoralen with UVA, narrow-band UVB and/or topical medications such as nitrogen mustard and topical corticosteroids were employed. Patients ranged from 4 to 57 years old. Fifteen were African American, three African, one Afro-Caribbean and one Hispanic. The interval from disease onset to diagnosis ranged from 7 months to 24 years. Patients presented at Stage 1A or 1B. Treatment included phototherapy and topical medications. In four patients with pre- and post-treatment biopsies, the original histological diagnosis of hypopigmented mycosis fungoides and the subsequent complete resolution were shown. There was no associated mortality in the patients studied. Hypopigmented mycosis fungoides affected skin of colour patients in this study. This variant differs from classic mycosis fungoides: younger population, slower progression and the majority of patients remaining in Stage I with treatment.

Understanding the immune mechanisms involved in the development of inhibitors can provide valuable information about pathways to human tolerance. Recent evidence indicates that B regulatory (Breg) cells play a pivotal role in controlling the production of antibodies (Abs) while promoting follicular T helper (Tfh) cells and monocytes, expressing the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP/CD91), which is involved in FVIII intake from the circulation. We studied circulating levels of Breg cells along with Tfh cells and the expression of LRP/CD91 on monocytes in patients with hemophilia A using 8-color flow cytometry and cell culture. Compared to healthy controls, patients with hemophilia A with inhibitors showed a severe reduction in levels of Breg cells and produced less interleukin-10 when activated via the CD40 signaling pathway. In addition, patients with hemophilia A with inhibitors exhibited an overexpression of LPR/CD91 on monocytes and normal levels of Tfh cells. Levels of Breg cells were not significantly related to LPR/CD91 although negative associations were evidenced.

A series of linear mixture modeling were used to encompass the performance accuracy, reaction times, and extraneous movements during the tests. Our findings suggested that age plays a critical role, and older subjects showed improvements in KSWCT performance; however, no significant divergence in activity level between the subtypes (ADHD-I and ADHD-H/C) was established. Patients with ADHD-H/C showed tendencies toward deficits in motor planning and executive control, exhibited by shorter reaction times for incorrect responses and more difficulty suppressing erroneous responses.

One patient with a cyst in the right lower quadrant accompanying intussusception on ultrasonography of the abdomen underwent ultrasonography-guided reduction but the ultrasonographic findings persisted. On exploration, only cecal duplication cyst without intussusception was detected. Cecal resection including the cyst and end-to-end ileocolic anastomosis were performed. Ultrasonography, color Doppler ultrasonography, barium or hydrostatic enema and computed tomography are helpful in diagnosing intussusception, but patients with radiologic findings of intussusception should be evaluated on symptoms and clinical findings before surgical intervention. Also, other diseases mimicking intussusception should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis.

Clinical performance was evaluated with ROC analyses including 45 MPS patients. Intra-day and inter-day precisions were <5% and <11% (CV), respectively. LoD was 9.12mg/L and LoQ was 23.3mg/L. The highest reference values for urinary GAG excretion were determined in an age-specific manner. In the 2-13years age cohort, a cut-off of 89.86mg/g creatinine resulted in 98.07% sensitivity and 93.33% specificity. Proteinuria and hematuria interfered with analysis in some instances. Neither leukocyturia nor pH changes affected the assay. Stability analysis indicated that freezing urine samples for transfer is unnecessary. Of the 45 MPS patient samples evaluated, only three tested negative including MPS II, IVA and VI.

In this study, 21 patients with Wilson's disease and a control group of 20 age- and gender-matched healthy children were included. All the patients and the control group were evaluated with two-dimensional (2D) and colour-coded conventional transthoracic echocardiography by the same paediatric cardiologist using the same echocardiography machine (Vivid E9, GE Healthcare, Norway) in standard precordial positions, according to the American Society of Echocardiography recommendations. 2D strain and strain rate echocardiography were performed after the ECG probes of the echocardiography machine were adjusted for ECG monitoring. Longitudinal, transverse and radial strain, and strain rate were assessed from six basal and six mid-ventricular segments of the left ventricle, as recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography. Left ventricular wall thickness, systolic and diastolic diameters, left ventricular diameters normalised to body surface area, end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes, cardiac output and cardiac index values were within normal limits and statistically similar in the patient and control groups (p > 0.05). Global strain and strain rate: the patient group had a statistically significant lower peak A longitudinal velocity of the left basal point and peak E longitudinal velocity of the left basal (VAbasR) point, and higher global peak A longitudinal/circumferential strain rate (GSRa) compared to the corresponding values of the control group (p < 0.05). Radial strain and strain rate: end-systolic rotation [ROT (ES)] was statistically significantly lower in the patient group (p < 0.05). Longitudinal strain and strain rate: end-systolic longitudinal strain [SLSC (ES)] and positive peak transverse strain (STSR peak P) were statistically significantly lower in the patient group (p < 0.05). Segmental analysis showed that rotational strain measurement of the anterior and lateral segments of the patient group were statistically significantly lower than the corresponding values of the control group (p < 0.05). Segmental analysis showed statistically significantly lower values of endsystolic longitudinal strain [STSR (ES)] of the basal lateral (p < 0.05) and end-systolic longitudinal strain [SLSC (ES)] of the basal septal segment (p < 0.05) in the patient group. End-systolic longitudinal strain [SLSC (ES)] and positive peak transverse strain (STSR peak P) were statistically significantly lower in the patient group (p < 0.05). Segmental analysis showed statistically significantly lower values of endsystolic longitudinal strain [SLSC (ES)] of the mid-anterior and basal anterior segments (p < 0.05), end-systolic longitudinal strain [STSR (ES)] measurements of the posterior and mid-posterior segments, end-systolic longitudinal displacement [DLDC (ES)] of the basal posterior, mid-posterior and mid-antero-septal segments in the patient group.

The test was developed using a computer with Lotus Freelance Software, binoculars with prisms and colored filters. The subject looks through binoculars at the computer screen two meters away. For monocular vision, six concentric blue circles, a blue horizontal line and a tilted red line were displayed on the screen. For binocular vision, white circles replaced blue circles. The subject was asked to orient the lines parallel to each other. The difference in tilt (degrees) between the subjective parallel and fixed horizontal position is the torsional alignment of the eye. The time to administer the test was approximately two minutes. In 70 Normal subjects, average age 16 years, the mean degree of cyclodeviation tilt in the right eye was 0.6 degrees for monocular viewing conditions and 0.7 degrees for binocular viewing conditions, with a standard deviation of approximately one degree. There was no ""statistically significant"" difference between monocular and binocular viewing.

41,41,12637290,"To our knowledge, no method satisfactory for clinical use has been developed to visualize white matter fiber tracts with diffusion-weighted MR imaging. The purpose of this study was to determine whether superposition of a spin-echo T2-weighted image and a color-coded image derived from three orthogonal diffusion-weighted images could show fiber tract architecture of the brain with an image quality appropriate for accurate reading with a computer monitor. MR images from 50 consecutive cases were reviewed. Three diffusion-weighted images per section were acquired with three orthogonal motion-probing gradients. These images were registered to a corresponding spin-echo T2-weighted image. A color-coded image was synthesized from three diffusion-weighted images by assigning red, green, or blue to each diffusion-weighted image and then adding a spin-echo T2-weighted image with a weighting factor. The ability of the superposed image to delineate the white matter pathways was evaluated on the basis of the known anatomy of these pathways and qualitatively compared with that of the spin-echo T2-weighted image. The main white matter fiber pathways, in particular the superior longitudinal fascicle, corpus callosum, tapetum, optic radiation, and internal capsule, were more clearly and easily identified on the superposed image than on the spin-echo T2-weighted image. The time required to produce the superposed image was approximately 40 minutes. Superposition of a spin-echo T2-weighted image and a color-coded image created from three orthogonal diffusion-weighted images showed structures of the brain that were not clearly visible on the spin-echo T2-weighted image alone. Such superposition presents images that are easy to interpret correctly.

Real-time color Doppler sonography was used to study 21 patients with intrahepatic venous collaterals. The cause, distribution, and clinical manifestations of collaterals were determined, and Doppler waveforms obtained from the collaterals were also analyzed. First, the causes of intrahepatic venous collaterals were divided roughly into two groups according to the presence or absence of veno-occlusions. The former group included liver tumors (six cases), primary Budd-Chiari syndrome (five cases), and metastatic adrenal tumors invading the inferior vena cava (two cases). The latter group consisted of diaphragmatic hernia (three cases), Osler-Weber-Rendu disease (two cases), and congestive liver (one case). The cause was not determined in two cases. Second, venous collaterals were distributed throughout the entire liver in primary Budd-Chiari syndrome but localized in the other cases. Third, Doppler waveforms of the collaterals were divided into two patterns: flat flow and multiphasic flow. Flat flow pattern was seen in patients with veno-occlusive diseases, and multiphasic flow pattern was seen in patients without veno-occlusive disease. The relationship between intrahepatic venous collaterals and veno-occlusive diseases has been emphasized in the literature, but the results of our series showed that they occurred under a wide variety of conditions, even without veno-occlusive diseases, including diaphragmatic hernia and Osler-Weber-Rendu disease.

44,44,35852299,"There is a growing recognition in the fields of public health and medicine that social determinants of health (SDOH) play a key role in driving health inequities and disparities among various groups, such that a focus upon individual-level medical interventions will have limited effects without the consideration of the macro-level factors that dictate how effectively individuals can manage their health. While the health impacts of mass incarceration have been explored, less attention has been paid to how the ""war on drugs"" in the United States exacerbates many of the factors that negatively impact health and wellbeing, disproportionately impacting low-income communities and people of colour who already experience structural challenges including discrimination, disinvestment, and racism. The U.S. war on drugs has subjected millions to criminalisation, incarceration, and lifelong criminal records, disrupting or altogether eliminating their access to adequate resources and supports to live healthy lives. This paper examines the ways that ""drug war logic"" has become embedded in key SDOH and systems, such as employment, education, housing, public benefits, family regulation (commonly referred to as the child welfare system), the drug treatment system, and the healthcare system. Rather than supporting the health and wellbeing of individuals, families, and communities, the U.S. drug war has exacerbated harm in these systems through practices such as drug testing, mandatory reporting, zero-tolerance policies, and coerced treatment. We argue that, because the drug war has become embedded in these systems, medical practitioners can play a significant role in promoting individual and community health by reducing the impact of criminalisation upon healthcare service provision and by becoming engaged in policy reform efforts.

Late death occurred in 2 patients, and the actuarial survival rate was 92.0% at 15 years after operation. The freedom from reoperation was 91.3% at both 10 and 15 years after the initial operation. Postoperative color Doppler flow imaging was performed in 22 of the 23 survivors, and results showed no mitral regurgitation in 4, mild regurgitation in 14, and moderate regurgitation in 4 patients. Four patients presently have mitral stenosis, with a mean transmitral pressure gradient greater than 10 mm Hg. The residual lesion of moderate mitral regurgitation with or without mitral stenosis developed in 6 of 11 patients in whom bilateral mitral annuloplasty was applied after the initial operation. Nineteen of the 22 survivors without reoperation were in New York Heart Association class I, and 3 were in class II. Clinical improvement was observed after conservative mitral repair in most pediatric patients with ventricular septal defect. However, careful follow-up for growth potential still appears to be needed to detect changes in mitral regurgitation and the development of mitral stenosis after valve repair, especially after bilateral annuloplasty.

52,52,17698519,"Conventional MR imaging shows evidence of brain injury and/or maldevelopment in 70%-90% of children with cerebral palsy (CP), though its capability to identify specific white matter tract injury is limited. The great variability of white matter lesions in CP already demonstrated by postmortem studies is thought to be one of the reasons why response to treatment is so variable. Our hypothesis is that diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a suitable technique to provide in vivo characterization of specific white matter tract lesions in children with CP associated with periventricular leukomalacia (PVL). In this study, 24 children with CP associated with PVL and 35 healthy controls were evaluated with DTI. Criteria for identification of 26 white matter tracts on the basis of 2D DTI color-coded maps were established, and a qualitative scoring system, based on visual inspection of the tracts in comparison with age-matched controls, was used to grade the severity of abnormalities. An ordinal grading system (0=normal, 1=abnormal, 2=severely abnormal or absent) was used to score each white matter tract. There was marked variability in white matter injury pattern in patients with PVL, with the most frequent injury to the retrolenticular part of the internal capsule, posterior thalamic radiation, superior corona radiata, and commissural fibers. DTI is a suitable technique for in vivo assessment of specific white matter lesions in patients with PVL and, thus, a potentially valuable diagnostic tool. The tract-specific evaluation revealed a family of tracts that are highly susceptible in PVL, important information that can potentially be used to tailor treatment options in the future.

Mean follow-up was 9 years (range 7-13 years).

B-mode and color Doppler US evaluation included the site, location, size, shape, margins, presence of calcifications, echo structure and echogenicity. All patients had US-guided biopsy for histologic analysis. US-guided biopsy and histology confirmed the diagnosis of soft tissue hemangioma in 92 of the 97 lesions (94.8%). Histologic examination of the remaining five lesions showed nodular fasciitis (two lesions), endometriosis (one lesion), hemangioendothelioma (two lesions); US of these lesions showed variable size, irregular margins, and deep-seated location. Histologically documented soft tissue hemangiomas were most commonly superficial (74 lesions) and arteriovenous (45 lesions). Shape was most commonly oval (fusiform), margins were most commonly not well defined (irregular, hazing but circumscribed), phleboliths were more common in deep-seated lesions, echo structure was heterogeneous, and echogenicity was most commonly hyperechogen and involuting.

Prospective study of infants and children undergoing cardiac catheterization via FA access, comparing IRT and pulse examination. The thermograms, displayed in a color map with each pixel representing a temperature, were examined by qualitative assessment of symmetry in thermal patterns and quantitative image analysis with abnormal thermographic asymmetry defined as a difference of >10% between limbs. In the 20 children enrolled, excellent agreement was found between the two methods with a Kappa value of 0.89. The median thermographic asymmetry in the nine children with pulse loss was 36 (13-76)%. Using receiver operating characteristic analysis, the asymmetrical pattern of ≥18% between limbs predicted the need for anticoagulation with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 89%. The area under the curve was 0.97 (95% confidence interval: 0.95-1). Children with absent pulse requiring anticoagulation showed a slower recovery in thermal asymmetry compared to those with a reduced pulse. By qualitative IRT assessment, all children with absent pulse requiring anticoagulation were correctly identified by 10 independent assessors.

For all samples examined, the CD34-positive rate obtained using the histogram method was higher than that obtained using the SSC-FL method. This finding was probably due to the fact that some monocytes non-specifically reacted with anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody, and the histogram method could not distinguish these non-specifically stained cells from CD34-positive precursor cells. On the other hand, the SSC-FL method seemed to yield a more accurate measurement of the percentage of CD34-positive cells in PBSCH samples. Based on this finding, it is recommended that the histogram method, which is currently used at most commercial laboratories, be reviewed in favor of the SSC-FL method when the CD34-positive cell rate of PBSCH is to be determined.

60,60,36427479,"Abortion is common but highly stigmatized in the United States, and the overturning of Roe v. Wade severely restricted abortion access in many states across the nation. Data reveal that maternal morbidity and mortality are already increasing, and research suggests existing inequities in abortion access across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups will be exacerbated. Research has shown that social support (perceived and received aid from one's social network) and social capital (resources accessed through those social connections) can improve access to health services and decrease barriers to care. Given the escalating barriers to abortion, including longer travel distances, it is imperative to better understand the roles of social support and social capital within abortion access, especially for people living on lower incomes and people of color. Our team conducted in-depth interviews with post-abortion patients (n = 18) from an urban abortion clinic in Georgia in 2019 and 2020, shortly after a six-week gestational age abortion limit had been passed but before it was enacted. We examined how people described their social support and social capital - or lack thereof - when making decisions about their pregnancy and their ability to access abortion. We found that social support and social capital - economic support in particular - were key facilitators of both abortion access and parenting, but participants often experienced barriers to economic support within their social networks due to poverty, unstable partnerships, structural inequality, and abortion stigma. Women experienced constraints to their reproductive autonomy, wherein they had no alternatives but abortion. Our findings suggest that increased economic support and de-stigmatization of abortion are needed to improve reproductive autonomy. Our findings also indicate that restricting and outlawing abortion services is significantly detrimental to the well-being of pregnant people, their families and networks, and their communities by perpetuating cycles of poverty and deepening socioeconomic and racial/ethnic inequities.

For the female prepubertal post-treatment configuration, local increases in size were conspicuous also at the labiomental groove (approximately 6%). Male adolescent post-treatment configurations revealed increases in size in the nasal, mental, and labiomental groove regions (approximately 18%) with negative allometries associated with the upper and lower lips (approximately 20%). For the female adolescent post-treatment configuration, the labial fissure showed an increase in size (approximately 17%), whereas the upper and lower lips and symphyseal region exhibited negative allometries (approximately 5-15%). For shape change, all soft tissue post-treatment configurations were highly isotropic (uniform shape change) over the entire facial nodal mesh except in the areas of the labiomental region and the labial fissure.

The frequency of CD4+CD25+CD127lowFOXP3+ Tregs was higher in children with T1D compared to control children, and this change was attributable to a higher proportion of naïve Tregs in these subjects. Further longitudinal analyses demonstrated that the increase in Treg frequency correlated with disease onset. The frequencies of the minor subsets of CD25+FOXP3low memory Tregs as well as CD25lowCD127lowFOXP3+ Tregs were also increased in children with T1D. Moreover, the ratio of CCR6-CXCR3+ and CCR6+CXCR3- memory Tregs was altered and the frequency of proliferating Ki67-positive and IFN-γ producing memory Tregs was decreased in children with T1D. The frequency of CXCR5+FOXP3+ circulating follicular T regulatory cells was not altered in children with T1D. Importantly, none of the alterations observed in children with T1D were observed in autoantibody-positive at-risk children.

We conducted a survival analysis with individual data from population-based cancer registries including women with breast cancer diagnosed between 1996 and 2012 in Aracaju and Curitiba. The main outcomes were the excess mortality hazard (EMH) and net survival. The associations of age, year of diagnosis, disease stage, race/skin colour and socioeconomic status (SES) with the excess mortality hazard and net survival were analysed using multi-level spline regression models, modelled as cubic splines with knots at 1 and 5 years of follow-up. A total of 2045 women in Aracaju and 7872 in Curitiba were included in the analyses. The EMH was higher for women with lower SES and for black and brown women in both municipalities. The greatest difference in excess mortality was seen between the most deprived women and the most affluent women in Curitiba, hazard ratio (HR) 1.93 (95%CI 1.63-2.28). For race/skin colour, the greatest ratio was found in Curitiba (HR 1.35, 95%CI 1.09-1.66) for black women compared with white women. The most important socio-economic difference in net survival was seen in Aracaju. Age-standardised net survival at five years was 55.7% for the most deprived women and 67.2% for the most affluent. Net survival at eight years was 48.3% and 61.0%, respectively. Net survival in Curitiba was higher than in Aracaju in all SES groups.""

Therefore, the present research was conducted to assess the effect of yoga on the cognitive functions of female adolescents with low academic performance. The present study is a randomized control trial (RCT). Eighty-nine female students in the age range of 12-14 years were randomly assigned into two groups [yoga (n = 45); physical exercise (n = 44)] at a school setting. Both groups were assessed before and after on Raven's standard progressive matrices (RSPM), Corsi Block Tapping Test (CBTT), Six Letter Cancellation Test (SLCT), Digit Letter Substitution Test (DLST), Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC). Findings of the present study showed significant (p < .05) differences in scores of forward CBTT, SWCT, and SLCT in group × time interaction. Both the groups showed significant (p < .05) improvement in SLCT, backward scores of CBTT, and STAIC-T. All outcomes measured were significantly (p < .05) improved in the yoga group except STAIC-S.

In 2015, we partnered with the government in Shenzhen and attached the stool colour card (SCC) to the health handbook for mothers and children. These handbooks have been distributed through official channels to every pregnant woman in Shenzhen since 1 January 2015. A total of 118 patients diagnosed with BA at Shenzhen Children's Hospital were enrolled and divided into two cohorts based on their date of diagnosis: cohort A before and cohort B after introduction of screening. The cohorts were compared to evaluate differences in age at diagnosis, jaundice-free rate, 2-year native liver survival rate and so on. After the implementation of the screening programme, the age at diagnosis decreased from 81±12 to 56±15 days old (p<0.05), the incidence of postoperative complications decreased from 58.8% to 52.6% (p<0.05), the jaundice-free rate increased from 47.1% to 54.4% (p<0.05), and the 2-year native liver survival rate increased from 44.4% to 52.6% (p<0.05). The percentage of patients who underwent surgery increased from 68.0% to 83.8% (p<0.05). In Shenzhen, our screening programme led to earlier diagnoses and better prognoses.

This defect has been reported to have a genetic etiology in some cases, although the full extent of genetic involvement in atrial septal defect is not known. Because symptoms are often lacking in childhood and manifest primarily in adulthood and because physical findings may be lacking, it is important to take a family history in patients in whom the defect is suspected. When evaluating children, a family history of atrial septal defect should raise suspicion of increased risk so that early diagnosis and treatment can be made. The author reports a cluster of 11 diagnosed atrial septal defects within one 32-member family group, 6 of whom required surgery to repair the defects. It is significant that most of the individuals were lacking in objective findings on physical examination, notably a murmur, as well as in subjective complaints. Diagnoses were made by use of two-dimensional echocardiography with color-enhanced Doppler ultrasonography in all but two cases--one diagnosed with transesophageal echocardiography and one, serendipitously, during cardiac catheterization. Echocardiography also revealed mitral valve prolapse, thin atrial septal wall, with aneurysm in some cases, and regurgitation of mitral or tricuspid valves in several individuals.

71,71,11723261,"Televised images are the most common stimulus for provoking photosensitive seizures in photosensitive persons. To inhibit photosensitive seizures in photosensitive persons who do or do not have epilepsy, the authors sought nonpharmacologic methods for reducing the levels of photic stimulation of televised images. The authors found two types of pathophysiologic mechanisms (wavelength-dependent and quantity of light-dependent mechanisms) for photoparoxysmal responses (PPR). The authors tested two different types of optical filters, one reflecting long-wavelength red light selectively, which stimulates a wavelength-dependent mechanism, and the other absorbing light in the visible spectrum evenly (neutral density filters). Inhibiting effects of optical filters were studied by conventional intermittent photic stimulation (IPS) using strobe light and novel photic stimulation using flashing cathode ray tubes (CRT). Both filters individually inhibited PPR insufficiently (less than 50%). Compound optical filters, composed of both types of filters, can inhibit the PPR, approximately 90% for IPS and 95% for photic stimulation with CRT. These compound optical filters do not destroy chromaticity of emissions from the television's CRT.

Postoperative catheter angiography is considered the gold standard. We evaluated the value of ICG and intraoperative catheter angiography in this setting. Between January 2009 and July 2013, 37 patients with brain AVMs underwent surgical resection of their vascular lesions. ICG videoangiography and an intraoperative catheter angiography were performed in 32 cases, and a routine postoperative angiogram was performed within 48 h to 2 weeks after surgery. The usefulness of ICG findings and the ability to confirm total resection and to identify residual nidus or persistent shunt were assessed and compared to intraoperative and postoperative digital subtraction angiography, respectively. There were 7 grade 1, 11 grade 2, 11 grade 3 and 3 grade 4 Spetzler-Martin classification AVMs. ICG angiography helped to distinguish AVM vessels in 26 patients. In 31 patients, it demonstrated that there was no residual shunting. In one patient, a residual AVM was identified and further resected. Intraoperative catheter angiography detected two additional small residuals that were missed by ICG angiography, both deep in the surgical cavity. Further resection of the AVM was performed, and total resection was confirmed by a repeat intraoperative angiogram. Postoperative angiography in a patient with a grade 4 lesion revealed one additional small deep residual AVM nidus with persistent late shunting missed on both ICG and intraoperative angiography. Overall ICG angiography missed three out of four residual AVMs after initial resection, while the intraoperative angiogram missed one. Although ICG angiography is a helpful adjunct in the surgery of some brain AVMs, it's yield in detecting residual AVM nidus or shunt is low, especially for deep-seated lesions and higher grade AVMs. ICG angiography should not be used as a sole and/or reliable technique. High-resolution postoperative angiography must be performed in brain AVM surgery and remains the best test to confidently confirm complete AVM resection.

The OMT-exposed children had significantly poorer visual acuity, both for the best eye, the worst eye and binocularly. Two children had mild visual impairment. Manifest strabismus was more frequent in the OMT group, 30%, vs. 4.8% in the control group. The most frequent types of strabismus were accommodative esotropia and intermittent exotropia. Manifest nystagmus was present in 10 (16%) of the exposed children compared to one among the non-exposed children. The accommodative amplitude was decreased in the OMT group compared to the controls. After adjusting for polydrug exposure and SGA (small-for-gestational-age), the between-group differences in visual acuity, strabismus, and nystagmus remained. The methadone-exposed children had poorer visual acuity, increased frequency of strabismus and a higher percentage of nystagmus, hypermetropia and astigmatism compared to the buprenorphine-exposed children. School-age children exposed to methadone or buprenorphine in utero had a higher prevalence of strabismus and nystagmus, and a lower visual acuity and accommodation amplitude.

A total of 513 high myopes (spherical equivalent [SE] ≤ -5.0 D, 4-19 years of age) without any advanced pathological myopic lesions were enrolled. Fundus photographs and choroidal thickness (ChT) data were collected by SS-OCT. A novel grading approach was adopted to classify fundus tessellation into four categories on colour fundus photography, referring to the location of tessellation divided by an Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study grid centred on the fovea, through which closer to the fovea represents higher grades of fundus tessellation. Peripapillary atrophy (PPA) area and ovality index were also measured.

Twenty-two patients (27 sides) had adult MMD, 14 patients (22 sides) had pediatric MMD, and 11 patients (11 sides) had atherosclerosis. Postoperative HP was significantly higher in adult MMD (40.7 %) than in pediatric MMD (18.2 %) and atherosclerosis (0 %). Adult MMD with HP was associated with a longer ICG peak time (P < 0.001). There was no correlation between the ICG peak time and preoperative cerebral blood flow or vascular reserve. The ratio of the vessel caliber was also higher in adult MMD with HP (P < 0.001).

81,81,28062966,"Protruding ears represent the main abnormality of the external ear, which has required numerous anatomic and surgical studies. Most studies give attention to the absence of the antihelix as the anatomic defect responsible for the clinical deformity of the lateral aspect of the ear that leads to its anteversion. The reason for this study is the controversial origin of the fold of the antihelix within the auricle framework, a field of interest for aesthetic otoplasty. The current study examined the medial surface of the cartilaginous ear frame from cadaver specimens with right morphology to investigate the starting point of the fold of the antihelix. This allowed for verification of a natural plica at the anatomic base of this antihelical fold, which to date has not had its topography described morphologically. It is acknowledged that relevant literature makes no reference to this innominate natural plica at the origin of the antihelix, whose anatomic and surgical importance is related in this report. This study aimed to show that the existence of a natural plica at the base of the antihelix in ear framing represents a landmark between normal and protruding ear morphology. For 8 years, 118 ears were carefully investigated within rigid ethical principles based on a thorough review of the pertinent literature. The study investigated 16 selected cadaver specimens and 102 protruding ears dissected by the senior author including 49 bilateral cases (26 males and 23 females) and 4 unilateral cases (2 males and 2 females). Bifacial anthropometric measurements by calipers were used for documentation. A natural plica at the base of the antihelix was found in all cadaver ears selected with right morphology, whereas it was totally absent in every surgically treated protruding ear irrespective of color, gender, age, or ethnic origin. Ambilateral measures of the antihelix eminence certify the study object in normal specimens as well as its lack in abnormal ones. Technical and topographic knowledge that a natural plica exists at the anatomic base of the antihelix is a valuable key point in recognizing the normal external ear. In addition, the making of a natural plica is the first and most effective factor in the reconstruction of the antihelical fold and its absolute absence results in the pathologic condition for protruding ears.

82,82,24605126,"We aimed to investigate the neurocognitive and behavioral endophenotypes of premorbid mood disorder. We compared intelligence, neuropsychological functioning, and behavioral problems among three groups: 1) a high-risk group [attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) children of parents with a history of a mood disorder], 2) a low-risk group (ADHD children of parents without a history of a mood disorder), and 3) normal comparison subjects. We used the Korean Educational Development Institute Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (KEDI-WISC-R), the Stroop Color Word Interference Test (Stroop), the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), and the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (RCFT) as neurocognitive measures, and we used the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) as a behavioral measure. Performance on these neuropsychological tests and score on the CBCL of 18 high-risk children were compared to those of 20 low-risk children and 24 healthy children. We also assessed the children's current mood state and familial functioning to control for the confounding effects of these variables. Compared to low-risk and healthy children, high-risk children were impaired on the Picture Completion and Stroop Word subtest and showed higher scores on the CBCL subscales representing internalizing symptoms. These significant group differences persisted even after adjustment for the children's current mood state and familial functioning. Neuropsychological deficits in the offspring of parents with a mood disorder may be associated with the current mood state rather than with innate characteristics, while their internalizing symptoms may partially stem from innate characteristics that are endophenotypes of a premorbid mood disorder.

83,83,33282415,"While increased household income is associated with overall decreased screen time for children, less is known about the effect of racial variation on this association. According to Minorities' Diminished Returns (MDRs) theory, family income and other economic resources show weaker association with children's developmental, behavioral, and health outcomes for racialized groups such as black families, due to the effect of racism and social stratification. In this study, we investigated the association, by race, between family income and children's screen time, as a proxy of screen time. This longitudinal study followed 15,022 American children aged 9-11 over a 1-year period. The data came from the baseline of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. The independent variable was family income, and it was categorized as a three-level nominal variable. The dependent variable, screen time, was a continuous variable. Ethnicity, gender, parental education, and marital status were the covariates. The results showed that family income was inversely associated with children's screen time. However, there was a weaker inverse association seen in black families when compared with white families. This was documented by a significant statistical interaction between race and family income on children's screen time. Diminished association between family income and children's screen time for black families, compared with white families, is similar to MDRs and reflects a health risk to high-income black children. In a society where race and skin color determine opportunities and treatment by society, children from middle class black families remain at risk across multiple domains. We should not assume that income similarly promotes the health of all racial and ethnic groups. Addressing health and behavioral inequalities requires interventions that go beyond equalizing socioeconomic resources for black families. Marginalization, racism, and poverty interfere with the normal family income-related development of American children.

We conducted a pilot study of nurse-delivered asthma education in a busy outpatient clinic. We enrolled a convenience sample of children (7-16 years) with uncontrolled persistent asthma who had a prescription for an inhaled controller medication and public health insurance. After provider visits, nurses taught dyads using picture-based materials, teach-back methods, and colored labels applied to asthma medications. The intervention was repeated at 1-month follow-up. We assessed feasibility by reviewing nurse documentation in the electronic medical record, detailing whether each component was implemented and the time required for education at each visit. We measured preliminary effectiveness by surveying children and caregivers separately before each clinic visit about asthma management responsibility, self-efficacy, caregiver quality of life, and symptoms; caregivers also completed a final telephone survey 2 months after the follow-up visit. We examined pre-post differences in continuous outcomes within-subjects using Wilcoxon signed rank tests. We enrolled 22 child/caregiver dyads.

The same method can theoretically be applied to color Doppler flows to generate dynamic 3-dimensional images of intracardiac blood flow jets. To explore the feasibility of this approach, we studied 41 patients with various valvular disorders or intracardiac shunts. We acquired sequential 2-dimensional images along with color Doppler information using rotational scanning from a transthoracic or a subcostal window. Images were digitized and processed for 3-dimensional reconstruction using dedicated software. After adequate segmentation, the flow jets were displayed in 3 dimensions in a gray scale format. With use of this approach, 3-dimensional reconstruction of color Doppler flows was possible in all but 1 patient. Still frames allowed immediate appreciation of the shape of the jets, their location in the cardiac chambers, and their size related to that cavity. Dynamic display was even more striking by showing the flow in real time. Dynamic 3-dimensional images enabled visualization of flow jets in projections not available in conventional color flow Doppler, looking directly at the views of shunt and regurgitant flows, and also permitted 3-dimensional delineation of flow convergence zones. We conclude that dynamic visualization of various intracardiac flows in 3 dimensions using transthoracic echocardiography is possible.

Vitamin C levels in whole blood, plasma, and gastric juice exhibited significant negative correlation with the age of patients, the histologic density of H. pylori, the degree of active and chronic gastritis, and the severity of H. pylori infection (based on urease positivity and histologic density of H. pylori). Gastric juice pH was correlated with the degree of chronic gastritis and was significantly higher in urease-positive patients. The data demonstrate that vitamin C levels in whole blood, plasma, and gastric juice and the gastric juice pH in Korean children are closely related to the severity of H. pylori infection and the histologic changes in the stomach.

98,98,3655420,"Musical murmurs are probably related to the vibrations of some structures in the cardiovascular system, and this may be reflected in the characteristic stripes which are recorded by the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) of the pulsed Doppler echocardiography (so-called FFT stripe). In the present study, we demonstrated new stripes by color Doppler echocardiography, which were composed of multiple warm and cold color bands which we termed color Doppler stripes (CD stripe). An experiment was performed to obtain Doppler signals from the surface of a vibrating tonometer at a frequency of 128 Hz. When the CD stripe was obtained, a similar FFT stripe was also recorded from the same sampling site. Fourteen patients with musical murmurs were selected from 2,000 consecutive phonocardiographic records made during the last one and a half years. The CD stripe was obtained in three and the FFT stripe in six. When both stripes were obtained, the FFT stripe was always obtained if we set carefully the sample site in the CD stripe, and these two were consistent in timing. We concluded that, in view of the close correlation between the CD stripe and the FFT stripe, the newly observed CD stripe is also a characteristic finding reflecting a regularly vibrating structure.

After induction therapy, 103, 13 and 8 patients showed MRD <0.01%, 0.01%-0.1% and >0.1%, respectively. The 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) in the patients with MRD <0.01%, 0.01%-0.1% and >0.1% was 88.9+/-3.9%, 70.0+/-14.5% and 0%, respectively and the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) was 82.4+/-4.4%, 21.2+/-18.0% and 0%, respectively. There were significant differences in the RFS and EFS among the patients with different MRD levels (P<0.01). Within half a year after induction remission, the 5-year RFS in patients with MRD negative (<0.01%) and positive was 87.7+/-4.1% and 58.3+/-14.2%, respectively (P<0.01) and the 5-year RFS was 80.7+/-4.6% and 25.6+/-13.8%, respectively (P<0.01).

Thirty-six affected individuals from 23 unrelated families. This was a retrospective study of patients who had a characteristic macular phenotype. Subjects underwent a full ocular examination, electrophysiologic studies, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), and fundus autofluorescence imaging. Genomic analyses were performed using haplotype sharing analysis and whole-exome sequencing. Visual acuity, retinal features, electroretinography, and whole-exome sequencing. Twenty-six of 36 subjects were female. The median age of subjects at presentation was 15 years (range, 5-59 years). The majority of subjects were asymptomatic and presented after a routine eye examination (22/36 subjects) or after screening because of a positive family history (13/36 subjects) or by another ophthalmologist (1/36 subjects). Of the 3 symptomatic subjects, 2 had reduced visual acuity secondary to nonorganic visual loss and bilateral ametropic amblyopia with strabismus. Visual acuity was 0.18 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) or better in 30 of 33 subjects. Color vision was normal in all subjects tested, except for the subject with nonorganic visual loss. All subjects had bilateral symmetric multiple yellow dots at the macula. In the majority of subjects, these were evenly distributed throughout the fovea, but in 9 subjects they were concentrated in the nasal parafoveal area. The dots were hyperautofluorescent on fundus autofluorescence imaging. The OCT imaging was generally normal, but in 6 subjects subtle irregularities at the inner segment ellipsoid band were seen. Electrophysiologic studies identified normal macular function in 17 of 19 subjects and normal full-field retinal function in all subjects. Whole-exome analysis across 3 unrelated families found no pathogenic variants in known macular dystrophy genes. Haplotype sharing analysis in 1 family excluded linkage with the North Carolina macular dystrophy (MCDR1) locus. A new retinal phenotype is described, which is characterized by bilateral multiple early-onset yellow dots at the macula. Visual function is normal, and the condition is nonprogressive.

We evaluated patients with spinal cord disease treated between January 2006 and September 2015. Intraoperative standard B-mode images were acquired using a 3.5-MHz to 12-MHz ultrasonographic probes (linear and curvilinear) on various ultrasound machines. The benefits and disadvantages of iUS were assessed for each case. A total number of 158 intradural spinal lesions were operated on using iUS. Of these, 107 lesions (68%) were intradural extramedullary and 51 (32%) were intramedullary. All lesions were clearly visible using the ultrasound probe. The high-frequency linear probes (10-12 MHz) provided a better image quality compared with lower-frequency probes. Color and power-angiography modes were helpful in assessing the vascularization of the tumors and location of the major vessels in the vascular lesions. We document how iUS was used to facilitate safe and efficient spinal tumor resection at each stage of the operation. iUS was beneficial in confirmation of tumor location and extension, planning myelotomy, and estimation of degree of resection of the intramedullary tumors. It was particularly helpful in guiding the approach in redo surgeries for recurrent spinal cord tumors. iUS has a fast learning curve and offers additional intraoperative information that can help improve surgical accuracy and therefore may reduce procedure-related morbidity.

In each infant, the mean of three repeated measurements in the forehead was calculated for each instrument, followed by a similar measurement on the chest. The bilirubin values varied between 0 and 320 µmol/l (0-18.8 mg/dl). There was a high degree of agreement with significant correlations between bilirubin values measured with the two devices on the forehead (Pearson's r = 0.94, p < 0.001) and the chest (r = 0.94, p < 0.001). The correlations remained after stratifying the data by gestational age, postnatal age and skin color. The coefficient of variation for repeated bilirubin measurements was 8.8% for JAISY and 8.0% for JM105 (p = 0.79).

104,104,22591103,"There is no consensus on the most appropriate treatment for patients with large to giant congenital melanocytic naevi (CMN) because of the risk of melanoma development. Surgical excision followed by skin grafting or expanded skin coverage may cause unfavourable scarring. There is a balance to be achieved between minimizing the disfiguring appearance and the risk of malignant change. The pulsed dye laser (PDL) is commonly used for vascular lesions and is highly absorbed by melanin and haemoglobin. Its pulse duration is longer than that of Q-switched ruby lasers (QsRL), which can have nonspecific photothermolytic effects on surrounding nonpigmented naevus cells. To investigate the effectiveness of combined treatment with the PDL and QsRL for large to giant CMN. Six patients with large to giant CMN were enrolled in this study. Treatment consisted of one pass of PDL treatment followed by one pass of QsRL treatment. Multiple rounds of treatment were applied to all patients. All patients responded to this combined regimen, and the lesional colour was effectively reduced. The mean number of rounds of laser treatment required to achieve skin lightening was 7·7. No patients suffered severe hypertrophic scarring. No cases of recurrence or malignant transformation were observed. The histological results from the patient who underwent the most laser therapy in this study showed a remarkable reduction in the number of melanocytic naevus cells after treatment.

However, the phenotypical correlates of brain functions associated with NMDA receptor genes and dopamine receptor genes in ADHD are yet to be investigated. We examined the diagnosis, genotype and the diagnosis-genotype interaction effects of GRIN2B and DRD4 variants on the local functional connectivity (by using the mean of static regional homogeneity (ReHo) and the mean and standard deviation (SD) of dynamic ReHo) in 67 ADHD subjects and 44 controls (aged 6-17 years).

CCTT measures processing speed, sustained and divided attention. There were significant diagnosis (p < 0.001) and interaction (p = 0.02) effects of the GRIN2B variant on the static ReHo mean in the left superior parietal cluster, and the ReHo value was positively correlated with the CCTT interference score in the ADHD with T allele carrier subgroup (p = 0.012). There were significant diagnosis (p < 0.001) and interaction (p = 0.03) effects of the DRD4 variant on the dynamic ReHo SD in the right superior parietal cluster.

107,107,36426893,"Often dubbed the fourth trimester, the first 6 weeks of the postpartum period is a critical time that sets the stage for future health outcomes for both women and children. Leading maternal and child health advocates agree that intervention in the first 6 weeks of life is crucial. Although most new parents prioritize their newborn's well-care, many postpartum patients do not attend appointments for themselves, missing critical opportunities for identification and treatment of leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality. Racial disparities in rates of postpartum complications highlight the increased importance of close postpartum follow-up for women of color. Barriers to attending routine postpartum visits were exacerbated by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Additionally, in traditional models of care, maternal-infant dyads experience fragmented care across multiple departments and patient care settings and only 1 to 2 routine visits for the postpartum patient. To address the challenges of providing in-person postpartum care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Boston, the Midwifery Service, and the Pediatrics Department of Boston Medical Center partnered to launch a mobile postpartum clinic that provided comprehensive, high-touch, dyadic care to postpartum patients and newborns in the first 6 weeks of life. Integrative mobile visits catered to the interplay of maternal and newborn health in the early postpartum period, providing an average of 3 visits to each dyad. This novel clinic concept addresses structural inequities by decreasing barriers to care and reimagines an ideal state of postpartum dyadic care with frequent visits addressing the complete needs of each postpartum patient and newborn.

108,108,28778755,"Keloids are abnormal fibroproliferative scars that pose a significant challenge to patients and clinicians. The molecular basis for keloid formation remains incompletely understood, and currently no universally effective treatments exist. It is well recognized that keloids are more prevalent in populations with darkly pigmented skin, such as African Americans, but the basis for the link between skin color and keloid risk is not known. Pigmentation reduces vitamin D production in the skin. Because most of the body's vitamin D is produced in the skin, rates of vitamin D deficiency are higher in populations with darker skin pigmentation. In addition to regulation of calcium homeostasis, vitamin D plays important roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, cancer progression, inflammation, and fibrosis. The activities of vitamin D are dependent on the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a member of the steroid nuclear receptor superfamily. The ligand-bound VDR acts as a transcription factor; thus, nuclear localization is required for ligand-dependent regulation of target gene expression. The current study investigated expression and nuclear localization of VDR in keloid scars (N=24) and biopsies of normal skin (N=24). Immunohistochemistry with two different antibodies demonstrated reduced VDR protein levels in a majority of keloid scars. Further, the percentage of epidermal cells displaying nuclear VDR localization was significantly lower in keloid scars compared with normal skin samples. Interestingly, analysis of VDR-positive nuclei among different normal skin samples showed a significant reduction in nuclear localization in epidermis of black donors compared with white donors. The results suggest that VDR may play a role in keloid pathology, and hint at a possible role for VDR in the increased susceptibility to keloid scarring in individuals with darkly pigmented skin.

Systematic literature searches for the seven exemplar chemicals, informed by the Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome (PECO) framework, were conducted through 18 November 2022, using PubMed, CINAHL Plus (EBSCO), GreenFILE (EBSCO), and Web of Science sources. We examined these studies regarding authors' conceptualization and operationalization of race, ethnicity, and other indicators of sociodemographic and socioeconomic disadvantage; whether studies presented data on exposure and outcome disparities and the patterns of those disparities; and the evidence of effect modification by or interaction with race and ethnicity. Two hundred twelve individual studies met the search criteria and were reviewed, resulting in 218 studies or investigations being included in this review. AP and Pb were the most commonly studied exposures. The most frequently identified neurodevelopmental outcomes were cognitive and behavioral/psychological. Approximately a third (74 studies) reported investigations of interactions or effect modification with 69% (51 of 74 studies) reporting the presence of interactions or effect modification. However, less than half of the studies presented data on disparities in the outcome or the exposure, and fewer conducted formal tests of heterogeneity. Ninety-two percent of the 165 articles that examined race and ethnicity did not provide an explanation of their constructs for these variables, creating an incomplete picture. As a whole, the studies we reviewed indicated a complex story about how racial and ethnic minority and low-income children may be disproportionately harmed by exposures to neurotoxicants, and this has implications for targeting interventions, policy change, and other necessary investments to eliminate these health disparities. We provide recommendations on improving environmental epidemiological studies on environmental health disparities. To achieve environmental justice and health equity, we recommend concomitant strategies to eradicate both neurotoxic chemical exposures and systems that perpetuate social inequities. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11750.

The objective of this study was to describe changes in RNFL and GCIPL thickness in the acute phase following pediatric ON. Data were collected prospectively from consecutive children presenting with ON as part of an incident acquired demyelinating event. Children with a final diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (n = 9, 10 ON-affected eyes) or monophasic demyelination (n = 16, 25 ON-affected eyes) who underwent spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) testing within 30 days of symptom onset were included. Standardized visual assessment was performed at presentation and 6-18 months follow-up. OCT measures were compared to those of healthy controls (n = 25, 50 eyes). Median (interquartile range [IQR]) global RNFL thickness was increased in ON-affected eyes (155 μm [114-199 μm]) compared to control eyes (104 μm [98.5-107.5 μm]; p < 0.0001). Compared to controls, fellow eyes demonstrated a reduced temporal quadrant RNFL thickness (59 μm [53-72 μm] versus 71.5 μm [65-81 μm]; p = 0.013) and lower GCIPL thickness (80.5 μm [74-88 μm] versus 87 μm [85-89 μm]; p = 0.003). The ON-affected eyes of children with monophasic demyelination demonstrated a greater global RNFL thickness (183.5 μm [146.5-206 μm]) compared to the ON-affected eyes of children with multiple sclerosis (108.5 μm [95-124 μm]; p = 0.01). OCT measures at presentation did not predict low-contrast visual acuity nor color vision at 6-18 months follow-up. Children with multiple sclerosis show less RNFL swelling in their ON-affected eyes at onset compared to children with monophasic demyelination. Lower GCIPL and temporal RNFL thickness in the clinically unaffected eyes of those children with unilateral ON suggests the presence of pre-existing neuroaxonal injury in children presenting with a first episode of ON.

A parallel design, proof-of-concept randomized control trial was conducted with 65 mother-infant dyads (32 randomized to intervention, 33 randomized an IBH attention control focused on promoting healthy mental health), in which the majority identify as Black (80%) and low income (91% receiving Medicaid). Participants and assessors were masked to treatment condition. Outcomes included feasibility (enrollment), acceptability (retention and adherence), and conditional weight gain (CWG), an indicator of rapid weight gain. The intervention was feasible (90% of eligible families enrolled) and acceptable (89% of families retained), with 81% receiving ≥3 of 4 treatment sessions. A medium effect was found on CWG (d = -0.54 post-treatment, d = -0.57 follow-up), with the infants in the treatment group showing significantly lower CWG (mean = -0.27, 95% CI, -0.63, 0.09) compared to the control group (mean = 0.29, 95% CI, -0.17, 0.76) at 9 months (p = .04).

It is a common public health problem that is most prominent worldwide in elementary school children. The current study aimed to investigate the prevalence, risk factors, and genetic diversity of P. humanus capitis among primary school children in the Erbil province. For this purpose, this study was conducted from October 2019 to December 2019 among 1100 randomly selected elementary school children aged 6-12. Data collection was performed via a regular questionnaire and physical hair examination. For the genetic diversity part, after collecting one louse randomly from each individual, DNA was extracted. The mitochondrial Cox1 gene was then amplified by universal primer and PCR. Gene sequencing was performed by ABI (BioNEER, South Korea). Data analysis was done by Chi-Square and T-test using the SPSS ver. 23. The overall infestation rate was 21.27%, and the rate was significantly higher among females (34.93%) compared to males (7.91%). Some variables had found the prevalence rate to be strongly affected. This included age; the rate was not significant (26.87%) in the age group 8-9 years compared to other age groups. According to hair length, the rate was significantly increased (36.52%) among children with tall hair. In terms of hair type, the incidence of curly-haired children was significantly higher (31.54%); in terms of hair color, there were not significant differences among blonde children (25.90%) and others.

118,118,28640738,"There are many theories explaining vitiligo such as genetic, autoimmune, neural, free radicals, biochemical, intrinsic defect, melanocytorrhagy, and convergent theories. Phenytoin is a widely used anticonvulsant, which is used in cutaneous medicine for treatment of ulcers and epidermolysis bullosa. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of topical phenytoin gel in the treatment of vitiligo patients and explaining the underlying mechanism using immunohistochemistry for evaluation of HMB45, CD4, and CD8. Only 9 patients out of 28 experienced response to phenytoin in the form of dull, white color change and light brown color. Post-phenytoin treatment biopsies showed decreased density of inflammation, increased melanin and increased HMB45 positive cells together with an increased number of CD4 positive lymphocytes and decreased number of CD8 positive lymphocytes. These observations did not reach significant level (P > 0.05). A high percentage of CD4 positive lymphocytes was significantly associated with a long duration of vitiligo (p = 0.03) and segmental vitiligo type (p = 0.02). The current study applied phenytoin as 2% concentrated gel for 3 months, which is a relatively short duration without observed side effects throughout the period. These results indicate that topical phenytoin of low concentrations may have beneficial effects through immunomodulatory activity by affecting CD4 and CD8 counts and subsequently the ratio between them. Further studies are recommended to combine phenytoin with other antivitiligo agents as local corticosteroids or phototherapy to clarify if it could potentiate their effects.

119,119,34158148,"Children and neonates very often receive intravenous therapy. There is a lack of systematic data on the incidence of extravasation injuries in children and neonates. Individual studies involving neonates receiving intravenous therapy on intensive care units report incidence rates of 18-46%. Serious complications, such as necrosis and ulceration, develop in 2.4-4% of cases, which in the long term can lead to contractures, deformities, and loss of limb function secondary to unfavorable scar formation. There are no guidelines available to date on the management of pediatric extravasation injuries. The present review article is based on a selective search of the literature in PubMed (for the period 1979 until June 2020) and our own clinical experience. There is a lack of randomized controlled studies on the management of pediatric extravasation injuries, so the level of evidence remains restricted to small comparative studies and case series. Conservative, pharmacological or surgical forms of treatment are used, depending on the volume and type of extravasated fluid as well as patient-specific factors. Firstly, an assessment is made as to whether the extravasated fluid is a substance with no primary toxic properties, a tissue irritating (irritant), or a necrosis-inducing (vesicant) substance. Skin and tissue should be examined for damage, skin color, swelling, capillary refill time, and pulse (distal to the injury). Depending on the substance and volume of the extravasated fluid and the degree of tissue damage, treatment options include conservative forms of treatment, administration of antidotes, hyaluronidase or vasodilators (such as phentolamine), the multiple puncture procedure, flushouts, and liposuction. Without evidence for the superiority of any particular treatment, therapy remains an individual decision, carrying the risks associated with off-label use.

126,126,8854396,"Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are among the principal causes of mortality of children under 5 years of age. Most deaths are due to pneumonia, which, when timely identified and properly treated, could be avoided. An effective case management scheme, based on early recognition of pneumonia and prompt antibiotic treatment, relies on early recognition of alarm signs by mothers and community health workers. For mothers to understand and act on advice from health workers, language and concepts commonly used by mothers should be utilized. The present study was carried out to compare the relative effectiveness of two different methods to elicit local terms used by mothers to refer to ARI symptoms/signs/treatments. A comparison was made among the terms elicited by a free listing of common terms mentioned by mothers in relation to ARI, and the terms they recognized when looking at a video that showed children with different ARI signs. The video was shown in a community and a clinical setting, in order to identify strengths and weaknesses of showing it in these settings. The video elicited more signs dealing with serious illness, respiratory distress and general malaise, but missed non-visual signs, such as fever, lack of appetite or pain. Also, mothers tended to be distracted by trivial signs, such as skin color. Free listing was easier to administer and elicited more non-life-threatening symptoms/signs, but mothers were more prone to drift away and mention terms not related to respiratory illness. Showing the video in the clinic elicited more medical-related terms, and was easier to show than in the community.

129,129,9145310,"The modified Gomori trichrome stain of muscles can demonstrate ragged red fibers which are irregular in outline and display a thick and irregular red subsarcolemmal layer and intermyofibrillar red deposits.

The sarcoplasm shows normal intermyofibrillar network. We defined these fibers as ""smooth red fibers"". To investigate the pathological significance of the smooth red fibers, we studied morphological differences between the smooth red fibers and ragged red fibers by light and electron microscopy and evaluated the occurrence and characteristics of the both abnormal muscle fibers in several neuromuscular diseases. Muscle specimens from 738 patients who were seen or consulted at the Department of Neurology, Hokkaido University, from January 1980 to October 1994 were examined. The smooth red fibers were classified into two types, type I and type II. Type I smooth red fibers were hypertrophied and showed a thin smooth red margin. Electron microscopy of the type I smooth red fibers showed no mitochondrial abnormality, being different from ragged red fibers which have abnormal mitochondria. Type I smooth red fibers were observed in chronic denervation process; they were specially frequent in Kugelberg-Welander syndrome. Hypertrophy of type I smooth red fibers were considered to be a compensative reaction in chronic denervation. Type II smooth red fibers were observed with or without ragged red fibers in mitochondrial myopathy. Type II smooth red fibers showed a thin smooth red margin, spreading red deposits from the margin into sarcoplasm. The fibers showed mitochondrial abnormality in electron microscopy. It could be posturated that type II smooth red fibers were transformed into ragged red fibers. The findings suggest 1) type I and type II smooth red fibers are different in origin, 2) type II smooth red fibers change to ragged red fibers, 3) type I and type II smooth red fibers are important markers of chronic denervation and mitochondrial myopathy, respectively.

Case-control. Thirteen adolescents 1-month post-concussion who reported ongoing balance problems (Balance+), 20 adolescent 1-month post-concussion who reported no balance problems (Balance-), and 30 non-injured adolescents (control) completed a series of balance tests. Participants completed two 2-min trials standing on a Nintendo Wii Balance Board™ during which the COP under their feet was recorded: i) double-leg stance, eyes open; ii) double-leg stance, eyes closed. Participants also completed a dual-task condition combining a double-leg stance and a Stroop Colour-word test. Participants in both the Balance+ and Balance- group swayed over a larger ellipse area compared to the control group while completing the Eyes Closed (Balance+, p=0.002; Balance-, p=0.002) and Dual-Task (Balance+, p=0.001; Balance-, p=0.004) conditions and performed the Dual-Task condition with faster medio-lateral velocity (Balance+, p=0.003; Balance-, p=0.009). The participants in the Balance- group also swayed over a larger ellipse area compared to the control group while completing the Eyes Open condition (p=0.005). No significant differences were identified between the Balance+ and Balance- groups. At 1-month post-concussion, adolescents demonstrated balance deficits compared to non-injured adolescents regardless of whether they reported balance problems. These results suggest that self-reported balance status might not be an accurate reflection of balance performance following a concussion in adolescents.

132,132,1979536,"In this review we will attempt to summarize the use of scrotal sonography in infants and children. The material is gathered from the literature and from our own experience of 197 sonograms performed on 175 pediatric patients. Included will be information on testicular development and descent, normal sonographic anatomy, classification of scrotal disease, and the final diagnoses of the sonograms. Scrotal sonography has proven useful in evaluating undescended testes in the inguinal canal and just inside the inguinal ring. It is of limited value when the testes are in the abdomen. Sonography can often distinguish the various causes of nonpainful scrotal masses such as tumors, hydrocele, and meconium peritonitis. Sonography is highly accurate in distinguishing normal from abnormal scrotal contents and in separating testicular from extratesticular masses. However, sonography does have limitations in distinguishing benign from malignant neoplasms or from some inflammatory lesions. Sonography can be successfully used in the differential diagnosis of the painful scrotum especially with color flow Doppler. Inflammatory diseases that often involve the epididymis can be distinguished from torsion. Torsion of the appendages has been diagnosed. In cases of scrotal trauma, management decisions are often based on the sonographic findings. Conditions that require surgical management such as testicular rupture or large testicular hematomas can be recognized. Information is included on a variety of miscellaneous conditions such as hydrocele, varicocele, and ambiguous genitalia in which sonography has proven valuable.

134,134,16122629,"Cognitive neuroscience researchers have hypothesized that context-dependent and context-independent response selection is associated with the left and right frontal lobe, respectively, in right-handed adult males. Patients with left frontal lobe lesions show context-independent reasoning in a cognitive bias task (CBT), while those with right frontal lesions show context-dependent reasoning. Young children show more context-independent responses in a modified CBT (mCBT), while adolescents and adults show more context-dependent responses. We investigated the cognitive bias of right-handed children with unilateral frontal lobe lesions/epileptic foci to explore the plasticity of lateralization in the frontal lobes. The study included eight children with left frontal lobe lesions/epileptic foci (LLF) and four children with right frontal lobe lesions/epileptic foci (RLF). Twenty-three right-handed age-matched males served as controls. A computer presented version of the original card-choice task that was simplified and modified for children was used (mCBT). Simple visual stimuli differed dichotomously in shape, color, number, and shading. A target object presented alone was followed by two choices from which subjects made selection based on preference. Considering all four characteristics, the degree of similarity between the target and the subjects' choice was scored for 30 trials. A high score indicated a context-dependent response selection bias and a low score indicated a context-independent bias. The RLF subjects had a higher converted score (mean: 26.8+/-2.2), while LLF subjects showed a lower converted score (mean: 7.75+/-6.3). There were highly significant differences between LLF subjects and the other groups (P<0.001 vs. controls or RLF subjects). No significant correlations were observed between the converted scores and the age at onset, time since insult, or IQ in either LLF or RLF subjects. These findings suggest that the lateralization of frontal lobe function elicited by mCBT is fundamental and independent of language lateralization, rather than secondary to it. Furthermore, these findings also indicate that the timetable for the development of lateralized frontal lobe functions depends upon biologic factors.

135,135,31267979,"In contrast to the use of traditional unidimensional paper-based scales, a mobile health (mHealth) assessment of pain in children and young people (CYP) with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) enables comprehensive and complex multidimensional pain data to be captured remotely by individuals. However, how professionals use multidimensional pain data to interpret and synthesize pain reports gathered using mHealth tools is not yet known. The aim of this study was to explore the salience and prioritization of different mHealth pain features as interpreted by key stakeholders involved in research and management of pain in CYP with JIA. Pain and rheumatology specialists were purposively recruited via professional organizations. Face-to-face focus groups were conducted for each specialist group. Participants were asked to rank order 9 static vignette scenarios created from real patient mHealth multidimensional pain data. These data had been collected by a researcher in a separate study using My Pain Tracker, a valid and acceptable mHealth iPad pain communication tool that collects information about intensity, severity, location, emotion, and pictorial pain qualities. In the focus groups, specialists discussed their decision-making processes behind each rank order in the focus groups. The total group rank ordering of vignette scenarios was calculated. Qualitative data from discussions were analyzed using latent thematic analysis. A total of 9 pain specialists took part in 1 focus group and 10 rheumatology specialists in another. In pain specialists, the consensus for the highest pain experience (44%) was poorer than their ranking of the lowest pain experiences (55%). Conversely, in rheumatology specialists, the consensus for the highest pain experience (70%) was stronger than their ranking of the lowest pain experience (50%). Pain intensity was a high priority for pain specialists, but rheumatology specialists gave high priority to intensity and severity taken together. Pain spread was highly prioritized, with the number of pain locations (particular areas or joints) being a high priority for both groups; radiating pain was a high priority for pain specialists only. Pain emotion was challenging for both groups and was only perceived to be a high priority when specialists had additional confirmatory evidence (such as information about pain interference or clinical observations) to validate the pain emotion report. Pain qualities such as particular word descriptors, use of the color red, and fire symbols were seen to be high priority by both groups in interpretation of CYP pain reports. Pain interpretation is complex. Findings from this study of specialists' decision-making processes indicate which aspects of pain are prioritized and weighted more heavily than others by those interpreting mHealth data. Findings are useful for developing electronic graphical summaries which assist specialists in interpreting patient-reported mHealth pain data more efficiently in clinical and research settings.

Cases had ICD-9/10 codes for torsion of the ovary, adnexa, ovarian pedicle, or fallopian tube and surgically confirmed OT; controls had codes for ovarian mass or cyst and surgically confirmed absence of OT. Preoperative transabdominal ultrasounds were analyzed by 3 radiologists blinded to final diagnosis. We used χ From 2016 to 2017, 32 patients presented with acute abdominal pain or symptoms concerning for ovarian mass requiring ultrasound imaging and subsequent diagnostic laparoscopy; 24 (75.0%) had confirmed OT by laparoscopy, and 8 (25.0%) did not. The mean age in both groups was similar (7.3 ± 2.9 years). Preoperative sonographic variables significantly associated with OT included presence of a simple cyst (20.8% vs 12.5%), ovarian heterogeneity (100% vs 12.5%), presence of peripheralized follicles (70.8% vs 0%), and asymmetry of color Doppler (75.0% vs 37.5%; all P < .05). Presence of free fluid, arterial color Doppler, and a whirlpool sign were not predictive of OT. In premenarchal patients, although certain variables on transabdominal sonography predicted surgically confirmed OT, only the presence of peripheralized follicles was unique to girls with OT. The decision to proceed with diagnostic laparoscopy for suspected OT can be aided by these specific sonographic findings but should ultimately be based on high clinical suspicion.

141,141,8695757,"Cell-to-cell interactions are mainly involved in the control of the proliferation, migration, differentiation and function of different cell types in a wide range of tissues. In the arterial vessel wall, human arterial endothelial cells (haEC) and smooth muscle cells (haSMC) coexist in close contact with each other. In atherogenesis, haSMC can migrate from the media to the subintimal space to form fibromuscular and atheromatous plaques. In the present study, a transfilter coculture system is described, in which the interface between haSMC and confluent or proliferative haEC can be studied in detail. Cells were cocultured on the opposite sides of a porous filter which separates both cell types like the internal elastic lamina in vivo. In cocultures containing proliferative haEC, haSMC growth was significantly stimulated (33.4 +/- 5.7 cells/section, p < 0.05) compared to haSMC monocultures (22.9 +/- 2.5 cells/section) and cocultures containing confluent haEC (15.6 +/- 2.9 cells/section). If confluent haEC were injured mechanically, haSMC growth increased highly significantly (71.3 +/- 16.8 cells/section, p < 0.001). Thus, cell-rich proliferates containing 5-7 layers of haSMC embedded in extracellular matrix were formed after 14 days. On the other hand, after haSMC migration to the endothelial side had occurred, the addition of LDL and monocytes to cocultures with arterial media explants and haEC resulted in the formation of lipid-rich, low-cellular structures. After 28 days, characteristic in vitro plaque growth was induced; the plaque contained a lipid core with predominantly necrotic cells, extracellular lipid accumulations, atypically shaped lipid-loaded haSMC and macrophages, similar to in vivo foam cells, as well as an increased amount of extracellular matrix (collagen I, III and IV). These areas were surrounded by typical fibromuscular caps consisting of smooth muscle alpha-actin-positive haSMC. Finally, the formation of capillaries by haEC could also be observed within these structures.

Three different zones of FAF change were visible. Persistence of the inner retinal layers, detected by SD OCT, was visible at presentation in 15 of 27 patients. Subfoveal choroidal thickness decreased with age, whereas central retinal thickness increased over a similar interval. Four patients in whom visual acuity decreased over the follow-up period recorded a reduction in central retinal thickness. Progressive structural changes occur at a time when central visual function is maintained. Pigmentary changes at the level of the RPE occur early in the disease course. Peripapillary chorioretinal atrophy, central retinal thickness, and subfoveal choroidal thickness are likely to be valuable in monitoring disease progression and should be considered as potential biomarkers in future therapeutic trials.

This is a retrospective review of six cases of FILS diagnosed antenatally by two dimensional (2D) and colour Doppler ultrasonography out of a total of 31,508 deliveries over a two-year period at the KK Women's and Children's Hospital. The incidence of FILS in this hospital was 1 in 5,251 deliveries. 2D ultrasonography showed an echogenic lung in all cases. FILS was confirmed by the demonstration of a systemic vessel leading to the affected lung on colour Doppler examination. After counselling, four terminated their pregnancies during mid-trimester, while two continued their pregnancies to term. Confirmation of the terminated cases was by post-mortem. In the two pregnancies that continued, regular growth scans were done to monitor the progression of the condition. Computed tomography confirmed the diagnosis post-delivery. Both were well but one had a resection of the sequestrated lung although he was asymptomatic. Histology also confirmed the diagnosis. FILS is a rare anomaly. 2D and colour Doppler ultrasonography are used to diagnose the condition antenatally. Termination of the pregnancy is not always indicated, as there are favourable outcomes from FILS.

147,147,33746036,"Alkaptonuria (AKU) is an inborn error of metabolism caused by the deficiency of homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGD) as a result of a defect in the HGD gene. HGD enzyme deficiency results in accumulation of homogentisic acid (HGA) in the body, which in turn leads to multisystemic clinical symptoms. The present study aimed to investigate the presenting symptoms, age at diagnosis, and clinical and genetic characteristics of AKU patients followed-up in different centers in Turkey. In this cross-sectional, multicenter, descriptive study, medical records of 66 AKU patients were retrospectively evaluated. Patients' data regarding demographic, clinical and genetic characteristics were recorded. HGD database (http://hgddatabase.cvtisr.sk/) was used to identify HGD gene variants. Of the patients, 37 (56.1%) presented with isolated dark urine and 29 (43.9%) were diagnosed based on the clinical symptoms or family screening. One of these patients was on follow-up for 2 years due to Parkinsonism and was diagnosed with AKU on further analyses. Signs of ochronosis such as joint pain, low back pain and renal stones developed in childhood in 7 patients. Eight patients were diagnosed with depression via psychiatric evaluation. There were 14 (21.2%) patients operated on for ochronosis. The most frequent mutation observed in the patients was c.175delA, which was followed by c.674G > A and c.1007-2A > T mutations. Four novel mutations (c.189G > A, c.549+1G > T, c.1188+1G > A, and c.334 T > G) were identified in the patients included in the study. In addition to the known signs such as dark urine and skin pigmentation, symptoms involving different systems such as neurological findings and depression can also be encountered in AKU patients. The presence of a change in urine color needs to be questioned in patients presenting with different symptoms such as arthralgia/arthritis, renal stones or low-back pain, particularly in childhood, when skin ochronosis is not pronounced, and further examination should be performed.

Outcomes included being ""on-track"" in each domain as well as overall health development. Using a Generalized Estimation Equation with a log-link function, while accounting for interactions between ethnoracial background, income, and income-squared, we found significant health development inequities by ethnoracial background and neighborhood-level income. Regarding overall health development, as well as the physical, social and emotional domains, Black students had a lower likelihood of being on-track compared to the weighted average across income levels, whereas Asian students surpassed the weighted average. White students exhibited the steepest slope, and at the lowest income levels, their health development scores were akin to their Black and Hispanic/Latino/a low-income counterparts but resembled their Asian counterparts at higher income levels. For the general knowledge and communication domain, white students consistently had the highest likelihood of being on-track, while Hispanic/Latino/a students had the lowest likelihood across all income levels. This study examines health development inequities among California kindergarteners in diverse communities. Our analysis shows that the relationship between neighborhood-level income and kindergartners' health development varies by domain and is weaker for students of color.

Model performance and reader agreement had highest scores for level-1 signal (median Dice 0.68) and lowest scores for level-3 signal (median Dice 0.40), particularly in examinations where this signal was sparse. It is feasible to develop a deep-learning-based model for automated segmentation of bone marrow signal in children and adolescents.

Seven patients from four unrelated families (F1, F2, F3, F4) were clinically assessed for visual acuity, color vision, ptosis, afferent pupillary defects, and visual fields and underwent orthoptic assessment, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and fundus examination to establish their clinical status. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples from all participants. The coding region (exons 1-28), including the intron-exon boundaries of the OPA1 gene, was screened in the probands of the four families, as well as in seven additional family members (four affected and three unaffected) with PCR and direct DNA sequencing. All patients presented bilateral decrease in best-corrected visual acuity and temporal pallor of the optic disc. The visual fields of the adult patients showed characteristic scotomata. Other signs were present in some patients such as decreased color discrimination and a gray crescent within the neuroretinal rim. After the OPA1 gene was sequenced, a previously undescribed heterozygous splice-site mutation c.784-1G>T in intron 7 was detected in family F2. In families F1, F3, and F4, a previously reported in-frame deletion c.876_878delTGT/p.(Val294del), the frameshift c.2366delA/p.(Asn789Metfs*11), and splice-site c.1140+5G>C mutations were detected, respectively.

Sunlight has long been recognized as a major provider of vitamin D and lighter skin color has been associated with better vitamin D status. In this context, we aimed to determine whether 25-hydroxyvitamin D[25-(OH)D] concentrations are related to skin color, sun exposure and gender among healthy Saudi children and adults. A total of 808 Saudi children (age=14.6±0.04years) and 561 (age=31.4±0.3years) adults of both genders were included in this study. Levels of sun exposure and skin color were determined using a standard questionnaire. Anthropometry and plasma 25-(OH)D concentrations were analyzed. On the basis of duration of sun exposure (<20min vs. >20min), a significantly lower concentration of 25-(OH)D (40.9±1.2 vs. 35.5±1.8nmol/l; p<0.019) was demonstrated in dark-skinned boys with exposure time less than 20min than those exposed longer than 20min.

AAP is likely a key contributor to the excess burden of asthma in children of color due to pervasive exposure before birth, at home, and in school. Recent findings suggest that psychosocial stressors may modify the relationship between AAP and asthma. The effect of AAP on asthma in children of color is likely modulated by multiple unique psychosocial stressors and gene-environment interactions.

Success was defined as restored erectile function without recurrent priapism. The major etiology of HFP is trauma, especially in children or young adults; in older men, HFP is a rare event mainly caused by malignoma. Cavernosal blood-gas analysis, color-Doppler ultrasound and angiography were the most effective diagnostic tools to distinguish high- from low-flow priapism. The success rate was 20% for shunt operations and 89% for arterial embolization. In conclusion, embolization was effective in the majority of cases of traumatic HFP, while shunt surgery remained disappointing.

Transient CH can be treated with short-term thyroxine replacement therapy or followed up without therapy, whereas lifelong thyroxine replacement is needed in permanent CH. Determination of the underlying etiology is essential for determination of follow-up strategy. The purpose of the present study was therefore to assess the role of color Doppler ultrasonography (CDU) in etiologic diagnosis of CH together with radionuclide method and grayscale ultrasonography (GSU). A total of 182 patients (83 female, 99 male) were evaluated. To determine etiologic diagnosis, the patients underwent a free T4 (fT4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and urinary iodine level measurement, and thyroid scintigraphy, perchlorate discharge test, CDU, and GSU. Fifty-four patients had transient and 97 had permanent CH. Isolated hyperthyrotropinemia was diagnosed in 31 patients. Transient CH was due to iodine deficiency in 22 and excess iodine in 13 patients. In 97 patients with permanent CH, ectopia was present in 32 patients and agenesis of the thyroid gland was found in 22 patients, while 43 were diagnosed with dyshormonogenesis. In the ectopia group, GSU failed to detect ectopic tissues in all cases, whereas CDU was successful in determining the presence of ectopic thyroid in 20 cases. The sensitivity of CDU was 80% in determining ectopic tissue. To determine etiologic diagnosis, radionuclide methods and sonographic modalities should be assessed together. The gold standard in the diagnosis of ectopic thyroid tissue is thyroid scintigraphy. CDU may be a major supportive diagnostic tool in the evaluation of ectopic thyroid gland.

Rapid addition of newer strains to this group necessitates heightened suspicion in the clinical settings. Specific requirements for cultures, biochemical testing, and molecular methods are needed to diagnose these organisms. The prospective study conducted at Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences from January 2019 to December 2021 using various clinical samples using molecular techniques such as line probe assay and hsp-65 gene sequencing to discover new NTM species. The management is challenging since it requires prolonged treatment, multiple drugs, drug resistance, and individualization of treatment in the combination of surgery if needed. In this article, we describe three different NTM species which were not reported in India and highlight to consider these organisms in adequate clinical situation. Mycobacterium iranicum is a rare strain with quick growth and scotochromogenic colonies that are orange-colored. Eight distinct strains were discovered in clinical samples from six different countries: Two each from Iran, Italy, Greece, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States.

Institutional review board approval was obtained for this HIPAA-compliant study. Thirty-four consecutive retrospectively identified patients in whom a compressed-sensing parallel-imaging 4D phase-contrast sequence was performed as part of routine clinical cardiac MR imaging between March 2010 and August 2011 and who had undergone echocardiography were included. Multiplanar, volume-rendered, and stereoscopic three-dimensional velocity-fusion visualization algorithms were developed and implemented in Java and OpenGL. Two radiologists independently reviewed 4D phase-contrast studies for each of 34 patients (mean age, 6 years; age range, 10 months to 21 years) and tabulated visible shunts and valvular regurgitation. These results were compared with color Doppler echocardiographic and cardiac MR imaging reports, which were generated without 4D phase-contrast visualization. Cohen κ statistics were computed to assess interobserver agreement and agreement with echocardiographic results. The 4D phase-contrast acquisitions were performed, on average, in less than 10 minutes. Among 123 valves seen in 34 4D phase-contrast studies, 29 regurgitant valves were identified, with good agreement between observers (k=0.85). There was also good agreement with the presence of at least mild regurgitation at echocardiography (observer 1, κ=0.76; observer 2, κ=0.77) with high sensitivity (observer 1, 75%; observer 2, 82%) and specificity (observer 1, 97%; observer 2, 95%) relative to the reference standard. Eight intracardiac shunts were identified, four of which were not visible with conventional cardiac MR imaging but were detected with echocardiography. No intracardiac shunts were found with echocardiography alone. With velocity-fusion visualization, the compressed-sensing parallel-imaging 4D phase-contrast sequence can augment conventional cardiac MR imaging by improving sensitivity for and depiction of hemodynamically significant shunts and valvular regurgitation.

Eighteen DSA examinations from 18 patients with MMD and 14 control participants were included.

The relative TTP (rTTP) values were then obtained by subtracting the TTP of the cerebellum. The Td was significantly longer in the patients with MMD presenting with infarction than in the control group. The Td significantly correlated with the angiographic Suzuki grading system and showed closer correlation with prolonged rTTP in the medial frontal, lateral frontal, and parietal regions compared with Suzuki grading. The Td significantly correlated with conventional angiographic grading and with the status of hemodynamic impairment in patients with MMD.

In vitro, PfHRP2 was secreted mainly during the second half of the asexual cycle with a marked rise during schizont development and rupture. The total PfHRP2 secreted before schizogony corresponded to approximately 4% of that contained in the red blood cells. In samples from 55 patients with acute falciparum malaria, the level of detection by ELISA corresponded to parasitaemias of 100/microL for whole blood and 1600/microL for separated plasma. Whole blood PfHRP2 levels were correlated significantly with admission parasitaemia (r = 0.76, P < 0.0001) and the stage of parasite development (r = 0.43, P < 0.01). Although whole blood PfHRP2 concentrations were higher in severe malaria, plasma concentrations of PfHRP2 were considerably higher in severe malaria (median titre 1:320, range zero to 1:1280) than in uncomplicated malaria (median titre 1:5, range zero to 1:80; P < 0.0001). The ratio of whole blood to plasma PfHRP2 was lower in severe than in uncomplicated malaria (median 4, range 0.25 to 256, versus 64, range 4 to 1280; P < 0.0001). With plasma samples the intensity of colour change on the dipstick correlated well with more precise measurement of optical density in the ELISA (r = 0.88, P < 0.0001).

180,180,20533130,"Consensus has not been reached regarding the treatment of ovarian torsion in premenarchal girls. If viable adnexa can be salvaged, the future reproductive potential of the girl is maximized. The authors determined the predominant etiology, evaluated the restoration of ovarian function and anatomic structure postoperatively in premenarchal girls with adnexal torsion, and discuss the most appropriate treatment. Sixty-six premenarchal girls with twisted adnexa underwent salpingoophorectomy (27 cases), or detorsion and adnexal conservation surgery (39 cases), according to the extent of adnexal damage found intraoperatively. These patients' data were collected and analyzed. The typical presentation, predominant etiology, surgical outcome, and restoration of ovarian function postoperatively were investigated. Of all torsive ovaries, histopathology verified that 2 (3.0%) cases were malignant, 8 (12.1%) cases were normal, and 56 (84.9%) cases were benign. After operation and menarche, ultrasound showed that the involved ovaries were of normal size with normal follicular development in 33 of the 35 (94.3%) patients who received detorsion and adnexal conservation surgery. In the remaining two (5.7%) of the 35 detorsion patients, the affected ovaries were atrophied (small sized) and there was no ultrasound evidence of follicular development. Premenarchal girls with adnexal torsion more commonly had a benign ovarian tumor or no underlying abnormality as an etiology; ovarian malignancy was rare. In the management of these cases, detorsion and adnexal conservation surgery should be considered in cases with adnexa appearing to be ischemic or hemorrhagic infarction.

We used quantitative measures of exposed (facultative) and unexposed (constitutive) skin color to examine relations between serum 25(OH)D concentration, tanning, race/ethnicity, and constitutive skin color over the summer, following winter vitamin D supplementation. The subjects (n= 426, mean age 11.7 ± 1.4 y, 51% female) were racially/ethnically diverse schoolchildren (57% non-white/Caucasian) enrolled in a 6-mo vitamin D supplementation trial (October-December to April-June). In this secondary analysis, measures of serum 25(OH)D concentration and skin color, with the use of reflectance colorimetry, were taken over a 6-mo period after supplementation, from pre-summer (April-June) to post-summer (September-December). Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate longitudinal relations. Following supplementation, mean serum 25(OH)D concentration was 29.3 ± 9.5 ng/mL but fell to 25.6 ± 7.9 ng/mL (P< 0.0001) by the end of summer. The decrease in white/Caucasian children was less than in black/African American children (P< 0.01) and tended to be less than in Hispanic/Latino, Asian, and multiracial/other children (P= 0.19-0.50) despite similar changes in sun-exposed skin color among all groups. Tanning was significantly associated with post-summer serum 25(OH)D concentration (β = -0.15,P< 0.0001), as was race/ethnicity (P= 0.0002), but the later association disappeared after adjusting for constitutive skin color. Tanning significantly contributed to serum 25(OH)D concentration over the summer, independent of race/ethnicity, but was not sufficient to maintain serum 25(OH)D concentration attained with supplementation.

The endocrine disrupting potential of these compounds is of increasing public health concern. The aim of this study is to understand the current exposure profile of these chemicals in last void before bedtime (night-time) and first-morning void (first-morning) urines among a Korean population and to characterize their exposure sources and pathways. A total of 261 people, including infants (0-2 years), toddlers (3-6 years), children (7-12 years), adolescents (13-18 years), and adults (≥19 years), were recruited, and sampled for night-time urine and first-morning urine of the following day. Methyl (MeP), ethyl (EtP), propyl (PrP) and butyl paraben (BuP), and triclosan were measured in urine. The demographic characteristics, use of personal care products, and food consumption were obtained through a questionnaire. Among the target compounds, EtP and MeP were most frequently detected at the highest concentrations. The median concentration of EtP in night-time urine was 32.4 μg/L (interquartile range: 8.37-82.8 μg/L), which is higher than previously reported worldwide. Unlike other test compounds, compared to those measured from first-morning urine, the EtP concentrations were significantly higher in night-time urine, suggesting the presence of different exposure sources. Among adults, the MeP and PrP concentrations in night-time urine were associated with frequent use of skin care products, colored cosmetics, bath products, toothpaste, vinyl food packaging, or consumption of canned food. The MeP and PrP concentrations were higher in females than in males, especially in night-time urine. The results of this study also show that multiple urine samples are necessary to capture the diurnal variation of non-occupational exposure to environmental chemicals, such as parabens.

186,186,34070118,"Recent studies have shown that parental educational attainment is associated with a larger superior temporal cortical surface area associated with higher reading ability in children. Simultaneously, the marginalization-related diminished returns (MDRs) framework suggests that, due to structural racism and social stratification, returns of parental education are smaller for black and other racial/ethnic minority children compared to their white counterparts. This study used a large national sample of 9-10-year-old American children to investigate associations between parental educational attainment, the right and left superior temporal cortical surface area, and reading ability across diverse racial/ethnic groups. This was a cross-sectional analysis that included 10,817 9-10-year-old children from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Parental educational attainment was treated as a five-level categorical variable. Children's right and left superior temporal cortical surface area and reading ability were continuous variables. Race/ethnicity was the moderator. To adjust for the nested nature of the ABCD data, mixed-effects regression models were used to test the associations between parental education, superior temporal cortical surface area, and reading ability overall and by race/ethnicity. Overall, high parental educational attainment was associated with greater superior temporal cortical surface area and reading ability in children. In the pooled sample, we found statistically significant interactions between race/ethnicity and parental educational attainment on children's right and left superior temporal cortical surface area, suggesting that high parental educational attainment has a smaller boosting effect on children's superior temporal cortical surface area for black than white children. We also found a significant interaction between race and the left superior temporal surface area on reading ability, indicating weaker associations for Alaskan Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders (AIAN/NHPI) than white children. We also found interactions between race and parental educational attainment on reading ability, indicating more potent effects for black children than white children. While parental educational attainment may improve children's superior temporal cortical surface area, promoting reading ability, this effect may be unequal across racial/ethnic groups. To minimize the racial/ethnic gap in children's brain development and school achievement, we need to address societal barriers that diminish parental educational attainment's marginal returns for middle-class minority families. Social and public policies need to go beyond equal access and address structural and societal barriers that hinder middle-class families of color and their children. Future research should test how racism, social stratification, segregation, and discrimination, which shape the daily lives of non-white individuals, take a toll on children's brains and academic development.

187,187,26280141,"Because childhood rashes may be difficult to differentiate by appearance alone, it is important to consider the entire clinical presentation to help make the appropriate diagnosis. Considerations include the appearance and location of the rash; the clinical course; and associated symptoms, such as pruritus or fever. A fever is likely to occur with roseola, erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), and scarlet fever. Pruritus sometimes occurs with atopic dermatitis, pityriasis rosea, erythema infectiosum, molluscum contagiosum, and tinea infection. The key feature of roseola is a rash presenting after resolution of a high fever, whereas the distinguishing features in pityriasis rosea are a herald patch and a bilateral and symmetric rash in a Christmas tree pattern. The rash associated with scarlet fever usually develops on the upper trunk, then spreads throughout the body, sparing the palms and soles. Impetigo is a superficial bacterial infection that most commonly affects the face and extremities of children. Erythema infectiosum is characterized by a viral prodrome followed by the ""slapped cheek"" facial rash.

Vascular hitch procedures are often performed as associated intrinsic obstruction is not expected. We compared data and intravenous urography (IVU) findings of patients with aberrant CV versus those with intrinsic UPJO, all undergoing open dismembered pyeloplasty. Is accurate pre-operative diagnosis of aberrant CV causing extrinsic UPJO possible? To assess differences in the demographic, clinical, radiological, intra-operative features and postoperative improvement after pyeloplasty between patients with a CV and those with only intrinsic UPJO. Prospective study of all children below 12 years with UPJO presenting to a tertiary referral centre and who underwent open Anderson - Hynes dismembered pyeloplasty between 2003 and 2013 was conducted. Pre-operative investigations included serial ultrasonography, renal dynamic [ethylene di-cysteine (EC)] scan and IVU. These were repeated 3 months after pyeloplasty. Pre-operative IVUs of children with CV were compared with the IVUs of an equal number of similar aged children, randomly selected from the intrinsic obstruction group. Pyeloplasty was performed in 643 children during the study period. Data of 33 children with aberrant CVs (mean age 6.99 years) were compared with the remaining 610 children (mean age 3.27 years) with only intrinsic obstruction. Highly significant associations of those with CV included age above 2 years, female gender, associated anomalies, abdominal pain in those above 2 years and poor preoperative function on IVU. Specific IVU features which were statistically highly significant in favor of presence of CV were small, intrarenal and globular flat bottomed pelvis. (Figure) Calyceal dilatation was also more prominent in the CV group. A funnel shaped, extrarenal pelvis was highly significant in favor of intrinsic obstruction. There was associated intrinsic obstruction in addition to CV obstruction in 8 children. All children symptomatically improved after pyeloplasty and did well on long term follow up. The majority showed improvement or stabilization of function on EC scan. With the advent of antenatal ultrasonography, most children with UPJO are detected early. Children with CV tend to present later. This is often detected during surgery. Color Doppler is useful but is operator dependant and not performed routinely. In this study, IVU showed the presence of obstruction and loss of function unlike color Doppler, but also revealed specific diagnostic features not previously reported in literature. This can help in accurate preoperative prediction and avoid endopyelotomy, or a dorsal lumbotomy/retroperitoneal approach. Renal function in CVs is expected to be good as the obstruction is thought to be intermittent. However, we noted delayed contrast uptake on IVU in 60.6% and differential renal function on EC scan below 40% in 17 patients (56.6%). These indicate the effect of the obstruction on the renal parenchyma and the importance of early detection. Higher association with other anomalies and higher incidence in females has also not been emphasized in the literature so far. We noted associated intrinsic obstruction in 24.24% patients which is highly significant. This category of patients is likely to be missed and inappropriately treated if a ""vascular hitch procedure"" is performed. None of our patients had postoperative complications. Characteristic features were seen on IVU helping in preoperative diagnosis which can be extrapolated to magnetic resonance urography. There is a higher association of CV in age above 2 years, females, associated congenital anomalies, delayed uptake on IVU and differential renal function below 40% compared to intrinsic obstruction. Associated intrinsic obstruction in 24% with no postoperative complications indicates the superiority of dismembered pyeloplasty over vasculopexy procedures.

Respiratory effort represents both the main input into the system and its functional output (sustained respirations). The progressive deterioration of functions during asphyxia, and their recovery during resuscitation, are readily understood within the sequence.

197,197,22841633,"Dental caries is a significant public health problem especially amongst children from low-income backgrounds. This longitudinal study examined the development of new occlusal caries in 227 Newark, NJ children ages 10-18. The role of previous caries experience and the presence of occlusal white and dark lesions in predicting the development of new lesions were examined. At each visit, the patient's teeth were given a visual-tactile examination and the subject's decayed, missing and filled (DMFS) score was determined. Next, molars lacking probeable caries or restorations were examined using transillumination for occlusal white and dark spots. This examination was repeated periodically. A Cox proportional hazard was used to analyse data concerning the development of new occusal caries in molars. The longitudinal data indicates that patients who were caries free at visit-1 developed significantly fewer occlusal caries during the longitudinal study. The hazard ratio for subjects who had first-visit caries was 2.27 compared to caries free subjects. Intact molars with occlusal white or dark lesions had caries hazard ratios of 0.78 and 1.49 respectively, compared to molars lacking initial colour changes. Having a prior caries history places the subject at increased risk of developing future caries. Teeth with dark lesions but not white lesions are at significantly increased risk for developing decay. White lesions may represent remineralizing or slowly progressing lesions. The results of this study can help identify patients and tooth surfaces at risk for future occlusal decay.

The reasons for these collections were after open surgery on the kidney in 11, open surgery on the ureter in 10, percutaneous nephrostolithotomy in 2, after renal transplantation in 5, and after ureteroscopy in 2. The presenting symptoms and signs included flank pain in 12, urine leakage in 5, fever in 5, masses in the iliac fossa in 5, and flank mass in 3. Ultrasound-guided single-step drainage of these collections was done using 10-12 F catheters. Ultrasound-guided single-step percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) was done prior to drainage of the collection in seven patients in whom ultrasound revealed back pressure changes in their renal units. Pigtail catheters (7-10 F) were used for PCN. The aspirated fluid was clear urine in 12 cases and turbid in 18. The amount of fluid drained ranged from 150-500 mL immediately after the procedure. We used color Doppler sonography to map the site of puncture. No complications were encountered after drainage. The period of drainage varied from 1 week to 37 days. Further intervention was needed in 12 cases due to development of ureteric stricture in 7, prolonged leakage in 3 (one after transplantation, one after ureterocolic anastomosis, and one after ureterolithotomy), and residual stones in 2. Double-J stenting was done in four cases. We conclude that ultrasound-guided drainage of perirenal and periureteral collections is a safe, rapid, and easy method of treatment and should eliminate the need for exploration to drain these collections.

Children with a clinical and molecular diagnosis of ABCA4-associated retinopathy without evidence of macular atrophy. The retinal phenotype was characterized by color fundus photography, OCT, fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging, electroretinography, and in 2 patients, adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO). Sequencing of the ABCA4 gene was performed in all patients. Visual acuity, OCT, FAF, electroretinography, and AOSLO results. Eight children with ABCA4-associated retinopathy without macular atrophy were identified. Biallelic variants in ABCA4 were identified in all patients. Four children were asymptomatic, and 4 reported loss of VA. Patients were young (median age, 8.5 years; interquartile range, 6.8 years) with good visual acuity (median, 0.155 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR]; interquartile range, 0.29 logMAR). At presentation, the macula appeared normal (n = 3), had a subtly altered foveal reflex (n = 4), or demonstrated manifest fine yellow dots (n = 1). Fundus autofluorescence identified hyperautofluorescent dots in the central macula in 3 patients, 2 of whom showed a normal fundus appearance. Only 1 child had widespread hyperautofluorescent retinal flecks at presentation. OCT imaging identified hyperreflectivity at the base of the outer nuclear layer in all 8 patients. Where loss of outer nuclear volume was evident, this appeared to occur preferentially at a perifoveal locus. Longitudinal split-detector AOSLO imaging in 2 individuals confirmed that the greatest change in cone spacing occurred in the perifoveal, and not foveolar, photoreceptors. Electroretinography showed a reduced B-wave-to-A-wave ratio in 3 of 5 patients tested; in 2 children, recordings clearly showed electronegative results. In childhood-onset ABCA4-associated retinopathy, the earliest stages of macular atrophy involve the parafovea and spare the foveola. In some cases, these changes are predated by tiny, foveal, yellow, hyperautofluorescent dots. Hyperreflectivity at the base of the outer nuclear layer, previously described as thickening of the external limiting membrane, is likely to represent a structural change at the level of the foveal cone nuclei. Electroretinography suggests that the initial site of retinal dysfunction may occur after phototransduction.

Previous studies on rheumatic heart disease in Nigeria were either clinical or retrospective echocardiographic studies. This study was aimed at determining the burden of chronic rheumatic mitral valve disease, pattern of valvular involvement, severity and associated valvular lesions, using echocardiography. Between May, 2004 and April 2005, patients with symptomatic rheumatic heart disease, seen in the cardiac clinics of University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, were recruited for the study. The patients were investigated non-invasively with M-mode, Two-dimensional, Pulsed wave, Continuous wave and colour flow Doppler echocardiographic techniques in order to assess the mitral and other intracardiac valves for evidence of rheumatic heart disease. There were a total of 55 patients, 39 (70.9%) females and 16 (29.1%) males with a mean age of 29.34 +/- 11.57 years. Mitral valve disease was found in 54 (98.2%) and isolated aortic valve disease in 1 (1.8%) of cases. Mitral regurgitation occurred in 64.8%, mixed mitral valve disease in 25.9% and pure mitral stenosis in 9.3%. Mitral valve disease was associated with aortic valve disease in 33.3%, with tricuspid valve disease in 24.1% and with functional pulmonary incompetence in 9.3% of cases. Rheumatic heart disease in Nigeria is essentially a disease of the mitral valve as seen elsewhere in the world.

215,215,11969318,"We used fMRI to investigate developmental changes in brain activation during a Stroop color-word interference task. A positive correlation was observed between age and Stroop-related activation (n = 30) in the left lateral prefrontal cortex, the left anterior cingulate, and the left parietal and parieto-occipital cortices. No regions showed a negative correlation between activation and age. We further investigated age-related differences by stratifying the sample into three age groups: children (ages 7-11), adolescents (ages 12-16), and young adults (ages 18-22). Young adult subjects (n = 11) displayed significant activation in the inferior and middle frontal gyri bilaterally, the left anterior cingulate, and bilateral inferior and superior parietal lobules. Between-group comparisons revealed that young adults had significantly greater activation than adolescent subjects (n = 11) in the left middle frontal gyrus and that young adults showed significantly greater activation than children (n = 8) in the anterior cingulate and left parietal and parieto-occipital regions, as well as in the left middle frontal gyrus. Compared to children, both adult and adolescent subjects exhibited significantly greater activation in the parietal cortex. Adult and adolescent groups, however, did not differ in activation for this region. Together, these data suggest that Stroop task-related functional development of the parietal lobe occurs by adolescence. In contrast, prefrontal cortex function contributing to the Stroop interference task continues to develop into adulthood. This neuromaturational process may depend on increased ability to recruit focal neural resources with age. Findings from this study, the first developmental fMRI investigation of the Stroop interference task, provide a template with which normal development and neurodevelopmental disorders of prefrontal cortex function can be assessed.

Outcomes from both scoring approaches were compared with the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL), Color-Object Association Test (COAT), and Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function for preschool children (BRIEF-P). A total of 44 children 44 to 65 months of age were evaluated with the ECVT, COAT, MSEL, and BRIEF-P. Tobii ×2-30 portable infrared cameras were programmed to monitor pupil direction during the ECVT 6-min animation and compared with observer-based PROCODER webcam scoring. Children watched 78% of the cartoon (Tobii) compared with 67% (webcam scoring), although the 2 measures were highly correlated (r = .90, p = .001). It is possible for 2 such measures to be highly correlated even if one is consistently higher than the other (Bergemann et al., 2012). Both ECVT Tobii and webcam ECVT measures significantly correlated with COAT immediate recall (r = .37, p = .02 vs. r = .38, p = .01, respectively) and total recall (r = .33, p = .06 vs. r = .42, p = .005) measures. However, neither the Tobii eye tracking nor PROCODER webcam ECVT measures of attention correlated with MSEL composite cognitive performance or BRIEF-P global executive composite. ECVT scoring using Tobii eye tracking is feasible with at-risk very young African children and consistent with webcam-based scoring approaches in their correspondence to one another and other neurocognitive performance-based measures. By automating measurement and scoring, eye tracking technologies can improve the efficiency and help better standardize ECVT testing of attention in younger children. This holds promise for other neurodevelopmental tests where eye movements, tracking, and gaze length can provide important behavioral markers of neuropsychological and neurodevelopmental processes associated with such tests.

A computer program, continuous potential display (CPD), was designed to animate the color-coded potential changes in 5-msec intervals at each recorded site. This program was used to analyze 35 ictal ECoGs recorded by subdural grid electrodes from 11 subjects who underwent epilepsy surgery for intractable partial seizures. Continuous potential display demonstrated recurrent cycles of seizure propagation from the EZ to the surrounding cortical area even when seizure discharges appeared widespread on ECoG. Hence, the EZ could be mapped at any time during the seizure course. The EZ mapped by analyzing a small fraction of ECoG during widespread seizure discharges using CPD only overlapped 69 +/- 24% (mean +/- standard deviation) of the surgical area. The EZ mapped by CPD had 34 +/- 22% false positives and 35 +/- 27% false negatives.

223,223,34735597,"Still's syndrome includes systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) and the adult form of Still's disease (adult-onset Still's disease, AOSD). Except for age, there are many similarities between sJIA and AOSD. A biphasic disease model is currently put forth. At disease onset, autoinflammation predominates, which is caused by dysregulation of the innate immune system. Later on, the disease can progress to a chronic-articular form, which is predominantly mediated by the adaptive immune system and is consequently due to autoimmunity. The ""window-of-opportunity"" hypothesis is based on this biphasic model and supports the assumption that an early, targeted therapy with cytokine blockade can prevent disease progression to chronic destructive arthritis. Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a serious complication of the so-called cytokine storm during the systemic phase of the disease. Clinically, there are many similarities between sJIA and AOSD. Recurrent fever, a fleeting, salmon-colored rash, and arthralgia/arthritis are common signs and symptoms of both sJIA and AOSD. The few differences are mainly related to the therapies and their side effects in children versus adults. In addition, the contribution of genetics to pathogenesis is more pronounced in sJIA compared to AOSD, but there are also smooth transitions in this respect and both diseases are heavily influenced by exogenous factors such as microbial triggers. Future research aspects could include additional investigation of these triggers such as viruses, bacteria, or dysbiosis of the human microbiome. Die systemische juvenile idiopathische Arthritis (sJIA) und die adulte Form des Morbus Still („adult-onset Still’s disease“, AOSD) gehören zum Still-Syndrom. Bis auf das Lebensalter finden sich viele Gemeinsamkeiten zwischen sJIA und AOSD. Heutzutage wird ein biphasisches Krankheitsmodell angenommen. Initial steht dabei die Autoinflammation im Vordergrund, die v. a. durch die Dysregulation des angeborenen Immunsystem bedingt ist. Im späteren Verlauf kann die Erkrankung zu einer chronisch-artikulären Verlaufsform wechseln, die vorwiegend durch das adaptive Immunsystem und somit durch Autoimmunität hervorgerufen wird. Die Hypothese des „Window of Opportunity“ beruht auf diesem biphasischen Modell und besagt, dass durch eine frühe zielgerichtete Therapie ein Wechsel der Verlaufsformen verhindert werden kann. Eine schwere Komplikation des „Zytokinsturms“ der systemischen Krankheitsphase stellt das Makrophagenaktivierungssyndrom dar. Klinisch bestehen viele Gemeinsamkeiten zwischen sJIA und AOSD. So gehören u. a. rezidivierende Fieberschübe, ein flüchtiges lachsfarbenes Exanthem und Arthralgien bzw. Arthritis zu häufigen Beschwerden in allen Altersgruppen.

To identify further banana cultivars that may be promoted to alleviate vitamin A deficiency among children and women and chronic disease problems among adults. Ripe fruit of banana cultivars growing in Australia (sourced mostly from a field research collection) were assessed for carotenoid content and flesh color.

Carotenoid content was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Flesh color was analyzed by HunterLab colorimetry. The yellow/orange-fleshed Asupina (a Fe'i banana) contained the highest level (1,412 microg/100 g) of trans beta-carotene, the most important provitamin A carotenoid, a level more than 20 times higher than that of Williams. All 10 yellow or yellow/orange-fleshed cultivars (Asupina, Kirkirnan, Pisang Raja, Horn Plantain, Pacific Plantain, Kluai Khai Bonng, Wain, Red Dacca, Lakatan, and Sucrier) had significant carotenoid levels, potentially meeting half or all of the estimated vitamin A requirements for a nonpregnant, nonlactating adult woman within normal consumption patterns. All were acceptable for taste and other attributes. The cream-fleshed cultivars had minimal carotenoid levels. There was a positive significant correlation between carotenoid content and deeper yellow/orange coloration indicators.

Children with a high caries index DMFT are more likely to develop high levels of dental anxiety, which will influence the degree of cooperation during dental procedures. Emotions play an important role in the psychosomatic development of children, and all the factors that contribute to the modeling of these emotional states must be known and taken into consideration. The aim of this study was to assess the association between dental anxiety in children with S-ECC and the color preferences for the components of the dental environment to reduce the levels of dental anxiety during medical visits. For this study, 91 children between 3 and 6 years of age diagnosed with S-ECC were selected from the Pediatric Dentistry Department of UMFST from Targu Mures and from a private dental office. The level of dental anxiety was determined by measuring the pulse rate, and a questionnaire was completed to establish the color preferences for the dental office environment and the dentist's attire. For this purpose, six different colors and their variants with three shades less intensity were chosen by using RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) identification codes for each color. The results showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the age of the subjects and dental anxiety levels, but there was no significant correlation between the DMFT score and dental anxiety. Also, the results showed that there was no significant difference between girls and boys when choosing the colors preferred by them for the dental office, but when comparing the colors that represented happiness, significant statistical difference was found between the girls' and boys' groups ( The data obtained showed that dental anxiety is strongly influenced by age, and an important role in inducing positive emotions is played by the dental environment if dressed in specific colors in order to reduce dental anxiety and create familiar conditions, especially for young children with S-ECC.

Successful manual detorsion was defined as complete pain resolution with a normal color Doppler ultrasound. All patients underwent surgical exploration. Patient data analyzed included: age, pain duration, site of onset, attempt of manual detorsion, pain relief after manual detorsion, color Doppler ultrasound results, surgical findings and outcome. One hundred twenty-two patients were included. Manual detorsion was attempted in 48% (58/122) cases. Manual detorsion was successful in 26% (15/58) patients.

236,236,15518223,"Congenital achromatopsia is a stationary retinal disorder with autosomal recessive inheritance. It is characterized by significant attenuation of cone-photoreceptor function. Symptoms include photophobia, nystagmus, and poor visual acuity from birth. Unlike in cone or cone-rod dystrophies, the retinal fundus usually appears normal. Here we describe two siblings with congenital achromatopsia, who exhibit different ophthalmic phenotypes. History was taken, and ophthalmic examinations were performed in a 7-year-old girl and her 5-year-old brother, who were referred to our department because of poor visual acuity. Two of their grandparents were brother and sister, suggesting an autosomal recessive transmission in inheritance. They have been followed for more than 13 years since the initial evaluation. Symptoms, visual acuity, and kinetic visual field were very similar to each other, consistent with findings of typical congenital achromatopsia. However, color-vision tests suggested that the brother had residual color discrimination, but the sister did not. The siblings had different full-field electroretinographic and spectral-sensitivity findings: residual cone functions were detected in only the brother, in agreement with his residual color vision. They also had different findings of retinal fundi and ocular refractions: the sister had bilaterally atrophic-appearing macular lesions and myopic errors. In contrast, the brother remains hyperopia and has exhibited no specific retinal findings until age 18 years. The causes why both complete and incomplete achromats occur in the siblings are uncertain but might be caused by modifying effects of sex-related genes or by environmental factors influencing certain gene regulations in cone photoreceptors.

Children aged 6-16 years with myopia were randomly allocated 2:1 to nightly 0.01% atropine or placebo eye drops in both eyes for 2 years. The primary outcome was cycloplegic spherical equivalent (SE) progression at 24 months. Secondary outcomes included axial length (AL) change, safety and acceptability. Linear mixed models with random intercepts were used for statistical analyses. Of 250 participants enrolled, 204 (81.6%) completed the 24-month visit (136 (81.4%) treatment, 68 (81.9%) placebo). Baseline characteristics, drop-out and adverse event rates were similar between treatment and control groups. At 24 months, SE change was not significantly different between 0.01% atropine and placebo groups (effect = 0.10 D, p = 0.07), but AL growth was lower in the 0.01% atropine group, compared to the placebo group (-0.07 mm, p = 0.007).

238,238,29722172,"The rapid diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis in children remains challenging. The presence of enlarged lymph nodes provides an opportunity to obtain diagnostic material through fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). Mycobacterial culture, traditionally the reference standard, has a slow turnaround time and PCR-based methods are not widely available in developing countries. Direct visualization of mycobacteria on microscopy can be a rapid method to confirm the diagnosis. This study compared three staining methods to visualize mycobacteria. Hundred FNAB specimens from persistently enlarged lymph nodes in children, clinically suspicious for tuberculosis, were evaluated for the presence of mycobacteria by three staining methods: Papanicolaou induced fluorescence (PIF) and Auramine O staining using fluorescence microscopy and Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining using conventional light microscopy. These methods were evaluated against mycobacterial culture. PIF positivity was 30%, with 38% and 48% for Auramine O and ZN respectively. The combined ZN/PIF positivity was 56%. The highest diagnostic accuracy (73%) was demonstrated by ZN alone and in combination with PIF, with PIF alone showing the lowest (49%) accuracy. Although the combined test showed the highest sensitivity, it had the lowest specificity, while ZN was significantly more sensitive than both other staining modalities. No statistical difference in specificity was seen among the tests. This study suggests that Auramine O staining on previously ZN stained slides does not significantly improve diagnostic accuracy. While currently widely available methods of direct visualization of mycobacteria suffer from low sensitivity, the ZN stain remains a useful diagnostic test, particularly in resource-constrained countries.

While previous research emphasized the relationship between impulsivity and child sexual offending, not pedophilia per se, studies on the underlying neurobiological mechanisms in subdomains of impulsivity remained scarce. Here, we focused on interference inhibition and examined event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of three groups of men performing a color-word Stroop task: (1) pedophiles with a history of CSO (P+CSO, n = 11), (2) pedophiles without a history of CSO (P-CSO, n = 8) and (3) non-pedophilic, non-offending healthy controls (HC, n = 10). On the behavioral level, P+CSO revealed increased Stroop interference as compared to P-CSO and HC. Moreover, increased Stroop interference in P+CSO was accompanied by enhanced conflict-related activity in left superior parietal cortex and precentral gyrus as compared to P-CSO. Albeit behavioral analyses of error and post-error processing revealed no significant between-group differences, P-CSO showed increased post-error-related activity in left posterior cingulate, precuneus and middle temporal gyrus as compared to P+CSO.

Potential late effects of PS despite PBPV on cardiac mechanics have not been well defined. Thirty-one patients aged 20.2 ± 7.6 years were studied at 18 ± 6 years after PBPV. Ventricular myocardial deformation was determined using speckle tracking echocardiography, while RV and LV volumes and ejection fraction as well as LV systolic dyssynchrony index were assessed by three-dimensional echocardiography. The results were compared with those of 30 controls. Pulmonary regurgitation, mostly trivial to mild, was present in 90% (28/31) of patients. Compared with controls, patients had significantly greater RV end-diastolic (P < 0.001), RV end-systolic (P < 0.001), and LV end-systolic (P = 0.04) volumes as well as lower LV ejection fraction (P < 0.001). For deformation, patients had significantly reduced RV longitudinal systolic strain (P = 0.004), decreased LV circumferential systolic strain (P < 0.001), and strain rate (P = 0.001) as well as greater LV mechanical dyssynchrony (P < 0.001). In patients, RV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes correlated with LV circumferential strain (r = -0.47, P = 0.008 and r = -0.36, P = 0.049, respectively) and dyssynchrony (r = 0.53, P = 0.002 and r = 0.49, P = 0.005, respectively).

252,252,18162064,"Eyeblink conditioning (EBC) is a Pavlovian paradigm that involves contingent temporal pairing of a conditioned stimulus (e.g., tone) with an unconditioned stimulus (e.g., air puff). Animal studies have shown that binge consumption of alcohol during pregnancy impairs EBC and that this impairment is likely mediated by a loss of neurons in the inferior olive and the cerebellar cortex and deep nuclei, as well as by a reduction in neural plasticity in the cerebellar deep nuclei. Short delay EBC was examined in 98 5-year-old children born to women from the Coloured (mixed ancestry) community in Cape Town, South Africa, who were recruited prenatally and are participating in the first prospective longitudinal study of children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). FAS status was assessed at 5 years by expert dysmorphologists. Two sessions of 50 trials each were administered to the children; a third session was administered the following day to those children who did not meet criterion of 40% conditioned responses in session 2. Not a single child with FAS met criterion for conditioning as contrasted with 75.0% of the controls. Whereas 86.7% of the controls who were conditioned met criterion by the end of Session 2, a large proportion of the relatively few alcohol-exposed nonsyndromal children who conditioned did not do so until Session 3. These alcohol effects on EBC persisted after controlling for IQ. Three of 4 microcephalic children who were not exposed to alcohol were successfully conditioned. This is the first prospective study to demonstrate impaired EBC in children diagnosed with FAS. Successful EBC in a microcephalic group supports the inference that the EBC deficit is specific to prenatal alcohol exposure and a potential biomarker for diagnosis of exposed children lacking the distinctive FAS dysmorphology. Delay EBC has a high sensitivity for identifying individuals with a diagnosis of probable FAS.

There are few BCB performance evaluations, especially evaluations comparing them with automated systems. We evaluated two manual BCBs (Bi-State BCB and BacT/ALERT BCB) and compared their yield and time to growth detection with those of automated BacT/ALERT system. BCBs were spiked in triplicate with 177 clinical isolates representing pathogens common in low-resource settings (19 bacterial and one yeast species) in adult and paediatric volumes, resulting in 1056 spiked BCBs per BCB system. Growth in manual BCBs was evaluated daily by visually inspecting the broth, agar slant, and, for BacT/ALERT BCB, colour change of the growth indicator. The primary outcomes were BCB yield (proportion of spiked BCB showing growth) and time to detection (proportion of positive BCB with growth detected on day 1 of incubation). 95% CI for yield and growth on day 1 were calculated using bootstrap method for clustered data using. Secondary outcomes were time to colony for all BCBs (defined as number of days between incubation and colony growth sufficient to use for further testing) and difference between time to detection in broth and on agar slant for the Bi-State BCBs. Overall yield was 95·9% (95% CI 93·9-98·0) for Bi-State BCB and 95·5% (93·3-97·8) for manual BacT/ALERT, versus 96·1% (94·0-98·1) for the automated BacT/ALERT system (p=0·61). Day 1 growth was present in 920 (90·8%) of 1013 positive Bi-State BCB and 757 (75·0%) of 1009 positive manual BacT/ALERT BCB, versus 1008 (99·3%) of 1015 automated bottles. On day 2, detection rates were 100% for BI-State BCB, 97·7% for manual BacT/ALERT BCB, and 100% for automated bottles. For Bi-State BCB, growth mostly occurred simultaneously in broth and slant (81·7%). Sufficient colony growth on the slant to perform further tests was present in only 44·1% of biphasic bottles on day 2 and 59·0% on day 3. The yield of manual BCB was comparable with the automated system, suggesting that manual blood culture systems are an acceptable alternative to automated systems in low-resource settings. Bi-State BCB outperformed manual BacT/ALERT bottles, but the agar slant did not allow earlier detection nor earlier colony growth.

To investigate the cause of dark urine, haemolysis and muscle cell injury were assessed. Intravascular haemolysis was greater in Group I than in Groups II and III. However, anaemia was more severe in Group III and is likely to have resulted mainly from extravascular haemolysis. Median plasma myoglobin concentrations were greater in Groups I and II than Group III (P = 0.00060). Plasma myoglobin was greater in children with cerebral malaria, hyperlactataemia and those who died but was not associated with acidosis. Urine myoglobin was greater in Group I than Groups II and III (P = 0.00054). It is likely that both haemoglobin and myoglobin contributed to dark urine.

258,258,10025116,"Psychogenic disturbance of vision includes various abnormalities such as low vision, abnormal visual field, abnormal color sense and disturbance of binocular function, although there are no abnormalities either in the eyeball or optic nerve, and no organic changes in brain computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To clarify these abnormalities, it is necessary first to study the mechanism of visual information processing. In this report, the mechanism of visual information processing such as visual acuity, visual field, vision and attention and binocular function was studied by standard electrophysiological methods as well as by new techniques including electroencephalography (EEG) topography, visual evoked response imaging system (VERIS), and magnetoencephalogram (MEG). The following four items and the possibilities for clinical application were studied and discussed. The subjects were normal adults and child volunteers, patients with disturbance of vision of psychogenic origin, and patients with abnormal visual fields caused by organic changes in the visual pathway. 1. Visual acuity (form vision). 1) Visually evoked potemtial (VEP), early receptor potential (ERP), and MEG examination were carried out for normal subjects and patients with psychogenic disturbance of vision. 2) The P 100 of pattern reversal VEP of the patients showed a significantly higher response. 3) In normal subjects, the P 300 was observed widely around the Pz in the ERPs during Landolt's ring stimulation. 4) In normal children, the P 300 was observed slightly temporal to the Pz. 5) In some patients maximum amplitude of P 300 was observed in the occipital or temporal region, but in other patients there was no P 300 response in any derivation. 6) MEG in patients with the conversion type of psychogenic disturbance of vision showed only 2 small dipolar patterns around 117 ms during flash stimulation. It was quite different from that of normal subjects. 2. Visual field. 1) Multifocal VEP using VERIS could detect experimental artificial hemianopia caused by conclusion of the half visual field in normal subjects. 2) Multifocal VEP could detect hemianopia or quadratanopia. 3) In multifocal VEP in normal subject, off-latency time was about 36 ms longer than on-latency time both in the center and at the periphery of the retina. The ratio of on/off response decreased from the center to the periphery. 4) In MEG using flash stimulation, hemianopia could be detected even in patients with fixation difficulties. 5) As the subjective visual field was not always in accord with the objective field, objective visual field evaluation is important. 3. Vision and attention. 1) To confirm the influence of attention on visual information processings in patients with disturbance of vision of psychogenic origin, a hypothetical 'island of attention' was postulated. 2) The 'spiral visual field' and the 'Inazuma-type visual field' could be explained by application of this hypothesis for patients with disturbance of vision. 3) Three kinds of waves in VEF, W 1, W 2, and W 3, were detected by MEG after the stimulation of line motion illusion. There was a tendency for the latency time on the attention side to be shorter than on the non-attention side in waves W 2 and W 3. 4) There was a tendency for the amplitude of the attention side to be higher than that of the non-attention side in wave W 3. 5) Attention may influence vision. 4. Binocular vision. 1) A stimulus target was devised which did not elicit N 75, P 100, or N 140 waves. When this target was used for stereoptic stimulation, a negative wave was elicited with a latency of 170 to 280 ms. 2) When the same stimulus target without parallax was used, this negative wave was elicited but the amplitude was small. 3) When evoked potentials were measured under the same conditions, an electric dipole was elicited from the occipital to the temporal region by the electric current source.

The degree of obesity was calculated as (actual body mass index/ideal body mass index -1) x 100. The pulmonary venous flow indexes were peak systolic (S) and diastolic (D) velocities and peak D/S. The mitral inflow indexes were peak velocities of early diastole (E) and atrial contraction (A) and peak E/A. The pulmonary venous flow velocity pattern in obese patients was characterized by unchanged peak S, decreases in peak D (43 +/- 7 vs 51 +/- 8, p < 0.01) and peak D/S (0.98 +/- 0.19 vs 1.29 +/- 0.20, p < 0.01), suggesting the reduction in the early diastolic filling. The peak D/S decreased significantly with an increase in the percentage body mass index (r = -0.84, p < 0.01). In contrast to the pulmonary venous flow pattern (peak D > peak S) as seen in normal controls, all of the obese patients with > 70% over body mass index had abnormal pulmonary venous flow velocity patterns (peak D < peak S). The mitral flow velocity pattern in obese patients was also characterized by a decrease in early diastolic filling. However, these indices did not correlate with an increase in the percentage over body mass index.

263,263,37792152,"The purpose of this paper is to describe the design and implementation of a multidisciplinary, integrated approach to supporting pregnant, postpartum, and parenting people (PPPP) and their families affected by substance use disorders (SUD). Between 2015 and 2022, the Moms Do Care (MDC) Program, sponsored by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health Bureau of Substance Addiction Services, established or expanded 11 co-located medical and behavioral health teams in locations across Massachusetts. These teams provided trauma-informed primary and obstetrical health care, SUD treatment and recovery services, parenting support, and case management for approximately 1048 PPPP with SUD. By enhancing the capacity of medical and behavioral health providers offering integrated care across the perinatal health care continuum, MDC created a network of support for PPPP with SUD. Lessons learned include the need to continually invest in staff training to foster teambuilding and improve integrated service delivery, uplift the peer recovery coach role within the care team, improve engagement with and access to services for communities of color, and conduct evaluation and sustainability planning.

Forty-three individuals from two pedigrees had complete eye examinations. Linkage analysis was performed with microsatellite markers from the region 3q28-29. Visual acuity in 21 affected individuals ranged from 20/25 to 20/800. Vision loss was more severe in males than females (P = 0.02). Color vision testing revealed generalized dyschromatopsia. Both visual acuity and color vision deteriorated with age. Linkage was established to chromosome 3q28-29 (LODmax = 4.68 for D3S2305). Autosomal dominant optic atrophy linked to chromosome 3q28-29 shows intrafamilial phenotypic variation as well as sex-influenced severity in two Midwestern families. ,2264,Clinical heterogeneity in autosomal dominant optic atrophy in two 3q28-qter linked central Illinois families,"Chen AS, Kovach MJ, Herman K, Avakian A, Frank W, Forrester S, Lin JP, Kimonis V.",Genet Med. 2000 Sep-Oct;2(5):283-9. doi: 10.1097/00125817-200009000-00003.,Chen AS,Genet Med,2000,2001/06/12,,,10.1097/00125817-200009000-00003

The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of the treatment of PWS in Chinese patients using the 595-nm PDL. In total, 184 patients with PWS over the face, neck and trunk or limbs were enrolled in the study. All the patients were treated with the 595-nm PDL 3-6 times, with a 4-week interval between each treatment. Treatment parameters varied for each patient according to the colour and location of the PWS. The efficacy of treatments and any side-effects were evaluated. Results were graded as percentage resolution (0-25%, 25-50%, 50-75% and 75-100%). Of the 184 patients who completed the study, 115 (62.5%) achieved excellent improvement, 38 (20.7%) achieved good results, and 31 (16.8%) had an unsatisfactory outcome (moderate and poor response). We found > 75% improvement for 76% of facial PWS (95/125), 43% of neck PWS and 20.8% of trunk or limb PWS. Pain and topical erythema were commonly reported immediately after the laser treatments. Prominent hyperpigmentation occurred in only 11 cases (6.0%) with poor improvement, and resolved within 6 months.

267,267,22928923,"Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic fungal disease endemic to Latin America and characterized by two clinical presentations, i.e., patients develop either acute/subacute or chronic clinical manifestations. The differences in clinical presentations are mainly dependent on the host immune response, but may also be related to demographic characteristics of some patients. In this retrospective study, 1,219 PCM cases treated between 1970 and 2009 in a university medical center, located in southeastern Brazil, were analyzed according to their clinical and demographic features. The most affected anatomical sites were lungs (63.8%) and oral mucosa (50.0%), with increasing involvement of these sites in accord with the age of the patients. Generalized lymphadenopathy (28.1%) and skin lesions (29.6%) were more frequent on the first decades of life. Involvement of the larynx (16.1%), gut (7.5%), spleen (4.7%), central nervous system (3.4%), bones and joints (2.2%), and adrenal (2.1%) were also variable according to the age of the host. The acute/subacute form of the disease accounted for 26.4% of PCM cases and, on a multivariate analysis, was inversely associated with aging (OR = 0.8 per year, P < 0.001), and directly associated with female sex (OR = 7.2, P < 0.001), mixed black and white racial background (OR = 2.3, P < 0.001) or black skin color (OR = 4.6, P < 0.001).

268,268,27548364,"Preterm newborns show an increased susceptibility to infections, conceivably related to their immature immune system. To gain further knowledge about the immune development in early preterm infants, we aimed to establish references for lymphocyte subsets and compare the maturation process during hospitalization to healthy term-born children and adolescents. For this purpose, peripheral blood samples (n = 153) were collected from 40 preterm infants, gestational age (GA) 26-30 week between 2nd and 6th day of life, and were monitored in intervals of every 2 or rather 4 weeks until the end of hospitalization. Furthermore, we analysed single sample controls of 10 term neonates. We compared these data with results of a study in healthy children and adolescent (n = 176). Flow cytometry of immune cell subsets was performed as single-platform analysis using 10-colour flow cytometry. Based on preterm's age, our percentile model allows readout of absolute cell count for lymphocytes, B cells, T cells, NK cells, T8 and T4 cells. The median (minimum) value of T-, B- and NK cells after birth was 2800 (600), 790 (120) and 140 (20) cells/μl, respectively. Major differences were found in absolute cell numbers of B cells, and in the frequency of regulatory T cells, most pronounced in the earliest preterm infants (GA 26). Compared to healthy children and adolescents, preterm infants reached lymphocyte counts in between the 5th and 50th percentile when discharging the hospital. This prospective observational study provides reference percentiles for lymphocytes subsets of preterm infants.

A case-control study including 19 patients with homozygous hemoglobin S, and 13 age- and sex-matched black control subjects. Serum MEGX concentration was measured after intravenous injection of 1 mg/kg (maximum 50 mg) lidocaine. ICG (0.5 mg/kg) was injected concomitantly and absorbance (805 nm) of serum was measured over time to determine its volume of distribution, serum half-life, and hepatic blood flow. MEGX formation at 15 minutes was decreased in patients with sickle cell disease compared with formation in the control subjects (39.9 +/- 18.0 vs 65.6 +/- 50.0 micrograms/L, respectively, p < 0.02). The volume of distribution of ICG was increased in patients with sickle cell disease compared with that in the control subjects (0.21 +/- 0.09 vs 0.11 +/- 0.03 L/kg, p < 0.01). This partly accounts for the decreased MEGX formation. The ICG half-life was similar in both groups (3.8 +/- 1.5 vs 3.1 +/- 1.0 min). Hepatic blood flow, derived from ICG clearance, was increased in sickle cell patients compared with that of the control subjects (12.2 +/- 4.5 vs 8.1 +/- 2.1 ml/kg/min, p < 0.01).

Although previous biomonitoring studies have indicated the effects on children of extensive exposure to ABX, studies on pregnant women remain scarce. To explore the effect on pregnant women of environmental exposure to ABX through accidental ingestion and identify potential health risks, the present study investigated 122 pregnant women in East China between 2019 and 2020. The presence of six categories of ABX (quinolones, sulfonamides, lincosamides, tetracyclines, amide alcohol ABX, and β-lactams) in plasma samples taken from the pregnant women was investigated using an ABX kit and a time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay. All six ABX were detected in the plasma, with a detection rate of 17.2%. It was discovered that the composition of intestinal flora in pregnant women exposed to ABX was different from that of pregnant women who had not been exposed to ABX. The intestinal flora of pregnant women exposed to ABX also changed at both the phylum and genus levels, and several genera almost disappeared. Furthermore, the metabolic levels of glucose and insulin and the alpha diversity of pregnant women exposed to ABX were higher than those of pregnant women not exposed to ABX. Pregnant women are potentially at higher risk of adverse microbial effects. Glucose metabolism and insulin levels were generally higher in pregnant women exposed to ABX than in unexposed women.

271,271,26765639,"The contributions of the hippocampal formation and adjacent regions of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) to memory are still a matter of debate. It is currently unclear, to what extent discrepancies between previous human lesion studies may have been caused by the choice of distinct patient models of MTL dysfunction, as disorders affecting this region differ in selectivity, laterality and mechanisms of post-lesional compensation. Here, we investigated the performance of three distinct patient groups with lesions to the MTL with a battery of visuo-spatial short-term memory tasks. Thirty-one subjects with either unilateral damage to the MTL (postsurgical lesions following resection of a benign brain tumor, 6 right-sided lesions, 5 left) or bilateral damage (10 post-encephalitic lesions, 10 post-anoxic lesions) performed a series of tasks requiring short-term memory of colors, locations or color-location associations. We have shown previously that performance in the association task critically depends on hippocampal integrity. Patients with postsurgical damage of the MTL showed deficient performance in the association task, but performed normally in color and location tasks. Patients with left-sided lesions were almost as impaired as patients with right-sided lesions. Patients with bilateral post-encephalitic lesions showed comparable damage to MTL sub-regions and performed similarly to patients with postsurgical lesions in the association task. However, post-encephalitic patients showed additional impairments in the non-associative color and location tasks. A strikingly similar pattern of deficits was observed in post-anoxic patients. These results suggest a distinct cerebral organization of associative and non-associative short-term memory that was differentially affected in the three patient groups. Thus, while all patient groups may provide appropriate models of medial temporal lobe dysfunction in associative visuo-spatial short-term memory, additional deficits in non-associative memory tasks likely reflect damage of regions outside the MTL. Importantly, the choice of a patient model in human lesion studies of the MTL significantly influences overall performance patterns in visuo-spatial memory tasks.

Odds of study outcomes were calculated among insured adults using logistic regressions. Insurance coverage types and sites of usual sources of care were the main independent variables. Six reasons for lifetime discrimination in health care were examined: 1) dissatisfaction with the health care system, 2) race or skin color, 3) age, 4) way the participant speaks English or other barrier to communication, 5) insurance status or type, and 6) income or education.

SBC is relatively common in long bones, but rarely in flat bones. Only several cases of the SBC of cranial bone have been reported. Although a craniectomy for total excision followed by cranioplasty by resin was common, in cases of children, cyst removal with titanium plate application would be an alterative.

The study group consisted of 30 children aged from 5 months to 16 years (mean 4.8 +/- 4.4 years). Echocardiographic studies were repeated before and during dobutamine infusion (5 microg/kg per minute). The peak diastolic velocity in the left descending coronary artery (LAD) was recorded by pulsed-Doppler under the guidance of color Doppler flow mapping. The coronary flow velocity (CFV) response was calculated as the ratio of LAD peak flow velocity at dobutamine infusion to basal LAD peak flow velocity. Left ventricular contractility was calculated by two-dimensionally directed M-mode echocardiography. The rate-corrected mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (mVcfc) and LV end-systolic wall stress (ESS) were used as indices of contractility. Adequate spectral Doppler recordings of the LAD peak flow velocity for the assessment of CFV response were obtained in 26 of 30 patients (87%). The LAD peak flow velocity at dobutamine infusion increased significantly compared with the basal values. The CFV response in the younger children was low and increased significantly with age. The CFV response did not show significant correlations with the changes in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate-pressure product, nor ESS during dobutamine infusion. However, a significant relationship between the CFV response and the percent change of mVcfc was observed. In the present study using high frequency transthoracic echocardiography, we demonstrated the age-related changes in CFV response and LV functional reserve by dobutamine infusion.

During cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the detector and the capnometer were connected between the ETT and ventilator tubing. Color shades on the detector ranged from 1 (purple) to 6 (yellow) corresponding to increasing concentrations of CO2. End-tidal CO2 concentrations as indicated by detector color and capnometric reading were monitored and recorded throughout the study. The results showed that there was a significant correlation between the detector color score and capnometric readings (P < 0.001).

294,294,16977637,"To study the biology of rare bone marrow (BM) multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), recognized protocols are needed. Colony-forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) assays have historically been used for the enumeration of MSCs. However, the need to isolate and further analyze MSCs requires new strategies based on cell surface markers. The purpose of this work was to verify the phenotype of BM MSCs in vivo and to develop flow cytometry-based methods for their evaluation. Pre-enrichment with D7-FIB-conjugated microbeads, cell sorting for CD45low D7-FIB+ LNGFR+ cells, and CFU-F assay were used to confirm the phenotype of BM MSCs in vivo. Further phenotypic characterization of MSCs was performed using three-color flow cytometry following pre-enrichment or by direct four-color flow cytometry. The sensitivity of direct flow cytometry/rare event analysis for the accurate enumeration of MSCs was validated using 85 samples from patients with neoplastic BM diseases. In normal BM, a significant correlation was found between the frequencies of CFU-Fs and CD45low D7-FIB+ LNGFR+ cells (n = 19, R = 0.719, P = 0.001). Following cell sorting, 15% of these cells were clonogenic. The same cells were enriched using LNGFR-based positive selection, CD45/Glycophorin A-based depletion, or plastic adherence.

MPH significantly improved performance in both groups, with the ADHD participants consistently displaying worse scores than those of controls both on and off MPH. These results suggest that though the diagnostic value of the Stroop task in ADHD remains controversial, it has heuristic value for monitoring clinical responses to MPH treatment. More research is needed to ascertain the clinical significance of our findings and to replicate this relatively small effect in a larger cohort, to determine whether MPH effects on Stroop performance are specific to ADHD symptoms or they generalize to other forms of symptomatology.

In this mixed-methods observational study, chart reviews, telephone surveys, and qualitative interviews in English and Spanish were conducted with caregivers who accessed the MMC between April and November 2020. Qualitative interviews were analyzed with the constant comparative method alongside descriptive chart and survey data analyses. Of 139 caregiver-infant dyads contacted, 68 (48.9%) completed the survey; 27 also completed the qualitative interview. The survey participants did not differ from the larger sample; most (86.7%) were people of color (52.9% identified as Latino and 33.8% as Black). Health-related social needs were high, including food insecurity (52.9%), diaper insecurity (44.1%), and anxiety (32%). Four women (6.1%) were diagnosed with hypertension requiring urgent evaluation. Nearly all (98.5%) reported being very satisfied with the services. Major themes from qualitative interviews included (1) perceived patient- and family-centered care, (2) perceived safety, and (3) perceived benefits of dyadic mother-infant care. In this assessment of caregivers who accessed the MMC-a rapidly-developed COVID-19 pandemic response-insights from caregivers, predominantly people of color, provided considerations for future postpartum/postnatal service delivery. Perceptions that the MMC addressed health-related social needs and barriers to traditional office-based visits and the identification of maternal hypertension requiring urgent intervention suggest that innovative models for postpartum mother-infant care may have long-lasting benefits.

301,301,27545012,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is associated with decreased exercise tolerance in children, presumably due to diastolic dysfunction. Modern imaging techniques to assess myocardial function during active exercise have not been applied to this population. We hypothesized that impaired contractile reserve, as assessed by tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) and strain, contributes to reduced exercise capacity in affected individuals. Children (<18 years) with HCM and healthy age- and sex-matched controls were prospectively enrolled. Resting echocardiograms and staged upright cycle ergometry with simultaneous echocardiograms were performed. During exercise, left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradients and color Doppler maps of apical four-chamber and parasternal short-axis views were obtained. Post processing of images was performed to obtain TDI velocities, and measurements of strain were attempted. Exercise parameters and staged TDI values were compared. The study population consisted of 58 subjects (22 with HCM and 36 controls). Patients with HCM had significantly higher peak LVOT gradients compared to controls at baseline and at each exercise stage. TDI revealed that diastolic function, as assessed by E' velocities at septal and lateral mitral annuli, normalized with exercise in HCM patients. Further, systolic function (S' velocity) of HCM patients at rest was normal but failed to augment normally at peak exercise. Children with HCM have decreased TDI velocities at rest. With exercise, they may increase their E' velocities but fail to augment S' velocities, demonstrating decreased contractile reserve. In the patient with suspected HCM but equivocal findings, exercise TDI assessment may complement the diagnostic evaluation.

305,305,11737724,"Although the clinical experience with transcatheter closure of the patent ductus arteriosus using the coils has grown rapidly, one important complication of this procedure using the conventional Gianturco coil was the migration of coils into peripheral vessels. This is especially for patients with a relatively larger size ductus and the risk for such complications could be increased. In this situation, the detachable coil may have some technical benefits to perform coil occlusion and reduce the incidence of complications. We describe the clinical efficacy of a simultaneous double or triple coil occlusion technique using the Cook detachable coil or bioptome delivered 0.052 inch Gianturco coil to close the ductus arteriosus. This was performed in patients whose ductus diameter was greater than 3.0 mm. From February 1995 to December 2000, 118 patients with patent ductus arteriosus were treated by coil occlusion using Cook detachable coils, of whom 58 patients whose minimum diameter of ductus > or = 3.0 mm were reviewed. All patients had successful placement of coils. According to the evaluation by color flow mapping, a trivial shunt was observed in 17 patients (29%) within 24 h after the procedure. In 11 out of 17 patients, a residual shunt was not detected 1 month after the procedure. At 6 months after the procedure, the residual shunt was detected only in three patients.

306,306,10737527,"We quantitatively evaluated the collagen-to-smooth muscle tissue matrix ratio in ureteropelvic junction obstruction, and compared the ratio with the degree of obstruction, patient age and postoperative renal recovery. We analyzed histological sections from 65 patients with ureteropelvic junction obstruction and 6 normal controls. Morphological and functional grading systems were adapted to determine the degree of renal obstruction. To examine smooth muscle and collagen tissue, sections were stained using Masson's trichrome. Two distinct populations of collagen versus smooth muscle were identified and the tissue matrix ratio was calculated by color image analysis. The mean tissue matrix ratio plus or minus standard deviation was 1.32+/-0.79 in all patients with ureteropelvic junction obstruction but only 0.30+/-0.10 in normal controls (p <0.0001). It appeared that the lower the tissue matrix ratio, the better the improvement in postoperative hydronephrosis (r = -0.50, p = 0.0001). Better recovery of renal function after pyeloplasty was observed with a decrease in the tissue matrix ratio (r = -0.43, p = 0.0004). We divided patients according to the tissue matrix ratio into groups 1--ratio 1 or less, 2--greater than 1 to 1.5 and 3--greater than 1.5 to determine a more detailed and clinically applicable correlation of tissue matrix ratio with postoperative renal functional changes. Better improvement in postoperative renal function was observed in group 1 than in group 3 (p = 0.002). Also, the tissue matrix ratio increased with patient age (r = 0.33, p = 0.007).

Significance was set at p≤0.05; Results: In all cases, CDU examinations showed subclinical signs of activity beyond the visible lesional borders, either in the same or adjacent corporal segments. A negative correlation was found between the change in US-MAS and MTX dose (Spearman coefficient, -0.45; p = 0.035). The group dosed at ≥0.265 mg/kg/wk showed a non-significant change in US-MAS (2-point decrease). No case became inactive.

317,317,38712575,"Retroareolar cysts (RCs) are a benign self-resolving condition primarily affecting pubertal individuals. However, their presentation as asymptomatic bluish areolar lumps remains underreported in the literature, with only six cases previously documented. This lack of awareness may lead to the oversight of RCs during diagnosis. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive literature review using PUBMED, and we further added three more cases. The mean time for clinical resolution was found to be 2.3 years. In light of these findings, we proposed a diagnostic and management algorithm to guide clinicians in their approach to RCs in pediatric patients. The algorithm involves thorough clinical examination, medical history assessment, and echographic investigation with color Doppler analysis. Regular follow-up visits are recommended until resolution of the lesions. Notably, due to the consistently favorable outcome of RCs, aggressive diagnostic interventions can be avoided, providing reassurance to patients and their families. It is crucial for paediatricians to stay updated on this underreported condition to ensure timely recognition and appropriate management. Dermatologists should be the first specialists to be consulted in cases of suspected RCs. Increasing awareness among healthcare professionals will contribute to improved diagnosis and management of this benign condition. In conclusion, RCs are a benign self-resolving condition commonly observed during puberty. Their presentation as asymptomatic bluish areolar lumps may often be overlooked. Through this study, we highlighted the importance of early recognition, proposed a diagnostic and management algorithm, and emphasized the favorable prognosis of RCs, which allows for a conservative approach to their management.

This study aimed to determine whether these perinatal risk factors were associated with neuropsychological deficits commonly seen in ADHD. We examined the effect of these two risk factors on measures of attentional control, motor inhibition, visual-motor integration, and fine motor coordination in a group of 81 children with ADHD, aged from 8 to 18 years. The neuropsychological battery included the Connors' Continuous Performance Test (CPT), the Stroop Color-Word Interference Test, the Beery Visual-Motor Integration Test, and the Purdue Pegboard Test. Heavy maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with slower reaction times (p < .002), and reaction time variability (p < .007) on the CPT. This study suggests a persistent negative effect of heavy prenatal maternal smoking on attentional control in children with ADHD.

319,319,21570462,"The aim of the work was early identification of preventable risk factors connected with the consumers usage of products of everyday use, such as cosmetics, toys and children products, and other materials intended for contact with human skin. The risk factor is represented by substances with irritation potential and subsequent possible sensitisation, resulting in negative impact on human physical and psychical health with social and societal consequences. The legislation for cosmetics, chemical substances and other products requires for hazard identification the application of alternative toxicological methods in vitro without the use of animals. For this reason we used a battery of alternative assays in vitro, based on cell cultures. Progressive methods of molecular biology, based on fluorimetry and fluorescence, were employed for identification of early morphological and functional changes on cellular level. Four colorants frequently used in cosmetics (P-WS Caramel, Chlorophyllin, Unicert Red K 7054-J and Unicert Red K 7008-J) were tested on cell line NIH3T3 (mouse fibroblast cell) and 3T3 Balb/c with/without UV irradiation (dose 5 J cm(-2)). Fluorescence methods for the study of cell damage using fluorescence probes offer results for the evaluation of cytotoxicity and cell viability of adherent cells. We detected intracellular production of ROS investigated by molecular probe CM-H(2)DCFDA, which is primarily sensitive to the increased production of hydrogen peroxide or its downstream products. Toxic effects on the cellular level were identified by viability tests using Neutral Red uptake and MTT assay, where the live cells reduce yellow soluble 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to insoluble formazan crystals.

322,322,22371105,"Over the past 5 years, the advent of echocardiographic screening for rheumatic heart disease (RHD) has revealed a higher RHD burden than previously thought. In light of this global experience, the development of new international echocardiographic guidelines that address the full spectrum of the rheumatic disease process is opportune. Systematic differences in the reporting of and diagnostic approach to RHD exist, reflecting differences in local experience and disease patterns. The World Heart Federation echocardiographic criteria for RHD have, therefore, been developed and are formulated on the basis of the best available evidence. Three categories are defined on the basis of assessment by 2D, continuous-wave, and color-Doppler echocardiography: 'definite RHD', 'borderline RHD', and 'normal'. Four subcategories of 'definite RHD' and three subcategories of 'borderline RHD' exist, to reflect the various disease patterns. The morphological features of RHD and the criteria for pathological mitral and aortic regurgitation are also defined. The criteria are modified for those aged over 20 years on the basis of the available evidence. The standardized criteria aim to permit rapid and consistent identification of individuals with RHD without a clear history of acute rheumatic fever and hence allow enrollment into secondary prophylaxis programs. However, important unanswered questions remain about the importance of subclinical disease (borderline or definite RHD on echocardiography without a clinical pathological murmur), and about the practicalities of implementing screening programs. These standardized criteria will help enable new studies to be designed to evaluate the role of echocardiographic screening in RHD control.

323,323,33337332,"To better understand the electroclinical features and epileptic network of lateral and medial orbitofrontal epilepsy (OFE). We evaluated four patients who had undergone epilepsy surgery. Epileptic foci in two patients originated from the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and those in the other two originated from the medial orbitofrontal cortex, which was confirmed by stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG). Time-frequency spectrograms were also provided for assistance, and the change in high-frequency energy was superimposed on the 3D reconstructed brain with a colour code in order to more intuitively show the transfer of high-frequency energy as the seizure evolves. All patients underwent SEEG-guided radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RF-TC) or focal resection and achieved satisfactory results. Lateral OFE and medial OFE were relatively independent with regards to clinical symptoms and epileptic network, however, lateral OFE was likely to propagate to the dorsolateral frontal lobe, whereas medial OFE (gyrus rectus) was more likely to propagate to the medial temporal lobe or insular lobe with long duration.

Stedman's Medical Dictionary defines a hamartoma as: 'A focal malformation that resembles a neoplasm grossly and even microscopically, but results from faulty development in an organ; it is composed of an abnormal mixture of tissue elements, or an abnormal proportion of a single element, normally present in that site, which develop and grow at virtually the same rate as normal components, and are not likely to result in compression of the adjacent tissue (in contrast to neoplastic tissue).' A choristoma is defined as 'a mass formed by maldevelopment of tissue of a type not normally found at that site.' Phacoma is defined as, 'a hamartoma found in phacomatosis,' a group of hereditary diseases characterised by hamartomas of multiple tissues. A naevus is a, 'birthmark; a circumscribed malformation of the skin, especially if coloured by hyperpigmentation or increased vascularity; it may be predominantly epidermal, adnexal, melanocytic, vascular, or mesodermal, or a localised overgrowth of melanin-forming cells arising in the skin early in life.' Ophthalmologists have adopted the term to refer to developmental melanocytic lesions of the uveal tract, but heretofore have not used it to describe developmental melanocytic, glial, or vascular lesions of the retina. The purpose of this report is to summarise the author's observations and concepts concerning focal lesions that probably are developmental tumours and placoid lesions composed of either entirely or in part retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Two of the lesions are tumefactions and may properly be termed 'hamartomas'. Four of the lesions are placoid and might better be described as naevi. Two are composed of hypertrophied RPE cells engorged with melanin granules, one is presumed to be hypertrophied RPE cells filled with a white pigment of unknown nature and one is composed of RPE cells containing no pigment.

332,332,37902919,"Postpartum care is an opportunity to provide essential follow-up care to people who have given birth, but inequalities in access by race and socioeconomic status (SES) are well-documented. The purpose of this study is to provide an in-depth description of the barriers to postpartum care using a mixed-methods design. Mixed method analyses using convergent design with three stages including (1) bivariate logistic regression of survey data representative of postpartum women in Kalamazoo County, Michigan, (2) thematic qualitative analyses of focus group interviews of survey participants, and (3) bivariate logistic regression and logistic regression meditation analyses using themes operationalized with survey data measures. In Kalamazoo county, 82.0% of women attended their postpartum visit. White women and women with higher SES were 2.84 (SE = 1.35, p < .001) and 5.73 (SE = 3.10, p < .001) times more likely to attend postpartum visits than women of color and those with lower SES. Qualitative analyses identified four common barriers: (1) misaligned goals for appointments, (2) time and scheduling of appointments, (3) prioritization of children, and (4) material resources and health insurance coverage. The quantitative analyses found mixed support for these barriers and found limited evidence that these barriers mediated the relationship between race or SES and postpartum attendance. The qualitative findings identify barriers that are amenable to practice-level interventions including changes to scheduling procedures and employing patient-centered care. The quantitative findings further suggest that although inequalities in postpartum care are present, interventions on these barriers may benefit women regardless of race and SES. What is Already Known on this Subject? Attendance at postpartum visits is lower for women of color and women with lower SES. Investigation of barriers to postpartum care is nascent, but prior research has shown common barriers include cost, transportation, scheduling, lack of provider continuity, and the fragmented nature of postpartum care in the U.S. Previous studies have tended to use only quantitative or qualitative data. What this Study adds? This mixed-methods study combines quantitative analyses of a county-level representative survey with qualitative focus group data to identify and statistically test for barriers to attendance and engagement at postpartum visits.

Sonograms of 119 consecutive patients with suspected appendicitis and 6- to 8-mm noncompressible appendixes were retrospectively blindly evaluated for thickening of the lamina propria (short axis thickness ≥ 1 mm). The reference standard for appendicitis was pathologic analysis of resected specimens. Results were compared with the two-tailed Fisher exact test. Thirty-one patients (26.1%) had a thickened lamina propria and 88 (73.9%) did not. Of the 27 pediatric patients with a thickened lamina propria, five (18.5%) had true-positive and 22 (81.5%) had false-positive sonograms for appendicitis; among the 55 pediatric patients without a thickened lamina propria, 27 (49.1%) had true-positive and 28 (50.9%) had false-positive sonograms for appendicitis (p = 0.009). Similar differences in adult patients were not statistically significant. All five pediatric patients with appendicitis and thickened lamina propria also showed two or more findings of periappendiceal fluid, hyperechoic periappendiceal fat, or mural hyperemia on color Doppler examination, compared with two of 22 similar pediatric patients without appendicitis (p < 0.001). Lymphoid hyperplasia may result in a noncompressible appendix 6-8 mm in diameter and may be misdiagnosed as appendicitis in pediatric patients. True-positive diagnoses of appendicitis can be accurately identified by the presence of at least two additional findings from the group of periappendiceal fluid, hyperechoic periappendiceal fat, and mural hyperemia. Identifying the characteristic sonographic appearance of lymphoid hyperplasia may help prevent false-positive misdiagnoses of appendicitis.

This is a major concern in Africa, where the majority of e-waste is discarded. In the year 2021, an estimated 57.4 million metric tons of e-waste were generated worldwide. Globally, COVID-19 lockdowns have contributed to increased e-waste generation. Although Africa generates the least of this waste, the continent has been the dumping ground for e-waste from the developed world. The flow of hazardous waste from the prosperous 'Global North' to the impoverished 'Global South' is termed ""toxic colonialism"". Agbogbloshie, Ghana, an e-waste hub where about 39% of e-waste was treated, was listed among the top 10 most polluted places in the world. The discard of e-waste in Ghana presents an issue of environmental injustice, defined as the disproportionate exposure of communities of color and low-income communities to pollution, its associated health and environmental effects, and the unequal environmental protection provided through policies. Despite the economic benefits of e-waste, many civilians (low-income earners, settlers, children, and people with minimal education) are exposed to negative health effects due to poverty, lack of education, and weak regulations.

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of a topical henna preparation in management of contact dermatitis in patients using lower limb prosthetics. The current randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on ninety-five participants with lower extremity amputation using limb prosthetics, aged 12-70 years who complained of contact dermatitis. They were randomly assigned to receive either two weeks of topical henna preparation every night as the intervention group, or topical placebo as the control group. Participants were instructed to spread henna preparation on the surfaces of the amputated limb that were in contact with the prosthesis. Severity of contact dermatitis symptoms was set as the primary outcome measure. Edema, papules and erythema were evaluated by a physician using standard color atlas. Secondary outcomes included symptoms such as burning, itching, pain, thickness and skin sweating evaluated by a self-administered questionnaire.

346,346,19158526,"Gluteal artery perforator flaps have gained popularity due to reliability, preservation of the muscle, versatility in flap design without restricting other flap options, and low donor-site morbidity in ambulatory patients and possibility of enabling future reconstruction in paraplegic patients. But the inconstant anatomy of the vascular plexus around the gluteal muscle makes it hard to predict how many perforators are present, what their volume of blood flow and size are, where they exit the overlying fascia, and what their course through the muscle will be. Without any prior investigations, the reconstructive surgeon could be surprised intraoperatively by previous surgical damage, scar formation, or anatomic variants.For these reasons, to confirm the presence and the location of gluteal perforators preoperatively we have used color Doppler ultrasonography. With the help of the color Doppler ultrasonography 26 patients, 21 men and 5 women, were operated between the years 2002 and 2007. The mean age of patients was 47.7 (age range: 7-77 years). All perforator vessels were marked preoperatively around the defect locations. The perforator based flap that will allow primary closure of the donor site and the defect without tension was planned choosing the perforator that showed the largest flow in color Doppler ultrasonography proximally. Perforators were found in the sites identified with color Doppler ultrasonography in all other flaps. In our study, 94.4% flap viability was ensured in 36 perforator-based gluteal area flaps. Mean flap elevation time was 31.9 minutes. We found that locating the perforators preoperatively helps to shorten the operation time without compromising a reliable viability of the perforator flaps, thus enabling the surgeon easier treatment of pressure sores.

347,347,26253563,"Inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) preferentially affecting cone photoreceptor function are being considered for treatment trials aiming to improve day vision. The purpose of the current work was to develop cone-specific visual orientation outcomes that can differentiate day vision improvement in the presence of retained night vision. A lighted wall (1.4 m wide, 2 m high) resembling a beaded curtain was formed with 900 individually addressable red, blue and green LED triplets placed in 15 vertical strips hanging 0.1 m apart. Under computer control, different combination of colors and intensities were used to produce the appearance of a door on the wall. Scotopically-matched trials were designed to be perceptible to the cone-, but not rod-, photoreceptor based visual systems. Unmatched control trials were interleaved at each luminance level to determine the existence of any vision available for orientation. Testing started with dark-adapted eyes and a scene luminance attenuated 8 log units from the maximum attainable, and continued with progressively increasing levels of luminance. Testing was performed with a three-alternative forced choice method in healthy subjects and patients with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) caused by mutations in GUCY2D, the gene that encodes retinal guanylate cyclase-1. Normal subjects could perform the orientation task using cone vision at 5 log attenuation and brighter luminance levels. Most GUCY2D-LCA patients failed to perform the orientation task with scotopically-matched test trials at any luminance level even though they were able to perform correctly with unmatched control trials. These results were consistent with a lack of cone system vision and use of the rod system under ambient conditions normally associated with cone system activity. Two GUCY2D-LCA patients demonstrated remnant cone vision but at a luminance level 2 log brighter than normal. The newly developed device can probe the existence or emergence of cone-based vision in patients for an orientation task involving the identification of a door on the wall under free-viewing conditions. This key advance represents progress toward developing an appropriate outcome measure for a clinical trial to treat currently incurable eye diseases severely affecting cone vision despite retained rod vision.

Transcatheter closure of patent arterial ducts was attempted in 13 patients, ranging in age from 5 months to 15 years, mean 4.1 years. Implantation of controlled-release PDA coils was attempted via the femoral artery through 5 Fr catheters in all cases except one, in whom both the femoral arterial and venous routes were used. The procedure was successful in 10 of the 13 patients. In these, the pulmonary artery systolic pressure ranged between 25 and 42 mmHg and the duct diameter varied from 1.5 to 6 mm at its narrowest point. Six of the patients received a single coil. Two coils were inserted in three patients and three coils in one patient. In three patients the ducts were too large for safe release of the coils, despite attempted implantation of up to three coils simultaneously. These coils were easily withdrawn into the catheter. Immediately at the end of the procedure, the duct was completely occluded in nine of the 10 patients, and in one patient there was a small residual flow. The procedure time varied between 35 min and 2.5 h, mean 81 min and the fluoroscopy time varied from 5 to 78 min, mean 25 min. None of the patients experienced hemorrhage, diminished lower extremity pulse, hemolysis or infection. In one patient, a 5 mm coil embolized into the right pulmonary artery soon after release. It was retrieved with a snare, then 8 mm and a 5 mm coil were implanted satisfactorily in the arterial duct. At follow-up by color Doppler echocardiography, the duct was completely occluded in all patients. Transcatheter closure of patent arterial ducts by controlled-release PDA coils is effective and safe. Even when more than one coil is inserted, it is still cheaper than transcatheter umbrella closure. This method is therefore of great value, particularly in less affluent countries.

This is the first study to evaluate the effect of HIV-1 subtype on neurodevelopment of Ugandan preschool children. Neurodevelopment of 87 HIV-1 infected and 221 HIV exposed uninfected Ugandan children 1.8-4.9 years of age was assessed using 4 scales of the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL), 2 scales of the Color Object Association Test (COAT), and 1 score of the Early Childhood Vigilance Test. HIV-1 subtype was defined by phylogenetic analyses. General linear models were used to relate test scores to HIV-1 subtype (A versus D) while adjusting for relevant covariates. The scores were benchmarked against HIV exposed uninfected group to facilitate the interpretation. Seventy-one percentage of children infected with subtype A versus 60% of children with subtype D were currently on antiretroviral therapy (P = 0.49). Children with HIV-1 subtype A infection were older when compared with subtype D (3.29 vs. 2.76 years, respectively, P = 0.03), but similar regarding sex, socioeconomic status, weight-for-age z-score, CD4+ and CD8+ (% and total), viral load. No statistically significant differences by HIV-1 subtype were observed in the MSEL, COAT and Early Childhood Vigilance Test. Differences ≥ 0.33 of the SD were observed for the MSEL Composite Score, Receptive Language (MSEL) and Total Memory (COAT). In contrast to previously reported differences in ND outcomes of school-age children by HIV-1 subtype, ND scores among preschool children were similar for subtypes A and D, with few potential differences on language production and memory outcomes that favored subtype A.

The potential clinical significance for both surgery design and prognosis determination was discussed. A cross-sectional case series. The eyes of 54 children diagnosed with unilateral combined PFV were evaluated using B-mode ultrasound and color Doppler imaging (CDI). Each participant's age at first presentation, diagnosis for referral, gender, family history, and systemic or other ocular anomalies were recorded. Retinal detachment, optic nerve abnormalities, and macular dislocation were also recorded in detail according to the RetCam (Clarity Medical Systems, Pleasanton, CA), ultrasound, and Doppler findings. The PFV eyes were divided into 4 groups on the basis of the ultrasound and CDI findings. Intergroup analysis was performed. Overall and intergroup analyses of the demographic features of the children with PFV were performed. The axial length, depth of the anterior chamber, and lens thickness were compared between the affected eyes and the fellow healthy eyes among the 4 groups. Some 22.2%, 18.5%, 33.3%, and 25.9% of the eyes were grouped into type I (""I"" shape), II (""Y"" shape), III (inverted ""Y"" shape), and IV (""X"" shape) combined PFV, respectively. The age at first presentation for type I was older than that for the other groups (P = 0.014). The axial length was reduced (P = 0.012) and the anterior chamber more shallow (P = 0.011) than in fellow healthy eyes for type IV eyes, but not for the other 3 groups. Ultrasound and CDI are informative screening and diagnostic tools that show characteristic flow patterns in the 4 types of combined PFV.

Patient 2 was an 11-year-old Arabic boy with an inguinal mass resulted to be an additional testicle in the inguinal canal. The echogenic texture and vascular flow of supernumerary testicles in question were similar to those of the normal testicles; however, their size was smaller. After 3 years of follow-up, the tertiary testes in the two patients remained stable in both size and echogenicity. Ultrasound plays a crucial role in the evaluation of masses.

To compare radionuclide ventriculography (RVG) and echocardiography for the assessment of left ventricular (LV) function in children with Hodgkin disease (HD) receiving doxorubicin, we studied 39 children with HD before radiotherapy, both early (≤ 2 adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine cycles) (group A; n=10) and late (≥ 6 adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine cycles) (group B; n=36) during treatment. Seven children were assessed twice. The patients underwent full clinical assessment, echocardiography, and RVG. In group A, LV ejection fraction (LVEF) was significantly lower when measured by RVG compared with echocardiography (P<0.05). Group B had lower LVEF compared with group A by echocardiography (P=0.09), and by RVG (P=0.000). Paired analysis of children studied early and late showed a significant drop in LVEF by echocardiography (58.7 ± 7.3 vs. 52 ± 52.44%; P=0.04) and RVG (51.4 ± 2.6% vs. 47.2 ± 3.1%; P=0.004).

353,353,34913992,"Smartphone-based fundus imaging (SBFI) is an innovative and low-cost alternative for color fundus photography. Since the first reports on this topic more than 10 years ago a large number of studies on different adapters and clinical applications have been published. The aim of this review article is to provide an overview on the development of SBFI and adapters and clinical applications published so far. A literature search was performed using the MEDLINE and Science Citation Index Expanded databases without time restrictions. Overall, 11 adapters were included and compared in terms of exemplary image material, field of view, acquisition costs, weight, software, application range, smartphone compatibility and certification. Previously published SBFI applications are screening for diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and retinopathy of prematurity as well as the application in emergency medicine, pediatrics and medical education/teaching. Image quality of conventional retinal cameras is in general superior to SBFI. First approaches on automatic detection of diabetic retinopathy through SBFI are promising and the use of automatic image processing algorithms enables the generation of wide-field image montages. SBFI is a versatile, mobile, low-cost alternative to conventional equipment for color fundus photography. In addition, it facilitates the delegation of ophthalmological examinations to assistance personnel in telemedical settings, could simplify retinal documentation, improve teaching, and improve ophthalmological care, particularly in countries with low and middle incomes.

356,356,12170030,"To establish criteria for venous reconstruction of middle hepatic vein (MHV) tributaries of the right liver graft in adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). In adult LDLT using the right hemiliver, the MHV is usually separated from the graft, which results in potential venous congestion in the major part of the right paramedian sector (segments 5 and 8). It is controversial whether MHV tributaries should be reconstructed. Thirty-nine donors for LDLT were enrolled in the study. After liver transection, temporary arterial clamping was carried out to visualize congestion in the right paramedian sector by occlusion of MHV tributaries. Intra- and postoperative (on postoperative days 3 and 7) Doppler ultrasonography was performed to check the hepatic venous and portal flow in the veno-occlusive area. In 29 of 37 donors (78%), the liver surface of the veno-occlusive area was discolored with temporary arterial clamping. The discolored area was calculated to represent approximately two thirds of the right paramedian sector on computed tomography volumetry. All of the cases with discoloration exhibited absent venous flow and regurgitated portal flow in the discolored area by intraoperative Doppler ultrasonography. These ultrasonographic findings resolved by postoperative day 7 in 6 of 14 cases (43%). The state of venous congestion in the right liver graft can be correctly assessed by the temporary arterial clamping method and intraoperative Doppler ultrasonography. If the venocongestive area is demonstrated to be so large that the graft volume excluding this area is thought to be insufficient for postoperative metabolic demand, venous reconstruction is recommended.

The increase in the use of plastic materials in the food packaging industry has led to an increase in released contaminants, such as microplastics (MPs) and phthalates (PAEs), in various food products including teabags. In this research, the abundance and features of MPs as well as PAEs concentration were investigated in 45 teabag samples of different Persian and German brands. The abundance of MPs in the Persian and German teabag samples was averagely 412.32 and 147.28 items/single teabag, respectively. Also, average PAEs levels in the Persian and German teabag samples were 2.87 and 2.37 mg/g, respectively. The predominant size category of MPs was related to 100-250 μm. Fibers and transparent were the dominant shape and color of detected MPs in teabags, respectively. Polyethylene (PE) and nylon were the most common MP polymer types. The most prominent PAEs congeners in teabag samples were diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP). Furthermore, MP exposure hazard through tea ingestion was analyzed for children and adults. DEHP showed the cancer risk (CR) for children and adults. The findings of this research indicated that high MPs and PAEs levels are released from teabags into tea drinks. Considering a daily drinking of a volume of 150 and 250 mL tea by children and adults, 486 and 810 MPs may enter their bodies, respectively.

Local pain (18.1%) and odynophagia (15%) were the most reported first symptoms, and the most frequent OOPML sites were the palatine tonsil (28.5%), hard palate (22.7%), and tongue (20.3%). The median evolution time was three months. Infectious OOPML were the most frequent, as expected in a reference center for infectious diseases, and thus, they are likely to be less frequent in general care and/or dental services. Underreporting of OOPML is possible, as oral/oropharyngeal examination is often not included in the routine medical examination. Oral cavity/oropharynx examination should be performed by specialists, such as dentists and otorhinolaryngologists, who have the expertise in identifying OOPML, even in incipient/asymptomatic cases. Given the numerous diseases in which OOPML can present, diagnosis could be facilitated by multidisciplinary teams, potentially enabling the early treatment of diseases, and thus, reduce morbidity and improve prognosis.

362,362,20798018,"Several studies have investigated the impact of mobile phone exposure on cognitive function in adults. However, children and adolescents are of special interest due to their developing nervous systems. Data were derived from the Australian Mobile Radiofrequency Phone Exposed Users' Study (MoRPhEUS) which comprised a baseline examination of year 7 students during 2005/2006 and a 1-year follow-up. Sociodemographic and exposure data were collected with a questionnaire. Cognitive functions were assessed with a computerised test battery and the Stroop Color-Word test. 236 students participated in both examinations. The proportion of mobile phone owners and the number of voice calls and short message services (SMS) per week increased from baseline to follow-up. Participants with more voice calls and SMS at baseline showed less reductions in response times over the 1-year period in various computerised tasks. Furthermore, those with increased voice calls and SMS exposure over the 1-year period showed changes in response time in a simple reaction and a working memory task. No associations were seen between mobile phone exposure and the Stroop test. We have observed that some changes in cognitive function, particularly in response time rather than accuracy, occurred with a latency period of 1 year and that some changes were associated with increased exposure. However, the increased exposure was mainly applied to those who had fewer voice calls and SMS at baseline, suggesting that these changes over time may relate to statistical regression to the mean, and not be the effect of mobile phone exposure.

363,363,28694011,"Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), a non-specific biomarker of systemic bodily inflammation, has been associated with more pronounced cognitive impairments in adults with psychiatric disorders, particularly in the domains of memory and executive function. Whether this association is present in early life (i.e., the time at which the cognitive impairments that characterise these disorders become evident), and is specific to those with emerging psychiatric disorders, has yet to be investigated. To this end, we examined the association between salivary CRP and cognitive function in children aged 11-14years and explored the moderating effect of psychopathology. The study utilised data from an established longitudinal investigation of children recruited from the community (N=107) that had purposively over-sampled individuals experiencing psychopathology (determined using questionnaires). CRP was measured in saliva samples and participants completed assessments of cognition (memory and executive function) and psychopathology (internalising and externalising symptoms and psychotic-like experiences). Linear regression models indicated that higher salivary CRP was associated with poorer letter fluency (β=-0.24, p=0.006) and scores on the inhibition (β=-0.28, p=0.004) and inhibition/switching (β=-0.36, p<0.001) subtests of the colour-word interference test, but not with performance on any of the memory tasks (working, visual, and verbal memory tasks). Results were largely unchanged after adjustment for psychopathology and no significant interactions between CRP and psychopathology were observed on any cognitive measure. Our findings provide preliminary evidence that elevated salivary CRP is associated with poorer cognitive function in early life, but that this association is not moderated by concurrent psychopathology. These findings have implications for early intervention strategies that attempt to ameliorate cognitive deficits associated with emerging psychiatric disorders. Further research is needed to determine whether salivary CRP levels can be used as a valid marker of peripheral inflammation among healthy adolescents.

Data on the size and location of 210 choroidal naevi were converted into a database of two-dimensional retinal charts by means of computer-drawing software. The geometric centre of each lesion was entered into corresponding sectors of the retinal chart. The location of the naevi was computationally visualised by merging the fundus drawings and displaying the number of overlapping lesions on colour-coded contour maps. Five naevi were located exactly between two fundus sectors, and were therefore excluded from the distribution analysis. Ten naevi (5%) were located anterior and 195 (95%) posterior to the equator. A total of 104 naevi (51%) were located in the temporal and 101 (49%) in the nasal hemisphere, and the distribution between the superior and inferior hemisphere was 104 (51%) and 101 (49%), respectively. The distribution did not differ significantly between genders, age groups, or between right and left eyes. More naevi with a diameter of >3 mm were located in the temporal hemisphere (P=0.0004) and anterior to the equator (P=0.006) compared with those with a diameter of </=3 mm. A similar distribution was found for naevi with overlying drusen.

Recently, it has been reported that silent, mild valvular regurgitation has been encountered in patients with rheumatic fever manifested by isolated polyarthritis and pure chorea. We studied 22 children with Sydenham's chorea to determine clinical and subclinical heart involvement at the time of the initial diagnosis. Ages of the patients ranged from 6-19 y (mean 13.14+/-3.0), and the female/male ratio was 3.4:1. All patients were evaluated by clinical and echocardiographic examination with respect to heart involvement. Carditis was detected in only 5 of 22 patients (23%) by auscultation. Clinical valvular involvement was determined: mitral regurgitation in three and combined mitral and aortic regurgitation in two. The frequency of valvular involvement increased significantly to 63% 2(14/22) after adding silent mitral regurgitation detected by colour Doppler echocardiography (chi2=7.50, p=0.0062). We found that clinically inaudible, but echocardiographically significant, mild valvular regurgitation was frequent in patients with pure chorea.

Twenty youths with ADHD were tested before and after MPH intake in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design and compared to twenty matched controls. Participants were tested on a range of standardized tasks including sustained attention to response, N-Back, and Word/Color Stroop. Identical tasks were administered twice each testing day, before and 1 hour after MPH/Placebo administration. Healthy controls were tested similarly with no intervention. Decreases in response time (RT) variability across tasks and in commission errors were found in ADHD after MPH. Conversely, a significant increase in RT variability and increase in omission errors were observed after the placebo. In the control group, RT variability and omission errors increased whereas commission errors decreased, suggesting fatigue and practice effects, respectively. Test-retest reliability was higher in controls than ADHD.

To correct the two problems simultaneously, the authors attempted to induce persistent postinflammatory hyperpigmentation for color and to build multiple pitted scars like facial skin pores for texture. This study describes a laser hole method using a traditional nonfractional carbon dioxide laser for treatment of facial hypopigmented scars and evaluates the clinical results. Forty-three facial hypopigmented scars in 27 patients were treated, excluding protruding or thick scars. A carbon dioxide laser was set in the superpulse mode by continuous delivery. Multiple small holes were made in the scar at a distance of 1 to 3 mm. Each laser hole was produced by continuously repeated shots at one point until the deep dermis was involved. All lesions were exposed without protection. At 1 or 2 months after initial treatment, the remaining hypopigmentation was treated by the same procedure. Treatment sessions were performed once for nine scars, twice for 22 scars, and three times for 12 scars. In most cases, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation was slightly diminished but maintained until the last follow-up. The fine irregular surface with multiple pitted scars was similar to that of normal skin. Scar improvement evaluation showed marked or excellent in 39 scars (90.7 percent) and minimal or partial in four deep or thick scars.

370,370,35484493,"Child abuse is a major global burden with an enduring negative impact on mental and physical health. A history of child abuse is consistently associated with worse cognitive performance among adults; data in older age groups are inconclusive. Since affective symptoms and cognitive functioning are interrelated among older persons, a synergistic effect can be assumed in patients with affective symptoms who also have suffered from child abuse. This study examines the association between a history of child abuse and cognitive performance in such patients. Cross-sectional data were collected from the 'Routine Outcome Monitoring for Geriatric Psychiatry & Science' project, including 179 older adults (age 60-88 years) with either a unipolar depressive, any anxiety, or somatic symptom disorder referred to specialized geriatric mental health care. A history of physical, sexual, and psychological abuse, and emotional neglect was assessed with a structured interview. Cognitive functioning was measured with three paper and pencils tests (10-words verbal memory test, Stroop Colour-Word test, Digit Span) and four tests from the computerized Cogstate Test Battery (Detection Test, Identification Test, One Card Learning Test, One Back Test). The association between a history of child abuse and cognitive performance was examined by multiple linear regression analyses adjusted for covariates. Principal component analyses of nine cognitive parameters revealed four cognitive domains, i.e., visual-verbal memory, psychomotor speed, working memory and interference control. A history of child abuse was not associated with any of these cognitive domains. However, when looking at the specific types of child abuse separately, a history of physical abuse and emotional neglect were associated with poorer interference control. A history of physical abuse was additionally associated with better visual-verbal memory. The association between a history of child abuse and cognitive performance differs between the different types of abuse. A history of physical abuse might particularly be a key determinant of cognitive performance in older adults with a depressive, anxiety, or somatic symptom disorder.

We analyzed histological sections from 75 patients with UPJ obstruction. Nine patients were excluded owing to bilateral UPJ obstruction and an improper specimen. We divided the specimen obtained from pyeloplasty into 3 parts, namely the renal pelvis above the obstruction, the obstructed UPJ portion and the ureter below the obstruction. To examine the collagen and smooth muscle, sections were stained using Masson's trichrome, and elastic van Giesson stain was used for elastin, smooth muscle and collagen. Collagen, smooth muscle and elastin populations were identified, and the tissue matrix ratio and percentage of elastin were calculated by color image analysis. In patients with lower ratios of collagen-to-smooth muscle in the UPJ proper hydronephrosis was more improved postoperatively (p = 0.049). In patients with a lower percentage of elastin in the renal pelvis, UPJ and ureter hydronephrosis was more improved postoperatively (p <0.0001). Because the UPJ portion was resected during pyeloplasty, the renal pelvis and the ureter remaining after pyeloplasty are likely to be related to improved hydronephrosis. A higher percentage of elastin in the renal pelvis and ureter contributes to inelasticity and low compliance, and results in a slower recovery from hydronephrosis after pyeloplasty.

However, methods to evaluate the treatment of HMME-PDT for PWS effectively and objectively are lacking. This study aimed to describe the different noninvasive diagnostic techniques used in the evaluation of treatment response to HMME-PDT for PWS. Thirty-one lesions of 22 patients with PWS were treated with HMME-PDT. Four noninvasive diagnostic techniques including VISIA-CR™ system, dermoscopy, high-frequency ultrasound (HFUS), and laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) were used to obtain standard radiographic data on skin color, skin thickness, blood vessel morphology, blood vessel distribution, and blood perfusion from lesions and surrounding normal skin before and after HMME-PDT. The standard image pattern of VISIA-CR™ system showed color change in the lesions of PWS after HMME-PDT. RBX red image of VISIA-CR™ system showed that erythema was highly aggregated even in invisible lesions at baseline but decreased after HMME-PDT. The erythema index reduced value d was related to the efficacy rating (γ = 0.631, P < 0.05). Dermoscopy showed that the number of spot-like and irregular linear vessels increased, which was correlated with the increase in clinical classification. After HMME-PDT, vascular rupture was observed by dermoscopy. The response rate of lesions with vascular rupture was 100.00% (20/20). Moreover, the response rate of lesions without vascular rupture was 63.64% (7/11). Vascular rupture sign was correlated with better efficacy (P < 0.05). HFUS showed that the dermis of PWS thickened and was arranged loosely with scattered linear hypoechoic signal. After HMME-PDT, the dermal layer of the lesions became thinner with a decreased linear hypoechoic signal. The response rate of the lesions with linear hypoechoic signal was 76.92% (10/13), and that without linear hypoechoic signal was 94.44% (17/18). The lesions without linear hypoechoic signal in the dermis showed better efficacy (P < 0.05). In some lesions, LSCI showed high blood perfusion signal in PWS lesions and blood perfusion reduction after HMME-PDT. VISIA-CR™ system can be used to observe not only visible but also invisible lesions of PWS. Moreover, lesions fading after HMME-PDT can be described objectively by VISIA-CR™ system. Dermoscopy played an important role in the clinical classification of PWS, including assessing vascular injury after HMME-PDT, guiding the adjustment of therapeutic dose, and selecting the end point of treatment. Both HFUS and LSCI can be used to assist treatment response evaluation of HMME-PDT.

Thus, present study analyzes microplastics in eight major bottled water brands available in Malaysia and estimates the potential human exposure. Membrane filtration method followed by visual and polymer identifications were utilized to identify microplastics particles in these eight major bottled water brands. Microplastic concentrations in bottled water samples ranged from 8 to 22 particles/L, with an average of 11.7 ± 4.6 particles/L. Particle sizes ranging between 100 and 300 μm were dominant and accounted for approximately 31% in these bottled water brands. Fragments were the most identified microplastics in bottled water with transparent color being the most prevalent. The polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP) polymer types found in this study are consistent with prior results in that microplastics in bottled water are mainly derived from packaging materials and bottle caps.

However, few studies have investigated preschool children with regard to these areas. We evaluated the relationship between cognition, attention and peripheral blood concentration of BDNF in preschool children. Twenty-eight children (mean age: 6.16 ± 0.60 years) were recruited. For all subjects, serum and plasma BDNF levels were assessed; intelligence was assessed using the Korean standardisation of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (KEDI-WISC); attention was assessed using the computerised continuous performance test (CCPT), the children's color trails test (CCTT), the Stroop color-word test for preschool children, and the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder rating scale (K-ARS); and finally emotional and behavioral problems were assessed using the child behavior checklist (K-CBCL). We confirmed the previously reported correlations between the various psychometric properties assessed and serum and plasma levels of BDNF in our sample. Serum BDNF levels were negatively correlated with both KEDI-WISC full scale IQ (FSIQ, r = -0.39, p = 0.04) and verbal IQ (VIQ, r = -0.05, p = 0.01), but not with the performance IQ (PIQ, r = -0.12, p = 0.56). There were no significant relationships between plasma BDNF level and VIQ, PIQ or FSIQ. No correlations were found between either serum or plasma level of BDNF and any of the attentional measures (CCPT, ARS, CCTT or Stroop color word test). The CBCL total behavioral problem and attention problem sections were positively correlated with plasma BDNF level (r = 0.41, p = 0.03), (r = 0.44, p = 0.02), however, no relationship was found between the serum BDNF and any of the composite CBCL measures. Our results suggest that high peripheral BDNF may be negatively correlated with intelligence, behavioral problems and clinical symptoms of neuro-developmental disorders such as intellectual disability in preschool children.

No particular preparation of the patient is needed, nevertheless a 3- to 5-hour fasting state improves the quality of the examination. The exam focuses on wall thickness and stratification, lumen content, distensibility and compressibility, presence of peristalsis of explorable segment of the GI tract and includes the investigation of mesentery, perivisceral tissues and nodes features. Color doppler flowmetry admits a qualitative evaluation of GI wall and mesentery vascularization.

Previous studies found that bipolar disorder adolescents showed cognitive impairment. The relationship between complexity of brain neural activity and cognition of bipolar II disorder (BD-II) adolescents remains unclear. Nineteen BD-II patients (14.63 ±1.57 years old) and seventeen age-gender matched healthy controls (HCs) (14.18 ± 1.51 years old) were enlisted. Entropy values of all voxels of the brain in resting-state functional MRI data were calculated and differences of them between BD-II and HC groups were evaluated. After that, correlation analyses were performed between entropy values of brain regions showing significant entropy differences and clinical indices in BD-II adolescents. Significant differences were found in scores of immediate visual reproduction subtest (VR-I, p = 0.003) and Stroop color-word test (SCWT-1, p = 0.015; SCWT-2, p = 0.004; SCWT-3, p = 0.003) between the two groups. Compared with HCs, BD-II adolescents showed significant increased brain entropy in right parahippocampal gyrus and right inferior occipital gyrus. Besides, significant negative correlations between brain entropy values of right parahippocampal gyrus, right inferior occipital gyrus and immediate visual reproduction subtest scores were observed in BD-II adolescents. The findings of the present study suggested that the disrupted function of corticolimbic system is related with cognitive abnormality of BD-II adolescents.

Successful repair will enable somatic growth and avoid repeated valve replacement and the need for systemic anticoagulation. When repair of the aortic valve is not possible in pediatric patients, replacement of the valve requires the most suitable (or, often, the least unsuitable) choice for each patient. The limitations of the typical replacement options (pulmonary autografts, mechanical valves, stented bioprostheses, and homografts) have led us to explore the use of stentless xenografts. Herein, we present a case of aortic valve replacement with a stentless porcine xenograft in one of the youngest and smallest patients reported to date. Use of the xenograft enabled a proper fit with a small aortic annulus, precluded the need for subsequent systemic anticoagulation, and averted a transvalvular gradient and the creation of 2-valve disease. We believe that the stentless porcine xenograft is feasible for use in pediatric patients who require aortic valve replacement.

Review of case notes and results of retinal imaging (color fundus photography, fundus autofluorescence [FAF] imaging, OCT), electrophysiologic assessment, and molecular genetic testing. Molecular genetic testing, clinical findings including visual acuity and retinal imaging, and electrophysiologic assessment. Forty patients with LCA-CEP290 were identified. The deep intronic mutation c.2991+1655 A>G was the most common disease-causing variant (23/40 patients) identified in the compound heterozygous state in 20 patients (50%) and homozygous in 2 patients (5%). Visual acuity (VA) varied from 6/9 to no perception of light, and only 2 of 12 patients with longitudinal VA data showed deterioration in VA in their better-seeing eye over time. A normal fundus was found at diagnosis in younger patients (mean age, 1.9 years), with older patients showing white flecks (mean age, 5.9 years) or pigmentary retinopathy (mean age, 21.7 years). Eleven of 12 patients (92%) with OCT imaging had preservation of foveal architecture. Ten of 12 patients (83%) with FAF imaging had a perifoveal hyperautofluorescent ring. Having 2 nonsense CEP290 mutations was associated with worse final VA and the presence of nonocular features. Detailed analysis of the clinical phenotype of LCA-CEP290 in a large cohort confirms that there is a window of opportunity in childhood for therapeutic intervention based on relative structural preservation in the central cone-rich retina in a significant proportion of patients, with the majority harboring the deep intronic variant potentially tractable to several planned gene editing approaches.

Cultured GCTTS cells obtained from a 7-year-old Japanese girl were divided into two groups, one for PKH-2 (green) staining and the other for PKH-26 (red) staining. After staining with the dyes, the cell populations were mixed and observed with a fluorescent microscope on the 4th and 14th days after mixing. On both the 4th and 14th days, the cultured GCTTS giant cells showed a mosaic of green and red colors, thus indicating cell membrane fusion. Images of double fluorescent labeled giant cells indicated cell fusion of mononucleated stromal cells that lead to multinucleated giant cells in these GCTTS cell cultures.

A qualitative paradigm was utilized so that the participants could tell their stories through words and text rather than collecting statistical data which is the domain of quantitative research. The adoption of a feminist standpoint theory bridged a communication gap, adjusted the balance of power within society and gave visibility and voice to the women. Eight New Zealand-resident multipara biological mothers ages 18 and over, who had nurtured or were still living with their affected offspring, were studied. Their ages ranged from 29 to 64. The mothers were interviewed in depth, face-to-face, using unstructured, open-ended questions. Data were analyzed using the constant comparative method. The mothers described a range of issues of concern for their disabled offspring and themselves (as advocates) relating to health, social, educational, judicial systems, lack of knowledge by professionals and problems in diagnosis, to being oppressed and stigmatized. Cognitive concerns for the offspring included attention-deficit, absence of fear, diminished memory and comprehension and inability to acknowledge and understand consequences. Behavioural issues included excessive crying or no crying as a baby, lying, stealing, hyper-activity, aggressiveness, destructiveness, sexual promiscuity and few friends. Other issues of concern were delayed milestones and numerous health problems. All mothers stated that the pregnancy, labour and delivery of their child with FASD were different from their other non-compromised pregnancies/labours/deliveries. Most mothers said that the doctors used medical language which they did not understand, thus giving power to the former. Seven mothers were either married to or partners of alcoholics when they conceived their offspring with FASD. All mothers had been drinking alcohol before becoming pregnant. Six mothers came from drinking families. Most mothers continued to consume alcohol because they did not know that they had conceived. All mothers were unaware of FASD and its effects on the unborn child. Eight babies had low Apgar scores with an average of 6 (out of 10) and low birth weight (average 6lb 2oz). An Apgar score is a numerical expression of an infant's condition, usually determined at 60 seconds after birth, based on heart rate, respiratory efforts, muscle tone, reflex irritability and colour. All women were of middle to high socio-economic status. Seven mothers experienced family breakdown as a result of alcohol consumption by the biological father of the child with FASD. All women feared for their child's future. Health, social, educational, judicial professionals, policy-makers and agencies, need to understand and be educated in the daily realities and complex problems that children with FASD and their families face. Only then will the correct diagnosis be made so that these individuals can receive the nurturing, needs, education, funding and support they require in order to live full and meaningful lives and have the quality of life they deserve.

We aim to help pediatricians detect facial dysmorphism across the fetal alcohol spectrum, especially among nonsyndromal heavily exposed (HE) individuals without classic facial characteristics. Of 192 Cape Coloured children recruited, 69 were born to women who reported abstaining from alcohol during pregnancy. According to multifaceted criteria, the remainder were allocated clinically to the FAS (n = 22), partial FAS (n = 26) or nonsyndromal HE (n = 75) categories. We used dense surface modeling and signature analyses of 3-dimensional facial photographs to determine agreement between clinical categorization and classifications induced from face shape alone, to visualize facial differences, and to consider predictive links between face shape and neurobehavior. Face classification achieved significant agreement with clinical categories for discrimination of nonexposed from FAS alone (face: 0.97-1.00; profile: 0.92) or with the addition of partial FAS (face: 0.90; profile: 0.92). Visualizations of face signatures delineated dysmorphism across the fetal alcohol spectrum and in half of the nonsyndromal HE category face signature graphs detected facial characteristics consistent with prenatal alcohol exposure. This subgroup performed less well on IQ and learning tests than did nonsyndromal subjects without classic facial characteristics. Heat maps and morphing visualizations of face signatures may help clinicians detect facial dysmorphism across the fetal alcohol spectrum. Face signature graphs show potential for identifying nonsyndromal heavily exposed children who lack the classic facial phenotype but have cognitive impairment.

Studies have examined clinical features and presentations of melanoma among the pediatric population and the conventional ABCDE criteria (asymmetrical shape, border, color, diameter, evolving lesion) used to diagnosis adult melanoma may not be entirely appropriate for pediatric melanoma; as such, additional pediatric-ABCD and CUP criteria (color changing, ulceration, pyogenic granuloma-like lesions) have been proposed. Dermoscopy serves as a valuable tool to detect suggestive patterns among pediatric skin lesions, and aids in the monitoring of skin lesions and detection of melanoma among children and adolescents. The etiology and pathogenesis of the pediatric melanoma is currently being investigated; studies have examined the genetic alterations that may be involved with the development of pediatric melanomas including TERT promoter, BRAF, and NRAS among others. While genetic testing using molecular techniques such as comparative genomic hybridization and fluorescence in-situ hybridization is helpful for diagnosis in certain contexts, molecular workup is not considered standard of care among pediatric melanoma cases, and in fact has not been proven to reliably distinguish between benign and malignant spitzoid tumors in children.

Achievement of a negative MRD state assessed by multicolor flowcytometry (MFC) is an important predictor of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in ALL patients. We sought to determine whether panels of antibodies combination are more suitable for detection of MRD in Childhood ALL. Eighty-four (84) patients with ALL (B-lineage subtype) were enrolled in this study. Normal template for B cell precursors was established in 15 control participants using 4-four panels of monoclonal Antibodies (Mo Abs),{CD22, CD45, CD58 and CD97 in combination with CD10, CD19, CD34}. At diagnosis, CD22 exhibited the lowest incidence of expression in only 50% of all patients, while CD45, CD58, and CD97 were expressed in 80.9, 59.5 and 92.8%, respectively. Analysis of MRD was performed for each Mo Abs combination at day 0 and day 14 post-induction of chemotherapy by 4-color (FCM). The incidence of MRD was 61.9, 70.6, 60.0 and 55.1% for CD22, CD45, CD58 and CD97, respectively. In B-ALL patients, (CD10/CD19/CD34/CD45) + (CD10/CD19/CD34/CD97) represented the highest incidence of expression of leukemic cells markers with a significant correlation with blasts count, suggesting that these are more specific for MRD detection. Also FCM is relatively cost effective for detection of MRD in ALL patients and its applicability in routine leukemia lab is valuable. MRD evaluation at the end of the induction therapy (i.e. day 35 or 42 according to the different schedules) is advised. Also, Ig/T cell receptor gene rearrangements and gene fusions analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are preferred.

To evaluate clinical responses after induction chemotherapy, we followed up on their bone marrow study. In our study, in vitro chemosensitivity test with the MTT assay significantly predicted whether patients with AML remained continuous complete remission or went into relapse.

Intralesional injection of pingyangmycin as a minimally invasive, gentle intervention may have better outcomes in treating low-flow OVMs compared with other currently used methods. To investigate the efficacy and safety of intralesional injection of pingyangmycin for treatment of low-flow OVM. A retrospective, noncomparative, interventional case series was conducted in a single medical center. Thirty-three consecutive patients with low-flow OVMs undergoing intralesional injection of pingyangmycin were included in the study. Injections of 1 to 5 mL of a pingyangmycin 1.5-mg/mL mixture with lidocaine hydrochloride, 2%, were given. Each patient received 1 to 4 injections at an interval of 6 to 8 weeks between February 2002 and January 2013. Mixture volume was determined on a basis of 0.5 mL of solution per cubic centimeter of the lesion. The maximum dose for 1 injection was 8 mg. Clinical observations were well documented before and after treatment. Reduction of lesion volume based on ultrasound-measured volume; overall appearance, including blue color and thickness of lesions before and after treatment; and adverse events were evaluated. Patients received a median of 2 (range, 1-4) intralesional injections of pingyangmycin. The mean pretreatment volume was 4.4 cm3 and posttreatment volume was 1.0 cm3 (t = 4.63; P < .001), with a mean decrease of 84% (range, 28%-100%). Marked to moderate improvement in the volume of the lesions was noticed in 31 eyes (94%; 25 of 33 [76%] with marked improvement and 6 of 33 [18%] with moderate improvement). Improvement occurred in 95% (18 of 19) of superficial lesions, 100% (3 of 3) of deep lesions, and 91% (10 of 11) of combined lesions. We noticed significant improvements in blue color and thickness on the basis of investigator scores from clinical photographs taken before and after treatment.

However, comparing the neurodevelopmental effects of prenatal and postnatal MeHg exposure (PreMeHg and PostMeHg, respectively) remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the associations between neurodevelopmental indicators and PreMeHg or PostMeHg. The participants were 134 children in the first grade of elementary schools aged 7-8 years from the Kinan region, an area with high consumption of MeHg-rich whales and tunas in Japan. We measured MeHg levels in preserved umbilical cord tissues and total mercury (T-Hg) levels in children's hair to estimate PreMeHg and PostMeHg levels, respectively. Neuropsychological (intelligence quotient testing and Boston Naming Test) and neurophysiological (brainstem auditory evoked potential [BAEP], visual evoked potential [VEP], and color vision tests) studies were performed to evaluate the neurodevelopmental status. Multiple regression analyses were conducted according to sex. The geometric mean MeHg levels in preserved umbilical cord tissues and T-Hg levels in children's hair were 0.11 μg/g and 2.94 μg/g, respectively. Neither PreMeHg nor PostMeHg was related to neuropsychological indicators. Some associations between MeHg exposure and neurophysiological results were observed only in boys. N145 latency in VEPs was significantly prolonged with increasing PreMeHg (β: 12.01, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.648, 23.38). The III-V interpeak intervals in BAEP were significantly prolonged with increasing PreMeHg or PostMeHg (β [95% CI]: 0.142 [0.041, 0.243] and 0.159 [0.052, 0.265], respectively). After adjusting for PreMeHg, the association between PostMeHg and BAEP latencies disappeared.

The fate of opsin-deficient cone cells is unknown. We know that rod opsin null mutant mice show rapid postnatal death of rod photoreceptors. Using in vivo histology with high-resolution retinal imaging, we studied a cohort of 20 BCM patients (age range 5-58) with large deletions in the red/green opsin gene array. Already in the first years of life, retinal structure was not normal: there was partial loss of photoreceptors across the central retina. Remaining cone cells had detectable outer segments that were abnormally shortened. Adaptive optics imaging confirmed the existence of inner segments at a spatial density greater than that expected for the residual blue cones. The evidence indicates that human cones in patients with deletions in the red/green opsin gene array can survive in reduced numbers with limited outer segment material, suggesting potential value of gene therapy for BCM.

We applied this test to the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from patients with bacterial meningitis due to gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, or fungi, showed positive reactions to the test. In contrast, CSF from patients with viral meningitis or noninfectious illnesses gave negative reactions. Therefore, this test seems to be useful for diagnosis of bacterial and fungal meningitis. When this test was used together with two types of limulus tests, an endotoxin-specific test, and a conventional test, meningitis was further characterized as gram-positive, gram-negative or fungal meningitis. The SLP test requires a computerized instrument for quantitative colorimetric measurement. A qualitative alternative of this test also can be accomplished by visually observing the darkening color.

414,414,30376534,"Migraine-type photophobia, most commonly described as exacerbation of headache by light, affects nearly 90% of the patients. It is the most bothersome symptom accompanying an attack. Using subjective psychophysical assessments, we showed that migraine patients are more sensitive to all colors of light during ictal than during interictal phase and that control subjects do not experience pain when exposed to different colors of light. Based on these findings, we suggested that color preference is unique to migraineurs (as it was not found in control subjects) rather than migraine phase (as it was found in both phases). To identify the origin of this photophobia in migraineurs, we compared the electrical waveforms that were generated in the retina and visual cortex of 46 interictal migraineurs to those generated in 42 healthy controls using color-based electroretinography and visual-evoked potential paradigms. Unexpectedly, it was the amplitude of the retinal rod-driven b wave, which was consistently larger (by 14%-19% in the light-adapted and 18%-34% in the dark-adapted flash ERG) in the migraineurs than in the controls, rather than the retinal cone-driven a wave or the visual-evoked potentials that differs most strikingly between the 2 groups. Mechanistically, these findings suggest that the inherent hypersensitivity to light among migraine patients may originate in the retinal rods rather than retinal cones or the visual cortex. Clinically, the findings may explain why migraineurs complain that the light is too bright even when it is dim to the extent that nonmigraineurs feel as if they are in a cave.

In order to obtain a better understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation of the various mutations in the optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) gene, we obtained both clinical and genetic information of ADOA patients from published reports. We conducted a systematic review of published OPA1 literature and identified 408 individuals with confirmed OPA1 mutations, 120 of whom reported extra-ocular (ADOA 'plus') manifestations through their descriptions of visual and multi-systemic symptoms. Our results show that there is a significant variation in frequency of the specific exons involved between the ADOA classic and ADOA 'plus' patients. Classic ADOA groups were more likely to have mutations in exon 8 and 9, while ADOA 'plus' groups were more likely to have mutations in exons 14, 15 and 17. Additional comparisons revealed significant differences between mutation types/domains and specific ADOA 'plus' manifestations. We also found that individuals with maternally inherited OPA1 mutations were significantly more likely to develop 'plus' manifestations than those with paternally inherited mutations.

A high resolution color image video analysis system was used to quantify and compare collagen and smooth muscle components of the muscularis layers to normal control ureters from patients of similar ages. In comparing ureters with ectopia (7), ureters with ectopic ureteroceles (20) and control ureters (4) there was not a statistically different collagen-to-smooth muscle ratio among the groups. In the patients with posterior urethral valves the amount of collagen and smooth muscle was not statistically different from controls (p > 0.01), although the collagen-to-smooth muscle ratio was increased. The 4 patients with the prune belly syndrome had a collagen-to-smooth muscle ratio that was markedly elevated (1.21 versus 0.39) compared with controls. When this group was analyzed as 2 separate groups (obstructed versus refluxing ureters) the difference was more apparent (p < 0.004).

Grating acuities in all BCM patients were driven by S-cones and rods; the foveal structural differences were not reflected in a difference between cohorts in visual sensitivity and spatial resolution. A difference in structural phenotype due to the C203R mutation versus large deletion mutations in BCM was detected as a more prolonged persistence of foveal photoreceptor structure in patients with the missense mutation. This should be taken into account in planning natural history studies, selecting outcomes for clinical trials, and defining the time window for possible therapies.

428,428,30339877,"To characterize the ocular phenotype of DICER1 syndrome. Prospective, single-center, case-control study. One hundred three patients with an identified germline pathogenic DICER1 variant (DICER1 carriers) and 69 family control participants underwent clinical and ophthalmic examination at the National Institutes of Health between 2011 and 2016. All participants were evaluated with a comprehensive ophthalmic examination, including best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and a dilated fundus examination. A subset of patients returned for a more detailed evaluation including spectral-domain OCT, color fundus photography, fundus autofluorescence imaging, visual field testing, full-field electroretinography, and genetic testing for inherited retinal degenerative diseases. Visual acuity and examination findings. Most DICER1 carriers (97%) maintained a visual acuity of 20/40 or better in both eyes. Twenty-three DICER1 carriers (22%) showed ocular abnormalities compared with 4 family controls (6%; P = 0.005). These abnormalities included retinal pigment abnormalities (n = 6 [5.8%]), increased cup-to-disc ratio (n = 5 [4.9%]), optic nerve abnormalities (n = 2 [1.9%]), epiretinal membrane (n = 2 [1.9%]), and drusen (n = 2 [1.9%]). Overall, we observed a significant difference (P = 0.03) in the rate of retinal abnormalities in DICER1 carriers (n = 11 [11%]) versus controls (n = 1 [1.5%]). One patient demonstrated an unexpected diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa with a novel variant of unknown significance in PRPF31, and 1 showed optic nerve elevation in the setting of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) of unclear cause. Three patients (3%) demonstrated DICER1-related ciliary body medulloepithelioma (CBME), 2 of which were identified during routine examination, a higher rate than that reported previously. Ophthalmologists should be aware of the ophthalmic manifestations of DICER1 syndrome, and individuals and families should be counseled on the potential signs and symptoms. We recommend that children with a germline pathogenic variant in DICER1, especially those younger than 10 years, undergo annual dilated ophthalmic examination, looking for evidence of CBME, signs of increased ICP, and perhaps changes in the retinal pigment epithelium.

429,429,25042470,"Traditional interpretation of GC-MS output involved the semi-quantitative estimation of outstanding low or high specific metabolites and the ratio between metabolites. Here, we utilize a systems biology approach to steroid metabolomics of a complex steroid-related disorder, using an all-inclusive analysis of the steroidal pathway in the form of a subject steroidal fingerprint and disease signature, providing novel methods of normalization and visualization. The study compares 324 normal children to pure enzymatic deficiency in 27 untreated 21-hydroxylase CAH patients and to complex disease in 70 children with obesity. Steroid profiles were created by quantitative data generated by GC-MS analyses. A novel peer-group normalization method defined each individual subject's control group in a multi-dimensional space of metadata parameters. Classical steroid pathway visualization was enhanced by adding urinary end-product sub-nodes and by color coding of semi-quantitative metabolic concentrations and enzymatic activities. Unbiased automated data analysis confirmed the common knowledge for CAH - the inferred 17-hydroxyprogesterone was up-regulated and the inferred 21-hydroxylase enzyme activity was down-regulated. In childhood obesity, we observe a general decrease of both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid metabolites, increased androgens, up-regulation of 17,20-lyase, 17-OHase and 11β-HSD1 activity and down-regulation of 21-OHase enzymatic activity. Our study proved novel normalization and visualization techniques are to be useful in identifying subject fingerprint and disease signature in enzymatic deficiency and insufficiency, while demonstrating hypothesis generation in a complex disease such as childhood obesity.

Within the literature, different techniques have been described for reconstruction of the external lamellae of the upper and lower eyelids as well as the medial and lateral canthal regions.Herein, we present the expanded pedicled forehead flap as a versatile and useful surgical option for reconstruction of various defects around the eye globe. A tissue expander is inserted underneath the forehead skin and serially expanded. The pedicle of the expanded pedicled flap is designed either from the superior portion of the expanded skin and interpolated to reconstruct the upper and lower eyelids, and the medial or lateral canthal areas; or from the inferior portion of the expanded skin and interpolated over the eyebrow to reconstruct the area between the upper eyelid crease and eyebrow.Fifteen patients with periorbital nevi or severe scarring were treated using the expanded forehead flap between the years 2003 and 2012. Thirteen patients had complex periorbital defects involving multiple anatomic areas, and 2 patients had defects confined to the upper eyelid area only. Operative and postoperative course for 13 patients was uneventful. One patient had a late infection of the tissue expander but nonetheless continued with the reconstructive process. In 1 patient, the tissue expander was removed due to infection, and subsequent reconstruction was not carried out. The aesthetic and functional results of reconstruction were very good, and with excellent skin color and thickness match. In 1 patient, the flap was defattened in an ancillary procedure. No partial or complete flap loss was observed in this study. We conclude that the expanded pedicled forehead flap is a safe and reliable method for reconstruction of different segments of the periorbital region, while providing good aesthetic and functional reconstructive results with minimal donor-site morbidity.

Our study was consisted of 326 patients who underwent liver transplantation procedures between November 1997 and May 2004. The records of all patients were reviewed retrospectively for the details of each patient's post-transplant Doppler US examinations, visceral angiographic examinations, and/or surgical procedures. Doppler US findings were correlated with angiographic results or surgery. Sensitivity and specificity of Doppler US parameters for the diagnosis of vascular complications of the hepatic artery, portal vein, and hepatic veins were calculated. Vascular complications occurred in 47 patients (14%). Eight instances of vascular complications were detected intraoperatively by Doppler US at the time of transplantation. For hepatic artery complications, use of a Doppler US criteria resulted in a sensitivity and a specificity of 92% and 97%, respectively. Doppler US parameters also resulted in a sensitivity and a specificity of 100% in detecting portal vein complications, and resulted in a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 100% in detecting hepatic vein complications.

Incomplete forms occur as well. This study investigates the genetic basis of clinically suspected ACHM in the United Arab Emirates. Retrospective case series (January 2016-December 2023) of patients with (1) clinically suspected ACHM or (2) mutations in ACHM-associated genes ( CNGA3 , CNGB3 , GNAT2 , PDE6C , PDE6H , AT6 ). Twenty-two clinically suspected patients (19 probands) were identified. Biallelic disease genes and the number of probands were CNGA3 (9), CNGB3 (6), PDE6C (1), GNAT2 (1), RGS9BP (1), and CNNM4 (1). Some mutant alleles were recurrent across different families. Two probands had their diagnoses revised after genetic testing and phenotypic reassessment to RGS9BP -related bradyopsia and CNNM4 -related Jalili syndrome. Three additional cases (making 22 total probands) were identified from ACHM gene mutation review-one each related to PDE6C , to AT6 , and to CNGB3 in concert with CNGA3 (triallelic disease). All three presented with macular discoloration, an atypical finding for classic ACHM. CNGA3 was the single most frequent implicated gene. Bradyopsia and Jalili syndrome can resemble incomplete ACHM. Recurrent mutant alleles may represent founder effects. Macular discoloration on presentation can occur in PDE6C -related disease, AT6 -related disease, and triallelic CNGB3 / CNGA3 -related disease. The possibility for triallelic disease exists and requires genetic counseling beyond that of simple autosomal recessive inheritance.

We identified novel risk factors for keratinocyte carcinomas and melanoma, highlighted the prognostic value of several FANCA alleles among individuals with a history of sunlamp use and childhood sunburns, and demonstrated the importance of combining genetic and clinical data in disease risk stratification. This study revealed genome-wide associations with important implications for understanding skin cancer risk in the context of the rapidly-evolving field of precision medicine.

435,435,23166719,"Definitive diagnosis of infectious diseases, including food poisoning, requires culture and identification of the infectious agent. We described how antibodies could be used to shorten this cumbersome process. Specifically, we employed an anti-Salmonella lipopolysaccharide O12 monoclonal antibody in an epitope-inhibition 10-min test (TUBEX TP) to detect O12⁺Salmonella organisms directly from routine blood culture broths. The aim is to obviate the need to subculture the broth and subsequently identify the colonies. Thus, blood from 78 young outpatients suspected of having enteric fever was incubated in an enrichment broth, and after 2 or 4 days, broth samplings were examined by TUBEX TP as well as by conventional agar culture and identification. TUBEX TP was performed before the culture results. Eighteen isolates of S. Typhi (15 after 2 days) and 10 isolates of S. Paratyphi A (4 after 2 days) were obtained by conventional culture. Both these Salmonella serotypes, the main causes of enteric fever, share the O12 antigen. In all instances where either of these organisms was present (cultured), TUBEX TP was positive (score 4 [light blue]--to--score 10 [dark blue]; negative is 0 [pink-colored]) i.e. 100% sensitive. Identification of the specific Salmonella serotype in TUBEX-positive cases was achieved subsequently by conventional slide agglutination using appropriate polyclonal antisera against the various serotypes. Twelve Escherichia coli, 1 Alcaligenes spp. and 1 Enterobacter spp. were isolated. All of these cases, including all the 36 culture-negative broths, were TUBEX-negative i.e. TUBEX TP was 100% specific. In a separate study using known laboratory strains, TUBEX TF, which detects S. Typhi but not S. Paratyphi A via the O9 antigen, was found to efficiently complement TUBEX TP as a differential test. Thus, TUBEX TP and TUBEX TF are useful adjuncts to conventional culture because they can save considerable time (>2 days), costs and manpower.

A KMT2A break-apart FISH probe identified 2 intact copies of the KMT2A gene region and an extra 5'KMT2A signal in 85% of interphase nuclei. Subsequent FISH studies using a KMT2A/AFDN dual-color dual-fusion FISH probe revealed positive results for a single fusion in 82% of interphase nuclei, indicating a KMT2A/AFDN gene fusion. Subsequently, metaphase FISH confirmed the location of the KMT2A/AFDN fusion at 6q27.

Patients were divided into two age categories, with a mean age of 3 years and 4.5 years, respectively. The group of healthy age-matched controls contained 60 individuals. Three-dimensional virtual facial models were evaluated using geometric morphometry and multivariate statistics methods. Statistically significant differences were found between each of the cleft groups and the controls. Color-coded maps showed facial shape deviations, which were located mainly in the nasal area and philtrum in all groups examined, and also in the buccal region and the chin in patients with UCLP or BCLP. These differences became more apparent, but not significantly so, in the older age category. Facial deviations typical of patients with clefts were observed in all of the patient groups examined. Although the analysis showed statistically significant differences in overall facial shape between patients and controls among all groups tested, the facial morphology in patients who have undergone only neonatal cheiloplasty (CL) is influenced to a small extent and may be considered satisfactory.

446,446,36262950,"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, also known as ADHD, is a neurodevelopmental disorder diagnosed in children. The exact cause of ADHD is not known, but, along with genetic factors, it is possible that environmental factors including toxins and diet may affect symptom severity. Of these dietary components, artificial food coloring (AFC), while approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has been suspected to be associated with ADHD symptoms. Of the nine FDA-certified food colors, two are used for artificial blue coloring: Blue No. 1 and Blue No. 2. There is limited literature describing the possible role of blue AFC in causing symptoms of ADHD in children. This paper provides a review of the literature surrounding artificial food coloring and its ability to affect the neurodevelopment of children in a way that could increase the behavioral indicators of ADHD. To do this, search criteria were established using a combination of MeSH terms about blue AFCs and ADHD and were entered into PubMed, along with limits on article types and publication dates from January 2000 to June 2022. There was a total of 20 articles that met this search criterion. These articles were reviewed by authors, and the ones not relevant to the topic were excluded. In total, four studies were chosen to be included in this article. After reviewing the literature, it was found that restriction diets, specifically those excluding AFCs, may affect symptom severity. The source of these changes is not known, but possible mechanisms include AFCs causing nutritional deficiencies and allergic reactions or altering neurotransmitter levels.

Recently, RYR2 exon 3 deletion has been identified in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and/or CPVT. This study aimed to screen for the RYR2 exon 3 deletion in CPVT probands, characterize its clinical pathology, and confirm the genomic rearrangement. Our cohort consisted of 24 CPVT probands. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based conventional genetic analysis did not identify any mutations in coding exons of RYR2 in these probands. They were screened using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). In probands identified with RYR2 exon 3 deletion, the precise location of the deletion was identified by quantitative PCR and direct sequencing methods. We identified two CPVT probands from unrelated families who harboured a large deletion including exon 3. The probands were 9- and 17-year-old girls. Both probands had a history of syncope related to emotional stress or exercise, exhibited bradycardia, and were diagnosed with left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC). We examined 10 family members and identified six more RYR2 exon 3 deletion carriers. In total, there were eight carriers, of which seven were diagnosed with LVNC (87.5%). Two carriers under the age of 4 years remained asymptomatic, although they were diagnosed with LVNC. Using quantitative PCR and direct sequencing, we confirmed that the deletions were 1.1 and 37.7 kb in length. RYR2 exon 3 deletion is frequently associated with LVNC. Therefore, detection of the deletion offers a new modality for predicting the prognosis of patients with LVNC with ventricular/atrial arrhythmias, particularly in children.

Color Doppler ultrasonography demonstrated absent hepatic venous flow and reversed portal venous flow in the congested area of the left paramedian sector which had been drained by the divided branch of the middle hepatic vein. The area was darkly discolored before arterial reperfusion and under clamping of the artery. Reconstruction of the venous branch was added after arterial anastomosis. Color Doppler ultrasonography revealed restored normal venous outflow and portal inflow after venous reconstruction. Postoperative course of the recipient was uneventful with rapid recovery of liver function. We propose that middle hepatic vein tributaries should be reconstructed if color Doppler ultrasonography demonstrates absent venous flow and reversed portal flow, and if the liver volume excluding the discolored area under occlusion of the hepatic artery is estimated to be insufficient for postoperative metabolic demand.

Time-to-peak and area under the curve values were obtained. Postoperative changes in adjusted time-to-peak (ΔTTP) and ratios of adjusted area under the curve changes (ΔAUC ratio) of common carotid artery, ICA, and external carotid artery angiograms were compared across clinical and angiographic outcome groups. To analyze diagnostic performance, we categorized clinical outcomes into favorable and unfavorable groups. The ΔTTP at the common carotid artery increased among clinical and angiographic outcomes, in that order, with significant differences (P = .003 and .005, respectively). The ΔAUC ratio at the common carotid artery and external carotid artery also increased, in that order, among clinical and angiographic outcomes with a significant difference (all, P = .000).

The metal burdens in Kwung Tong, an old area with heavy traffic, are significantly higher than other districts. When a Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance was performed on the ranked metal concentrations in different housing districts, the Chi-square values are all significant at a probability level of < 0.001. This might be attributable to the fact that there is no highly contaminating industries (such as metal smelters, battery plants and petrochemicals) in Hong Kong. The dust metals may travel from the roads, through the windows and balconies, into the houses, as those homes that do not have their windows opened often had a lower level of contaminants in their house dust (median Cd= 3.6 microg/g; median Cu = 313.2 microg/g; median Pb = 144.6 microg/g; median Mn = 211.6 microg/g; and median Zn = 1,333.7 microg/g). Moreover, those occupants who sweep their floors or dust their furniture on daily bases, or use vacuum cleaners, had a lower level of metals inside their houses. Another finding of interest is that the color of the wall paint used in the house may be another factor influencing the contamination levels. ",2458,Home sweet home?

Data collected via telephone interviews in a nationwide sample of 554 parents or caregivers in family were analyzed. Use of sunscreen was the most common measure applied (77.8%), while sunglasses were least frequently used (12.5%). The prevalence of sunburn during the past year was 21.8%, and it was positively associated with children's age. The use of sun protection measures was significantly associated with the age and skin color of the child, while characteristics and tanning behaviors of the caregivers only played a minor role.

Some patients with deep hand burns are treated with full-thickness or split-thickness skin grafts. Skin graft is commonly used for hand reconstruction. However, the grafted skin would be more pigmented than the adjacent skin and different from skin texture. 19 patients who showed hyperpigmentation after skin graft of finger and palm were treated. They all were injured by hand burns. We performed mechanical dermabrasion of the hyperpigmentation scar and application of a split thickness skin harvested from medial aspect of plantar of foot. Patients were asked about their level of satisfaction with the procedure and scar appearance was assessed using a five-point Likert scale. Also scar appearances were assessed using a Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS). The grafts were completely taken in all 19 patients. The color of the graft became similar to adjacent tissue. 15 patients were very satisfied, and four patients were relatively satisfied. The average score of the patients postoperative appearance improvement was 4.5 (improved to significantly improved postoperative appearance). Average VSS score was improved from 9.53 to 2.53.

Color Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) is an important tool in the diagnosis and follow-up of varicocele, and could be successfully used to detect a venous reflux in the iliac-deferential district, usually involved in the recurrence/persistence of varicocele. We compared 2 historical series of patients treated with Palomo laparoscopic varicocelectomy between 1994 and 2018. In group 1, preoperative scrotal CDUS was obtained, while in group 2, additional inguinal CDUS was performed in order to detect a refluxing deferential vein (DV). When a deferential reflux was found, the DV and internal spermatic vein were interrupted during the same Palomo laparoscopic varicocelectomy. A total of 449 patients underwent left laparoscopic varicocelectomy; 146 of them were not studied for deferential reflux with CDUS (group 1), while in the remaining 303, routine CDUS research of deferential reflux was obtained (group 2). The persistence/recurrence rate was significantly higher in group 1 (13.7 vs. 1%, p < 0.000).

They allow accurate quantification of immune responses ex vivo independent of function, with high levels of sensitivity. They have revealed unexpectedly large frequencies of 'memory' T cell responses against viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and provided information about their phenotypic and functional variation. However, such studies have generally concentrated on limited numbers of individuals analysed in detail. To allow larger population-based studies, we devised a method for tetramer analysis using 50-100 microlitre blood volumes in a 96-well plate format. We adapted this method to study the effect of age on responses in a cohort of nearly 600 individuals to an immunodominant HLA-A2 restricted response to CMV pp65 (NLVPMVATV). We observed the phenomenon of steady 'memory inflation' with age, similar to recently observed longitudinal data from murine studies.

471,471,1392338,"Liver transplantation from a brain death donor has not yet been accepted in Japan. The only alternative method at present is transplantation from a living donor. After the first successful living related liver transplantation was performed by Strong in Brisbane, Australia, Japanese hepatic and transplant surgeons also began to perform such operations. As of February 1991, 16 living related liver transplantations had already been performed in Japan, mainly for children with biliary atresia. Five of these patients subsequently died, however, our patient has survived more than 1 year, and she is presently leading a normal school life. The most important issue regarding living related liver transplantation is to ensure the donor's safety. For this purpose, we conducted a preoperative banking of the donor's own blood and plasma. In addition, a selective vascular occlusion was carried out to reduce blood loss during the resection of the liver. Intraoperative color Doppler ultrasonography was introduced for evaluating the circulation of the graft. By using this modality, the following three points were able to be accurately estimated in order to obtain optimal graft perfusion: 1) The most suitable position for the graft to be fixed to the abdominal wall, 2) whether or not the abdominal wall could be closed and 3) the indication for a ligation of the collateral veins to form a porto-systemic shunt. Thanks to these procedures, living related liver transplantations have now become an acceptable transplant method, however, a transplantation from a cadaver that is brain dead but still has a beating heart is still absolutely necessary for adult recipients.

Among 286 Black, South African women, the association between childhood maltreatment and neurocognitive health, defined here as neurocognitive performance (NP), was first estimated assuming constant variance. Then, without assuming constant variance, we applied Goldstein's method (Encyclopedia of statistics in behavioral science, Wiley, 2005) to model ""complex level-1 variation"" in NP as a function of childhood maltreatment. Mean performance in some tests of information processing speed (Digit-symbol, Stroop Word, and Stroop Color) lowered with increasing severity of childhood maltreatment, without evidence of significant individual variation. Conversely, we found significant individual variation by severity of childhood maltreatment in tests of information processing speed (Trail Making Test) and executive function (Color Trails 2 and Stroop Color-Word), in the absence of mean differences.

Behavioral difficulties score of the children was assessed using Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare between the cognition outcomes and behavioral difficulties score pre- and post-COVID-19-lockdown. In a sub-group of children who provided data in both surveys, the difference in cognitive and behavioral outcomes was tested using a mixed effect model. Compared to the pre-COVID-19-lockdown, schoolchildren post-COVID-19-lockdown scored lower in the standardized performance index for the visual search task, which measures attention (0.27 SD, 95% confidence intervals (95%CI): -0.40, -0.13).

Cigarette smoke induces numerous side effects in the people who do not smoke, but are in the same environment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of parental smoking on pigmentation of their children's oral mucosa. This study was carried out as a historical cohort. Participants were 400 healthy children, 10 to 11 years old who did not use any drugs. The passive smoker group included 200 children who at least one member in their family was a smoker. The control group included 200 children who did not have a smoker in their family. Furthermore, two groups were matched in the point of view of skin color. The children in the two groups were examined and oral pigmentation was recorded. Finally, the results were analyzed by the chi- square test. Pigmentation was seen in 150 children (75%) in the experimental group and 122 children (61%) in the control group (P<0.005). The relative risk of oral pigmentation for children who were exposed to passive smoking was 1.23. Based on the results of this study, passive smoking can induce gingival pigmentation in children.

Hence, we studied the accuracy of Qp/Qs as estimated by intraoperative TEE. Twenty-six patients undergoing VSD closure were studied. After separation from the cardiopulmonary bypass, the presence and severity of residual leakage was evaluated by color Doppler image, and the Qp/Qs (TEE-derived Qp/Qs) was calculated by measuring the vessel diameter and the velocity-time integral of the flow profiles in the main pulmonary artery and left ventricular outflow tract. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed at pre-discharge and at 6-12 months after the correction to confirm the presence and severity of residual leakage. TEE detected only minor leakage, with no indication for re-repair, in 8 of the 26 patients. Nevertheless, TEE-derived Qp/Qs varied from 0.57 to 2.07 and were incorrect in 17 patients (65.4%). This meant that when TEE-derived Qp/Qs was outside the acceptable range, the patient was judged not to be in need of re-repair. TTE at pre-discharge confirmed trivial leakage in 3 patients in whom TEE had also identified similar leakages. These leakages were not observed at the follow-up TTE. TEE-derived Qp/Qs lacks the accuracy required to play a crucial role in quantitatively measuring the severity of residual shunt, while two-dimensional TEE can reliably detect residual leakage after VSD closure and lead to optimal judgment on the need for re-repair.

This is a double-blind 6-week functional magnetic resonance imaging trial with 24 unmedicated manic patients randomized to risperidone or divalproex, and 14 healthy controls (HCs) matched for IQ and demographic factors (mean age: 13.1±3.3years). A pediatric affective color matching task, in which subjects matched the color of a positive, negative or neutral word with one of two colored circles, was administered. The primary clinical measure was the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). The risperidone group, relative to HC, showed an increase in activation from pre- to post-treatment in right pregenual and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and decreased activation in bilateral middle frontal gyrus during the negative condition; and decreased activation in left inferior and medial, and right middle frontal gyri, left inferior parietal lobe, and right striatum with positive condition. In the divalproex group, relative to HC, there was an increased activation in right superior temporal gyrus in the negative condition; and in left medial frontal gyrus and right precuneus with the positive condition. Greater pre-treatment right amygdala activity with negative and positive condition in the risperidone group, and left amygdala activity with positive condition in divalproex group, predicted poor response on YMRS.

ASD is highly heritable and heterogeneous with a complex genetic etiology. Recurrent submicroscopic deletions or duplications have been identified in a subgroup of individuals with ASD using array technology. Adequate genetic testing for these genomic imbalances have not yet been widely implemented in the diagnostic setting due to lack of feasible and cost-effective methods as well as difficulties to interpret the clinical significance of these small copy number variants (CNVs). We developed a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay to investigate its usefulness for detection of copy number alterations (CNAs) in autistic patients. This test proved to be easy to perform, fast, cost-effective, and suitable for reliable detection of multiple loci in a single reaction. We screened 148 autistic patients for 15 different loci covering 26 genes and found a 15q11-13 interstitial duplication that had escaped detection by conventional karyotyping in 1.3% of the patients. Synthetic probe MLPA allows for a flexible analysis of a continuously increasing number of CNAs associated with autism.

This was a retrospective, clinical study of patients who had strip crowns (SC) placed on maxillary primary incisors, returned for at least 1, 6-month recall examination, and whose parents consented to participate in the study. Radiographic and photographic examinations were used for evaluation. Two evaluators rated the images independently. When ratings were not in agreement, the 2 examiners reviewed the photograph or radiograph together and reached a consensus rating. One hundred twelve restorations placed in 40 children were evaluated. The evaluations were performed after the crowns had been in place for an average of 18 months. None of the restorations were totally lost, and only 12% were rated as having lost some resin material, resulting in an 88% overall retention rate. There was no difference in restoration success if the crowns were placed 4 at a time, or if fewer crowns were placed in a single sitting; the failure rates were comparable. Teeth that had pulpal treatment were judged to have far more significant color match discrepancies than those teeth without pulpal treatment. Ninety-one percent of the teeth demonstrated healthy pulps. Eight percent had some pulpal changes but did not require immediate attention. Only 1 tooth showed radiographic evidence of pulpal necrosis. Only 11 teeth had pulpal treatment, but of these, 10 demonstrated clinical success. Composite resin strip crowns for restoring primary incisors with large or multisurface caries performed well. Color match of these crowns with adjacent teeth may be significantly reduced when placed upon teeth that have undergone pulpectomy treatment and have been obturated with an iodoform paste.

Concurrent tasks (motor and cognitive) significantly decreased gait velocity and cadence and increased stride time; the differences were more obvious during the concurrent cognitive task. A moderate correlation was found between gait parameters (gait velocity and stride length) and CCTT-2 and PBS scores in children with TBI. Gait performance may be affected by task complexity following TBI. Attention and balance deficits caused deterioration in gait performance under the concurrent task condition in children with TBI. This study illustrates the crucial role of task demand and complexity in dual-task interference.

Monosomy 21 is a rare cytogenetic aberration for which clinical features were incompletely defined since full monosomy 21 is incompatible with life. A 5-year-old male patient with FXS and low-grade mosaicism for full monosomy 21 (46,XY[96%]/45,XY,-21[4%]) is presented. He had lack of speech and severely impaired social skills, hyperactivity, stereotypical hand movements, a special interest towards moving colourful items and a short attention span for other objects around. He had macrocephaly, a rather long face, prominent occiput and prominent midface, retrognathia, down-slanting palpebral fissures, hypertelorism and cup-shaped, posteriorly rotated and low-set ears. Full monosomy in the aberrant cell line was proven by whole chromosome painting. FXS was previously reported to accompany sex chromosome aneuploidies; however, to the best of our knowledge, the present patient is the first FXS patient with an aberration involving autosomes. He contributes to the current knowledge on monosomy 21 phenotype, having dysmorphic facial findings despite the concurrent phenotypic expression of the FXS.

For each patient, we evaluated the severity of urgency, by studying the admission triage-coloured codes, the clinical data at admission and the discharge diagnosis. Neonates who had access to PEU were 812 in the OC1, 3720 in the OC2, and 748 in the OC3 respectively; 69 (8.4%), 138 (3.7%), and 55 (7.4%) was the proportion of neonatal accesses for neurological conditions. We observed that in the study period, the three hospitals had an important decrease of pediatric accesses to their PEU, but the proportion of neonates who had access to the OC1 for neurologic diseases, with respect to the total neonatal accesses, remained stable. We found that the most frequent neurologic disease for which newborns had access to PEU was Cyanosis, (46.1% of all neonatal accesses). Apnea was the second most frequent cause, with a number of 76 accesses (29%).

Here, we sought to further characterize the performance of PBFC for pediatric leukemia and highlight the exceptions when PBFC can result in misdiagnosis. An institutional database was searched between 2012 and 2016 for cases of acute leukemia with concurrent PBFC and BM evaluation. Immunophenotyping results from the peripheral blood and BM using four or eight color flow cytometry, as well as BM cytochemical staining and immunohistochemistry, were compared. Two hundred ninety PBFC samples with concurrent BM evaluation were identified. Based on the final immunophenotypic classification, the cases were distributed as follows: 108 B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), 57 T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), 116 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 9 mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL). Among all cases, five had a diagnostically significant discrepancy between PBFC and BM evaluation. In three cases, the immunophenotype by PBFC was consistent with early T-cell precursor ALL (ETP-ALL), whereas BM evaluation demonstrated MPAL. Two cases were suspicious for acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) and MPAL, T/myeloid by PBFC but were diagnosed as B-ALL and T-ALL in the BM. Immunophenotypic classification by PBFC is accurate (>98%) in almost all cases of pediatric leukemia with the rare exceptions of suspected ETP-ALL, MPAL, and AMKL.

Because patients often require pacemakers or intracardiac electrophysiology studies (EPS)/ablation for arrhythmias, narrowed or obstructed baffles restrict cardiac access hindering intracardiac procedures. Current guidelines recommend clinical as well as comprehensive transthoracic echocardiographic/Doppler (TTE) studies to identify baffle problems. This study reviews the effectiveness of these guidelines in detection of baffle issues pre-EPS catheterization and need for ancillary vascular interventions. Data from all patients with repaired d-TGA referred for hemodynamic catheterization or EPS between 1995 and 2009 at our institution were reviewed, including symptoms and TTE findings. Obstruction was defined as either a disturbed color Doppler flow or mean velocity >1 m/s above the mitral valve or directly measured pressure gradient >4 mm Hg or more than 50% baffle diameter narrowing by venography. Of 59 patients (34 pacemaker, 9 ablation, 16 routine hemodynamic) ages 8-39 years (mean 22.8), only three (5%) had symptoms of obstruction.

The locations of the anterior and posterior mitral annuli were determined to be the hing point of the anterior leaflet on the left ventricular side and the junction of the posterior leaflet on the ventricular side, respectively. Mitral regurgitation (MR) was evaluated by CDE in the parasternal long-axis view. The ratio of the duration of regurgitation to ejection time (DT/ET) was measured by M-mode CDE in the subjects with and without MVP. The values of ""c"" ranged from +10 mm to -3 mm, and those of ""d"" from +5 mm to -4 mm (minus denotes prolapse into the left atrium). Approximately normal distributions were demonstrated with the parameters ""c"" and ""d"". The value of ""e"" could not be measured because of a poor image of the posterior leaflet. The incidence of MVP varied from 2.5 to 13.5% depending on the criterion for applied MVP. Fifty-nine of the 487 healthy subjects turned out to have MR (12%).

The DT/ET ratio of the MR subjects with MVP tended to be higher than that of the boys without MVP.

The fillings were analysed after 1 month, 6, 12 and 18 months, by the criteria for evaluation of the dental clinical materials given by Ryge. Restorations mostly gave excellent results, especially those placed on permanent immature teeth. Actually, Dyract AP and Unifil Flow were marked (A) after 18 months in 93.3% of the cases. Fuji IX restorations had the lowest retention rate, especially on deciduous teeth, due mostly to bad oral hygiene habits. Dissatisfaction with the tested criteria was, above all, because of the bad marginal adaptation and the colour dismatch of the restorations. Conditioning prior to the application of the restoratives was beneficial. Fluoride-releasing materials are a revolution in the treatment of tooth decay, especially in children.

Thirty-six patients with an initial episode of acute rheumatic fever and Sydenham's chorea (3 patients with subclinical mitral regurgitation) were followed up prospectively for 5 years. Clinical examinations and transthoracic color Doppler echocardiography were done for each patient at initial attacks of Sydenham's chorea and at recurrences of rheumatic fever. Six recurrences of rheumatic fever occurred in 6 of the 36 patients. One recurrence developed in the regular secondary prophylaxis group (27 patients) with a recurrence rate of 0.007 per patient-year. Three of the 18 patients who initially had no heart murmur and no echocardiographic finding of valvular regurgitation had three recurrences of pure chorea with no echocardiographic evidence of significant valvular regurgitation. Interestingly, one of the 3 patients with previous pure chorea and echocardiographic finding of significant mitral regurgitation had a recurrence of pure chorea and new echocardiographic evidence of mitral, aortic and tricuspid regurgitations. Furthermore, two recurrences occurring in 2 of the 15 patients with previous carditis developed echocardiographic evidence of new carditis. Rheumatic recurrence can develop new valve damage evident by echocardiography for the patient with pure Sydenham's chorea who had previous subclinical valvulitis.

Echocardiography is the primary tool used to diagnose and monitor PDA. We trained a deep learning model to identify PDA presence in relevant echocardiographic images. Echocardiography video clips (n = 2527) in preterm infants were reviewed by a pediatric cardiologist and those relevant to PDA diagnosis were selected and labeled (PDA present/absent/indeterminate). We trained a convolutional neural network to classify each echocardiography frame of a clip as belonging to clips with or without PDA. A novel attention mechanism that aggregated predictions for all frames in each clip to obtain a clip-level prediction by weighting relevant frames. In early model iterations, we discovered training with color Doppler echocardiography clips produced the best performing classifier. For model training and validation, 1145 such clips from 66 patients (661 PDA+ clips, 484 PDA- clips) were used. Our best classifier for clip level performance obtained sensitivity of 0.80 (0.83-0.90), specificity of 0.77 (0.62-0.92) and AUC of 0.86 (0.83-0.90).

The molecular genetic findings of childhood-onset STGD patients were compared with those of adult-onset patients. Clinical, imaging, electrophysiologic, and molecular genetic findings. The median ages of onset and the median age at baseline examination were 8.5 (range, 3-16) and 12.0 years (range, 7-16), respectively.

Flecks were not identified at baseline in 12 patients (31%). SD-OCT detected foveal outer retinal disruption in all 21 patients with available images. Electrophysiologic assessment demonstrated retinal dysfunction confined to the macula in 9 patients (36%), macular and generalized cone dysfunction in 1 subject (4%), and macular and generalized cone and rod dysfunction in 15 individuals (60%).

Patients with childhood-onset STGD more frequently harbored 2 deleterious variants (18% vs 5%) compared with patients with adult-onset STGD. Childhood-onset STGD is associated with severe visual loss, early morphologic changes, and often generalized retinal dysfunction, despite often having less severe fundus abnormalities on examination. One third of children do not have flecks at presentation.

We hypothesize that there is a low rate of malignant nail pathology among pediatric patients undergoing nail bed biopsy for melanonychia. We performed a retrospective chart review of 54 pediatric patients (age <18 years) at a single institution who presented with melanonychia and underwent nail bed biopsy from 2007 to 2022. Data points collected included patient demographics, medical history, physical exam findings, pathology reports, and clinical photos. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess for risk factors associated with high-risk pathology findings. The average age of melanonychia onset was 5.5 years (SD 4.4). The average age of first biopsy was 7.8 years (SD 4.3). On physical exam, 27 patients had at least four features concerning for melanoma (asymmetry, border irregularity, color heterogeneity, diameter > 1/3 of nail, evolving color, evolving diameter, Hutchinson's sign). The most common pathology diagnoses were melanocytic nevus (35%), atypical intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation (AIMP) with benign features (24%), subungual lentigo (22%), and AIMP with concerning features (17%). There were no cases of melanoma in situ or invasive malignant melanoma. On multivariate regression, the only significant risk factor associated with more concerning pathology (AIMP with concerning features) was the calendar year in which biopsy was performed (coefficient = -0.34, P = 0.016). There was no association between physical exam features and high-risk pathology. Twelve patients had surgical re-excision of the lesion, 6 of which were due to incomplete excision of AIMP with concerning features and 6 of which were due to recurrence. Our case series did not find any cases of melanoma in situ or malignant melanoma arising from pediatric melanonychia. Atypical intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation with concerning features was associated only with the year in which the biopsy was performed, which may reflect the improved understanding of pediatric melanonychia as often benign despite concerning features on pathology. The decision to perform a nail matrix biopsy in pediatric melanonychia should be based on a collaborative discussion between the patient's parents, dermatologist, and plastic surgeon.

Although there have been several reviews published on COVID-19 and health disparities across various populations, none has focused on sexual health. We plan to conduct a scoping review that seeks to fill several of the gaps in the current knowledge of sexual health in the COVID-19 era. A scoping review focusing on sexual health and COVID-19 will be conducted.

Grey literature will be identified using Disaster Lit, Google Scholar, governmental websites, and clinical trials registries (e.g., ClinicalTrial.gov , World Health Organization, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Registry). Study selection will conform to the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewers' Manual 2015 Methodology for JBI Scoping Reviews. Only English language, original studies will be considered for inclusion. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and abstract data. A narrative summary of findings will be conducted. Data analysis will involve quantitative (e.g., frequencies) and qualitative (e.g., content and thematic analysis) methods.

524,524,20422171,"Congenital heart defects with a component of pulmonary stenosis are often palliated in childhood by disrupting the pulmonary valve. Patients often undergo subsequent pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) to protect the heart from the consequences of pulmonary regurgitation. In the presence of associated moderate functional tricuspid valve (TV) regurgitation, it is unclear what factors contribute to persistent TV regurgitation following PVR. In particular, it is unknown whether PVR alone will reduce the right ventricular (RV) size and restore TV function or whether concomitant TV annuloplasty is required as well. Thirty-five patients were analyzed. Each patient underwent initial palliation of congenital pulmonary stenosis or tetralogy of Fallot, underwent subsequent PVR between 2002 and 2008, and had at least moderate TV regurgitation at the time of valve replacement. Serial echocardiograms were analyzed. Pulmonary and TV regurgitation, along with RV dilation and dysfunction, were scored (0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe). RV volume and area were also calculated. Potential risk factors for persistent postoperative TV regurgitation were evaluated. One month following PVR, there was a significant reduction in pulmonary valve regurgitation (mean, 3 vs. 0.39; P < 0.0001) and TV regurgitation (mean, 2.33 vs. 1.3; P < 0.0001). There were also significant reductions in RV dilation, volume, and area. There were no significant further improvements in any of the parameters at 1 and 3 years. There was no difference in the degree of TV regurgitation postoperatively between those patients who underwent PVR alone and those who underwent concomitant tricuspid annuloplasty (mean, 1.29 vs. 1.31; P = 0.81). We conclude that following PVR, improvement in TV regurgitation and RV size occurs primarily in the first postoperative month. TV function improved to a similar degree with or without annuloplasty.

However, avoidance has almost exclusively been investigated with explicit measures targeting more strategic aspects of behavior. The aim of the present study was to examine automatic avoidance in older individuals displaced as children at the end of World War II with (n=22) and without PTSD (n=26) and in non-traumatized control participants (n=23) with an Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT). Participants were instructed to respond to the color (gray, brown) of trauma-related, neutral, and control pictures by pushing or pulling a joystick. Groups did not differ significantly as to their behavioral tendencies towards trauma-related pictures. Thus, there was no evidence for automatic avoidance in individuals with PTSD. However, high vigilance was associated with stronger implicit avoidance towards trauma-related pictures in the PTSD group.

A metropolitan university hospital. Consecutive case series. One hundred seventy-five hospital patients, aged 1 month to 87 years, who had undergone pericardiocentesis (n = 165) or control subjects who had undergone open heart surgery (n = 10) between 1984 and 1996. The appearance of pericardial fluid and results of chemistry tests, cell counts, cytologic studies, Gram's stain, and microbial cultures were obtained by chart review. The etiology of each pericardial fluid sample was determined using prospective diagnostic criteria. Exudates differed from transudates by higher leukocyte counts and ratios of fluid to serum lactate dehydrogenase levels. Fluid glucose levels were significantly less in exudates. Sensitivity for detecting exudates was high for specific gravity > 1.015 (90%), fluid total protein > 3.0 g/dL (97%), fluid to serum protein ratio > 0.5 (96%), fluid lactate dehydrogenase ratio > 0.6 (94%), and fluid to serum glucose ratio < 1.0 (85%). None of these indicators were specific. Fluid total protein and specific gravity were moderately correlated (r = 0.56). Fluid cytologic study had a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 100% for malignant effusion. No other test was diagnostic for a specific etiology. Among infection-associated effusions, culture-positive fluid had more neutrophils, higher lactate dehydrogenase levels, and lower ratios of fluid to serum glucose than culture-negative (parainfective) fluid. Evaluation of pericardial fluid might be limited to cell count, glucose, protein, and lactate dehydrogenase determinations plus bacterial culture and cytology.

The film contains NAD, nitro blue tetrazolium, 3-OHB dehydrogenase, and diaphorase, and the surface is coated with modified biomembrane and can detect 50-1500 microM 3-OHB within 2-3 min. One drop or 50 microliters of plasma/serum or blood is applied to the film, and the violet color is read via reflectance meter after 2 min. Plasma/serum samples greater than 1500 microM 3-OHB can be measured by dilution with saline. In blood with 40% hematocrit, the color developed is 50% less than with plasma/serum, and this was adjusted in the reflectance meter. A good correlation (r = 0.99) was observed between results with automated and film methods and between visual methods and reflectance meter. In insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, all 3 subjects with positive ketonuria (+ +), 8 of 12 subjects with mild ketonuria (+), and 7 of 25 subjects without ketonuria exhibited elevation of 3-OHB in blood greater than 200 microM.

532,532,34582433,"Brazil has made great progress in reducing child mortality over the past decades, and a parcel of this achievement has been credited to the Bolsa Família program (BFP). We examined the association between being a BFP beneficiary and child mortality (1-4 years of age), also examining how this association differs by maternal race/skin color, gestational age at birth (term versus preterm), municipality income level, and index of quality of BFP management. This is a cross-sectional analysis nested within the 100 Million Brazilian Cohort, a population-based cohort primarily built from Brazil's Unified Registry for Social Programs (Cadastro Único). We analyzed data from 6,309,366 children under 5 years of age whose families enrolled between 2006 and 2015. Through deterministic linkage with the BFP payroll datasets, and similarity linkage with the Brazilian Mortality Information System, 4,858,253 children were identified as beneficiaries (77%) and 1,451,113 (23%) were not. Our analysis consisted of a combination of kernel matching and weighted logistic regressions. After kernel matching, 5,308,989 (84.1%) children were included in the final weighted logistic analysis, with 4,107,920 (77.4%) of those being beneficiaries and 1,201,069 (22.6%) not, with a total of 14,897 linked deaths. Overall, BFP participation was associated with a reduction in child mortality (weighted odds ratio [OR] = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.79 to 0.88; p < 0.001). This association was stronger for preterm children (weighted OR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.68 to 0.90; p < 0.001), children of Black mothers (weighted OR = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.97; p < 0.001), children living in municipalities in the lowest income quintile (first quintile of municipal income: weighted OR = 0.72; 95% CI: 0.62 to 0.82; p < 0.001), and municipalities with better index of BFP management (5th quintile of the Decentralized Management Index: weighted OR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.66 to 0.88; p < 0.001). The main limitation of our methodology is that our propensity score approach does not account for possible unmeasured confounders. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis showed that loss of nameless death records before linkage may have resulted in overestimation of the associations between BFP participation and mortality, with loss of statistical significance in municipalities with greater losses of data and change in the direction of the association in municipalities with no losses. In this study, we observed a significant association between BFP participation and child mortality in children aged 1-4 years and found that this association was stronger for children living in municipalities in the lowest quintile of wealth, in municipalities with better index of program management, and also in preterm children and children of Black mothers. These findings reinforce the evidence that programs like BFP, already proven effective in poverty reduction, have a great potential to improve child health and survival. Subgroup analysis revealed heterogeneous results, useful for policy improvement and better targeting of BFP.

Although typically a highly heterogeneous autosomal recessive disease, homozygosity for single mutation in BBS 10 has been identified in a significant number of affected individuals tested in South Africa (SA). Objectives. To delineate the ethnic distribution and clinical phenotype in a cohort of SA BBS patients with the K243IfsX15 mutation in BBS 10 and discuss the implications for genetic testing of and counselling for this disorder in SA. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study collating clinical and laboratory data retrospectively in a genetically homogenous subgroup of BBS patients from SA. A total of 76 patients from 74 families were tested. Homozygosity for the K243IfsX15 BBS 10 mutation was found in 50 families (67%) and heterozygosity for the same mutation in an additional two affected individuals. With the exception of one patient of mixed ancestry, all were black South Africans from different language groups. This is in keeping with the observation that BBS is more common in this ethnic group compared with white and coloured patients in SA, first made by Prof. Beighton nearly 3 decades ago. A subset of 15 patients available for detailed phenotyping confirmed consistency with well-described features of the disorder, with some overlap with other ciliopathies. The onset of visual impairment was early in our cohort, before the age of 8 years, cognitive impairment was significant, and renal and cardiac abnormalities were infrequently encountered. Conclusion. The high frequency of homozygosity for a single mutation in an ethnic subset of the SA population is strongly suggestive of a founder effect. This has allowed establishment of a diagnostic test with a high yield in our local population. Better understanding of the phenotype will improve earlier recognition of the disorder to allow for appropriate intervention.

All participants underwent an extensive ophthalmological examination, including functional tests as well as optical coherence tomography, to measure individual retinal layer thicknesses. Multivariable mixed linear regression models were used to assess possible associations between HIV status (and other HIV-related parameters) and ocular parameters, while accounting for the inclusion of both eyes and several known confounders. Thirty-three HIV-infected children (median age 13.7 years [interquartile range (IQR), 12.2-15.8], median CD4+ T-cell count 760 cells/mm3, 82% with an undetectable HIV viral load [VL]), and 36 controls (median age 12.1 years [IQR, 11.5-15.8]) were included. Contrast sensitivity (CS) was significantly lower in the HIV-infected group (1.74 vs. 1.76 logCS; P = 0.006). The patients had a significantly thinner foveal thickness (-11.2 μm, P = 0.012), which was associated with a higher peak HIV VL (-10.3 μm per log copy/mL, P = 0.016). In this study, we found a decrease in foveal thickness in HIV-infected children, which was associated with a higher peak VL. Longitudinal studies are warranted to confirm our findings and to determine the course and clinical consequences of these foveal changes.

539,539,9646048,"Children are highly susceptible to deleterious effects of environmental toxins. Those who live in underserved communities may be particularly at risk because environmental pollution has been found to be disproportionately distributed among communities. Mounting evidence suggests that asthma rates are rising and that this disease can be caused or aggravated by air pollution. Although ambient air quality has generally improved, these improvements have not reached minority communities in equal proportions. This and other data has fueled the concept of environmental justice or environmental equity, which has led to community activism and government actions. One possible example of environmental inequity and its consequences is the Hunt's Point community, in the South Bronx, New York. This community experiences a high pollution burden with the siting of facilities that emit hazardous wastes into the air. Our approach to this problem has been the formation of mechanisms for bidirectional communication between community residents, government entities, and academic institutions such as Mount Sinai Medical Center. As a result of this experience, we believe that the key to achieving environmental health, especially in communities of color where many children are at risk, is to empower residents to take charge of their environment by providing relevant educational opportunities. Strategies for environmental health education include multitiered training approaches that include community residents, parent education, direct children education, and community education through professional counselors and train-the-trainer approaches. We propose that academic researchers must use community residents not just as subjects of our studies, but to increase our mutual understanding of environmental health, resulting in active participation of community members in research design, data collection, analysis, and dissemination of results in order to make intervention strategies more effective.

540,540,17910584,"This study compared MRI cerebral volumes and Neuronal-Nuclei (NeuN) cell densities in pediatric epilepsy surgery patients with cortical dysplasia (CD; n = 25) and hemimegalencephaly (HME; n = 14). Our purpose was to deduce possible mechanisms of pathogenesis and epileptogenesis based on an understanding of normal developmental corticoneurogenesis. We used MRI to measured cerebral hemisphere volumes, and NeuN staining to determine grey and white matter cell densities and cell sizes in the molecular layer, grey, and white matter. CD and HME surgical cases were compared with autopsy or non-CD cases (n = 20). Total MRI brain volumes were similar between non-CD, CD, and HME cases. However, in HME patients, the affected cerebral hemisphere was larger and the nonaffected side smaller than non-CD cases. Compared with autopsy cases, NeuN cell densities and cell sizes in CD and HME patients were increased in the molecular layer, upper grey matter, and white matter. In CD and HME cases, total cerebral hemisphere volumes were normal in size and there were more cortical neurons in upper layers than expected. The increase in cortical neuronal densities is consistent with the hypothesis that CD and HME pathogenesis involves increased neurogenesis in the late (not early) phases of cortical formation. In addition, more neurons in the molecular layer and white matter supports the concept that CD and HME pathogenesis also involves incomplete programmed cell death in the remnant cells occupying the preplate and subplate regions. Based on our anatomical and previous electrophysiological findings, we propose that in CD and HME seizure generation is the consequence of incomplete cerebral development with abnormal interactions between immature and mature cells and cellular networks.

We performed a categorical analysis to estimate the effects of the 3 disorders on EF and a dimensional analysis to estimate the effects of symptom scales on EF. We found that the AD/HD and PDD＋ subjects had negative effects on verbal working memory and intra-individual response variability. The severity of these impairments was positively correlated with the inattentiveness score. The subjects with a PDD＋ or PDD－ diagnosis had poorer scores on interference control;the severity of this impairment was correlated with the PDD symptom score. Impairments in visuospatial working memory were detected in the AD/HD and PDD－ groups but not in the PDD＋ group. Impairments in inhibition of the pre-potent response were noted in all 3 categories.

555,555,37285338,"Poor birth outcomes are more prevalent for Black communities, but strong evidence shows that doula care can improve those outcomes. More evidence is needed to understand racial differences, discrimination, and equity in doula care. The current study's objective was to describe the experiences of Black doulas as well as the challenges and facilitators of providing doula care to communities of color in Georgia. From Fall 2020-Fall 2021, 20 surveys and in-depth interviews were conducted with doulas as part of a community-based participatory study co-led by Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition of Georgia and academic researchers. Doula participants were diverse in age (5% under 25, 40% 25-35, 35% 36-45, and 20% 46+) and race/ethnicity (45% white, 50% Black, 5% Latinx). Most (70%) Black doulas reported that more than 75% of their clientele is Black, while most (78%) white doulas reported that less than 25% of their clientele is Black. Doulas noted the alarming Black maternal mortality rate and how mistreatment causes Black clients to lose trust in medical staff, leaving them in need of advocates. Black doulas were passionate about serving and advocating with Black clients. Participants also described how language and cultural barriers, particularly for Asian and Latinx people, reduce clients' ability to self-advocate, increasing the need for doulas. Doulas also discussed the ways that race influences their connections with clients and their dissatisfaction with the lack of cultural humility or sensitivity training in standard doula training. Our findings indicate that Black doulas provide essential and supportive services to Black birthing people, and those services are more urgently needed than ever following the overturn of Roe v. Wade. Doula training must be improved to address the cultural needs of diverse clients. Increasing access to doula care for Asian and Latinx communities could also address language and cultural barriers that can negatively impact their maternal and child health outcomes.

These results were validated by dc-fluorescence in situ hybridization and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. dc-CISH on LBC samples is a reliable modality to detect gene rearrangements in sarcomas.

563,563,12851333,"Although homogeneous pigmentation usually is observed in wild animals, most domestic animal species display a wide variety of coat colors. In fur animals, the coat color is an important production trait, and in other species such as cattle and sheep, the coat color is a major breed characteristic. Variability in coat color is seen both within and between breeds, and makes domesticated species unique for studying gene function and gene regulation of loci affecting pigmentation. In several species, mutations in the MC1-R gene have been shown to cause the dominant expression of black pigment. In fox, alleles of both the agouti and the MC1-R gene could cause eumelanin synthesis. In addition, a nonepistatic interaction between MC1-R and agouti has been observed, resulting in several different coat color phenotypes expressing a mixture of red and black pigmentation. Also in cattle and sheep, amino acid substitutions within the MC1-R explain the dominant inheritance of black pigmentation. Unlike the constitutively activated MC1-R found in the Alaska silver fox, dominant variants of the MC1-R found in cattle and sheep seem to be completely dominant with no antagonizing effect of agouti. MC1-R variants with premature stop codons are widespread in several cattle populations, indicating that this well-conserved gene has no other fundamental function beside pigmentation. Other well-established breed characteristics include distinct coat color patterns in which the distribution of melanocytes, partly regulated by the c-kit gene, seems to be involved.

Eligible subjects arrived via ambulance and were less than 145 cm tall, the upper limit of height for Broselow measurements. Subjects were excluded if they had a medical condition preventing proper measurement (e.g., contractures).

Data came from the cross-sectional Survey of the Health of Urban Residents in the United States (N = 2796). Logistic regressions were used to identify factors associated with odds of always worrying about the possibility of becoming a victim of police brutality and to examine its association with depression among Latinas, Black, and White women. Odds of always worrying about police brutality were greater among Black women and Latinas compared to White women. Household history of incarceration was associated with anticipation of police brutality among Black women and Latinas but not among White women. Black women and Latinas with constant anticipation of police brutality and history of incarceration of a household member during their childhood had elevated odds of depressed mood.

Serum vitamin D concentrations were measured before treatment in 178 patients with active TB and 130 healthy contacts. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and its relation to skin colour, month of estimation and TB diagnosis were determined. 35 patients and 35 frequency-matched contacts completed dietary and sun exposure questionnaires to determine the relative contribution of these to serum vitamin D concentrations. There was a statistically significant difference in serum vitamin D concentrations between patients and contacts (20.1 vs 30.8 nmol/l, 95% CI 7.1 to 14.3; p<0.001) and significantly more patients had severely deficient concentrations (<21 nmol/l) than controls (114/178 (64%) vs 40/130 (31%), p<0.001).

There was no difference in sunlight exposure between the groups. Patients with active TB have lower serum vitamin D concentrations than contacts from similar ethnic and social backgrounds and with comparable dietary intake and sun exposure, and do not show the expected seasonal variation.

Age-adjusted mortality rates at national level decreased significantly over time (annual percent change [APC]: -4.7; 95% CI: -6.0 to -3.3), with a decrease in the Southeast, South and Central-West regions, and a non-significant increasing trend in the North and Northeast regions. We identified spatial and spatiotemporal high-risk mortality clusters located mainly in NCC-endemic areas. Conditions related to the nervous system were the most commonly associated causes of death when NCC was mentioned as an underlying cause, and HIV/AIDS was the main underlying cause when NCC was an associated cause. NCC is a neglected and preventable cause of severe neurologic disease and death with high public health impact in Brazil.

572,572,36727812,"Women of reproductive age are chronically underrepresented in breast cancer studies. Recent studies suggest that almost 40% of patients diagnosed with breast cancer who are of reproductive age want to have children after completing treatment. In this study, the authors evaluated patients of reproductive age who had undergone nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) and implant-based reconstruction. The authors compared those who became pregnant with those who did not with respect to clinical and radiologic changes that are reported at follow-up. Any patient 45 years of age or younger at the time of NSM was determined to be of reproductive age, selected for evaluation, and followed prospectively. The presence or absence of breast examination changes in the setting of pregnancy after NSM was recorded. A total of 36 patients became pregnant after NSM, and 158 patients did not become pregnant after NSM. Of those who became pregnant, nearly half reported some clinical change just before or immediately after delivery. These changes included color change and discharge at the residual nipple-areola complex and palpable nodularity elsewhere. For those with palpable changes, an ultrasound was performed and hypoechoic lesions with variable vascularity were identified. For those who went on to excision, lactational hyperplasia was the most common diagnosis. Ultrasound is an appropriate first-line investigation of breast changes, which can include hyperplasia of remaining ductal and glandular tissue. Patients who became pregnant after NSM commonly had clinical breast examination changes, but the majority of these changes were found to be benign on further evaluation. Risk, II.

573,573,9437062,"Compared with esophageal varices, gastrointestinal varices are relatively rare, but they are clinically important because they tend to bleed massively. Color Doppler sonography is now widely used to diagnose the collaterals, but few color Doppler findings of gastric or intestinal varices have been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the sonographic and color Doppler findings of gastrointestinal varices and to determine the role of color Doppler sonography in the diagnosis of these varices. We studied 30 patients who were diagnosed by endoscopy as having gastrointestinal varices (24 gastric, four duodenal, two intestinal) with color Doppler sonography and compared the results with the clinical data. The causes of gastric varices included liver cirrhosis (16/24, 66.7%), idiopathic portal hypertension (3/24, 12. 5%), chronic pancreatitis with splenic vein thrombosis (2/24, 8.3%), congenital biliary atresia (1/24, 4.2%), congenital hepatic fibrosis (1/24, 4.2%), and unknown (1/24, 4.2%). The causes of duodenal varices included idiopathic portal hypertension with portal thrombosis (3/4, 75%) and liver cirrhosis (1/4, 25%). The gastric wall at the fundus was thickened in 17 of 24 cases (70.8%) with gastric varices, and the duodenal wall was thickened in four of four cases (100%) with duodenal varices. Sonography revealed thrombosis in the splenic vein in two of two cases with gastric varices secondary to chronic pancreatitis and in the confluence of the superior mesenteric vein and the splenic vein in three of four cases with duodenal varices. Color Doppler sonography demonstrated multiple, slow constant blood flows in the thickened wall in 15 of 24 cases (62.5%) with gastric varices and in four of four cases (100%) with duodenal varices. It demonstrated accumulated slow constant blood flows in the cecum in the case with cecal varices. Color Doppler showed also the communication between the varices and the neighboring vascular system (superior mesenteric vein and inferior vena cava) in the case with cecal varices, but it did not directly reveal such a communication in the other 29 cases (96.7%). Color Doppler showed a hepatofugal flow in the left gastric vein in all the hemorrhagic gastric varicose patients with esophageal varices, but it showed a hepatopetal flow in the left gastric vein in the isolated nonhemorrhagic gastric varicose patients. Color Doppler sonography was very useful for the diagnosis of gastric and duodenal varices and for visualizing fine venous flows in the thickened gastric or duodenal wall. When it shows portal thrombosis in the confluence of the splenic vein and the superior mesenteric vein, duodenal varices should be suspected. The flow direction of the left gastric vein helps to differentiate hemorrhagic gastric varices from nonhemorrhagic ones.

Among the 90 patients, preoperative echocardiograms were available in 27. MVP was found in 21 of the 27 patients (78%) preoperatively, but it was found in 59% (16/27) postoperatively. In total, MVP was detected in 50 of the 90 patients (56%) postoperatively. The postoperative MVP group had higher pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratios (3.6 +/- 1.9 vs 2.8 +/- 1.1, p less than 0.05) and higher mean pulmonary arterial pressures (21 +/- 11 vs 13 +/- 5 mmHg, p less than 0.01) at the time of surgery. Between the two groups with or without MVP postoperatively, there was no difference (p less than 0.05) in age at surgery, the postoperative duration and left ventricular (LV) deformity index both in pre- and postoperative states. A mitral regurgitant (MR) murmur was recorded in seven patients postoperatively. However, only two had clinically severe MR. It was concluded that MVP is frequently detected in patients with closure of ASD and it is related neither to degree of the LV deformity nor to age at operation; rather, it is related to the severity of the preoperative hemodynamic state.

This Participatory Action Research was done in 23 villages of the Primary Health Centre, Anji, in Wardha District of Maharashtra. In February and March 2008, needs assessment was undertaken by interviewing the mothers of 261 children and 260 adolescent girls. Hemoglobin levels of adolescent girls and children were measured with the use of the hemoglobin color scale. The girls were given weekly iron-folic acid tablets, and the children were given daily liquid iron prophylaxis for 100 days in a year through community participation. The adolescent girls and the mothers of the children and adolescent girls were also given nutritional education on the benefits and side effects of iron supplementation. In June and July 2008, follow-up assessment was performed by survey and force field analysis. There was a significant reduction in the prevalence of nutritional anemia from 73.8% to 54.6% among the adolescent girls and from 78.2% to 64.2% among the children. There was improvement in awareness of iron-rich food items among the adolescent girls and the mothers of the children.

To assess the cumulative association of paired DNA and RNA testing with detection of disease-causing germline genetic variants and resolution of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Paired DNA and RNA sequencing was performed on individuals undergoing germline testing for hereditary cancer indication at a single diagnostic laboratory from March 2019 through April 2020. Demographic characteristics, clinical data, and test results were curated as samples were received, and changes to variant classification were assessed over time. Data analysis was performed from May 2020 to June 2023. Main outcomes were increase in diagnostic yield, decrease in VUS rate, the overall results by variant type, the association of RNA evidence with variant classification, and the corresponding predicted effect on cancer risk management.

Variant classification was impacted in 549 individuals (1.3%). Medically significant upgrades were made in 97 individuals, including 70 individuals who had a variant reclassified from VUS to pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) and 27 individuals who had a novel deep intronic P/LP variant that would not have been detected using DNA sequencing alone.

To determine whether the color preference of migraine-type photophobia is phase- or condition-dependent, we compared the effects of each color of light in each intensity between migraineurs during and in-between attacks and healthy controls. During the ictal and interictal phases, the proportion of migraineurs reporting changes in headache severity when exposed to the different colors of light increased in accordance with elevated light intensities. During the ictal phase, white, blue, amber, and red lights exacerbated headaches in ∼80% of the patients; however, during the interictal phase, light initiated headache in only 16% to 19%. Notably, green light exacerbated headaches in 40% and triggered headaches in 3% of the patients studied during the ictal and interictal phases, respectively. With one exception (highest red light intensity), no control subject reported headache in response to the light stimuli.

According to the Fitzpatrick skin scale, we found that the darker the skin color, the higher the probability of AN and KP (OR, 0.298; 95% CI, 0.106-0.834, p = 0.021; OR, 0.306; 95% CI, 0.117-0.796, p = 0.015, respectively). Some dermatoses associated with obesity and insulin resistance were not found in obese children, or there was no significant association. These results indicate that many skin morbidities may be prevented by preventing and treating obesity and insulin resistance in the early period.

Between March 1983 and June 1989, 15 patients (7 male, 8 female) aged 2.5 months to 9.2 years (mean, 3.7 years) had resection of coarctation of the aorta and end-to-end anastomosis with polydioxanone absorbable suture. Thirteen patients have returned for routine postoperative evaluation, the follow-up time ranging from 11 to 49 months (mean, 23 months). Noninvasive two-dimensional, pulsed-wave Doppler and color echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging studies demonstrated good anatomical repair and no anastomotic aneurysm formation or residual coarctation of the aorta in any patient after end-to-end anastomosis with polydioxanone.

We aimed to identify mechanisms underlying the racial/ethnic disparities in IPV among SGM, focusing on childhood experiences of violence, structural inequalities, and sexual minority stress. 308 SGM assigned female-at-birth (AFAB; 82 White, 133 Black, 93 Latinx; age 16-31) self-reported on minor psychological, severe psychological, physical, and sexual IPV victimization and perpetration, and three proposed mechanisms: childhood violence (child abuse, witnessing interparental violence), structural inequalities (economic stress, racial discrimination), and sexual minority stressors (internalized heterosexism, anti-SGM victimization, low social support). Indirect effects of race on IPV victimization via hypothesized mechanisms were estimated using logistic regression with 5,000 bootstrapped samples. Compared to White participants, Black participants were 2.5-7.03 times more likely to report all eight IPV types; Latinx participants were 2.5-4.8 times more likely to experience four IPV types. Univariate indirect effects analyses indicated that these racial/ethnic disparities were partially explained by higher economic stress, racial/ethnic discrimination, and childhood violence experiences (for Black and Latinx participants) and lower social support (Black participants). In multivariate models, the most robust indirect effects were through racial/ethnic discrimination and childhood violence. Findings underscore the need for policy and interventions aimed at preventing IPV among SGM-POC by targeting factors that contribute to IPV disparities in this group, particularly racial/ethnic discrimination and family violence.

Cytologically, granulomatous dermatitis shows granulomas and multinucleated giant cells. Various etiologic agents of granulomatous diseases can also be identified. We aimed to investigate Tzanck smear findings in granulomatous skin diseases. Patients who had granulomas and/or multinucleated giant cells of Langhans, foreign body- and/or Touton type in Tzanck smear tests were included in the study. In these patients, Tzanck preparations were then further evaluated for additional cytologic findings. Samples stained with May-Grünwald-Giemsa stain were evaluated by the same dermatologist throughout the study. In some patients, methylene blue, Gram and/or Erlich-Ziehl-Nielsen stains were also performed. In all of the study cases, the final diagnosis was established after the evaluation of clinical and laboratory findings (including, when appropriate, potassium hydroxide examination; bacterial, leishmanial, and fungal cultures; histopathology; tuberculosis and leishmania polymerase chain reaction). We also calculated the sensitivity and specificity of the Leishman-Donovan body for cutaneous leishmaniasis. Over a 2-year period, 94 of 950 patients (9.9%) in whom Tzanck smear tests were performed had cytologic findings consistent with a granulomatous reaction. In 74 (78.7%) and 20 (21.3%) patients, the granulomatous reaction was due to infectious and noninfectious causes, respectively. Infectious causes included cutaneous leishmaniasis in 65 patients (87.8%), candidal granuloma in two patients, botyromycosis in two patients, and aspergillosis, blastomycosis, mucormycosis, leprosy, and cutaneous tuberculosis in one patient each. In 58 of 74 patients (78.4%) with infectious granulomatous dermatitis, the causes of the granulomas were identified. Noninfectious granulomatous reactions were due to granuloma annulare in 7 patients, sarcoidosis in 5 patients, a foreign body in 4 patients, necrobiosis lipoidica in 2 patients, and juvenile xanthogranuloma in 2 patients. In 17 of 20 patients (85%) with noninfectious granulomatous reactions, the cytologic findings were characteristic of the final diagnoses. The sensitivity and specificity of Leishman-Donovan bodies for cutaneous leishmaniasis were 76.9% and 100%, respectively. All of the samples were evaluated by the same dermatologist throughout the study; therefore no comment could be made regarding the reliability of the Tzanck smear test. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of Tzanck smear test findings for diseases other than cutaneous leishmaniasis could not be calculated because of an insufficient number of patients.

The results showed that the positive rate of CD19 (115/116, 99.1%) in 116 cases with B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B lineage ALL) was significantly higher than that of CD20 (33/116, 28.4%) (P < 0.01); in 17 patients with B lineage/Myeloid (B/My) acute mixed lineage leukemia (AMLL), the former positive rate (17/17, 100%) was also higher than the latter (5/17, 29.4%) (P < 0.01). Both of the two antigens were negative in 29 patients with acute T lymphoblastic leukemia and 7 patients with T/My AMLL. The positive rates of CD19 and CD20 in 152 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were 7.2% and 2.0%, respectively. The difference of the fluorescence intensity between the two antigens on the cells from each patient with B lineage ALL or B/My AMLL was statistically significant (t = 20.68, P < 0.001).

This report presents a rare GI-related pediatric case, demonstrating a favorable response to blood purification therapy. A 10-year-old girl was admitted with recurrent fever, abdominal pain, and neurological symptoms, culminating in a transient cardiac arrest. Blood tests revealed multi-organ injury and a high risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation, while peripheral blood smear detected GI within neutrophil cytoplasm. The patient was diagnosed with acute necrotizing encephalopathy, severe sepsis, and multiple organ failure. After receiving multiple sessions of blood purification therapy, peripheral blood GI levels markedly decreased, accompanied by improvements in various laboratory parameters and signs of neurological recovery. Unfortunately, due to financial constraints, the family opted to transfer the patient back to their local hospital, where she succumbed shortly after discharge. This case underscores the complexities in managing GI-related pediatric cases. Moreover, it emphasizes the potential benefits of blood purification therapy in such scenarios. Notably, this study highlights a potential correlation between the level of GI in peripheral blood and disease severity, particularly in pediatric cases. While these findings hold clinical significance for the treatment and management of GI-related patients, further research focusing on middle-aged and elderly individuals is imperative to elucidate the fundamental relationship between peripheral blood GI quantity and clinical presentation and to evaluate the efficacy of blood purification in GI-related cases.

595,595,24587582,"Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with neurocognitive deficits. However, the neural substrates underlying such deficits remain unknown. To examine executive control and emotional processing in OSA, 10 children age 7 to 11 y with polysomnographically diagnosed OSA and 7 age- and sex-matched controls underwent a color-word Stroop task and an empathy task consisting of dynamic visual scenarios depicting interpersonal harm or neutral actions in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. Functional MRI data were processed using MATLAB 7.12 with SPM8 for region of interest (ROI) analyses, and a general linear model was used with regressors for each trial type in each task. For the Stroop task, accuracy was similar in the two groups, with no differences in the effect of incongruency on success rates. OSA showed greater neural activity than controls in eight ROI clusters for incongruent versus congruent trials (P < 0.001). Within the a priori ROIs, the anterior cingulate cortex was significantly different between groups (P < 0.05). For perceiving harm versus neutral actions, ROI analysis revealed a significant correlation between apnea-hypopnea index and left amygdala activity in harm versus neutral actions (r = -0.71, P < 0.05). These results provide the first functional MRI evidence that cognitive and empathetic processing is influenced by obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children. Children with OSA show greater neural recruitment of regions implicated in cognitive control, conflict monitoring, and attentional allocation in order to perform at the same level as children without OSA.

600,600,12689752,"Age-related changes in tooth color have been described previously, however, the use of dental color for age estimation in forensic odontology has been limited due to the difficulty of measuring color objectively. This study presents an objective method for determining dental color to estimate the age of an individual. Dentine color in 250 teeth from patients ranging in age from 10 to 89 years was determined by spectroradiometry. Color measurements were performed as suggested in the CIE 1931 (International Commission on Illumination). Chromaticity coordinates (x, y, z), luminance (Y), whiteness index (WIC, Z%, WIC) and yellowness index (YI) were obtained. Correlations between these colorimetric variables and aging were established by linear regression analyses. All the variables fit the mathematical model with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.53 to 0.75. This method of color measurement produced an expected associated error of calibration averaging 13.7 years about the mean estimated values, at a 70% level of confidence. Two different multiple regression models for dental age estimation were tested, and variables that made the greatest contributions to age calculation were identified. To determine the effect of postmortem interval on tooth color and its influence in age estimation, 37 teeth obtained from human skeletal remains buried during an interval ranging from 21 to 37 years were also studied.

602,602,30174435,"To attain effective and safe pharmacotherapy, formulations in (pre)term neonates should enable extensive dose flexibility. During product development and subsequent authorization and clinical use of such formulations, there is also a need for informed decisions on excipient exposure: in addition to the need to improve the knowledge on active compounds, there is a similar need to improve the knowledge on excipients in neonates. Excipients are added to formulations as co-solvent, surfactant, preservative, colorant and/or sweetener as vehicle(s) to result in a suitable (e.g. taste, shelf life, stability) product. Progress has been made in the awareness, knowledge and access to this knowledge on the clinical pharmacology of excipients in neonates. This is thanks to different initiatives focussing on epidemiological data, excipient pharmacokinetics, or building datasets to create this knowledge. We highlight the Safe Excipient Exposure in Neonates and Small Children (SEEN) and propylene glycol project to illustrate the feasibility to build knowledge, and discuss the methods applied and problems observed during these studies. The information generated in these and other studies (European Study on Neonatal Exposure to Excipients, ESNEE) should be integrated in repositories like the Safety and Toxicity of Excipients for Paediatrics (STEP) to facilitate access to all stakeholders. This merged knowledge should have impact and assist in improving the quality of risk assessment and decision making during drug development, applying a risk-benefit framework (explicit justification of excipients, plan product development early and engage all stakeholders, data sharing and modeling, challenges related to new excipients, context sensitive risk-benefit analysis).

Large defect size and deficient rims have been described as predictors for complications and unsuccessful device placement in closure of interatrial communications. MASP is an underappreciated morphologic atrial septal variation whose prevalence in isolated atrial communications and its influence on percutaneous device closure has not been systematically assessed. We retrospectively evaluated echocardiographic data of 328 patients scheduled for percutaneous secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) and patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure between January 2006 and January 2013. In ASD patients, defect size was measured by balloon stretch diameter while the length of the surrounding rims was measured in standard transthoracic and transesophageal views. Furthermore, the distance between septum primum and septum secundum as it attaches to the left atrial roof was evaluated in both, ASD and PFO patients. Septal anatomy of patients with procedural failure was compared to the anatomy of patients in whom the procedure was successful. Transcatheter defect closure was successful in 131 (92.3%) of 142 ASD patients (32.3 years ± 24.7 years) and in all 186 PFO patients (49.6 years ± 16.2 years). Thirteen (4%) patients were found to have MASP (1.6 mm-13 mm). Smaller retroaortic rim, inferior rim, and the presence of a MASP were independently associated with procedural failure in ASD patients (P = 0.02, P = 0.03, and P = 0.003, respectively).

MUS parameters were quantitated by digital image processing and correlated with JDM disease activity measures and semi-quantitative thigh MRI short tau inversion recovery (STIR) and T1 scores. Rectus femoris MUS echogenicity was increased (median 47.8 vs 38.5, P = 0.002) in patients with JDM compared with controls. Rectus femoris MUS echogenicity correlated with Physician Global Activity (PGA), Manual Muscle Testing (MMT), and Childhood Myositis Assessment Scale (CMAS) (rs 0.4-0.54). Some MUS parameters correlated with functional quantitative measures of muscle strength: resting RF area on MUS strongly correlated with knee extension quantitative muscle testing (rs 0.76), and contracted area correlated with proximal MMT, knee extension quantitative muscle testing, and CMAS (rs 0.71-0.80). MUS echogenicity correlated with both STIR and T1 MRI (rs 0.43), and T1 MRI correlated inversely with RF contracted area (rs -0.49) on MUS. There were differences in pre- and post-exercise vascular power and colour Doppler on MUS in patients with JDM vs controls, with the percentage change of post-exercise vascular power Doppler lower in JDM compared with controls (7.1% vs 100.0%).

This analysis describes and compares transwomen who had been homeless in the last 6 months to those not homeless. We hypothesized that homelessness would compete with HIV care, food, shelter, and be associated with poverty. Variable domains included sociodemographic, mental health and substance use, HIV care, sexual risk behavior, social support from transgender and other friends, and childhood sexual abuse. There were 102 youth enrolled, 77 (75.5%) who had been homeless, and 25 (24.5%) who had not been homeless.

In vitro differentiation ability and immunomodulatory properties of ASCs were also tested. Flow cytometry showed that all ASCs express typical MSC markers CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105 simultaneously, but do not express such markers as HLA-DR, CD34, CD14, CD19, and CD45. Furthermore, median fluorescence intensity of positive cell surface markers increased with each subsequent passage indicating the accumulation of protein expression. The multilineage differentiation demonstrated the ability of ASCs from P6 to efficiently differentiate into adipocytes and chondrocytes, but their potential of osteogenic differentiation was diminished. Data from co-culture of ASCs and autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) indicated that ASCs from P3, P6, and P9 significantly reduce the proliferation of PBMNCs at ASCs:PBMNCs ratio 1:1 and this suppression is dose dependent. This study demonstrated that ASCs from P2 to P8, cultured in the presence of AS, represent a highly homogeneous cell population with a peak accumulation of MSC surface proteins at P5 possessing multilineage differentiation ability and significant immunosuppressive properties after double freezing and more than 4 years of cryopreservation.

615,615,37253844,"Scars play a pivotal role in plastic surgery: as surgeons, we continuously seek the best approach to perform a surgical procedure through a minimal access, possibly hidden in natural creases of the body, in order to create a scar less noticeable as possible. This behavior is explained by the fact that commonly, both patients and surgeons believe that the smaller the scar, the better the result. However, this is not always true and the quality of the scar is as important as its length (Barone in Aesthetic Plast Surg, 2022. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00266-022-03081-5 ). A small but widened scar can be less tolerated than a longer linear scar. Scar appearance is an important aspect influencing patient satisfaction after a surgical procedure that is often unaddressed (Barone in Aesthetic Plast Surg 42(6):1506-1518, 2018). The SCAR-Q represents the first validated comprehensive patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) designed for children and adults to assess scars (Klassen in Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open 6(4):e1672, 2018). It is composed of three domains: scar appearance, scar symptoms, and psychosocial impact. The scar appearance scale investigates how bothered the patient is about his/her scar and consists of 12 items asking about length, width, color, shape, and size of the scar, as well as how it looks up close and from different angles. The symptoms scale investigates how bothered are patients by how their scar has felt in the past week and it consists of 12 items asking whether the scar is painful, numb, itchy, hard or firm, tight, and sensitive when touched, as well as whether the scar makes it hard to move parts of the face or body or do some activities. The psychosocial impact scale investigates how the patient feels about his/her scar and involves 5 items asking about feeling upset, embarrassed, or unhappy about the scar, as well as how they feel when someone sees their scar. The three scales are independent and can also be administered separately. Scores for SCAR-Q scales range from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing a better outcome. Following a rigorous five-step process in cooperation with the developers, our team translated and validated the SCAR-Q questionnaire in Italian in order to allow Italian surgeons to use it in their clinical practice overcoming the language barrier that was often encountered with patients who are not fluent in English. We believe this is a precious tool for plastic surgeon to assess patient satisfaction, any issues related specifically to the scar and analyze the outcomes of the procedure performed.Level of evidence V: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

A total of 169 extremities with lymphoedema secondary to lymph node dissection and 65 extremities with idiopathic oedema (suspected primary lymphoedema) were evaluated; the utility of indocyanine green lymphography for diagnosis was compared with lymphoscintigraphy. Regression analysis between lymphoscintigraphy type and indocyanine green lymphography stage was conducted in the secondary lymphoedema group. In secondary oedema, the sensitivity of indocyanine green lymphography, compared with lymphoscintigraphy, was 0.972, the specificity was 0.548 and the accuracy was 0.816. When patients with lymphoscintigraphy type I and indocyanine green lymphography stage I were regarded as negative, the sensitivity of the indocyanine green lymphography was 0.978, the specificity was 0.925 and the accuracy was 0.953. There was a significant positive correlation between the lymphoscintigraphy type and the indocyanine green lymphography stage. In idiopathic oedema, the sensitivity of indocyanine green lymphography was 0.974, the specificity was 0.778 and the accuracy was 0.892. In secondary lymphoedema, earlier and less severe dysfunction could be detected by indocyanine green lymphography. Indocyanine green lymphography is recommended to determine patients' suitability for lymphaticovenular anastomosis, because the diagnostic ability of the test and its evaluation capability for disease severity is similar to lymphoscintigraphy but with less invasiveness and a lower cost. To detect primary lymphoedema, indocyanine green lymphography should be used first as a screening examination; when the results are positive, lymphoscintigraphy is useful to obtain further information.

It has been reported that soluble T cell antigens are released from cells in response to T cell activation. In the present study, we investigated whether soluble antigen levels of CD2, CD4 and CD8 in serum increase during acute IM. Soluble CD2, CD4 and CD8 levels in serum were measured by a sandwich enzyme immunoassay. In addition, peripheral blood T cell subsets were analyzed by single and two color flow-cytometric analyses in IM. Patients with IM had increased levels of soluble CD2, CD4 and CD8 in serum samples obtained during acute stages. We found a positive correlation between serum levels of soluble CD8 and absolute counts of HLA-DR+CD8+T cells during acute IM. In addition, the correlation between soluble CD8 levels and serum GOT or GPT levels was shown to be positive during acute IM. Our findings suggest that the soluble antigen levels of CD2, CD4 and CD8, in particular CD8, in serum are an important immunologic parameter for determining the activation of T cells during acute IM.

620,620,9764855,"Mast cells (MC) are important cellular components of the immune network in diverse organs. The skin MC has likewise been implicated in IgE- and complement-mediated cutaneous reactions. Such reactions supposedly involve specific cell surface membrane receptors. In this study, the cell surface marker profile of human skin MC was established using monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) against defined CD antigens. MC were isolated from juvenile foreskin (n = 55) and adult mammary skin (n = 5). The reactivity of MC with MoAb was assessed by a combined toluidine blue/immunofluorescence staining technique. Confirming our previous analyses on lung MC, foreskin MC reacted with MoAb against CD9, CD29, CD33, CD43, CD44, CD45, CD46, CD51, CD54, CD55, CD58, CD59, CD61, and CD117 (c-kit). Foreskin MC were also recognized by MoAb to CD47, CD48, CD49d, CD53, CD60, CD63, CD81, CD82, CD84, CD87, CD92, CD97, CD98, and CD99. Recently clustered CD antigens detectable on foreskin MC were CD147 (neurothelin), CD149 (MEM133), CD151 (PETA-3), and CD157 (BST-1). In contrast to lung MC and MC from adult skin, foreskin MC were found to express CD88 (C5aR). Also, cutaneous MC (from both juvenile foreskin and adult mammary skin), but not lung MC, were found to bind the CD32 MoAb IV.3, 2E1, and FLI8.26 (Fc gammaRII). The CD50 antigen (ICAM-3) was detectable on lung MC, but not on foreskin MC or MC of adult mammary skin. In summary, our data show that cutaneous MC and lung MC express an almost identical phenotype; however, in contrast to lung MC, cutaneous MC appear to express substantial amounts of CD32 and to lack CD50. In addition, foreskin MC, unlike MC from adult skin or lung, express CD88.

A retrospective study was conducted by reviewing medical charts and photographs of 86 Taiwanese children with various types of nevus of Ota between January 2017 and September 2020. Picosecond 755-nm alexandrite laser therapy was used to treat pigmentary lesions. Percent clearance of lesions during treatment and the treatment time required to achieve 95%-100% clearance were determined. According to Tanino's classification or Peking University Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) classification of nevus of Ota, most patients belonged to Tanino's Type II (32%) and Type III (38%) or PUMCH Type IIb (33%) and Type IIIb (26%), which indicated that the nevus was mainly distributed in the forehead, upper and lower eyelid, zygomatic, cheek, and temple regions. After treatment with picosecond 755-nm alexandrite laser, 96.5% of the patients achieved 95%-100% clearance with an average of 4.3 treatment sessions. The earlier onset of lesions (before 5 months of age) and the darker Fitzpatrick skin types (type IV vs. type III) significantly increased the number of treatments required to achieve clear response, while sex, age at first treatment, Tanino's classification of nevus, and color of nevus had no significant effect.

We analysed the epidemiological characteristics and time trends of schistosomiasis-related mortality in Brazil. We performed a nationwide study based on official mortality data obtained from the Brazilian Mortality Information System. We included all deaths in Brazil between 2000 and 2011, in which schistosomiasis was mentioned on the death certificate as an underlying or associated cause of death (multiple causes of death). We calculated crude and age-adjusted mortality rates (per 100,000 inhabitants), and proportional mortality rates. Trends over time were assessed using joinpoint regression models. Over the 12-year study period, 12,491,280 deaths were recorded in Brazil. Schistosomiasis was mentioned in 8,756 deaths, including in 6,319 (72.2%) as an underlying cause and in 2,437 (27.8%) as an associated cause. The average annual age-adjusted mortality rate was 0.49 deaths/100,000 inhabitants (95% confidence interval: 0.46-0.52) and proportional mortality rate was 0.070% (95% confidence interval: 0.069-0.072). Males (0.53 deaths/100,000 inhabitants), those aged ⩾70years (3.41 deaths/100,000 inhabitants), those of brown race/colour (0.44 deaths/100,000 inhabitants), and residents in the Northeast region of Brazil (1.19 deaths/100,000 inhabitants) had the highest schistosomiasis-related death rates. Age-adjusted mortality rates showed a significant decrease at a national level (Annual Percent Change: -2.8%; 95% confidence interval: -4.2 to -2.4) during the studied period. We observed decreasing mortality rates in the Northeast (Annual Percent Change: -2.5%; 95% confidence interval: -4.2 to -0.8), Southeast (Annual Percent Change: -2.2%; 95% confidence interval: -3.6 to -0.9), and Central-West (Annual Percent Change: -7.9%; 95% confidence interval: -11.3 to -4.3) regions, while the rates remained stable in the North and South regions. Despite the reduced mortality, schistosomiasis is still a neglected cause of death in Brazil, with considerable regional differences.

627,627,10737466,"The estimation of the age of skin bruises is of importance in forensic medicine, especially in child abuse cases. Time-dependent changes in bruise colour and/or associated histological features have been used with a limited degree of success. An increased rate of apoptosis in the injured tissue has been considered as a novel time-dependent marker of cell death, by injury inflicted in a rat model. The object of the present study was to apply the TUNEL method of DNA end labelling to identify and enumerate apoptotic cells in bruised and normal skin in order to study the relationship of apoptotic cell density with the age of the bruise. A commercially available DNA end labelling kit, TUNEL method, was standardised, validated and used for this purpose. Twenty unselected post-mortem cases with bruises due to a variety of causes were studied. The apoptotic cells stained with TUNEL reaction were counted in 10 high power fields in the epidermis, as well as in the dermis of formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded skin specimens. The mean positive cell densities (+/- 1 S.E.) were compared with respect to the age of the bruise. In the epidermis, the mean apoptotic cell count was statistically significantly greater in the bruised skin compared to normal skin in 2- to 6-day-old bruises; whilst in the dermis the same was true in 3- to 8-day-old bruises. The overall findings suggest that there is a quiescent period prior to the increase in the apoptotic cell activity that is seen following skin bruising. This is so provided the post-mortem skin samples were collected within a lapse of 6 days or less between the time of death and formalin fixation and paraffin embedding to avoid the bias made by the difference of length of post-mortem interval.

Previous literature has suggested community attitudes and intrinsic factors within the decision-making process may be negatively impacting on implant uptake, however these elements have not previously been studied in detail in this context. We set out to explore community attitudes towards the contraceptive implant and the pathways to decision making around implant use in a rural community on Karkar Island, PNG. We conducted 10 focus-group (FGD) and 23 in-depth interviews (IDI) using semi-structured topic guides. Key sampling characteristics included age, exposure or non-exposure to implants, marital status, education and willingness to participate in discussion. Four FGDs were held with women, four with men and two with mixed gender. IDIs were carried out with five women (current implant users, former implant users, implant never users), five men, five religious leaders (Catholic and non-Catholic), four village leaders and four health workers. Two in-depth interviews (four participants) were analysed as dyads and the remaining participant responses were analysed individually. Men were supportive of their wives using family planning but there was a community-wide lack of familiarity about the contraceptive implant which influenced its low uptake. Men perceived family planning to be 'women's business' but remained strongly influential in the decision making processes around method use. Young men were more receptive to biomedical information than older men and had a greater tendency towards wanting to use implants. Older men preferred to be guided by prominent community members for decisions concerning implants whilst young men were more likely to engage with health services directly. In communities where a couple's decision to use the contraceptive implant is strongly coloured by gendered roles and social perceptions, having a detailed understanding of the relational dynamics affecting the decision-making unit is useful in targeting future healthcare interventions. Engaging groups who are reluctant to connect with health information, as well as those who are most influential in the decision making process, will have the greatest impact on increasing implant acceptability and uptake.

In the present study, we have examined the expression and function of the 10D1 Ag on human thymocytes. Three-color FMF analysis showed that the 10D1 Ag was highly expressed on minor but distinct subpopulations of double-negative and CD4 single-positive thymocytes, and weakly on a part of double-positive thymocytes, but not on CD8 single-positive thymocytes. In double-negative thymocytes, the vast majority of 10D1+ cells were immature thymocytes of CD7+2+3- phenotype. Interestingly, 10D1 mAb could induce the proliferation of CD4 single-positive thymocytes in the presence of goat anti-mouse Ig to cross-link the 10D1 Ag. The treatment of thymocytes with OKT4 mAb plus C but not with OKT8 mAb plus C totally abrogated the proliferative response induced by 10D1 mAb, indicating that the 10D1-responsible thymocytes were of CD4+8- phenotype. This 10D1 mAb-induced thymocyte proliferation was perfectly dependent on the endogenous IL-2/IL-2R system since a complete inhibition was observed with anti-IL-2 and anti-IL-2R mAb. The proliferating CD4 single positive thymocytes predominantly expressed the IL-2R alpha (p55) but not a detectable level of the IL-2R beta (p75). These results indicate that, although the 10D1 Ag can be detected on the CD7+2+3-4-8- thymocytes, its functional expression is restricted to a minor more mature CD4+ thymocyte population as well as in peripheral blood T cells, and the implications of these findings are discussed.

Twenty limbs in 20 patients were studied with air plethysmography (APG), photoplethysmography (PPG), and duplex ultrasonography. Ten limbs (group 1) were clinically without any venous disease. Group 2 consisted of 10 limbs with severe, class 3 venous stasis. Duplex ultrasonography, complemented with Doppler color-flow imaging was used to examine the superficial and deep venous systems to identify reflux. Ultrasonography identified deep venous reflux in eight of 10 limbs in group 2. Severe superficial reflux was identified in the two remaining limbs. Seven limbs with deep reflux also demonstrated severe superficial reflux. Superficial venous reflux was identified in one leg in group 1. APG accurately separated normal limbs from those with reflux. Parameters that were significantly different (p < 0.05) between the two groups were the venous filling index, (group 1 = 1.37 +/- 1.16 ml/sec, group 2 = 29.5 +/- 6.2 ml/sec.), venous volume (group 1 = 107 +/- 10.1 ml, group 2 = 220 +/- 22.5 ml), ejection fraction (group 1 = 52.5% +/- 2.3%, group 2 = 32.5% +2- 4.6%), and residual volume fraction (group 1 = 21.4 +/- 2.0%, group 2 = 52.1% +/- 2.5%). PPG refill times were significantly shortened in group 2 versus those of group 1 (6.4 +/- 0.89 sec vs 20.2 +/- 1.1 sec). The sensitivity of PPG refill times to identify reflux was 100%, but the specificity was only 60%, whereas the sensitivity and specificity for the residual volume fraction was 100%. The venous filling index was able to identify reflux and determine whether only superficial reflux was present with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 90%. The kappa coefficient of agreement between duplex scanning and APG was 0.83, whereas between duplex and PPG it was only 0.47. APG accurately identifies limbs with and without venous reflux when compared with duplex ultrasonography. APG is a better method of evaluating clinically significant venous reflux than PPG. PPG is a sensitive method of detecting reflux, but the specificity is poor, and PPG refill times cannot accurately predict the location of reflux. The combination of APG and duplex ultrasonography provides the best means of assessing venous reflux.

Double- and triple-color cytofluorimetric analysis was used to better characterize the phenotypic features of the different subsets. Apart from a reduced number of T lymphocytes (CD3+) in DS children and of B lymphocytes (CD19+) in both DS groups, the major alteration we found was a marked age-related increase of the percentage of cells bearing markers associated with NK activity, such as CD16, CD56, and CD57. These DS cells were apparently severely defective as far as their function was concerned, because NK activity was significantly reduced in comparison with age-matched controls, but still capable of responding to cytokines such as interleukin-2, interferon-beta, and interferon-gamma, and to the modulation of lytic activity exerted by the anti-CD16 monoclonal antibody.

Race was significantly associated with frequency of injuries in several anatomical locations, with White victims having a higher frequency of injuries than Black victims. Skin color was significantly associated with injury frequency in many anatomical locations, with victims with light skin sustaining more injuries than victims with dark skin. Even when skin color was included in the relationship, race remained a statistically significant factor, suggesting that the relationship between race and injuries may be more complicated than merely a skin color difference that has been mislabeled a racial difference.

In this study, we successfully treated 2 patients with vitiligo using a short-pulsed CO2 laser and by grafting the autologous cultured epidermis. Small pieces of uninvolved skin (2 x 1 cm) were taken for cultivation from a pudendal or axillary area and were expanded into 2 pieces of epidermal sheets 100 cm. Before grafting, the lesions were abraded superficially using a short-pulsed CO2 laser with a computerized pattern generator. After successful grafting, repigmentation was visible within 1 to 2 months. One year after grafting, the skin color was almost the same as that of the surrounding normal skin. Thus, the combination of short-pulsed CO2 laser resurfacing and cultured epidermal grafting is a powerful option for treating an asymmetric and wide vitiliginous lesion.

We present a comparison of the Glasgow seven-point checklist and the American Cancer Society's ABCDs of pigmented lesions for detecting early melanomas. Logistic regression analysis showed that the Glasgow checklist (N = 205 lesions) contained two significant variables (irregular outline, P = .001, relative odds = 10.9; diameter greater than 1 cm, P = .005, relative odds = 6.7) for differentiating benign from malignant pigmented lesions whereas a three-point version of the ABCDs (N = 192 lesions) had three significant variables (irregular outline, P = .001, relative odds = 9.3; diameter greater than 6 mm, P = .008, relative odds = 5.5; variegation, P = .05, relative odds = 3.7). All six melanomas scored 3 out of 3 on the ABCD scale for a sensitivity of 1.00 and specificity of 0.98 at a threshold of 3 out of 3. Patients rarely sought dermatologic consultation because of these predictors but often sought help for nonsignificant reasons such as inflammation (P = .93), color change (P = .84), itch (P = .72), and increasing size (P = .38). The simpler three-point scale at a threshold of two had equal specificity (0.88 versus 0.94) and better sensitivity (0.73 versus 0.44) than the Glasgow seven-point checklist at the recommended threshold of three out of seven. We therefore recommend that the American public be better educated about the ABCDs to help increase self-referral so that early melanomas can be found and eradicated.

The authors review indications, choices, safety, efficacy, complications, and technical refinements. A treatment algorithm is presented. A retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent microvascular reconstruction of the face and all patients with craniofacial dysmorphology was performed. Between 1989 and 2004, a total of 93 patients with the following diagnoses were identified: craniofacial microsomia (n = 73), Treacher Collins syndrome (n = 8), and severe orbitofacial cleft (n = 12). All patients underwent microsurgical facial reconstruction with a superficial inferior epigastric, groin, or circumflex scapular flap. Flap revisions, complications, and non-free flap related surgery were reviewed. The mean age at microvascular reconstruction was 11 years (range, 4 to 27 years). Flap choices included the following: superficial inferior epigastric (n = 4), groin (n = 3), and circumflex scapular (n = 105). Seventy-six patients underwent unilateral and 17 patients underwent bilateral (one of 17 simultaneous) reconstructions. Postoperative complications included partial flap loss (n = 1), reexploration (n = 1), hematoma (n = 5), and cellulitis (n = 5). All patients had subjective improvement in facial contour, symmetry, skin tone, and color.

640,640,37745944,"In1998, the Boston Birth Cohort (BBC) was initiated at Boston Medical Center (BMC) in response to persistently high rates of preterm birth (PTB, defined as birth before 37 weeks of gestation) in the US population and the longstanding profound PTB disparity among Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC). The BBC encompasses two linked study protocols: The PTB Study serves as the baseline recruitment in the BBC. It aims to address fundamental questions about the causes and consequences of PTB. The study oversamples preterm babies using a case/control study design, in which cases are defined as mothers who deliver a preterm and/or low birthweight baby (<2500 grams regardless of gestational age). Controls are enrolled at a 2:1 control/case ratio and matched by maternal age (±5 years), self-reported race and ethnicity, and date of delivery (± 7 days for case delivery). From inception, it was designed as a comprehensive gene-environmental study of PTB. As a natural extension, the Children's Health Study, under a separate but linked Institutional Review Board protocol, is a longitudinal follow-up study of the participants who were recruited at birth in the PTB Study and who continue pediatric care at BMC. This linked model allows for investigation of early life origins of pediatric and chronic disease in a prospective cohort design. The BBC is one of the largest and longest National Institutes of Health-funded prospective birth cohort studies in the United States, consisting of 8733 mother-child dyads enrolled in the PTB Study at birth, and of those, 3592 children have been enrolled in the Children's Health Study, with a median follow-up of 14.5 years. The BBC mirrors the urban, underresourced, and underrepresented BIPOC population served by BMC. A high proportion of BBC children were born prematurely and had chronic health conditions (e.g., asthma, obesity, and elevated blood pressure) in childhood. The BBC's long-term goal has been to build a large, comprehensive database (epidemiological, clinical, and multiomics) and biospecimen repository to elucidate early life origins of pediatric and chronic diseases and identify modifiable upstream factors (e.g., psychosocial, environmental, and nutritional) to improve health across the life course for BIPOC mothers and children.

A case-based, precoded questionnaire consisting of 10 clinical cases/patients with 26 teeth/occlusal surfaces was developed. The cases were set up in a PowerPoint presentation and color printed as a booklet illustrating patients with different patterns of caries activity, severity, and risk. A total of 69 dental professionals participated. Content and face validity of the survey method was established using a panel of experts. The panel also assessed the reliability of the method using a test-retest procedure (κ ≥ 0.80) and acting as benchmark. Measurements of agreement between dental professional and benchmark assessments showed substantial agreement for overall caries activity and risk assessment of patients and for clinical and radiographic severity of occlusal lesions (κ = 0.61-0.67). For assessment of caries lesion activity on occlusal surfaces, the agreement was moderate (κ = 0.50). Regarding treatment decisions, dental professionals showed substantial agreement when indicating restorative treatments (κ = 0.68). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a significant influence of various patient-, lesion-, and participant-related variables in the assessment of caries risk, caries activity and severity, and treatment decision. In conclusion, Danish dental professionals participating in the study apply reasonably well current concepts on overall caries activity and risk assessment, clinical and radiographic severity of occlusal lesions, and, to a certain extent, assessment of caries lesion activity on occlusal surfaces.

642,642,25250996,"Impetigo is the most common bacterial skin infection in children two to five years of age. There are two principal types: nonbullous (70% of cases) and bullous (30% of cases). Nonbullous impetigo, or impetigo contagiosa, is caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, and is characterized by honey-colored crusts on the face and extremities. Impetigo primarily affects the skin or secondarily infects insect bites, eczema, or herpetic lesions. Bullous impetigo, which is caused exclusively by S. aureus, results in large, flaccid bullae and is more likely to affect intertriginous areas. Both types usually resolve within two to three weeks without scarring, and complications are rare, with the most serious being poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Treatment includes topical antibiotics such as mupirocin, retapamulin, and fusidic acid. Oral antibiotic therapy can be used for impetigo with large bullae or when topical therapy is impractical. Amoxicillin/clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, clindamycin, doxycycline, minocycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and macrolides are options, but penicillin is not. Natural therapies such as tea tree oil; olive, garlic, and coconut oils; and Manuka honey have been anecdotally successful, but lack sufficient evidence to recommend or dismiss them as treatment options. Treatments under development include minocycline foam and Ozenoxacin, a topical quinolone. Topical disinfectants are inferior to antibiotics and should not be used. Empiric treatment considerations have changed with the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, with methicillin-resistant S. aureus, macrolide-resistant streptococcus, and mupirocin-resistant streptococcus all documented. Fusidic acid, mupirocin, and retapamulin cover methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and streptococcal infections. Clindamycin proves helpful in suspected methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections.

Overall parental satisfaction with the treatment was excellent; however, satisfaction with regard to color received the lowest rating. No significant differences were found between dentist and parent evaluations of color, size, and overall appearance (Fisher exact test; P=.194,.776,.291, respectively). Parents rated their overall satisfaction as being positive regardless of their poor ratings of color, size, or overall appearance. However, a significant relationship was found between durability and overall satisfaction (P=.046). Parents who gave poor ratings to durability also rated their overall satisfaction as being poor. Parental satisfaction with bonded resin composite SCs for the treatment of primary incisors with large or multi-surface caries was excellent. Parents' dissatisfaction was most often related to color of the restorations. However, this did not affect their overall satisfaction with the crowns.

When this flap was used in the auricular or periauricular region, the blood circulation was safe and the appearance was aesthetically good in flaps pedicled by the postauricular vessels or by the superficial temporal vessels.

We excluded advertised websites, links to individual pdf documents and links to blogs/chats. We compiled a complete list of websites identified using the three search engines and the search terms and analysed the content. We only selected pages that were relevant to fibroadenoma. We excluded pages which only contained contact details and no narrative information relating to the condition. We did not assess information where links were directed to alternative websites. We undertook a qualitative visual assessment of each of the websites using a framework of pre-determined key criteria based on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services toolkit. This involved assessing characteristics such as overall design, page layout, font size and colour. Each criterion was scored as: +1- criterion achieved; -1- criterion not achieved; and 0- no evidence, unclear or not applicable (maximum total score 43). We then assessed the readability of each website to determine the UK and US reading age using five different readability tests: Flesch Kincaid, Gunning Fog, Coleman Liau, SMOG, and the Automated Readability Index. We compared the readability scores to determine if there were any significant differences across the websites identified. We also generated scores for the Flesh Reading Ease as well as information about sentence structure (number of syllables per sentence and proportion of words with a high number of syllables) and proportion of people the text was readable to.

The median readability score for the identified websites was 8.58 (age 14-15), with a range of 6.69-12.22 (age 12-13 to university level). There was a statistically significant difference between the readability scores obtained across websites (p<0.001). Almost half of the websites (18/39; 46.2%) were classified as very difficult by the Flesch Reading Ease score, with only 13/39 (33.33%) classified as being fairly easy or plain English. We found wide differences in the general appearance, layout and focus of the fibroadenoma websites identified. The readability of most of the websites was also much higher than the recommended level for the public to understand. Fibroadenoma website information needs to be simplified to reduce the use of jargon and specificity to the condition for individuals to better comprehend it. In addition, their visual appearance could be improved by changing the layout and including images and diagrams.

648,648,19416315,"Cerebral palsy (CP) is frequently linked to white matter injury in children born preterm. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a powerful technique providing precise identification of white matter microstructure. We investigated the relationship between DTI-observed thalamocortical (posterior thalamic radiation) injury, motor (corticospinal tract) injury, and sensorimotor function. Twenty-eight children born preterm (16 males, 12 females; mean age 5y 10mo, SD 2y 6mo, range 16mo-13y; mean gestational age at birth 28wks, SD 2.7wks, range 23-34wks) were included in this case-control study. Twenty-one children had spastic diplegia, four had spastic quadriplegia, two had hemiplegia, and one had ataxic/hypotonic CP; 15 of the participants walked independently. Normative comparison data were obtained from 35 healthy age-matched children born at term (19 males, 16 females; mean age 5y 9mo, SD 4y 4mo, range 15mo-15y). Two-dimensional DTI color maps were created to evaluate 26 central white matter tracts, which were graded by a neuroradiologist masked to clinical status. Quantitative measures of touch, proprioception, strength (dynamometer), and spasticity (modified Ashworth scale) were obtained from a subset of participants. All 28 participants with CP had periventricular white-matter injury on magnetic resonance imaging. Using DTI color maps, there was more severe injury in the posterior thalamic radiation pathways than in the descending corticospinal tracts. Posterior thalamic radiation injury correlated with reduced contralateral touch threshold, proprioception, and motor severity, whereas corticospinal tract injury did not correlate with motor or sensory outcome measures. These findings extend previous research demonstrating that CP in preterm children reflects disruption of thalamocortical connections as well as descending corticospinal pathways.

The lesion size of low-grade MEC was smaller than those of intermediate- and high-grade MEC. MEC lesions of the salivary glands were mostly associated with heterogeneous echotexture, indistinct margins, irregular shape, and absence of distal acoustic enhancement. They sometimes showed cystic areas, calcifications, regional lymph node enlargement, or were well vascularized on Doppler.

650,650,2362377,"Visual functions in senescence were assessed quantitatively by the pattern reversal visually evoked cortical potentials (VECP) in human subjects and animals. The results obtained in the elderly showed an elevation of contrast threshold, ie, lowered sensitivity, for higher spatial frequency, and a rise in the luminance thresholds. There was also an overall suppression in the temporal frequency curves, a sensitivity decrease for the upper half of the visual field, a blue-yellow defect and a decrease in the amplitude of accommodation. Studies of the pseudophakic eye with an intraocular lens verified that the lower transparency and yellowish changes of the crystalline lens and senile miosis do not entirely account for the depressed visual function in the elderly. The delay of P100 peak latency of the VECP in patients with juvenile Parkinson's disease after cessation of L-dopa indicated the deficiency of dopamine in these patients, which in turn was considered as a clinical model of senescence. Optic nerve fiber counts in mice showed a significant decrease in the aged group. It was considered that there is neuronal senescence other than in the eye itself. The results can be illustrated by the following daily life experience. In the evening, an elderly person would have difficulty in identifying a cat as a calico cat if the cat were atop a wall and running quickly through the visual field. It was surprising, however, that the senescence found in the visual function was not as great as that found in the other sensory organs.

Different techniques can be used for this purpose, each of which has its own advantages and limitations. Therefore, appropriate selection is necessary to obtain the best results for each patient, and many factors, such as patient anatomy, age, associated cardiomyopathies, etc., have to be considered.

We retrospectively compared 26 Japanese patients before and after treatment. A good therapeutic outcome was achieved overall, but some adult female patients subsequently developed severe postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Sacral Mongolian spots were more laser-resistant than extrasacral Mongolian spots. The outcome correlated with the age of patients at the initiation of treatment; therefore, sacral and extrasacral Mongolian spots should be treated before 20 years of age. To avoid severe postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, the optimal interval between laser treatments and the use of other treatment modalities including Q-switched ruby laser, Q-switched neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet laser, or bleaching creams should be considered.

Two methods, repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP)-PCR and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR, were used to generate DNA fingerprints, and computer-assisted analysis was used to derive clusters. The two PCR techniques were only partially complementary (48%). REP-PCR fingerprints identified a distinct pathological cluster consisting of strains from 63% of the patients and was strongly associated with both disease (P < 0.00001) and the vacuolating cytotoxin A (vacA) signal sequence type (P < 0.003). RAPD-PCR fingerprinting was not associated with disease and was less strongly associated with vacA (P < 0.05) than REP-PCR was.

One hundred and ten community adolescents (59 male) aged from 12 to 19 years (mean age = 16.31, SD age = 1.77) completed the MGT and Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire. The results yielded 4 types of strange face illusions; 2 types of illusions (slight change of light/color [20%] and own face deformation [45.5%]) lacked depersonalization-like phenomena (no identity change), while 2 other types (vision of other identity [27.3%], and vision of non-human identity [7.3%]) contained clear depersonalization-like phenomena. Furthermore, the disorganization dimension of schizotypy associated negatively with time of first illusion (first press), and positively with frequency of illusions during the MGT. Statistically significant differences on positive and disorganized schizotypy were found when comparing groups on the basis of degree of depersonalization-like phenomena (from slight color changes to non-human visions).

Nearly half (47.4%) of the infants had green stool color dominating for at least 1 week, with comparable frequency among breastfed (47.7%) and formula-fed (45.2%) infants. Green stools were associated with a higher defecation frequency (linear mixed-effect model p < 0.0001). Occasional blood in stool was reported in 9.3% and recurrent blood in 5.2% of the infants with no difference in stool consistency. Hard stools were rare (≤ 1%).     Conclusion: This study enlightens the spectrum of defecation patterns in healthy term infants during the first 17 weeks of life. A better understanding of bowel function helps healthcare professionals distinguish normal from abnormal when addressing defecation, the color of stools, and the type of feeding. What is Known: • Breastfed infants have more frequent and more yellow-colored stools than formula-fed infants. • Stools with green color are often suggested by the parents or even by medical professionals to indicate disease or discomfort in early life. What is New: • Nearly half of the healthy term infants had green stool dominating for at least one week during the first 17 weeks and occasional blood was reported in almost 10% of the infants during this period. • Data on normal variation in bowel function and stool may serve primary health care professionals when educating the families and caretakers of infants.

The study group comprised 11 patients with RPE65 mutations, and for control purposes, 32 healthy probands and 2 achromats. A custom-made binocular chromatic pupillometer (Bino I) connected to a ColorDome Ganzfeld stimulator was used to assess changes in pupil diameter in response to red (640 nm) and blue (462 nm) light stimuli. Light intensities, stimulus duration, and background varied depending on the protocol used. Results were compared to the clinical phenotype, that is, visual field (Goldmann perimetry), best corrected visual acuity, and full-field stimulus testing (FST). No significant differences in any of the pupil response parameters were observed in intraday or intervisit variability tests. Pupil responses to rod-weighted stimulation were significantly diminished in all RPE65 patients. Pupil responses to cone-weighted stimuli differed among RPE65 patients and did not always correlate with residual visual field and cone sensitivity loss in FST. Pupil responses to ipRGC-weighted answers were slightly but significantly diminished, and the postillumination pupil response was significantly increased.

672,672,18317133,"The thoracodorsal artery perforator flap is a versatile flap for resurfacing soft-tissue defects. However, it is too bulky for resurfacing shallow defects. The authors used preoperative color Doppler sonography to identify the suprafascial courses of skin perforators to facilitate the design and thinning procedures of thoracodorsal artery perforator flaps. Thin thoracodorsal artery perforator flaps were designed in 29 patients. Preoperative color Doppler sonography was used to identify the penetrating points and suprafascial courses of skin perforators. According to the different orientations of suprafascial courses, skin perforators could be classified into three types. The designs and thinning procedures of flaps relied on the findings of preoperative color Doppler sonography. Fifty-eight ideal perforators were marked on the 29 patients. Intraoperative dissections proved that 55 perforators were thoracodorsal artery skin perforators, and three perforators were intercostal artery perforators. In one patient, no skin perforator derived from the descending branch of the thoracodorsal artery was found during intraoperative dissection (3.4 percent). Suprafascial courses could be demonstrated by preoperative color Doppler sonography in 54 of the 55 thoracodorsal artery skin perforators. Nineteen were type 1 perforators (35.2 percent), 26 were type 2 perforators (48.1 percent), and nine were type 3 perforators (16.7 percent). Complications were encountered in six patients (20.7 percent), all of whom recovered well.

673,673,36453516,"Measurable residual disease (MRD) is the most powerful independent predictor of risk of relapse and long-term survival in adults and children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). For almost all patients with ALL there is a reliable method to evaluate MRD, which can be done using multi-color flow cytometry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction to detect specific fusion transcripts or immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor gene rearrangements, and high-throughput next-generation sequencing. While next-generation sequencing-based MRD detection has been increasingly utilized in clinical practice due to its high sensitivity, the clinical significance of very low MRD levels (<10-4) is not fully characterized. Several new immunotherapy approaches including blinatumomab, inotuzumab ozogamicin, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies have demonstrated efficacy in eradicating MRD in patients with B-ALL. However, new approaches to target MRD in patients with T-ALL remain an unmet need. As our MRD detection assays become more sensitive and expanding novel therapeutics enter clinical development, the future of ALL therapy will increasingly utilize MRD as a criterion to either intensify or modify therapy to prevent relapse or de-escalate therapy to reduce treatment-related morbidity and mortality.

The aim of the present study was to assess whether ICG videoangiography is also suitable for intraoperative confirmation of extracranial-intracranial bypass patency. Forty patients undergoing cerebral revascularization for hemodynamic cerebral ischemia (11 patients), moya-moya disease (18 patients), or complex intracranial aneurysms (11 patients) were included. Superficial temporal artery (STA)-middle cerebral artery (MCA) bypass surgery was performed 35 times in 30 patients (five patients with moyamoya underwent bilateral procedures), STA-posterior cerebral artery bypass surgery in two patients, and saphenous vein (SV) high-flow bypass surgery in eight patients. In each patient, following the completion of the anastomosis, ICG (0.3 mg/kg body weight) was given systemically via an intravenous bolus injection. A near-infrared light emitted by laser diodes was used to illuminate the operating field and the intravascular fluorescence was recorded using an optical filter-equipped video camera. The findings of ICG videoangiography were compared with those of postoperative digital subtraction (DS) or computerized tomography (CT) angiography. In all cases excellent visualization of cerebral arteries, the bypass graft, and brain perfusion was noted. Indocyanine green videoangiography was used to identify four nonfunctioning STA-MCA bypasses, which could be revised successfully in all cases. In two cases of SV high-flow bypasses, ICG videoangiography revealed stenosis at the proximal anastomotic site, which was also revised successfully.

Multicentre, double-masked, superiority, placebo-controlled, randomised trial. We will enrol children aged 6-12 years with myopia of -0.50 dioptres or worse in both eyes.We will recruit 289 participants with an allocation ratio of 2:1 (193 atropine; 96 placebo) from five centres. Participants will instil one drop in each eye every day for 2 years and attend a research centre every 6 months. The vehicle and preservative will be the same in both study arms.The primary outcome is SER of both eyes measured by autorefractor under cycloplegia at 2 years (adjusted for baseline). Secondary outcomes include axial length, best corrected distance visual acuity, near visual acuity, reading speed, pupil diameter, accommodation, adverse event rates and allergic reactions, quality of life (EQ-5D-Y) and tolerability at 2 years. Mechanistic evaluations will include: peripheral axial length, peripheral retinal defocus, anterior chamber depth, iris colour, height and weight, activities questionnaire, ciliary body biometry and chorioretinal thickness. Endpoints from both eyes will be pooled in combined analysis using generalised estimating equations to allow for the correlation between eyes within participant. Three years after cessation of treatment, we will also evaluate refractive error and adverse events.

The maximal width of the aortic stenosis jet seen in 61 of these patients (Group A) was measured at the aortic valve. Color-guided continuous wave Doppler examination was used to measure the mean transaortic pressure gradient, and the aortic valve area was estimated using the simplified continuity equation. The aortic stenosis jet was not seen in 39 patients (Group B), and the mean pressure gradient and aortic valve area in these patients were assessed by conventional Doppler echocardiography alone. The mean pressure gradient obtained by continuous wave Doppler study and cardiac catheterization in the 61 Group A patients correlated well (r = 0.90); the correlation was lower in the 39 Group B patients (r = 0.70). The overall correlation for the combined Groups A and B was good (r = 0.82).

Fifty-six family members had a complete eye examination. Clinical records of an additional 3 patients were reviewed. Goldmann perimetry and a 21-chip subtest of the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue test were performed on selected patients. Affected patients, unaffected siblings, and potentially informative spouses were genotyped with short tandem repeat polymorphisms located on chromosome 3. The genotypic data were subjected to linkage analysis. Thirty-four family members were found to be clinically affected. Most experienced vision loss (20/40 or poorer) in the first decade of life. Most (9 of the 16 eyes) progressed to 20/800 or poorer visual acuity by age 60 years, while 2 patients maintained visual acuities of 20/40 at that age. Affected patients had a 2- to 10-fold increase in the error score of a 21-chip subtest of the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue test compared with age-matched unaffected family members.

In the present study, the vision in BCM is examined, specifically seeking clinically-feasible outcomes for a future clinical trial. BCM patients (n = 25, ages 5-72) were studied with kinetic and static chromatic perimetry, full-field sensitivity testing, and eye movement recordings. Vision at the fovea and parafovea was probed with chromatic microperimetry. Kinetic fields with a Goldmann size V target were generally full. Short-wavelength (S-) sensitive cone function was normal or near normal in most patients. Light-adapted perimetry results on conventional background lights were abnormally reduced; 600-nm stimuli were seen by rods whereas white stimuli were seen by both rods and S-cones. Under dark-adapted conditions, 500-nm stimuli were seen by rods in both BCM and normals. Spectral sensitivity functions in the superior retina showed retained rod and S-cone functions in BCM under dark-adapted and light-adapted conditions. In the fovea, normal subjects showed L/M-cone mediation using a 650-nm stimulus under dark-adapted conditions, whereas BCM patients had reduced sensitivity driven by rod vision. Full-field red stimuli on bright blue backgrounds were seen by L/M-cones in normal subjects whereas BCM patients had abnormally reduced and rod-mediated sensitivities.

Forty-eight patients were identified, with disease-causing variants in five different genes: CNGA3, CNGB3, GNAT2, PDE6C and PDE6H. Longitudinal evaluation was possible for 11 patients and 27 patients participated in a renewed in-depth phenotyping consisting of visual acuity assessment, optical coherence tomography (OCT), fundus autofluorescence, colour vision evaluation, contrast sensitivity, mesopic microperimetry and full-field electroretinography. Foveal morphology was evaluated based on OCT images for all 48 patients using a grading system based on the integrity of the hyperreflective photoreceptor band, the inner segment ellipsoid zone (ISe). Signs of progression were evaluated based on longitudinal data and correlation with age. We found a statistically significant positive correlation between OCT grade and age (Spearman ρ = 0.62, p < 0.0001) and we observed changes in the foveal morphology in 2 of 11 patients with ≥5 years of follow-up. We did not find any convincing correlation between age and functional parameters (visual acuity, retinal sensitivity and contrast sensitivity) nor did we find correlation between structural and functional parameters, or any clear genotype-phenotype correlation. Some patients with ACHM demonstrate signs of progressive foveal changes in OCT characteristics with increasing age. This is relevant in terms of possible new treatments. However, functional characteristics, such as visual acuity, remained stable despite changing foveal structure.

692,692,26674187,"Given the proposed changes to nutrition labelling in Canada and the dearth of research examining comprehension and use of nutrition facts tables (NFts) by adolescents and young adults, our objective was to experimentally test the efficacy of modifications to NFts on young Canadians' ability to interpret, compare and mathematically manipulate nutrition information in NFts on prepackaged food. An online survey was conducted among 2010 Canadians aged 16 to 24 years drawn from a consumer sample. Participants were randomized to view two NFts according to one of six experimental conditions, using a between-groups 2 x 3 factorial design: serving size (current NFt vs. standardized serving-sizes across similar products) x percent daily value (% DV) (current NFt vs. ""low/med/high"" descriptors vs. colour coding). The survey included seven performance tasks requiring participants to interpret, compare and mathematically manipulate nutrition information on NFts. Separate modified Poisson regression models were conducted for each of the three outcomes. The ability to compare two similar products was significantly enhanced in NFt conditions that included standardized serving-sizes (p ≤ .001 for all). Adding descriptors or colour coding of % DV next to calories and nutrients on NFts significantly improved participants' ability to correctly interpret % DV information (p ≤ .001 for all). Providing both standardized serving-sizes and descriptors of % DV had a modest effect on participants' ability to mathematically manipulate nutrition information to calculate the nutrient content of multiple servings of a product (relative ratio = 1.19; 95% confidence limit: 1.04-1.37). Standardizing serving-sizes and adding interpretive % DV information on NFts improved young Canadians' comprehension and use of nutrition information. Some caution should be exercised in generalizing these findings to all Canadian youth due to the sampling issues associated with the study population. Further research is needed to replicate this study in a more heterogeneous sample in Canada and across a range of food products and categories. Essai randomisé mesurant l’efficacité des modifications apportées au tableau de la valeur nutritive sur la compréhension et l’utilisation de l'information nutritionnelle par les adolescents et les jeunes adultes au Canada. Compte tenu des changements proposés à l’étiquetage nutritionnel au Canada et de la rareté des travaux de recherche portant sur la compréhension et l’utilisation des tableaux de la valeur nutritive (tVN) chez les adolescents et les jeunes adultes, notre objectif consistait à réaliser un essai expérimental pour déterminer si les modifications apportées au tVN permettaient d’améliorer efficacement la façon dont les jeunes Canadiens interprètent, comparent et manipulent, sur le plan mathématique, l’information nutritionnelle figurant dans le tVN de denrées préemballées. Une enquête en ligne a été menée auprès d’un échantillon de consommateurs composé de 2 010 Canadiens âgés de 16 à 24 ans. Nous avons réparti les participants de façon aléatoire en six groupes d’étude, et nous avons présenté à chacun des groupes deux des six tVN définis comme conditions expérimentales, selon un plan factoriel 2 x 3 : portion de référence (tVN actuel et portions de référence normalisées pour tous les produits similaires) x pourcentage de la valeur quotidienne (% VQ) (tVN actuel, ajout des descripteurs « faible/moyen/élevé » et ajout d’un code de couleurs). L’enquête comprenait sept tâches consistant à interpréter, comparer et manipuler, sur le plan mathématique, l’information nutritionnelle figurant dans les tVN. Des modèles de régression de Poisson modifiés ont été élaborés pour chacun des trois résultats. La capacité à comparer deux produits similaires s’est révélée significativement meilleure quand le tVN incluait une portion de référence normalisée (p ≤ 0,001 dans tous les cas). L’ajout de descripteurs ou d’un code de couleurs indiquant, sur le tVN, le % VQ pour les calories et les nutriments a amélioré de façon significative la capacité des participants à interpréter correctement l’information à propos de ce % VQ (p ≤ 0,001 dans tous les cas). Le fait de présenter aux participants des portions de référence normalisées et des descripteurs du % VQ a eu un effet modeste sur leur capacité à manipuler, sur le plan mathématique, l’information nutritionnelle pour calculer la valeur nutritive de plusieurs portions d’un produit (ratio relatif = 1,19; intervalle de confiance à 95 % : 1,04 à 1,37). La normalisation des portions de référence et l’ajout d’information sur l’interprétation du % VQ dans le tVN ont permis aux jeunes Canadiens de mieux comprendre et utiliser l’information nutritionnelle. Il faut néanmoins faire preuve de prudence avant de généraliser les résultats de l’enquête à l’ensemble des jeunes Canadiens en raison de l’échantillonnage de la population à l’étude.

694,694,36635734,"The manufacture and production of industrial chemicals continues to increase, with hundreds of thousands of chemicals and chemical mixtures used worldwide, leading to widespread population exposures and resultant health impacts. Low-wealth communities and communities of color often bear disproportionate burdens of exposure and impact; all compounded by regulatory delays to the detriment of public health. Multiple authoritative bodies and scientific consensus groups have called for actions to prevent harmful exposures via improved policy approaches. We worked across multiple disciplines to develop consensus recommendations for health-protective, scientific approaches to reduce harmful chemical exposures, which can be applied to current US policies governing industrial chemicals and environmental pollutants. This consensus identifies five principles and scientific recommendations for improving how agencies like the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approach and conduct hazard and risk assessment and risk management analyses: (1) the financial burden of data generation for any given chemical on (or to be introduced to) the market should be on the chemical producers that benefit from their production and use; (2) lack of data does not equate to lack of hazard, exposure, or risk; (3) populations at greater risk, including those that are more susceptible or more highly exposed, must be better identified and protected to account for their real-world risks; (4) hazard and risk assessments should not assume existence of a ""safe"" or ""no-risk"" level of chemical exposure in the diverse general population; and (5) hazard and risk assessments must evaluate and account for financial conflicts of interest in the body of evidence. While many of these recommendations focus specifically on the EPA, they are general principles for environmental health that could be adopted by any agency or entity engaged in exposure, hazard, and risk assessment. We also detail recommendations for four priority areas in companion papers (exposure assessment methods, human variability assessment, methods for quantifying non-cancer health outcomes, and a framework for defining chemical classes).

He had no other symptoms and his past medical history only included minor child illnesses. His 11-month-old brother had the same dark discoloration of his diapers. Laboratory testing on a spot urine sample showed hyperoxaluria and nephrotic range proteinuria with low creatinine and normal albumin concentrations. Considered causes were hyperoxaluria, alkaptonuria, interfering substance, adulteration. The further diagnostic work-up revealed increased homogentisic acid in urine, compatible with alkaptonuria. Urinary creatinine and total protein measurements on Roche Cobas were, respectively, falsely decreased and increased in the presence of homogentisic acid.

Content of the paracetamol in both syrup formulations has not incurred any change even after a period of 6 months of storage, which showed that these two formulations are appropriate ones. From six different formulations of the paracetamol syrup in percentage of 2.5% (125 mg/5 ml) as more appropriate are: fifth formulation which can be considered, without no doubt, as most appropriate one because of its relatively low cost, an stabilized pH, a quite likeable taste and as such also consequently acceptable in the pediatric practice.

All patients underwent ophthalmic evaluation including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), color vision testing, fundus examination, full-field standard electroretinography (ERG), multifocal (mf) ERG, and SD-OCT. Qualitative and quantitative SD-OCT data and ERG responses were analyzed and compared among the patient categories and the normal control group. There were 4 major categories of SD-OCT findings, based on the status of the ellipsoid portion of the photoreceptor inner segment (ISe), outer segment (OS) contact cylinder, and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layer. Category 0 showed no structural abnormalities. Category 1 showed foveal ISe loss and obscurity of the border between the ISe band and the external limiting membrane (ELM). Category 2 showed foveal thinning and focal foveal ISe disruption with an intact ELM. Category 3 showed foveal thickening and perifoveal disruption of the ISe layer. Category 1 to 3 showed OS contact cylinder layer absence and RPE thickening. The patients in category 0 tended to be younger (mean, 10.0 years) than those in categories 1 to 3 (mean, 17.6 years), although this difference was not statistically significant. Category 1 to 3 patients exhibited statistically significant thinning of the central retina and outer nuclear layer and thickening of the RPE layer relative to the category 0 and normal control group. There was a significant correlation between the central foveal thickness and BCVA in the patients with cone dystrophy. ERG and mfERG responses did not differ significantly among the different cone dystrophy categories. The morphologic features of cone dystrophy as revealed by SD-OCT, could be categorized as either normal or 1 of 3 different types of outer retinal changes. The presence of normal retinal structures in young cone dystrophy patients with functional impairment (category 0) indicates that electrophysiologic studies are superior to current imaging modalities for the early diagnosis of cone dystrophy.

There was good agreement between estimated age interval and factual age at death in 37/51 (72%) of the cases. In eight cases the factual age at death deviated up to +/-5 years from the estimated age, and in six cases by more than 6 years. The average difference between factual age at death and estimated age was 4.5 years. The four subadults in the material were all correctly estimated within an age range of +/-3 years. Our study showed that forensic odontological age estimates are reliable. However, the implementation of the specific methods may need to be adjusted concerning age ranges.

Caregiving quality (HOME) was significantly correlated with MSEL composite performance 1-year posttraining for both the MISC and the UCOBAC trial arms. Likewise, physical growth was significantly related to child development outcomes even though it did not differ between trial arms. Even though MISC demonstrated an advantage of improving caregiving quality, it did not produce better child cognitive outcomes compared with health and nutrition training. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01640561.

Intradural blood could arise by several mechanisms, including the act of removing the dura mater from the calvarium during the autopsy.

Participants consisted of 2195 Black, mixed ancestry (""Colored""), Indian, and White youth, aged 12-17 years old (mean age = 14.6; SD = 1.8), recruited via a multi-stage stratified sampling procedure in Durban, Cape Town, and Johannesburg, South Africa. Data were collected via individual in-person structured interviews, administered by trained interviewers in the participant's preferred language. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the interrelationships of environmental stressors (violent victimisation, legal and illegal drug availability) and low well-being (depressive symptoms, low self-esteem, health problems) with respect to adolescent cigarette smoking and alcohol use. The results supported our hypotheses: Environmental stressors were related to low well-being which, in turn, was linked to both adolescent smoking and alcohol use. There were also direct pathways from environmental stressors to both adolescent smoking and alcohol use. Smoking and alcohol use were significantly correlated. The findings suggest that environmental stressors may be associated with diminished psychological and physical well-being, as well as smoking and alcohol use, among South African adolescents. Longitudinal research is warranted to further understand the interrelationship of environmental stressors, low well-being, and adolescent substance use, so that these issues may be addressed by South African programmes and policies.

721,721,36969097,"Plastics have conveyed great benefits to humanity and made possible some of the most significant advances of modern civilization in fields as diverse as medicine, electronics, aerospace, construction, food packaging, and sports. It is now clear, however, that plastics are also responsible for significant harms to human health, the economy, and the earth's environment. These harms occur at every stage of the plastic life cycle, from extraction of the coal, oil, and gas that are its main feedstocks through to ultimate disposal into the environment. The extent of these harms not been systematically assessed, their magnitude not fully quantified, and their economic costs not comprehensively counted. The goals of this Minderoo-Monaco Commission on Plastics and Human Health are to comprehensively examine plastics' impacts across their life cycle on: (1) human health and well-being; (2) the global environment, especially the ocean; (3) the economy; and (4) vulnerable populations-the poor, minorities, and the world's children. On the basis of this examination, the Commission offers science-based recommendations designed to support development of a Global Plastics Treaty, protect human health, and save lives. This Commission report contains seven Sections. Following an Introduction, Section 2 presents a narrative review of the processes involved in plastic production, use, and disposal and notes the hazards to human health and the environment associated with each of these stages. Section 3 describes plastics' impacts on the ocean and notes the potential for plastic in the ocean to enter the marine food web and result in human exposure. Section 4 details plastics' impacts on human health. Section 5 presents a first-order estimate of plastics' health-related economic costs. Section 6 examines the intersection between plastic, social inequity, and environmental injustice. Section 7 presents the Commission's findings and recommendations. Plastics are complex, highly heterogeneous, synthetic chemical materials. Over 98% of plastics are produced from fossil carbon- coal, oil and gas. Plastics are comprised of a carbon-based polymer backbone and thousands of additional chemicals that are incorporated into polymers to convey specific properties such as color, flexibility, stability, water repellence, flame retardation, and ultraviolet resistance. Many of these added chemicals are highly toxic. They include carcinogens, neurotoxicants and endocrine disruptors such as phthalates, bisphenols, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), brominated flame retardants, and organophosphate flame retardants. They are integral components of plastic and are responsible for many of plastics' harms to human health and the environment.Global plastic production has increased almost exponentially since World War II, and in this time more than 8,300 megatons (Mt) of plastic have been manufactured. Annual production volume has grown from under 2 Mt in 1950 to 460 Mt in 2019, a 230-fold increase, and is on track to triple by 2060. More than half of all plastic ever made has been produced since 2002. Single-use plastics account for 35-40% of current plastic production and represent the most rapidly growing segment of plastic manufacture.Explosive recent growth in plastics production reflects a deliberate pivot by the integrated multinational fossil-carbon corporations that produce coal, oil and gas and that also manufacture plastics. These corporations are reducing their production of fossil fuels and increasing plastics manufacture. The two principal factors responsible for this pivot are decreasing global demand for carbon-based fuels due to increases in 'green' energy, and massive expansion of oil and gas production due to fracking.Plastic manufacture is energy-intensive and contributes significantly to climate change. At present, plastic production is responsible for an estimated 3.7% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the contribution of Brazil. This fraction is projected to increase to 4.5% by 2060 if current trends continue unchecked. The plastic life cycle has three phases: production, use, and disposal. In production, carbon feedstocks-coal, gas, and oil-are transformed through energy-intensive, catalytic processes into a vast array of products. Plastic use occurs in every aspect of modern life and results in widespread human exposure to the chemicals contained in plastic. Single-use plastics constitute the largest portion of current use, followed by synthetic fibers and construction.Plastic disposal is highly inefficient, with recovery and recycling rates below 10% globally. The result is that an estimated 22 Mt of plastic waste enters the environment each year, much of it single-use plastic and are added to the more than 6 gigatons of plastic waste that have accumulated since 1950. Strategies for disposal of plastic waste include controlled and uncontrolled landfilling, open burning, thermal conversion, and export. Vast quantities of plastic waste are exported each year from high-income to low-income countries, where it accumulates in landfills, pollutes air and water, degrades vital ecosystems, befouls beaches and estuaries, and harms human health-environmental injustice on a global scale. Plastic-laden e-waste is particularly problematic. Plastics and plastic-associated chemicals are responsible for widespread pollution. They contaminate aquatic (marine and freshwater), terrestrial, and atmospheric environments globally. The ocean is the ultimate destination for much plastic, and plastics are found throughout the ocean, including coastal regions, the sea surface, the deep sea, and polar sea ice. Many plastics appear to resist breakdown in the ocean and could persist in the global environment for decades. Macro- and micro-plastic particles have been identified in hundreds of marine species in all major taxa, including species consumed by humans. Trophic transfer of microplastic particles and the chemicals within them has been demonstrated. Although microplastic particles themselves (>10 µm) appear not to undergo biomagnification, hydrophobic plastic-associated chemicals bioaccumulate in marine animals and biomagnify in marine food webs. The amounts and fates of smaller microplastic and nanoplastic particles (MNPs <10 µm) in aquatic environments are poorly understood, but the potential for harm is worrying given their mobility in biological systems. Adverse environmental impacts of plastic pollution occur at multiple levels from molecular and biochemical to population and ecosystem. MNP contamination of seafood results in direct, though not well quantified, human exposure to plastics and plastic-associated chemicals. Marine plastic pollution endangers the ocean ecosystems upon which all humanity depends for food, oxygen, livelihood, and well-being. Coal miners, oil workers and gas field workers who extract fossil carbon feedstocks for plastic production suffer increased mortality from traumatic injury, coal workers' pneumoconiosis, silicosis, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. Plastic production workers are at increased risk of leukemia, lymphoma, hepatic angiosarcoma, brain cancer, breast cancer, mesothelioma, neurotoxic injury, and decreased fertility. Workers producing plastic textiles die of bladder cancer, lung cancer, mesothelioma, and interstitial lung disease at increased rates. Plastic recycling workers have increased rates of cardiovascular disease, toxic metal poisoning, neuropathy, and lung cancer. Residents of ""fenceline"" communities adjacent to plastic production and waste disposal sites experience increased risks of premature birth, low birth weight, asthma, childhood leukemia, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer.During use and also in disposal, plastics release toxic chemicals including additives and residual monomers into the environment and into people. National biomonitoring surveys in the USA document population-wide exposures to these chemicals. Plastic additives disrupt endocrine function and increase risk for premature births, neurodevelopmental disorders, male reproductive birth defects, infertility, obesity, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and cancers. Chemical-laden MNPs formed through the environmental degradation of plastic waste can enter living organisms, including humans. Emerging, albeit still incomplete evidence indicates that MNPs may cause toxicity due to their physical and toxicological effects as well as by acting as vectors that transport toxic chemicals and bacterial pathogens into tissues and cells.Infants in the womb and young children are two populations at particularly high risk of plastic-related health effects. Because of the exquisite sensitivity of early development to hazardous chemicals and children's unique patterns of exposure, plastic-associated exposures are linked to increased risks of prematurity, stillbirth, low birth weight, birth defects of the reproductive organs, neurodevelopmental impairment, impaired lung growth, and childhood cancer. Early-life exposures to plastic-associated chemicals also increase the risk of multiple non-communicable diseases later in life. Plastic's harms to human health result in significant economic costs. We estimate that in 2015 the health-related costs of plastic production exceeded $250 billion (2015 Int$) globally, and that in the USA alone the health costs of disease and disability caused by the plastic-associated chemicals PBDE, BPA and DEHP exceeded $920 billion (2015 Int$). Plastic production results in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions equivalent to 1.96 gigatons of carbon dioxide (CO The adverse effects of plastics and plastic pollution on human health, the economy and the environment are not evenly distributed. They disproportionately affect poor, disempowered, and marginalized populations such as workers, racial and ethnic minorities, ""fenceline"" communities, Indigenous groups, women, and children, all of whom had little to do with creating the current plastics crisis and lack the political influence or the resources to address it. Plastics' harmful impacts across its life cycle are most keenly felt in the Global South, in small island states, and in disenfranchised areas in the Global North. Social and environmental justice (SEJ) principles require reversal of these inequitable burdens to ensure that no group bears a disproportionate share of plastics' negative impacts and that those who benefit economically from plastic bear their fair share of its currently externalized costs. It is now clear that current patterns of plastic production, use, and disposal are not sustainable and are responsible for significant harms to human health, the environment, and the economy as well as for deep societal injustices.The main driver of these worsening harms is an almost exponential and still accelerating increase in global plastic production. Plastics' harms are further magnified by low rates of recovery and recycling and by the long persistence of plastic waste in the environment.The thousands of chemicals in plastics-monomers, additives, processing agents, and non-intentionally added substances-include amongst their number known human carcinogens, endocrine disruptors, neurotoxicants, and persistent organic pollutants. These chemicals are responsible for many of plastics' known harms to human and planetary health. The chemicals leach out of plastics, enter the environment, cause pollution, and result in human exposure and disease. All efforts to reduce plastics' hazards must address the hazards of plastic-associated chemicals. To protect human and planetary health, especially the health of vulnerable and at-risk populations, and put the world on track to end plastic pollution by 2040, this Commission supports urgent adoption by the world's nations of a strong and comprehensive Global Plastics Treaty in accord with the mandate set forth in the March 2022 resolution of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA).International measures such as a Global Plastics Treaty are needed to curb plastic production and pollution, because the harms to human health and the environment caused by plastics, plastic-associated chemicals and plastic waste transcend national boundaries, are planetary in their scale, and have disproportionate impacts on the health and well-being of people in the world's poorest nations. Effective implementation of the Global Plastics Treaty will require that international action be coordinated and complemented by interventions at the national, regional, and local levels.This Commission urges that a cap on global plastic production with targets, timetables, and national contributions be a central provision of the Global Plastics Treaty. We recommend inclusion of the following additional provisions:The Treaty needs to extend beyond microplastics and marine litter to include all of the many thousands of chemicals incorporated into plastics.The Treaty needs to include a provision banning or severely restricting manufacture and use of unnecessary, avoidable, and problematic plastic items, especially single-use items such as manufactured plastic microbeads.The Treaty needs to include requirements on extended producer responsibility (EPR) that make fossil carbon producers, plastic producers, and the manufacturers of plastic products legally and financially responsible for the safety and end-of-life management of all the materials they produce and sell.The Treaty needs to mandate reductions in the chemical complexity of plastic products; health-protective standards for plastics and plastic additives; a requirement for use of sustainable non-toxic materials; full disclosure of all components; and traceability of components. International cooperation will be essential to implementing and enforcing these standards.The Treaty needs to include SEJ remedies at each stage of the plastic life cycle designed to fill gaps in community knowledge and advance both distributional and procedural equity.This Commission encourages inclusion in the Global Plastic Treaty of a provision calling for exploration of listing at least some plastic polymers as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) under the Stockholm Convention.This Commission encourages a strong interface between the Global Plastics Treaty and the Basel and London Conventions to enhance management of hazardous plastic waste and slow current massive exports of plastic waste into the world's least-developed countries.This Commission recommends the creation of a Permanent Science Policy Advisory Body to guide the Treaty's implementation. The main priorities of this Body would be to guide Member States and other stakeholders in evaluating which solutions are most effective in reducing plastic consumption, enhancing plastic waste recovery and recycling, and curbing the generation of plastic waste. This Body could also assess trade-offs among these solutions and evaluate safer alternatives to current plastics. It could monitor the transnational export of plastic waste. It could coordinate robust oceanic-, land-, and air-based MNP monitoring programs.This Commission recommends urgent investment by national governments in research into solutions to the global plastic crisis. This research will need to determine which solutions are most effective and cost-effective in the context of particular countries and assess the risks and benefits of proposed solutions. Oceanographic and environmental research is needed to better measure concentrations and impacts of plastics <10 µm and understand their distribution and fate in the global environment. Biomedical research is needed to elucidate the human health impacts of plastics, especially MNPs. This Commission finds that plastics are both a boon to humanity and a stealth threat to human and planetary health. Plastics convey enormous benefits, but current linear patterns of plastic production, use, and disposal that pay little attention to sustainable design or safe materials and a near absence of recovery, reuse, and recycling are responsible for grave harms to health, widespread environmental damage, great economic costs, and deep societal injustices. These harms are rapidly worsening.While there remain gaps in knowledge about plastics' harms and uncertainties about their full magnitude, the evidence available today demonstrates unequivocally that these impacts are great and that they will increase in severity in the absence of urgent and effective intervention at global scale. Manufacture and use of essential plastics may continue. However, reckless increases in plastic production, and especially increases in the manufacture of an ever-increasing array of unnecessary single-use plastic products, need to be curbed.Global intervention against the plastic crisis is needed now because the costs of failure to act will be immense.

Measures of rapid automatic naming (RAN) have been used for over 50 years to capture aspects of vision and cognition. MULES was designed as a series of 54 grouped color photographs (fruits, random objects, animals) that integrates saccades, color perception and contextual object identification. We examined MULES performance in youth, collegiate and professional athletes at pre-season baseline and at the sidelines following concussion. Our study teams administered the MULES to youth, collegiate and professional athletes during pre-season baseline testing. Sideline post-concussion time scores were compared to pre-season baseline scores among athletes with concussion to determine degrees and directions of change.

Significant interactions existed between race/ethnicity and the COVID-19 SHO period for intent (p < 0.001) and mechanism of injury (p < 0.001). There was also significant interaction between SVI and the COVID-19 SHO period for mechanism of injury (p = 0.01). Children of color experienced a significant increase in intentional (COVID 16.4% vs. Control 13.7%, p = 0.03) and firearm (COVID 9.0% vs. Control 5.2%, p < 0.001) injuries, but no change was seen among White children. Children from the most vulnerable neighborhoods suffered an increase in firearm injuries (COVID 11.1% vs. Control 6.1%, p = 0.001) with children from the least vulnerable neighborhoods having no change. All-terrain vehicle (ATV) and bicycle crashes increased for children of color (COVID 2.0% vs. Control 1.1%, p = 0.04 for ATV; COVID 6.7% vs. Control 4.8%, p = 0.02 for bicycle) and White children (COVID 9.6% vs. Control 6.2%, p < 0.001 for ATV; COVID 8.8% vs. Control 5.8%, p < 0.001 for bicycle). In contrast to White children and children from neighborhoods of lower vulnerability, children of color and children living in higher vulnerability neighborhoods experienced an increase in intentional and firearm-related injuries during the COVID-19 pandemic.

724,724,33242333,"To what extent do characteristics of germline genome editing (GGE) determine whether the general public supports permitting the clinical use of GGE? The risk that GGE would cause congenital abnormalities had the largest effect on support for allowing GGE, followed by effectiveness of GGE, while costs, the type of application (disease or enhancement) and the effect on child well-being had moderate effects. Scientific progress on GGE has increased the urgency of resolving whether and when clinical application of GGE may be ethically acceptable. Various expert bodies have suggested that the treatment characteristics will be key in determining whether GGE is acceptable. For example, GGE with substantial risks (e.g. 15% chance of a major congenital abnormality) may be acceptable to prevent a severe disease but not to enhance non-medical characteristics or traits of an otherwise healthy embryo (e.g. eye colour or perhaps in the future more complex traits, such as intelligence). While experts have called for public engagement, it is unclear whether and how much the public acceptability of GGE is affected by the treatment characteristics proposed by experts. The vignette-based survey was disseminated in 2018 among 1857 members of the Dutch general public. An online research panel was used to recruit a sample representing the adult Dutch general public. A literature review identified the key treatment characteristics of GGE: the effect on the well-being of the future child, use for disease or enhancement, risks for the future child, effectiveness (here defined as the chance of a live birth, assuming that if the GGE was not successful, the embryo would not be transferred), cost and availability of alternative treatments/procedures to prevent the genetic disease or provide enhancement (i.e. preimplantation genetic testing (PGT)), respectively. For each treatment characteristic, 2-3 levels were defined to realistically represent GGE and its current alternatives, donor gametes and ICSI with PGT. Twelve vignettes were created by fractional factorial design. A multinominal logit model assessed how much each treatment characteristic affected participants' choices. The 1136 respondents (response rate 61%) were representative of the Dutch adult population in several demographics. Respondents were between 18 and 89 years of age. When no alternative treatment/procedure is available, the risk that GGE would cause (other) congenital abnormalities had the largest effect on whether the Dutch public supported allowing GGE (coefficient = -3.07), followed by effectiveness (coefficient = 2.03). Costs (covered by national insurance, coefficient = -1.14), the type of application (disease or enhancement; coefficient = -1.07), and the effect on child well-being (coefficient = 0.97) had similar effects on whether GGE should be allowed. If an alternative treatment/procedure (e.g. PGT) was available, participants were not categorically opposed to GGE, however, they were strongly opposed to using GGE for enhancement (coefficient = -3.37). The general acceptability of GGE was higher than participants' willingness to personally use it (P < 0.001). When participants considered whether they would personally use GGE, the type of application (disease or enhancement) was more important, whereas effectiveness and costs (covered by national insurance) were less important than when they considered whether GGE should be allowed. Participants who were male, younger and had lower incomes were more likely to allow GGE when no alternative treatment/procedure is available. Some (e.g. ethnic, religious) minorities were not well represented. To limit complexity, not all characteristics of GGE could be included (e.g. out-of-pocket costs), therefore, the views gathered from the vignettes reflect only the choices presented to the respondents. The non-included characteristics could be connected to and alter the importance of the studied characteristics. This would affect how closely the reported coefficients reflect 'real-life' importance. This study is the first to quantify the substantial impact of GGE's effectiveness, costs (covered by national insurance), and effect on child well-being on whether the public considered GGE acceptable. In general, the participants were strikingly risk-averse, in that they weighed the risks of GGE more heavily than its benefits. Furthermore, although only a single study in one country, the results suggests that-if sufficiently safe and effective-the public may approve of using GGE (presumably combined with PGT) instead of solely PGT to prevent passing on a disease. The reported public views can serve as input for future consideration of the ethics and governance of GGE.

725,725,15467410,"The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of perfusion imaging of the brain using the Z-score and subtraction dynamic images obtained from susceptibility contrast MR images. Five patients, each with a normal MRI, Moya-moya, a middle cerebral artery occlusion, post-trauma syndrome, and a metastatic brain tumor, were selected for a presentation. A susceptibility-contrast echo-planar image after a routine MRI was taken as the source image with a rapid manual injection of 0.1 mmol/kg of Gd-DTPA. The inflow and washout patterns were observed from the time-signal intensity curve of the serial scans using the standard program of an MRI machine. The repeated Z-score images of the peak and late phases were made using the threshold Z-score values between 1.4 and 2.0 in four to five studies of the pre-contrast, peak, and late phases. Dynamic subtraction images were produced by subtracting sequential post-contrast images from a pre-contrast image and coloring these images using a pseudocolor mapping method. In the diseases with perfusion abnormalities, the Z-score images revealed information about the degree of perfusion during the peak and late phases. However, the quality varied with the Z-score threshold and the studies selected in a group. The dynamic subtraction images were of sufficient quality with no background noise and more clearly illustrated the temporal changes in perfusion and delayed perfusion. The Z-scores and dynamic subtraction images illustrated the degree of perfusion and sequential changes in the pattern of perfusion, respectively. These images can be used as a new complimentary method for observing the perfusion patterns in brain diseases.

Topographic maps of most components in aged subjects were significantly different from those in young subjects, mainly because of higher amplitudes of the components in the aged group. This difference was particularly significant for later components with the peak latencies of longer than 40 ms. Gender and stimulus side caused no significant differences in amplitude and topography of the components. Therefore, for clinical application of topographic maps of median nerve SEPs, a difference of gender and stimulus side could be disregarded, but it is necessary to consider the age effect.

Participants were subdivided into six groups depending on their age, ranging from 8 to 83 years. We analyzed response speed and accuracy as well as the event replated potential (ERP) components P1 and N1, associated with visual processing and attention, N2 as marker of interference suppression and cognitive control, and P3 as a marker of cognitive updating and stimulus categorization. Response speed and accuracy were low early and later in life, with peak performance in young adults. Similarly, ERP latencies of all components and P1 and N1 amplitudes followed a u-shape pattern with shortest latencies and smallest amplitudes occurring in middle-age. N2 amplitudes were larger in children, and for incongruent stimuli in adults middle-aged and older. P3 amplitudes showed a parietal-to-frontal shift with age. Further, group-wise regression analyses suggested that children's performance depended on cognitive processing speed, while older adults' performance depended on cognitive resources. Together these results imply that different mechanisms restrict performance early and late in life and suggest a non-linear relationship between electrophysiological markers and performance in the Flanker task across the lifespan.

The purpose of this study was to report the clinical characteristics and optical coherence tomography (OCT) in patients with focal foveal atrophy of unknown etiology. The study was a retrospective observational case series. Data collected included complete ocular examination results for best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), ophthalmoscopy, fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, color sense discrimination tests, visual field tests, and OCT examinations. Twenty-three eyes in 21 patients were examined. The mean patient age was 49.2 ± 15.4 years. The mean BCVA was 20/25. The 21 patients were divided into three groups according to OCT results. Group 1 eyes (n = 10) had intact inner and outer hyperreflective layers (HRLs), with the signal of the inner HRL corresponding to the junction between the inner and outer photoreceptor segments and the outer HRL corresponding to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Group 2 eyes (n = 9) had small hyporeflective defects with defects in the inner HRL at the fovea but an intact outer HRL. Group 3 eyes (n = 4) had small hyporeflective defects in both the inner and outer HRLs at the fovea. Groups 3 eyes had significantly lower visual acuity compared to Group 1 eyes and Group 2 eyes. There was no significant difference in visual acuity between Group 1 and Group 2 eyes. There were no significant differences among the groups with respect to color vision or foveal thickness. This is the first report of clinical presentations for patients with focal foveal atrophy of unknown etiology.

This study was designed to extend research on the application of the Delboeuf illusion to food on a plate by testing whether a plate's rim width and coloring influence perceptual bias to affect perceived food portion size. Within-subjects experimental design. Experiment 1 tested the effect of rim width on perceived food portion size. Experiment 2 tested the effect of rim coloring on perceived food portion size. In both experiments, participants observed a series of photographic images of paired, side-by-side plates varying in designs and amounts of food. From each pair, participants were asked to select the plate that contained more food. Multilevel logistic regression examined the effects of rim width and coloring on perceived food portion size. Experiment 1: participants overestimated the diameter of food portions by 5% and the visual area of food portions by 10% on plates with wider rims compared with plates with very thin rims (P<0.0001). The effect of rim width was greater with larger food portion sizes. Experiment 2: participants overestimated the diameter of food portions by 1.5% and the visual area of food portions by 3% on plates with rim coloring compared with plates with no coloring (P=0.01). The effect of rim coloring was greater with smaller food portion sizes. The Delboeuf illusion applies to food on a plate.

In group 1. dreams of patients who received suggestions, and in group 2, those of the control group of patients who did not. The incidence of dream reports and the characteristics and the theme of the reported dreams were compared among the groups. In general, the control and the psychological intervention groups were different in terms of dreaming frequency, and non-recall dreaming. The incidence of dream reports was significantly higher in the suggestion group (82/190 at 10 min and 71/190 at 60 min respectively) than in the control group (16/80 at 10 min and 13/80 at 60 min, respectively; p10 = 0.001 and p60 = 0.002). There were no differences in the nature (thought- like or cinematic), quality (color or B&W) and the mood (positive vs. negative) of the recalled dreams.

743,743,36563876,"Globally, rates of youth suicide vary considerably. Suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) are consistently associated with risk of death by suicide. However, international trends in STB have not yet been compared. To address this gap, an international meta-analysis of epidemiological and school-based studies that report on STB in youth was conducted. Systematic searches were conducted in PubMed and PsycINFO through April 2022. Eligible studies included prevalence of active suicidal ideation (SI) or suicide attempts (SA) in community youth younger than age 22. All studies were coded by 2 authors. Mixed models accounting for shared methods and including hypothesized moderators were conducted using the metafor package in R. There were 371 effect sizes for SI, 94 for SI with a plan, and 316 for SA, representing 149 regions. Year of data collection ranged from 1981 to 2021. Participants were 6 to 21 years old. The prevalence of SI ranged across regions from 14.3% to 22.6%; the prevalence of SA ranged from 4.6% to 15.8%. Year was not associated with increasing STB prevalence except for studies from the United States, which showed increasing rates of SI and SA since 2007. This is the most comprehensive meta-analysis of STB in youth, providing valuable data about how risk factors most commonly associated with suicide vary internationally and over time. International rates of STB among youth are not improving and may be getting worse in the United States, despite efforts to reduce suicide risk. Most studies did not report rates of SI or SA separately for LGBTQIA+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, and others) youth and youth of color.

Dermoid cysts may occur in the orbital and periorbital region in paediatric patients and are often recurrent. The surgical approach depends upon the site of the lesion, superficial or deep. To our knowledge, this is the first described case of a patient with resection of dermoid cyst treated with human amniotic membrane implant and topical application of 0.02% mitomycin C. We present a case of a 12-year-old male with a tumour in the superotemporal region of the right eye (RE). Symptoms included decreased visual acuity (VA), burning eye, foreign body sensation, and photophobia of the affected eye. A physical examination detected blepharospasm. Ophthalmic examination of his RE, fingers count from a 1-2 m distance, showed no improvement with pinhole. Visual acuity was 20/20 on the left eye (LE). The bio-microscopic examination confirmed the presence of a tumour mass (15 mm × 12 mm) on the surface of the RE, invading the superotemporal sector. The tumour had a lobulated appearance, a shiny and vascularized surface covered by conjunctiva, a pearlescent-pink colour, a medium consistency, was renitent and painless. An ultrasound scan revealed atrophy of the pigmented retinal epithelium with scleral indentation of the RE. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a recurrent lesion consistent with an epibulbar dermoid cyst. Surgical excision of the lesion was performed and a human amniotic membrane (HAM) graft and topical 0.02% mitomycin C (MMC) were applied.

A school-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February 21 to March 31, 2016. A total of 735 school children were included in the study. A stratified multistage sampling followed by systematic sampling technique was employed to select the study participants. Thyroid physical examination was done and classified according to the World Health Organization recommendations as grade 0, grade 1, and grade 2. The level of salt iodine content was determined using the rapid field test kit. The value 0 parts per million (PPM), <15 PPM and ≥15 PPM with the corresponding color chart on the rapid test kit were used to classify the level of iodine in the sampled salt. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was employed to identify factors associated with goiter. Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) was calculated to show the strength of association. In multivariable analysis, variables with a P-value of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. In this community, the overall prevalence of goiter was 29.1% [95% CI: 25.9, 32.6], in which about 22.4 and 6.7% had goiter grade 1 and grade 2, respectively.

Children with TLE exhibited executive dysfunction on D-KEFS testing, reduced N-back accuracy, and increased N-back reaction time compared with healthy controls; D-KEFS and N-back behavioral findings were significantly correlated. Children with TLE also exhibited significant reduction in activation of the frontal lobe within the executive control network compared to healthy controls. These alterations were significantly correlated with N-back behavioral findings and D-KEFS testing. Children with TLE exhibit executive dysfunction, which correlates with executive control network alterations.

Results Among the 93 patients, 36 (38.7%) had proven appendicitis (mean PSV, 19.7 cm/sec; mean RI, 0.69) and 57 patients (61.2%) did not (mean PSV, 7.1 cm/sec, P < .0001; mean RI, 0.50, P < .0001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the diagnosis of appendicitis was 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.95, 1.00) for PSV and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.95; P = .011) for RI. Chosen discriminatory criteria of PSV greater than 10 cm/sec and RI greater than 0.65 yielded specificity for appendicitis of 94.7% and 96.5% with sensitivity of 88.9% and 63.9% (P = .013) and negative predictive value of 93.1% and 80.9% (P = .045), respectively. Original clinical graded compression US interpretations based on established US findings demonstrated specificity of 96.2% and sensitivity of 100.0%. Considering the subset of 20 patients whose maximum outer diameter measured 6-8 mm, the discriminatory criteria of PSV greater than 10 cm/sec and RI greater than 0.65 yielded specificity for appendicitis of 88.9% each, with sensitivity of 100.0% and 63.6% and negative predictive value of 100.0% and 66.6%, respectively. Conclusion In patients with visualized appendices at US, those with appendicitis exhibit significantly higher point PSV and point RI values than do patients without appendicitis and are distinguishable with high specificity by using a PSV greater than 10 cm/sec and an RI greater than 0.65 as diagnostic criteria.

755,755,33600256,"Robust data from longitudinal birth cohort studies and experimental studies of perinatally exposed animals indicate that exposure to ortho-phthalates can impair brain development and increase risks for learning, attention, and behavioral disorders in childhood. This growing body of evidence, along with known adverse effects on male reproductive tract development, calls for immediate action.Exposures are ubiquitous; the majority of people are exposed to multiple ortho-phthalates simultaneously. We thus recommend that a class approach be used in assessing health impacts as has been done with other chemical classes. We propose critically needed policy reforms to eliminate ortho-phthalates from products that lead to exposure of pregnant women, women of reproductive age, infants, and children. Specific attention should be focused on reducing exposures among socially vulnerable populations such as communities of color, who frequently experience higher exposures.Ortho-phthalates are used in a vast array of products and elimination will thus necessitate a multipronged regulatory approach at federal and state levels. The fact that manufacturers and retailers have already voluntarily removed ortho-phthalates from a wide range of products indicates that this goal is feasible.

Prospective observational case series. Eighty-nine patients seen by the UK Nationally Commissioned XP Service, from April 2010 to December 2014, with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of XP. Patients underwent a full ophthalmic examination at each visit. Clinical features from both eyes were recorded on a standard proforma. The most recent assessments were analyzed. A 2-tailed Fisher exact test was used to assess for differences in ocular features between patients in XP subgroups with impaired transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) (category 1: XP-A, B, D, F, and G) and preserved TC-NER (category 2: XP-C, E, and V). Lid and periocular abnormalities, ocular surface pathologies, neuro-ophthalmologic abnormalities, lens and retinal abnormalities, and visual acuity (VA). Ninety-three percent of XP patients in our cohort had ocular involvement, with 65% describing photophobia. The most common abnormalities were in the periocular skin and ocular surface, including interpalpebral conjunctival melanosis (44%) and conjunctival injection (43%). Eleven percent of patients had required treatment for periocular cancers and 2% for ocular surface cancers. The most common neuro-ophthalmologic finding was minimal pupillary reaction to light (25%). Patients in category 2 had significantly more ocular surface abnormalities than patients in category 1, including a greater proportion of conjunctival injection (P = 0.003), conjunctival corkscrew vessels (P < 0.001), corneal scarring (P = 0.01) and pingueculae under the age of 50 (P = 0.02). Meanwhile, patients in category 1 had a higher proportion of poorly reactive pupils (P < 0.001) and abnormal ocular movements (P = 0.03) compared with those in category 2. Five patients (6%) presented to ophthalmologists with ocular surface signs related to XP, before any formal diagnosis of XP was made. A large proportion of XP patients have ocular involvement. Regular examination by an ophthalmologist is essential, especially in screening for eyelid and ocular surface tumors. The ocular phenotype-genotype segregation within XP patients suggests that XP is a heterogeneous and complex disease. With further study, we hope to offer these patients more individualized patient care.

A total of 179 masses in 169 subjects were included. The malignancy rate was 10.6%. The AUC for the VSTVS was 0.919. A VSTVS cut-off value of 4 achieved a sensitivity of 79% (95% CI 0.54-0.93), specificity of 88% (95% CI 0.82-0.93), PPV of 0.44 (95% CI 0.33-0.56), NPV of 0.97 (95% CI 0.94-0.99), LR+ of 6.77 (95% CI 4.18-10.97), and LR- of 0.24 (95% CI 0.10-0.57).

Twenty-four patients (18 women and 6 men; mean age, 49.7 years; range, 9-77 years) diagnosed with GM and treated with castellani solution were enrolled retrospectively. Topical treatment using castellani solution with or without curettage of a granular lesion and serial otoendoscopy-aided photographic documentation of the tympanic membrane were performed. Outpatient follow-up period ranged from 3 to 72 months and the mean follow-up period was 14.4 months. GM was classified into marginal/non-marginal type and ulcerative/polypoid subtype using a new scale. According to the scale used in this study, the marginal and ulcerative GM was the predominant type of GM lesion. Bacterial cultures of ear discharges from 19 patients revealed Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium and Providencia stuartii in 12, 5, and 1 patient, respectively and no growth of bacteria in one patient. Of 24 patients, 23 showed complete resolution of GM after treatment with castellani solution. However, one patient had a persistent, small, dry, deepithelialized lesion and eight others required more than 3 months for complete recovery owing to a persistent residual lesion. There was recurrence in two patients but the lesion resolved after additional castellani treatment. Topical application of castellani solution is a simple and effective treatment for GM. This study suggests a potential of castellani solution for treatment of GM with a serial photographic documentation and novel classification scale for description of lesions.

762,762,34440389,"Down syndrome (DS) is one of the most complex genetic disorders in humans and a leading genetic cause of developmental delays and intellectual disabilities. The mouse remains an essential model organism in DS research because human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) is orthologously conserved with three regions in the mouse genome. Recent studies have revealed complex interactions among different triplicated genomic regions and Hsa21 gene orthologs that underlie major DS phenotypes. Because we do not know conclusively which triplicated genes are indispensable in such interactions for a specific phenotype, it is desirable that all evolutionarily conserved Hsa21 gene orthologs are triplicated in a complete model. For this reason, the Dp(10)1Yey/+;Dp(16)1Yey/+;Dp(17)1Yey/+ mouse is the most complete model of DS to reflect gene dosage effects because it is the only mutant triplicated for all Hsa21 orthologous regions. Recently, several groups have expressed concerns that efforts needed to generate the triple compound model would be so overwhelming that it may be impractical to take advantage of its unique strength. To alleviate these concerns, we developed a strategy to drastically improve the efficiency of generating the triple compound model with the aid of a targeted coat color, and the results confirmed that the mutant mice generated via this approach exhibited cognitive deficits.

The aim of this study was to independently validate the diagnostic accuracy of surface topography (ST) classification trees to identify curve severity and progression using a new sample of data in participants with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Radiographs for diagnosing and monitoring AIS involve harmful radiation exposure repeated at successive clinical visits. Classification trees using a novel ST technique have been proposed to determine curve severity and progression noninvasively that could be used to monitor scoliosis. Forty-five adolescents with AIS treated nonoperatively, with ST scans and radiographs at baseline and follow-up (1 year later), were recruited from a scoliosis clinic. The Cobb angle (CA) from radiographs determined curve severity as mild (10° < CA < 25°) or moderate/severe (CA ≥ 25°) and progression as an increase >5°.ST scans were analyzed to calculate the best plane of symmetry and associated deviation color map. Root mean squares and maximum deviation were calculated for each area of asymmetry. ST measurements were analyzed using two published decision trees developed to maximize sensitivity and negative predictive value. Curves were classified as mild or moderate/severe and curve progression was predicted. Accuracy statistics were calculated to evaluate performance. For curve severity, sensitivity and specificity were 95% and 35%, respectively. Negative and positive predictive values were 90% and 53%, respectively, with an accuracy of 61%. For curve progression, sensitivity and specificity were 73% and 44%, respectively. Negative and positive predictive values were 83% and 30%, respectively, with an accuracy of 51%. Assuming that mild and nonprogressive curves would not require an x-ray, the use of ST decision trees could eliminate 31% of x-rays.

771,771,33441756,"Skin pigmentation is associated with skin damages and skin cancers, and ultraviolet (UV) photography is used as a minimally invasive mean for the assessment of pigmentation. Since UV photography equipment is not usually available in general practice, technologies emphasizing pigmentation in color photo images are desired for daily care. We propose a new method using conditional generative adversarial networks, named UV-photo Net, to generate synthetic UV images from color photo images. Evaluations using color and UV photo image pairs taken by a UV photography system demonstrated that pigment spots were well reproduced in synthetic UV images by UV-photo Net, and some of the reproduced pigment spots were difficult to be recognized in color photo images. In the pigment spot detection analysis, the rate of pigment spot areas in cheek regions for synthetic UV images was highly correlated with the rate for UV photo images (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.92). We also demonstrated that UV-photo Net was effective for floating up pigment spots for photo images taken by a smartphone camera. UV-photo Net enables an easy assessment of pigmentation from color photo images and will promote self-care of skin damages and early signs of skin cancers for preventive medicine.

Patients were eligible for inclusion in this study if they presented to the ED with either suspected overdose or unexplained metabolic acidosis. One milliliter of the patient's urine was added to 1 mL of each of the two reagents. A positive test was defined as any darkening of the color of the reagent. Each patient had a quantitative serum ASA measured. Twenty of 180 patients (11%) had quantitative serum ASA levels above 5 mg/dL. Both reagents were 100% sensitive in identifying these patients. The specificity of FC was 71% compared with 73% for TR. The two reagents gave similar results in 91% of cases. Both FC and TR are reliable in detecting ASA in the urine of patients presenting with suspected drug overdose.

We report two case studies involving the persistent regrowth of white hair after AA that became pigmented through treatment. In the first case study, a 47-year-old woman with AA exhibited a fully regrown head of hair, which remained unpigmented.

The series consisted of 30 pediatric PTC younger than 18 years of age at the time of diagnosis and 15 matched lymph node metastases (LNM). Primary tumors and matched LNM were screened for the presence of the AGK-BRAF fusion transcript by RT-PCR. To confirm the identity of the amplified products, randomly selected samples positive for the presence of the fusion transcripts were sequenced. Moreover, BRAF dual-color, break-apart probes confirmed BRAF rearrangement. Overall, the AGK-BRAF fusion gene was detected in 10% (3/30) of primary tumors. For one of these cases, paired LNM was also available, which also shows the presence of AGK-BRAF fusion gene.

In this study, the accuracy of two-dimensional echocardiography combined with color Doppler flow mapping to assess the size, stenosis, and atresia of the major PA branches was examined using a new parasternal approach. With the use of right and left high parasternal windows, we visualized each of the major portions along the right (R-PA) and left (L-PA) pulmonary arteries in 45 of the 47 examinations (96%) in 38 patients with cyanotic heart disease. The patients were between 13 days and 20 years old (mean age, 2.9 years). The internal diameters of the major PA branches were measured at three points along the R-PA (the proximal, mid, and distal portions) and at the proximal and distal portions on the L-PA in systole by both two-dimensional echocardiography and angiography. In addition, the diameter of the stenosis in the PA branch was measured. These PA values as determined by two-dimensional echocardiography correlated well with those obtained by angiography (r = .95 to .97). By two-dimensional echocardiography with color Doppler flow mapping, 17 of 19 lesions with stenoses or atresia of the major PA branches were predicted as defined by angiography (sensitivity, 89.5%; specificity, 100%). Differences between the distal parts of the L-PA and R-PA of > 30% in diameter were determined by angiography in 15 examinations and by two-dimensional echocardiography in 12 examinations (sensitivity, 80%; specificity, 97.4%).

789,789,37534527,"Diagnostic criteria for juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) are currently well defined, however in some patients diagnosis still remains a challenge. Flow cytometry is a well established tool for diagnosis and follow-up of hematological malignancies, nevertheless it is not routinely used for JMML diagnosis. Herewith, we characterized the CD34+ hematopoietic precursor cells collected from 31 children with JMML using a combination of standardized EuroFlow antibody panels to assess the ability to discriminate JMML cells from normal/reactive bone marrow cell as controls (n=29) or from cells of children with other hematological diseases mimicking JMML (n=9). CD34+ precursors in JMML showed markedly reduced B-cell and erythroid-committed precursors compared to controls, whereas monocytic and CD7+ lymphoid precursors were significantly expanded. Moreover, aberrant immunophenotypes were consistently present in CD34+ precursors in JMML, while they were virtually absent in controls. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that combined assessment of the number of CD34+CD7+ lymphoid precursors and CD34+ aberrant precursors or erythroid precursors had a great potential in discriminating JMMLs versus controls. Importantly our scoring model allowed highly efficient discrimination of truly JMML versus patients with JMML-like diseases. In conclusion, we show for the first time that CD34+ precursors from JMML patients display a unique immunophenotypic profile which might contribute to a fast and accurate diagnosis of JMML worldwide by applying an easy to standardize single eight-color antibody combination.

792,792,10597672,"In cases of microtia with a low hairline, the manner in which hair is removed from the reconstructed auricle must be taken into consideration. This is one of the most common but difficult problems with reconstruction for microtia. The authors describe a new technique that uses a simple regional flap to resolve this problem. The hair-bearing skin in the estimated auricular region and its covering are removed using a local flap from the hairless mastoid region. This is done in the first stage of auricular reconstruction, the costal cartilage grafting is done in the second stage, and elevation of the auricle is done in the last stage. In 38 auricles of 36 patients who were treated from 1993 to 1995, eight auricles of eight patients were treated with this technique. In all cases, the hairless flap healed well, without vascular stasis or skin necrosis. In addition, no complications from using this technique occurred in the later stages of auricular reconstruction. With this technique, the skin of the flap provides a good texture and color match to the auricle. In addition, the skin of the flap has good elasticity for the cutaneous pocket for cartilage grafting. The harvested area of the flap can be hidden behind the reconstructed auricle. The authors initially wondered whether the marginal scar of the transposed flap's position in the auricle would be conspicuous. However, all of the scar became inconspicuous because it was positioned in the scaphoid fossa.

Rusty pipe syndrome is a rare cause of benign, self-limiting bloody nipple discharge during late pregnancy and early lactation. Given that rusty pipe syndrome is not described in conventional textbooks, we thought it would be appropriate to bring this benign disease to the notice of readers. A 31-year-old G1P1 female delivered an infant with a birth weight of 3000 g via cesarean section at 39 weeks of gestation. The baby was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for a suspected oblique inguinal hernia. The mother had bilateral painless bloody nipple discharge when she started to express milk. A physical examination uncovered no signs of inflammation, engorgement, palpable mass, tenderness, cracks or ulcers. A breast ultrasound and cytological analysis revealed no signs of a neoplasm. Without any medical intervention, the color of the rusty milk changed from dark brown to light brown during hospitalization and finally resolved six days postpartum. Rusty pipe syndrome is a self-limiting benign condition that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of bloody nipple discharge.

The use of chromatic VEPs (cVEPs) in addition to standard VEPs can inform us of the function or dysfunction of chromatic pathways. The chromatic VEP has been well studied in human health and disease. Yet, to date our knowledge of their underlying mechanisms and applications remains limited. This likely reflects a heterogeneity in the methodology, analysis and conclusions of different works, which leads to ambiguity in their clinical use. This review sought to identify the primary methodologies employed for recording cVEPs. Furthermore cVEP maturation and application in understanding the function of the chromatic system under healthy and diseased conditions are reviewed.

Grading was performed using morphologic findings obtained by ultra high-resolution spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was calculated for different grades. Observational case series. Sixty-nine patients with foveal hypoplasia (albinism, n = 34; PAX6 mutations, n = 10; isolated cases, n = 14; achromatopsia, n = 11) and 65 control subjects were examined. A 7×7-mm retinal area was sampled using a 3-dimensional scanning protocol (743×75, A scans×B scans) with ultra high-resolution spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SOCT Copernicus HR; 3-μm axial resolution). Gross morphologic abnormalities were documented. B-scans at the fovea were segmented using a longitudinal reflectivity profile. Logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution BCVA was obtained. Grading was based on presence or absence of foveal pit and widening of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and outer segment (OS) at the fovea. Quantitative measurements were obtained for comparing atypical foveal hypoplasia in achromatopsia. Best-corrected visual acuity was compared with the grade of foveal hypoplasia. Four grades of foveal hypoplasia were distinguished: grade 1, shallow foveal pit, presence of ONL widening, presence of OS lengthening; grade 2, grade 1 but absence of foveal pit; grade 3, grade 2 but absence of OS lengthening; grade 4, grade 3 but absence of ONL widening. There was significant difference in visual acuity (VA) associated with each grade (P<0.0001). Grade 1 was associated with the best VA (median VA, 0.2), whereas grades 2, 3, and 4 were associated with progressively poorer VA with a median VA of 0.44, 0.60, and 0.78, respectively. The atypical features seen with foveal hypoplasia associated with achromatopsia were characterized by decreased retinal and ONL thickness and deeper foveal depth. A structural grading system for foveal hypoplasia was developed based on the stage at which foveal development was arrested, which helps to provide a prognostic indicator for VA and is applicable in a range of disorders associated with foveal hypoplasia.

The rights to bodily autonomy and consent are core components of high-quality health care. To assess experiences of coercion and nonconsent for procedures during perinatal care among racialized service users in the United States, we analyzed data from the Giving Voice to Mothers (GVtM-US) study. In a subset analysis of the full sample of 2700, we examined survey responses for participants who described the experience of pressure or nonconsented procedures or intervention during perinatal care. We conducted multivariable logistic regression analyses by racial and ethnic identity for the outcomes: pressure to have perinatal procedures (eg, induction, epidurals, episiotomy, fetal monitoring), nonconsented procedures performed during perinatal care, pressure to have a cesarean birth, and nonconsented procedures during vaginal births. Among participants (n = 2490), 34% self-identified as BIPOC, and 37% had a planned hospital birth. Overall, we found significant differences in pressure and nonconsented perinatal procedures by racial and ethnic identity. These inequities persisted even after controlling for contextual factors, such as birthplace, practitioner type, and prenatal care context. For example, more participants with Black racial identity experienced nonconsented procedures during perinatal care (AOR 1.89, 95% CI 1.35-2.64) and vaginal births (AOR 1.87, 95% CI 1.23-2.83) than those identifying as white. In addition, people who identified as other minoritized racial and ethnic identities reported experiencing more pressure to accept perinatal procedures (AOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.08-2.20) than those who were white. There is a need to address human rights violations in perinatal care for all birthing people with particular attention to the needs of those identifying as BIPOC. By eliminating mistreatment in perinatal care, such as pressure to accept services and nonconsented procedures, we can help mitigate long-standing inequities.

804,804,37740440,"Presence of minimal residual disease (MRD), detected by flow cytometry, is an important prognostic biomarker in the management of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). However, data-analysis remains mainly expert-dependent. In this study, we designed and validated an Automated Gating & Identification (AGI) tool for MRD analysis in BCP-ALL patients using the two tubes of the EuroFlow 8-color MRD panel. The accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility of the AGI tool was validated in a multicenter study using bone marrow follow-up samples from 174 BCP-ALL patients, stained with the EuroFlow BCP-ALL MRD panel. In these patients, MRD was assessed both by manual analysis and by AGI tool supported analysis. Comparison of MRD levels obtained between both approaches showed a concordance rate of 83%, with comparable concordances between MRD tubes (tube 1, 2 or both), treatment received (chemotherapy versus targeted therapy) and flow cytometers (FACSCanto versus FACSLyric). After review of discordant cases by additional experts, the concordance increased to 97%. Furthermore, the AGI tool showed excellent intra-expert concordance (100%) and good inter-expert concordance (90%). In addition to MRD levels, also percentages of normal cell populations showed excellent concordance between manual and AGI tool analysis. We conclude that the AGI tool may facilitate MRD analysis using the EuroFlow BCP-ALL MRD protocol and will contribute to a more standardized and objective MRD assessment. However, appropriate training is required for the correct analysis of MRD data.

Twenty-two eyes of 14 Japanese patients from nine families with Stickler syndrome were studied. All of the patients were found to have mutations in the COL2A1 gene and had undergone ERG recordings. The ERGs from one of the two eyes were compared to 11 eyes of 11 normal control subjects who were matched by age, sex, and refractive error. One patient had non-recordable ERGs under both scotopic and photopic conditions. For the remaining 13 patients, the amplitudes of the b-waves of the scotopic combined, rod, and cone responses were significantly smaller than those of the control subjects (P = 0.0001, P = 0.015, P = 0.0006, respectively). The implicit times of the b-wave of the scotopic combined and photopic responses were significantly prolonged (P = 0.0037 and P = 0.0126). The age was inversely and significantly correlated with the amplitudes of the scotopic combined a-wave (P = 0.0184) and b-wave (P = 0.0076) in 13 eyes. The amplitudes of the scotopic combined b-wave amplitudes were not significantly correlated with the refractive error. The reduced or absent full-field ERGs in eyes with Stickler syndrome indicate that the physiology of the entire retina was negatively altered. The greater reduction in the ERGs with increasing age suggests that the physiological alterations of the retina are progressive.

808,808,7488779,"Detachment of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve is an alternative technique for obtaining complete visualization of a perimembranous ventricular septal defect (VSD) in cases where the VSD is obscured by the chordae tendineae or a pouch formation of the septal leaflet. This method presents theoretical concerns because it has the potential for causing postoperative valvular insufficiency. We therefore evaluated valvular function in patients who underwent VSD closure with detachment of the tricuspid valve. In a consecutive series of 153 patients who underwent VSD closure using a transatrial approach, 13 had incision of the tricuspid valve. Follow-up echocardiographic studies were performed on these patients at least 1 year following operation. There were no operative deaths. Color Doppler echocardiography revealed no residual shunt in any of these patients. Ten patients had no evidence of tricuspid stenosis or regurgitation. One patient had trivial tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation was observed in two patients of these, one patient was a small infant who had a VSD complicated by pulmonary hypertension. The other patient had a VSD with a mitral cleft, pulmonary hypertension, and Down's syndrome. The incised tricuspid valve was resuspended by solely running sutures. In conclusion, detachment of the tricuspid valve is a safe and useful method for adequate exposure of a VSD. However, this method should be avoided in patients with Down's syndrome and in small infants. Furthermore, repair of the incised valve should not be performed using only running sutures.

The drug modifies pre-mRNA splicing of the SMN2 gene to increase production of functional SMN. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of risdiplam in patients with type 2 or non-ambulant type 3 spinal muscular atrophy. In this phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients aged 2-25 years with confirmed 5q autosomal recessive type 2 or type 3 spinal muscular atrophy were recruited from 42 hospitals in 14 countries across Europe, North America, South America, and Asia. Participants were eligible if they were non-ambulant, could sit independently, and had a score of at least 2 in entry item A of the Revised Upper Limb Module. Patients were stratified by age and randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either daily oral risdiplam, at a dose of 5·00 mg (for individuals weighing ≥20 kg) or 0·25 mg/kg (for individuals weighing <20 kg), or daily oral placebo (matched to risdiplam in colour and taste). Randomisation was conducted by permutated block randomisation with a computerised system run by an external party. Patients, investigators, and all individuals in direct contact with patients were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in the 32-item Motor Function Measure total score at month 12. All individuals who were randomly assigned to risdiplam or placebo, and who did not meet the prespecified missing item criteria for exclusion, were included in the primary efficacy analysis. Individuals who received at least one dose of risdiplam or placebo were included in the safety analysis. SUNFISH is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02908685. Recruitment is closed; the study is ongoing. Between Oct 9, 2017, and Sept 4, 2018, 180 patients were randomly assigned to receive risdiplam (n=120) or placebo (n=60). For analysis of the primary endpoint, 115 patients from the risdiplam group and 59 patients from the placebo group were included. At month 12, the least squares mean change from baseline in 32-item Motor Function Measure was 1·36 (95% CI 0·61 to 2·11) in the risdiplam group and -0·19 (-1·22 to 0·84) in the placebo group, with a treatment difference of 1·55 (0·30 to 2·81, p=0·016) in favour of risdiplam. 120 patients who received risdiplam and 60 who received placebo were included in safety analyses. Adverse events that were reported in at least 5% more patients who received risdiplam than those who received placebo were pyrexia (25 [21%] of 120 patients who received risdiplam vs ten [17%] of 60 patients who received placebo), diarrhoea (20 [17%] vs five [8%]), rash (20 [17%] vs one [2%]), mouth and aphthous ulcers (eight [7%] vs 0), urinary tract infection (eight [7%] vs 0), and arthralgias (six [5%] vs 0).

Arterial blood gas samples were chocolate brown in colour, with a low arterial partial pressure of oxygen of 197 mm Hg. This large oxygen saturation gap raised suspicion for methaemoglobinaemia. However, the patient's co-oximetry results were suppressed by the blood gas analyser and delayed a definitive diagnosis. A methaemalbumin screen was sent instead, which was positive at 65 mg/L (reference interval: <3 mg/L). Treatment with methylene blue was initiated but did not result in complete resolution of cyanosis. This patient had been red cell exchange dependent since childhood for thalassaemia. Therefore, an urgent red cell exchange was initiated overnight, leading to an improvement in symptoms and interpretability of co-oximetry results. This resulted in rapid improvement without residual sequelae or complications. We conclude that a methaemalbumin screen can be used as a surrogate test for prompt confirmation of diagnosis in lieu of co-oximetry in cases of severe methaemoglobinaemia or in cases with underlying haemoglobinopathy.

812,812,12444286,"The differentiation of unilateral versus bilateral varicoceles and testicular volume measurements are important in determining the need for adolescent varicocele surgery and also in following patients after varicocelectomy. The aim of this study was to prospectively compare the findings of physical examination and color Doppler ultrasonography in the diagnosis of pediatric varicoceles and to compare the findings using the Prader orchidometer and scrotal ultrasonography in the measurement of testicular volumes. This study included 68 boys with varicoceles, ranging in age from 8 to 19 years. Varicoceles were diagnosed using both physical examination and scrotal color Doppler ultrasonography. The testicular volumes of 136 testicles were measured using the Prader orchidometer and scrotal ultrasonography. A difference of more than 10% or 2 ml in each testicular volume was considered significant. The mean age of the boys was 13.5 +/- 2.3 years. On physical examination, a left unilateral varicocele was diagnosed in 46 boys (67.6%). The other 22 boys (32.4%) had bilateral varicoceles. Color Doppler ultrasonography detected bilateral varicoceles in 4 of the 46 boys (8.7%) who were diagnosed by physical examination as having only left unilateral varicoceles (grade 3 in 3 patients and grade 2 in 1 patient).

Although the management of subclinical varicoceles remains controversial, these data show that color Doppler ultrasonography may be necessary in the diagnosis of bilateral varicoceles, especially in boys with high-grade left varicoceles.

One-way analysis of variance was used for statistical analyses. Results : The nostril height and width ratio and the height of the alar groove were significantly improved postoperatively and maintained for 15 years. The mean ratio of nostril surface areas was 1.01 ± 0.12 fifteen years postoperatively, and there was no significant difference from the ratio 1 year postoperatively.

Nevertheless, the selective interactions between UV exposures and nevus and freckling genes remain largely undescribed. We conducted a longitudinal study from ages 6 through 10 years in 477 Colorado children who had annual information collected for sun exposure, sun protection behaviors, and full body skin exams. MC1R and HERC2/OCA2 rs12913832 were genotyped and linear mixed models were used to identify main and interaction effects. All measures of sun exposure (chronic, sunburns, and waterside vacations) contributed to total nevus counts, and cumulative chronic exposure acted as the major driver of nevus development. Waterside vacations strongly increased total nevus counts in children with rs12913832 blue eye color alleles and facial freckling scores in those with MC1R red hair color variants. Sunburns increased the numbers of larger nevi (≥2 mm) in subjects with certain MC1R and rs12913832 genotypes. Complex interactions between different UV exposure profiles and genotype combinations determine nevus numbers and size, and the degree of facial freckling. Our findings emphasize the importance of implementing sun-protective behavior in childhood regardless of genetic make-up, although children with particular genetic variants may benefit from specifically targeted preventive measures to counteract their inherent risk of melanoma.

A 10-year (2007 to 2016) retrospective study of oral papillary lesions was undertaken. All biopsy reports that included a clinical description of papillary or verrucous architecture were retrieved. The data collected included clinical features, size, color, location, histopathologic diagnosis, age, and gender. The study included 137 patients, with a total of 150 lesions. The ages ranged from 10 weeks to 84 years (mean, 49 years). Histopathologically, 60% of cases were human papillomavirus (HPV) related, 19% showed hyperplasia, 11% had hyperplastic candidiasis, 7% were dysplastic or malignant, and 3% were benign of unknown etiology. Among the 7% of lesions diagnosed with dysplasia or malignancy, only 60% were suspected to have malignancy at the time of biopsy. HPV-related lesions and hyperplasia were most frequently found on the tongue (38% and 41%, respectively) and soft palate (21% and 14%, respectively). Hyperplastic candidiasis was most frequently found on the buccal mucosa and tongue (35% and 24%, respectively). Squamous cell carcinoma was found in 1.3% of total lesions and verrucous carcinoma in 1.3%. Of the verrucous or papillary malignant lesions, 50% were found on the gingiva. Most malignant lesions occurred in the 40- to 60-year age group. The results of this study suggest that, because of the wide spectrum of entities presenting clinically with a papillary-verrucous architecture, biopsy is necessary for diagnosis. The clinical presentation allowed for overall accurate diagnosis in only 47% of cases and 60% accuracy in dysplastic or malignant cases. It is of considerable importance to correctly identify those lesions that are HPV related but at the same time to rule out those lesions that are unrelated to HPV to help alleviate a patient's anxiety. Most important, biopsy is mandatory for the recognition of malignant lesions with a papillary-verrucous architecture, which may mimic other benign entities in the group of papillary-verrucous lesions.

Transfontanellar duplex brain sonography, including RI, were obtained for 28 neonates prior to cooling and for 20 neonates following cooling.

Neonates with RI values <0.60 prior to and following cooling were more likely to die or have severe neurodevelopmental disability by ages 20-32 months than those with RI>0.60. Lower RI values were associated with specific neurodevelopmental deficits in motor skill attainment.

Multiple self-report pain assessment tools have been shown reliable in cognitively intact adults and children but are understudied in the cognitively impaired, particularly in persons with TBI. The objective of this study was to assess the utility and reliability of four pain assessment instruments among TBI patients during inpatient rehabilitation and the influence of cognitive impairment. Participants self-completed four pain intensity measures, the Verbal Descriptor Scale, Faces Pain Scale (Faces), Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), and Color-Enhanced Visual Analog Scale (CAS), during five study visits over a 2-week period. Data were collected on time to completion and most preferred pain measure. To assess scale reliability, participants re-rated their current pain. To assess scale responsiveness, standard mean response was measured across time and a worst past pain experience was rated. Cognitive impairment was assessed with the Memory, Orientation, and Amnesia Test. The NRS was the most preferred measure by participants at every time point in the study. Mean pain measure completion time for all measures was under 11 seconds and did not significantly change during the study period. All scales showed very high test-retest reliability, with very strong correlations. Standard mean response from day 0 to 14 ranged from 0.387 to 0.532 across the scales. When stratified by cognitive impairment, the mean scores were consistently nominally higher for impaired participants, reaching statistical significance only for the CAS and Faces at baseline. In the cognitive impaired group, reliability for the Faces showed some weakening, as did the VAS to a milder degree. All four pain measures demonstrated good utility, very high test-retest reliability, and satisfactory responsiveness. Greater cognitive impairment was associated with elevated pain ratings, especially in the Faces and CAS. The NRS was the most preferred by patients, regardless of cognitive impairment level.

Recent studies have shown that the misuse and increased unsupervised availability of alcohol-based hand sanitisers may result in adverse events in children such as skin irritation, dryness, cracking and peeling. Unintentional or intentional ingestion of hand sanitisers in children under the age of 12 years may occur because of the colour, smell and flavour added to it. Consumption of alcohol in children may result in hypoglycaemia, apnoea and acidosis. This allows the invasion of other bacterial and viral infections. Children may also rub their eyes with sanitised hands and cause ocular injury. Therefore, the use of hand sanitisers in general needs to be revised in both children and adults. Other interventions on lowering the risk of adverse events because of misuse of hand sanitiser should be practised more often.

Differences between the groups in cognitive and emotional functioning were examined using Golden's Stroop and Emotional Stroop tests. For Emotional Stroop Mean reaction time (RT) of positive word (POS) and negative word (NEG) with color congruence (C) or incongruence (I) were recorded as POS-C, POS-I, NEG-C and NEG-I, respectively. For Golden's interference scores (IGs), both errors and RTs in the ADHD group were higher than in the other groups. Longer mean RTs of POS-C, POS-I, NEG-C and neural word (NEU) of the ADHD group, and NEG-I of ADHD+DICCD and DICCD groups were observed compared to HC. After 12 weeks of methylphenidate treatment, differences between ADHD subgroups and HC on Golden's Stroop RT disappeared, but differences in Golden's Stroop errors and Emotional Stroop mean RTs remained. The ADHD+DICCD group showed longer mean RTs in NEG-C, NEG-I and NEU of the Emotional Stroop test than the ADHD group. Our study shows that regardless of emotional responding, deficit in cognitive control is the core symptom of ADHD. However, emotionally biased stimuli may cause response inhibitory dysfunction among DICCD with callous-unemotional traits, and the comorbidity of ADHD and DICCD tends to account for the negative emotional response characteristic of DICCD. These deficits may be eliminated by medication treatment in ADHD, but not the ADHD with comorbid DICCD.

834,834,11459107,"Visuospatial processing is accomplished in distinct neuroanatomic pathways. One such pathway, known as the where pathway, involves a dorsal route through magnocellular thalamic cells to occipital and parietal cortices and conveys location and motion information. A second pathway, known as the what pathway, involves a ventral route through parvocellular thalamic cells to occipital and temporal cortices and conveys color and form information. The where pathway is thought to be responsible for processing spatial relationships while the what pathway is responsible for object identification. Children with early-treated congenital hypothyroidism (CH) who exhibit selective visuospatial deficits may provide a good model to study the differential development of these pathways. Because children with CH lacked thyroid hormone at a time when needed by developing brain regions such as the parietal cortex, these children may be affected to a greater degree on tasks tapping where but not what pathway processing. We tested this hypothesis via retrospective analysis of their performance on 6 spatial tasks. Compared were 49 adolescents with CH and 49 matched control participants. On the basis of confirmatory factor analysis, tasks were assigned to either where or that pathway groupings. A repeated measures ANOVA showed the CH group was impaired relative to a normal comparison group only on where pathway tasks.

Subjects were seven patients with ages ranged from 6- to 77-years old and body weight > 15 kg. The size of the PDA ranged from 1.8 to 6.3 mm with pulmonary to systemic flow ratios from 1.2 to 2.2. During DC-PDA using Ampaltzer Duct Occluder or coil, an intra-cardiac echocardiographic (ICE) catheter was advanced into pulmonary arteries and standard views were developed to guide DC-PDA. We have developed two standard views; the main pulmonary artery view (MPA view) and the left pulmonary artery view (LPA view). The MPA view provided aortic short axis view equivalent to that seen by trans-thoracic echocardiography in children. The LPA view, obtained by the echo probe in the LPA and turned it up upside down, provided long axis view of the PDA allowing more precise anatomical evaluation. TPE allowed us to monitor the entire procedure and determine residual shunts. TPE in the MPA and LPA view can be an effective guide for DC-PDA. This report leads to new application of this imaging device.

840,840,38904898,"Granular Cell Tumor (GCT) is an uncommon benign lesion in the oral cavity whose pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Due to their infrequent occurrence and similarity to other oral lesions, they are often forgotten during the initial clinical diagnosis. Therefore, understanding its prevalence, clinical and pathological characteristics is crucial for an accurate diagnosis and adequate management. All cases diagnosed as GCTs in six Brazilian and Argentinian oral diagnostic centers were re-evaluated by HE staining, and clinical, demographic, and histopathological data were collected and evaluated. The series comprised 45 female (73.8%) and 16 male (26.2%), with a 2.8:1 female-to-male ratio and a mean age of 35.3 ± 16.9 years (range: 7-77 years). Most cases occurred on the tongue (n = 49; 81.6%) and presented clinically as asymptomatic papules or nodules (n = 50; 89.3%) with a normochromic (n = 25; 45.5%) or yellowish (n = 11; 20.0%) coloration and sizes ranging from 0.2 to 3.0 cm (mean ± SD: 1.40 ± 0.75 cm). Morphologically, most tumors were characterized by a poorly delimited proliferation (n = 52; 88.1%) of cells typically rounded to polygonal containing abundant, eosinophilic, finely granular cytoplasm. Pustulo-ovoid bodies of Milian were identified in all lesions (n = 61; 100%). Entrapment of skeletal striated muscle (n = 44; 72.1%) and nerve fibers (n = 42; 68.9%) were common findings. Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia (PEH) was observed in 23 cases (39.0%). In only 27.7% of cases (n = 13) there was agreement between the clinical and histopathological diagnosis. Outcome information was available from 16 patients (26.2%), with clinical follow-up ranging from 4 to 36 months (mean 13.3 months), and none developed local recurrence. The clinical and histopathological features of GCTs were consistent with those described in previous studies. In general, these lesions have a predilection for the lateral region of the tongue in adult women. It is essential to consider GCTs in the differential diagnosis of yellow or normochromic papules and nodules in the oral cavity.

843,843,26301492,"Despite the effort of developing various nanodelivery systems, most of them suffer from undesired high uptakes by the reticuloendothelial system, such as liver and spleen. Herein we develop an endogenous phosphatase-triggered coassembly strategy to form tumor-specific indocyanine green (ICG)-doped nanofibers (5) for cancer theranostics. Based on coordinated intermolecular interactions, 5 significantly altered near-infrared absorbance of ICG, which improves the critical photoacoustic and photothermal properties. The phosphatase-instructed coassembly process, as well as its theranostic capability, was successfully conducted at different levels ranging from in vitro, living cell, tissue mimic, to in vivo. Specifically, the tumor uptake of ICG was markedly increased to 15.05 ± 3.78%ID/g, which was 25-fold higher than that of free ICG (0.59 ± 0.24%ID/g) at 4 h after intravenous injection. The resulting ultrahigh T/N ratios (>15) clearly differentiated tumors from the surrounding normal tissue. Complete tumor elimination with high therapeutic accuracy has been successfully achieved upon laser irradiation (0.8 W/cm(2), 5 min) within 24-48 h postinjection. As the first example, in vivo formation of tumor-specific ICG-doped nanofiber for PTT theranostics owns the immense potential for clinical translation of personalized nanomedicine with targeted drug delivery as well as for cancer theranostics.

This mixed-method, quasi-experimental design study included 27 adolescents who evaluated four smartphone PA game-based applications in two Boys & Girls Clubs of America. After an initial baseline week (i.e., usual activity during their visit to the Club), adolescents played each game for 1 week. During a final week, the participants could choose to play any combination of the four games. An established conceptual framework was used to assess feasibility. Efficacy was assessed by changes in PA via wrist-worn accelerometers (model GT3x+; ActiGraph LLC, Pensacola, FL). Practicality was measured through field notes, the number of players attending each session, and the proportion of attendees who played the games. Acceptability was measured using poststudy focus groups. Compared with baseline (3.22 metabolic equivalents [METs]), mean accelerometer values were significantly (P<0.05) higher during ""Space Rayders"" (4.33 METs) and ""Color Hunt"" (3.67 METs). Attendance did not differ among games, and weekly number of players averaged 12 of 27 participants. Qualitative findings indicated that participants perceived ""Space Rayders"" as the most acceptable game. Overall, participants found the games to be enjoyable and easy to use, although they had suggestions to improve graphics and sounds. Smartphone games can be feasible for adolescents to use for PA.

845,845,27447086,"Mutations in the coding sequence of the L and M opsin genes are often associated with X-linked cone dysfunction (such as Bornholm Eye Disease, BED), though the exact color vision phenotype associated with these disorders is variable. We examined individuals with L/M opsin gene mutations to clarify the link between color vision deficiency and cone dysfunction. We recruited 17 males for imaging. The thickness and integrity of the photoreceptor layers were evaluated using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Cone density was measured using high-resolution images of the cone mosaic obtained with adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy. The L/M opsin gene array was characterized in 16 subjects, including at least one subject from each family. There were six subjects with the LVAVA haplotype encoded by exon 3, seven with LIAVA, two with the Cys203Arg mutation encoded by exon 4, and two with a novel insertion in exon 2. Foveal cone structure and retinal thickness was disrupted to a variable degree, even among related individuals with the same L/M array. Our findings provide a direct link between disruption of the cone mosaic and L/M opsin variants. We hypothesize that, in addition to large phenotypic differences between different L/M opsin variants, the ratio of expression of first versus downstream genes in the L/M array contributes to phenotypic diversity. While the L/M opsin mutations underlie the cone dysfunction in all of the subjects tested, the color vision defect can be caused either by the same mutation or a gene rearrangement at the same locus.

This work aims to use her life story and her artistic production in a longitudinal study to examine with quantitative tools the effects of physical and emotional pain (rage) on artistic expression. Kahlo suffered from polio as a child, was involved in a bus accident as a teenager where she suffered multiple fractures of her spine and had 30 operations throughout her lifetime. She also had a tempestuous relationship with her painter husband, Diego Rivera. Her physical and personal troubles however became the texture of her vivid visual vocabulary-usually expressed through the depiction of Mexican and indigenous culture or the female experience and form. We applied color analysis to a series of Frida's self-portraits and revealed a very strong association of physical pain and emotional rage with low wavelength colors (red and yellow), indicating that the expression of her ailments was, consciously or not, achieved by increasing the perceived luminance of the canvas. Further quantitative analysis that used the fractal dimension identified ""The broken column"" as the portrait with higher compositional complexity, which matches previous critical acclaim of this portrait as the climax of her art. These results confirm the ability of color analysis to extract emotional and cognitive features from artistic work.

Homeless youth were much more likely to have been involved with a mental health system (47% vs. 12%, P < 0.001), the criminal justice system (20% vs. 2%, P < 0.001), high-risk sexual behaviors (21% vs. 3%, P < 0.001), and substance abuse (25% vs. 6%, P < 0.001) than were other youth served by the program. Comprehensive networks of care offering a continuum of services and a variety of entry routes and types of care sites are needed to connect under-served youth to health care. Outreach and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) counseling and testing services can offer important portals of entry into health services for at-risk youth. Support services such as outreach, case management, and mental health services are needed to complement medical services by all youth at-risk for contracting HIV. Support services are necessary for the initiation and retention of youth in care so that early case identification and complex treatment regimens can be initiated and tailored to the individual.

However, alternations of anatomical and functional characteristics of subcortical limbic structures and their relationship with neurocognition of PBD remain unclear. Thirty-six PBD type I (PBD-I) (15.36 ± 0.32 years old), twenty PBD type II (PBD-II) (14.80 ± 0.32 years old) and nineteen age-gender matched healthy controls (HCs) (14.16 ± 0.36 years old) were enlisted. Primarily, the volumes of the subcortical limbic structures were obtained and differences in the volumes were evaluated. Then, these structures served as seeds of regions of interest to calculate the voxel-wised functional connectivity (FC). After that, correlation analysis was completed between volumes and FC of brain regions showing significant differences and neuropsychological tests. Compared to HCs, both PBD-I and PBD-II patients showed a decrease in the Stroop color word test (SCWT) and digit span backward test scores. Compared with HCs, PBD-II patients exhibited a significantly increased volume of right septal nuclei, and PBD-I patients presented increased FC of right nucleus accumbens and bilateral pallidum, of right basal forebrain with right putamen and left pallidum. Both the significantly altered volumes and FC were negatively correlated with SCWT scores. The study revealed the role of subcortical limbic structural and functional abnormalities on cognitive impairments in PBD patients. These may have far-reaching significance for the etiology of PBD and provide neuroimaging clues for the differential diagnosis of PBD subtypes.

The percentage of CD(4)(+)CD(25)(+) T cells were detected by 2-color flow cytometry. The levels of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-gamma, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta in plasma and supernatant were assayed by ELISA. Both the asthmatic children and the control children were selected to induce sputum by hypertonic saline. Sputum was processed for detecting the expression of Foxp3-mRNA. The expression of Foxp3-mRNA in both sputum and PBMC was detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR with beta-actin as internal control. The percentage of CD(4)(+)CD(25)(+) regulatory T cells in exacerbation and remission asthmatic children was significantly lower than that of the control children both prestimulation [(10.1 +/- 2.1)% vs. (15.5 +/- 2.7)%, (11.7 +/- 2.5)% vs. (15.5 +/- 2.7)%, P < 0.05] and poststimulation with PHA [(12.4 +/- 2.3)% vs. (26.9 +/- 3.8)%, (17.3 +/- 3.2)% vs. (26.9 +/- 3.8)%, P < 0.05].

Amaranth is rich in nutrients, but with high level of phytate. The objective of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of home processed amaranth grain containing bread in the treatment of anemia, hemoglobin concentration and iron deficiency anemia among two-to-five year-old children in Southern Ethiopia. Children with anemia (hemoglobin concentration <110.0g/L) (N = 100) were identified by random sampling and enrolled in a 1:1 cluster randomized controlled trial for six months in 2017. The amaranth group (N = 50), received 150g bread containing 70% amaranth and 30% chickpea, the amaranth grain was processed at home (soaking, germinating, and fermenting) to decrease the phytate level. The maize group (N = 50), received 150g bread, containing processed maize (roasted and fermented) to give a similar color and structure with amaranth bread. Hemoglobin, ferritin, and CRP were measured at baseline and at the end of intervention. Hemoglobin and ferritin values were adjusted for altitude and infection, respectively. Generalized estimating equation and generalized linear model were used to analyze the data. In the last follow-up measure anemia prevalence was significantly lower in the amaranth group (32%) as compared with the maize group (56%) [adjusted risk ratios, aRR: 0.39 (95%CI: 0.16-0.77)]. Hemoglobin concentration estimate of beta coefficient was significantly higher in the amaranth group compared with the maize group [aβ 8.9g/L (95%CI: 3.5-14.3)], p-value <0.01.

860,860,9083972,"To define the clinical utility of the color Doppler proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) method for estimating regurgitant stroke volume (SV), 160 regurgitant lesions were evaluated in 104 patients with mitral (MR), aortic (AR), and tricuspid (TR) regurgitation. Regurgitant SV by PISA was calculated as 2 pi R2 x V x (time-velocity integral/peak flow velocity), where R is the radius corresponding to the first blue-red interface velocity of the maximal PISA during the cardiac cycle. The time-velocity integral and peak flow velocity from the continuous-wave Doppler recording of the regurgitant jet were used to correct PISA for phasic variations in regurgitant flow. Fifteen lesions were excluded because of difficulty in tracing the continuous-wave Doppler regurgitant curve. Among 145 remaining regurgitant lesions, PISA was measurable in 50 (78%) of 64 cases of MR and 24 (69%) of 35 cases of TR but in only 12 (26%) of 46 cases of AR (p < 0.001). Regurgitant SV by PISA correlated modestly well with jet area/atrial area in all atrioventricular valve lesions (MR: r = 0.55; TR: r = 0.65; p < 0.001). However, the correlation improved if only central jets were considered (MR: r = 0.70; TR; r = 0.75; p < 0.001). These findings are not unexpected because jet area/atrial area underestimates the true severity of regurgitation in cases of eccentric (wall-impinging) jets. PISA was detected in all severe cases of regurgitation but in only 64% of cases of mild MR, 45% of cases of mild TR, and 6% of cases of mild AR (p < 0.01).

861,861,2004867,"Women are increasingly at risk for AIDS. At the root of this risk is women's relative lack of control over their bodies and their lives. Those women with least control, generally poor women of color, are at greatest risk in both developed and developing countries. To date, AIDS prevention programs have ignored most women, focusing almost exclusively on women in the sex industry and, more recently, prenatal women. We urgently need prevention programs for women that view women as more than ""mothers and whores"" and recognize that AIDS poses a real risk to many of us; programs that are sensitive to the complex realities of women's lives and offer realistic alternatives that will allow women to protect themselves from HIV infection. The author recommends a change in AIDS prevention programs in developed and developing countries which recognizes 1) the lack of mutually exclusive sex roles of, for instance, the mother and the prostitute, and 2) the economic position of dependency, and 3) the social identification as childbearer. The risk of all poor women of color has been overlooked in the immediate focus on prostitution and AIDs, and female rates are increasing. For instance, the U.S. reported females AIDS cases rose from 7% in 1985 to 11% in 1989, and in West Germany female HIV cases rose from 4% in 1984 to 25% in 1988. Sub-Saharan African women constitute 50% of AIDS cases. As a direct consequence, pediatric AIDS cases have increased. For the female teenager in developing countries school based AIDs education is rare, and because of the lack or limited formal education for most women, out of school programs need to be provided in ways which offer choices and information about contraception. For women of reproductive age, the use of condoms as protection from HIV also denies the culturally determined status of motherhood. For prostitutes, effective and appropriate prevention programs provide information and tools for protection against AIDs. It is cautioned that police harassment, HIV testing, and job training and alternative employment deny underlying economic and social conditions and hence are ineffective. Prostitute's age, number of children, general health, drug use, work situation, sex practices, and economic choices affect whether prevention may involve training in safe sex negotiation or condom use techniques. For HIV positive women, birth rates may increase as a security investment. Counseling to terminate pregnancy denies the cultural importance of the motherhood role. Care must be directed to both mother and child in the same location.

Each patient had color Doppler sonography performed prior to laparotomy. The Doppler results were compared to the histological diagnosis of the ovarian tumors. Of the 113 patients whose intratumoral blood flow could be evaluated, the pulsatility index was significantly lower in malignant lesions than in benign lesions (0.85 +/- 0.46 vs 1.63 +/- 0.64, p<0.001).

The present results suggest that color Doppler sonography may be a useful clinical tool in the pre-operative evaluation of ovarian masses. However, the pulsatility indexes showed considerable overlap between benign and malignant lesions, indicating that color Doppler sonography has limitations in the differentiation of benign from malignant ovarian masses.

Throughout Africa children play with beetles by letting them fly on a string. In the Sahel, the hard work of dung beetles is an inspiration for stories. Fireflies are generally associated with ghosts and witches, likely because the glowing of the beetles is interpreted as magical.

However, no study to date has investigated changes in this system across different age groups in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Thus, this study aimed to explore changes in PFC function in children with ADHD. Study participants included typically developing (TD) children (n = 140) and children with ADHD (n = 67) of primary school age. Behavioral executive functions and their neural basis were evaluated between the TD children and children with ADHD and also across different age periods (younger and older children). To examine executive function, inhibitory control was assessed using the reverse Stroop task, and PFC near-infrared spectroscopic measurements were used to investigate the neural mechanisms involved. Both ADHD symptoms and the ability to inhibit color interference improved with age.

870,870,25387048,"To describe multimodal imaging findings in patients with dark or white without pressure lesions of the fundus. Retrospective observational case series of 10 patients with white or dark without pressure lesions. We analyzed multimodal imaging using spectral domain optical coherence tomography, color and near-infrared fundus photography, and fundus autofluorescence imaging to explore the findings associated with these lesions. All patients had geographic dark or white lesions on clinical examination and color photography, which were either hyporeflective or hyperreflective on near-infrared reflectance imaging, respectively. On optical coherence tomography, these lesions correlated with an abrupt change of the photoreceptor reflectivity, with relative hyporeflectivity of photoreceptor zones (ellipsoid and interdigitation zones, as well as outer segments) within the dark, and relative hyperreflectivity within white lesions. Ten patients underwent fundus autofluorescence, which showed well-defined zones of relative hypo-autofluorescence within the lesion, compared with neighboring uninvolved regions, whether dark or white without pressure. In two patients who had a lesion combining white and dark without pressure, we observed the transition in photoreceptor reflectivity from the dark lesion (hyporeflective) to the white lesion (hyperreflective), relative to the surrounding retina. Both white and dark without pressure lesions are associated with changes in outer retinal reflectivity on optical coherence tomography, which occur in opposite directions compared with the surrounding unaffected areas. In the face of normal visual field testing to date, the clinical significance of this finding remains uncertain. Recognition of the optical coherence tomography appearance will help clinicians avoid unnecessary workup of these patients for outer retinal dystrophy or degeneration.

872,872,29024734,"Knowledge regarding the morphologic spectrum of pediatric melanoma (PM) is sparse, and this may in part contribute to delay in detection and thicker tumors. To analyze the clinicodermoscopic characteristics of PM. Retrospective study of 52 melanomas diagnosed in patients before the age of 20 years. On the basis of its clinical, dermoscopic, and histopathologic characteristics, PM can be classified as spitzoid or nonspitzoid. The nonspitzoid melanomas (n = 37 [72.3%]) presented in patients with a mean age of 16.3 years (range, 8-20) and were associated with a high-risk phenotype and a pre-existing nevus (62.2%). The spitzoid melanomas (n = 15 [27.7%]) were diagnosed in patients at a mean age of 12.5 years (range, 2-19) and were mostly de novo lesions (73.3%) located on the limbs (73.3%). Whereas less than 25% of PMs fulfilled the modified clinical ABCD criteria (amelanotic, bleeding bump, color uniformity, de novo at any diameter), 40% of spitzoid melanomas did. Dermoscopic melanoma criteria were found in all cases. Nonspitzoid melanomas tended to be multicomponent (58.3%) or have nevus-like (25%) dermoscopic patterns. Spitzoid melanomas revealed atypical vascular patterns with shiny white lines (46.2%) or an atypical pigmented spitzoid pattern (30.8%). There was good correlation between spitzoid subtype histopathologically and dermoscopically (κ = 0.66). A retrospective study without re-review of pathologic findings.

Although visual improvement is a primary goal of surgical intervention, prediction models are lacking. We retrospectively reviewed all patients undergoing craniopharyngioma surgery at a single institution (2014-2019). Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables of interest were collected. Visual acuity and visual fields (VFs) were standardized into Visual Impairment Scores (VISs), defined by the German Ophthalmological Society. VIS ranged from 0 (normal vision) to 100 (complete bilateral blindness). Visual improvement/deterioration was defined as a postsurgical decrease/increase of ≥5 VIS points, respectively. Complete ophthalmologic assessments were available for 61 operations, corresponding to 41 patients (age, 4-73 years). Vision improved after 28 operations (46%), remained stable after 27 (44%), and deteriorated after 6 (10%).

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2017, Issue 12); MEDLINE Ovid; Embase Ovid; BIREME LILACS, OpenGrey, the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). The date of the search was 17 January 2018. This review includes randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compared any device or aid used for reading to another device or aid in people aged 16 or over with low vision as defined by the study investigators. We did not compare low-vision aids with no low-vision aid since it is obviously not possible to measure reading speed, our primary outcome, in people that cannot read ordinary print. We considered reading aids that maximise the person's visual reading capacity, for example by increasing image magnification (optical and electronic magnifiers), augmenting text contrast (coloured filters) or trying to optimise the viewing angle or gaze position (such as prisms). We have not included studies investigating reading aids that allow reading through hearing, such as talking books or screen readers, or through touch, such as Braille-based devices and we did not consider rehabilitation strategies or complex low-vision interventions. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. At least two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. The primary outcome of the review was reading speed in words per minute. Secondary outcomes included reading duration and acuity, ease and frequency of use, quality of life and adverse outcomes. We graded the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We included 11 small studies with a cross-over design (435 people overall), one study with two parallel arms (37 participants) and one study with three parallel arms (243 participants). These studies took place in the USA (7 studies), the UK (5 studies) and Canada (1 study). Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) was the most frequent cause of low vision, with 10 studies reporting 50% or more participants with the condition. Participants were aged 9 to 97 years in these studies, but most were older (the median average age across studies was 71 years). None of the studies were masked; otherwise we largely judged the studies to be at low risk of bias. All studies reported the primary outcome: results for reading speed. None of the studies measured or reported adverse outcomes.Reading speed may be higher with stand-mounted closed circuit television (CCTV) than with optical devices (stand or hand magnifiers) (low-certainty evidence, 2 studies, 92 participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence that reading duration was longer with the electronic devices and that they were easier to use. Similar results were seen for electronic devices with the camera mounted in a 'mouse'. Mixed results were seen for head-mounted devices with one study of 70 participants finding a mouse-based head-mounted device to be better than an optical device and another study of 20 participants finding optical devices better (low-certainty evidence). Low-certainty evidence from three studies (93 participants) suggested no important differences in reading speed, acuity or ease of use between stand-mounted and head-mounted electronic devices. Similarly, low-certainty evidence from one study of 100 participants suggested no important differences between a 9.7'' tablet computer and stand-mounted CCTV in reading speed, with imprecise estimates (other outcomes not reported).Low-certainty evidence showed little difference in reading speed in one study with 100 participants that added electronic portable devices to preferred optical devices. One parallel-arm study in 37 participants found low-certainty evidence of higher reading speed at one month if participants received a CCTV at the initial rehabilitation consultation instead of a standard low-vision aids prescription alone.A parallel-arm study including 243 participants with AMD found no important differences in reading speed, reading acuity and quality of life between prism spectacles and conventional spectacles. One study in 10 people with AMD found that reading speed with several overlay coloured filters was no better and possibly worse than with a clear filter (low-certainty evidence, other outcomes not reported). There is insufficient evidence supporting the use of a specific type of electronic or optical device for the most common profiles of low-vision aid users. However, there is some evidence that stand-mounted electronic devices may improve reading speeds compared with optical devices. There is less evidence to support the use of head-mounted or portable electronic devices; however, the technology of electronic devices may have improved since the studies included in this review took place, and modern portable electronic devices have desirable properties such as flexible use of magnification. There is no good evidence to support the use of filters or prism spectacles. Future research should focus on assessing sustained long-term use of each device and the effect of different training programmes on its use, combined with investigation of which patient characteristics predict performance with different devices, including some of the more costly electronic devices.

Sixteen children with steroid-sensitive INS (mean age 9.0 years) were included in this study, together with 15 healthy normal children (mean age 7.9 years) for the control group. Intracellular production of both IFNgamma and IL-4 in helper T cell (CD4+ cell) was investigated by a 3-color flow cytometry. The cross-sectional data showed no significant differences of percentages of Th0 (IFNgamma+ IL-4+ CD4+ cell), Th1 (IFNgamma+ lL-4- CD4+ cell) and Th2 (IFNgamma- IL-4+ CD4+ cell) in CD4+ cells (p > 0.05). The Th1/Th2 ratio during nephrotic relapse did not differ from those during nephrotic remission and in normal healthy children (p > 0.05). We conclude that there is no significant skew of Th1/Th2 balance in childhood INS and that the cardinal immunological abnormality does not lie in helper T cells but in other cells, such as suppressor/cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells or monocytes/macrophage.

890,890,31359871,"Childhood overweight and obesity are major health challenges in the United States. One of the recommendations to combat obesity is to maintain a healthy diet, which is often best supported by eating home-cooked meals to control cooking methods, ingredients, and portions. Diet control through home cooking is challenged because of the decline in culinary skills in the population and a paucity of effective culinary nutrition education (CNE) programs. Providing technology-enabled CNE (CNE-tech) to overweight and obese adolescents can equip them with life skills that can assist them in the future. Such skills can facilitate saving money, eating healthier, and creating social environments. In addition, CNE builds cooking confidence and food literacy that in turn can build adolescent self-efficacy, particularly toward managing their health behaviors. This study aimed to inform functionalities, design requirements, and the context of use for CNE-tech that could enhance overweight and obese adolescents' healthy food literacy, cooking confidence, and general self-efficacy with regard to self-management to ultimately promote healthy lifestyle management. The design science study was completed in 2 distinct phases engaging overweight and obese adolescents, parents of overweight and obese adolescents, and the health care providers that treat adolescents with these conditions. Phase 2, our primary source of data, involved user-centered design methods including the following: (1) early stage prototype usability analysis, (2) semistructured interviews with 70 overweight or obese adolescents engaged in a healthy behavior program, and (3) semistructured interviews with 10 health care providers. Data were analyzed using constant comparison analysis to identify functionalities, design requirements, and inform the context of use of CNE-tech. Data revealed specific desired functionalities for the CNE-tech related to building cooking skills, populating a healthy recipe database, suggesting healthy alternatives, supporting the construction of a healthy plate, and the ability to share healthy recipes and cooking accomplishments. Moreover, the adolescents provided design requirements pertaining to the presentation (eg, vivid colors, semirealistic images, and cooking sounds), use of multimedia, and gaming. Data further revealed contextual factors, such as shared experiences with family members and enhanced continued use. We demonstrate the potentiality of creating CNE-tech that could effectively lead to better self-care and induce sustainable behavioral change as it facilitates skill building, self-efficacy, and a pathway that enables overweight and obese adolescents to influence cooking habits in their family home and future dwellings. Our CNE-tech-proposed solution aligns with the goals of overweight and obese adolescents and also reflects existing theories about behavioral change.

893,893,17079574,"Although animal studies have demonstrated frontal white matter and behavioral changes resulting from prenatal cocaine exposure, no human studies have associated neuropsychological deficits in attention and inhibition with brain structure. We used diffusion tensor imaging to investigate frontal white matter integrity and executive functioning in cocaine-exposed children. Six direction diffusion tensor images were acquired using a Siemens 3T scanner with a spin-echo echo-planar imaging pulse sequence on right-handed cocaine-exposed (n = 28) and sociodemographically similar non-exposed children (n = 25; mean age: 10.6 years) drawn from a prospective, longitudinal study. Average diffusion and fractional anisotropy were measured in the left and right frontal callosal and frontal projection fibers. Executive functioning was assessed using two well-validated neuropsychological tests (Stroop color-word test and Trail Making Test). Cocaine-exposed children showed significantly higher average diffusion in the left frontal callosal and right frontal projection fibers. Cocaine-exposed children were also significantly slower on a visual-motor set-shifting task with a trend toward lower scores on a verbal inhibition task. Controlling for gender and intelligence, average diffusion in the left frontal callosal fibers was related to prenatal exposure to alcohol and marijuana and an interaction between cocaine and marijuana exposure. Performance on the visual-motor set-shifting task was related to prenatal cocaine exposure and an interaction between cocaine and tobacco exposure. Significant correlations were found between test performance and fractional anisotropy in areas of the frontal white matter. Prenatal cocaine exposure, alone and in combination with exposure to other drugs, is associated with slightly poorer executive functioning and subtle microstructural changes suggesting less mature development of frontal white matter pathways. The relative contribution of postnatal environmental factors, including characteristics of the caregiving environment and stressors associated with poverty and out-of-home placement, on brain development and behavioral functioning in polydrug-exposed children awaits further research.

Ethnographic tools including interviews, group discussions, informal conversations and living-in-camp observations were used for collecting information on local knowledge, perceived cause, severity and health seeking behaviour of nomadic Fulani in their dry season camps at the Gongola-Benue valley in Northeastern Nigeria. Nomadic Fulani regarded pabboje (a type of ""fever"" that is distinct from other fevers because it ""comes today, goes tomorrow, returns the next"") as their commonest health problem. Pabboje is associated with early rains, ripening corn and brightly coloured flora. Pabboje is inherent in all nomadic Fulani for which treatment is therefore unnecessary despite its interference with performance of duty such as herding. Traditional medicines are used to reduce the severity, and rituals carried out to make it permanently inactive or to divert its recurrence. Although modern antimalaria may make the severity of subsequent pabboje episodes worse, nomads seek treatment in private health facilities against fevers that are persistent using antimalarial medicines. The consent of the household head was essential for a sick child to be treated outside the camp. The most important issues in health service utilization among nomads are the belief that fever is a Fulani illness that needs no cure until a particular period, preference for private medicine vendors and the avoidance of health facilities.

Two hundred retinal samples of right eye [57.0% females (n = 114) and 43.0% males (n = 86)] were selected from baseline visit. A custom-written software was used for vessel segmentation. Vessel segmentation is the process of transforming two-dimensional color images into binary images (i.e. black and white pixels). The circular area of approximately 2.6 optic disc radii surrounding the center of optic disc was cropped. The non-vessels fragments were removed. FracLac was used to measure the fractal dimension and vessel density of retinal vessels. This study suggested that 14.1% of the region of interest (i.e. approximately 2.6 optic disk radii) comprised retinal vessel structure. Using correlation analysis, vessel density measurement and fractal dimension estimation are linearly and strongly correlated (R = 0.942, R(2) = 0.89, p < 0.001).

A set of left and right scanned images was taken for each subject and each scan took an average of 2.5 seconds. These scanned images were processed and merged to form a composite 3-dimensional soft tissue reproduction of the subjects using commercially-available reverse modeling software. The differences in facial morphology were measured using shell deviation color maps. The average face was used to compare differences between male and female groups and 3 subjects with craniofacial anomalies. The difference between the average male and female face was 0.460 +/- 0.353 mm. The areas of greatest deviation were at the zygomatic area and lower jaw line, with the males being more prominent. The results of the surface deviation between the subjects with craniofacial anomalies were significant. The construction of the average face provides an interesting perspective into measuring changes in groups of patients and also acts as a useful template for the comparison of craniofacial anomalies.

Ten of these patients also had echocardiographic examinations, eight of which included color-flow Doppler studies. The diagnosis of PAPVC was confirmed in each of these patients by surgery or angiography. Fourteen anomalous pulmonary venous connections were identified, 10 involving the right upper lobe pulmonary vein and 4 involving the left upper lobe pulmonary vein. This retrospective review demonstrated that all 14 anomalous venous connections were correctly identified by MR imaging, whereas only 8 of 13 (62%) were identified by echocardiography. With MR, 89% of all the pulmonary veins and 93% of the anomalous pulmonary veins were visualized on axial images, while 41% of all pulmonary veins and 71% of anomalous veins were seen on coronal MR images. There were five atrial septal defects (ASDs), four of the sinus venous type and one of the septum secundum type.

This study aimed to evaluate the specific orofacial and oral health characteristics, including masticatory performance, in Thai patients with CS. A comparative study was conducted with Thai CS patients aged 6-17 years and a control group of healthy individuals with similar age distribution. Assessments included craniofacial morphology, oral health status, and masticatory performance. Intergroup comparisons utilized appropriate statistical tests. The study included 24 CS patients with a mean age of 10.11 ± 2.98 years and 30 controls. CS patients exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of various oral conditions compared to controls: cleft palate (20.8%), anterior open bite (41.7%), anterior crossbite (54.2%), posterior crossbite (50%), combined anterior-posterior crossbite (45.8%), dental crowding in both maxilla and mandible (50% and 45.8% respectively), congenitally missing teeth (50%), supernumerary teeth (12.5%), and eruption failure (54.2%). Furthermore, CS patients exhibited significantly higher caries prevalence and susceptibility, alongside poorer oral hygiene, compared to controls. Regarding jaw relationships, CS patients exhibited a significantly higher proportion of Angle's Class III malocclusion (50%) compared to the control group, where Class I malocclusion was predominant (50%).

This neoplasm has low malignant potential and with adequate surgical treatment has a very good prognosis. We present the case of a 15-year-old girl admitted in our department for an intra-abdominal tumor, diagnosed incidentally on ultrasonography after a minor trauma. The CT scan revealed an important mass, apparently localized in the liver. Intraoperative assessment found the tumor originating from the pancreatic head (12 cm in diameter), well defined, with reddish-brown color, well-vascularized and heterogeneous consistency. It was completely removed without sacrificing other tissues. The postoperative evolution was uneventful. The microscopic feature of the tumor, using Hematoxylin and Eosin staining was characteristic. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis. Four years postoperative follow-up showed no recurrence. Only several hundred solid pseudopapillary tumors of the pancreas are described in the literature. In children, the incidence of this tumor is extremely rare. Some investigators believe it is originated from pluripotent primordial stem cells. The clinical picture is non-specific.

In youth, negative affect has been shown to predict insulin resistance (IR), and disinhibited-eating behaviors have been linked to IR. It is unknown if youth with a parent with T2D (P-T2D) report greater psychological and behavioral symptoms than those without a P-T2D. To compare youth with and without a P-T2D on symptoms of negative affect and disinhibited-eating. Nine-hundred thirty-two youth (13.3 ± 2.6 years; BMIz 1.06 ± 1.06; 67.8% female; 53.6% people of color; 10.7% with a P-T2D) completed questionnaires of anxiety and depressive symptoms, eating in the absence of hunger, and emotional-eating. Loss-of-control (LOC)-eating was assessed by interview. In two separate subsamples, energy intake was explored using laboratory test meals simulating eating in the absence of hunger and LOC-eating, respectively. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity. In follow-up analyses, fat mass (kg) and height, and IR were included as covariates, respectively. Adjusting for all covariates including adiposity and IR, compared to youth without a P-T2D, youth with a P-T2D reported more anxiety and depression symptoms, greater eating in the absence of hunger, and emotional-eating (ps < 0.05). No significant differences were found for LOC-eating, or in exploratory analyses of energy intake for either test meal (ps > 0.16). Self-reported negative affect and disinhibited-eating may be higher among youth with P-T2D compared to those without P-T2D.

918,918,33341599,"We aimed to examine the prevalence and correlates of opportunistic skin check behaviours among Australians and whether changes over time might explain increasing underlying rates of melanoma in situ. The National Sun Protection Survey involved periodic telephone-based cross-sectional surveys during summer since 2003. Skin checks by a doctor in the past 12 months was asked in four summers over 2006-2017, and responses from 23,374 Australians aged 12-69 years were analysed. Prevalence estimates were weighted to be representative of the Australian population. Chi-square tests compared the prevalence over time and by characteristics. The overall proportion reporting whole-body skin checks in the past 12 months was 20 % in 2006-07 and 2010-11, 21 % in 2013-14, and 22 % in 2016-17; but increased from 29 % in 2006-07 to 37 % in 2016-17 for those aged 45-69 years (p < 0.0001). In 2016-17, 5% reported a skin check of part-body and 9% for a specific mole or spot. The proportion reporting no skin checks increased from 61 % to 64 % over time (p < 0.0001). Whole-body skin checks were more common among older respondents, females, and also varied by residence location, skin sensitivity, skin colour, risk perception, and socio-economic index (all p < 0.001). Approximately one third of Australians had their skin checked by a doctor within a 12-month period, but this varied across population sub-groups.

The study subjects were divided into two groups according to their test conditions (background versus additional noise), and tests were conducted using psychological examination tools. Chi-square tests and general linear models were used to assess the differences of impacts on cognition between the two groups. After adjusting for socio-demographic covariates, the noise significantly affected the results of full-scale IQ, verbal IQ, Continuous Performance Test scores, and Children's Color Trails Test and Stroop test scores. The groups at high risk of learning difficulties were more affected by noise than low-risk groups.

The sample comprised 36,956 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, who participated in the Study of Cardiovascular Risks in Adolescents, a nationwide, cross-sectional, school-based study. CVH was assessed by the LE8 score (0-100 points), comprising eight metrics categorized into two domains: health behaviors (diet, physical activity, nicotine exposure, and sleep) and health factors (body mass index, non-HDL cholesterol, blood glucose, and blood pressure). Sociodemographic factors were sex, age, type of school, skin color, and region of residence. The results were expressed as means with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). The overall average score was 75.8 points (95 % CI: 75.3-76.3), classified as moderate CVH.

927,927,38665784,"Early recognition of pain in children is crucial, and their self-report is the primary source of information. However, communication about pain in healthcare settings can be challenging. For non-verbal communication regarding different symptoms, children prefer digital tools. The electronic Faces Thermometer Scale (eFTS) utilizes a universal design with colors, face emojis, and numbers on an 11-point scale (0-10) for pain assessment. The aim of this study was to establish content validity of the eFTS for pain assessments in children. A mixed methods design was used. The study took place at a university hospital in eastern Sweden, involving 102 children aged 8-17 years who visited outpatient clinics. Participants were presented with 17 pictures representing varying pain levels and asked to assess hypothetical pain using the eFTS. A think-aloud approach was employed, prompting children to verbalize their thoughts about assessments and the eFTS. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive and comparative statistics, together with a qualitative approach for analysis of think-aloud conversations. A total of 1,734 assessments of hypothetical pain using the eFTS were conducted. The eFTS differentiated between no pain (level 0-1) and pain (level 2-10). However, no clear agreement was found in the differentiation between hypothetical pain intensity levels (level 2-10). The analysis revealed that children utilized the entire scale, ranging from no pain to high pain, incorporating numbers, colors, and face emojis in their assessments. The variability in assessments was influenced by prior experiences, which had an impact on the statistical outcome in our study. However, employing the think-aloud method enhances our understanding of how children utilize the scale and perceive its design, including the incorporation of emotion-laden anchors.

Central scotoma corresponded to retinal lesions in two patients. Full field ERG was normal but multifocal ERG showed decreased amplitude and delayed implicit time in the macular area. EOG was normal except in one patient. Color vision tests were also normal. The phenotype of this Korean family is consistent with NCMD. Linkage analysis is required to confirm the diagnosis.

934,934,37058350,"Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) in mobile health are an intervention design that provides behavior change support based on an individual's changing and dynamic contextual state. However, few studies have documented how end users of JITAI technologies are involved in their development, particularly from historically marginalized families and children. Less is known for public health researchers and designers of the tensions that occur as families negotiate their needs. We aimed to broaden our understanding of how historically marginalized families are included in co-design from a public health perspective. We sought to address research questions surrounding JITAIs; co-design; and working with historically marginalized families, including Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) children and adults, regarding improving sun protection behaviors. We sought to better understand value tensions in parents' and children's needs regarding mobile health technologies and how design decisions are made. We examined 2 sets of co-design data (local and web-based) pertaining to a larger study on mobile SunSmart JITAI technologies with families in Los Angeles, California, United States, who were predominantly of Latinx and multiracial backgrounds. In these co-design sessions, we conducted stakeholder analysis through perceptions of harms and benefits and an assessment of stakeholder views and values. We open coded the data and compared the developed themes using a value-sensitive design framework by examining value tensions to help organize our qualitative data. Our study is formatted through a narrative case study that captures the essential meanings and qualities that are difficult to present, such as quotes in isolation. We presented 3 major themes from our co-design data: different experiences with the sun and protection, misconceptions about the sun and sun protection, and technological design and expectations. We also provided value flow (opportunities for design), value dam (challenges to design), or value flow or dam (a hybrid problem) subthemes. For each subtheme, we provided a design decision and a response we ended up making based on what was presented and the kinds of value tensions we observed. We provide empirical data to show what it is like to work with multiple BIPOC stakeholders in the roles of families and children. We demonstrate the use of the value tension framework to explain the different needs of multiple stakeholders and technology development. Specifically, we demonstrate that the value tension framework helps sort our participants' co-design responses into clear and easy-to-understand design guidelines. Using the value tension framework, we were able to sort the tensions between children and adults, family socioeconomic and health wellness needs, and researchers and participants while being able to make specific design decisions from this organized view. Finally, we provide design implications and guidance for the development of JITAI mobile interventions for BIPOC families.

However, some are complicated by hemorrhage or infection or are associated with calcification. In these instances, difficulties can be encountered distinguishing the complicated cysts from cystic renal tumors such as cystic renal cell carcinoma, multilocular cystic nephroma, and mixed epithelial and stromal tumors. The Bosniak classification is widely used to categorize cystic renal lesions but is used to classify those discovered via computed tomography. Ultrasonography (US) and color Doppler US are the most frequently used imaging techniques for abdominal surveys and long-term follow-up because of their noninvasiveness, relatively low cost, wide availability, and frequently, lack of contrast medium.

A Le Fort III with distraction osteogenesis can be done to correct this. This is a controlled way in which to achieve appreciable stable advancement of the midface without the need for bone grafting, but the vector of the movement is not always predictable. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 3-dimensional effect of Le Fort III distraction osteogenesis with an external frame. Ten patients (aged 7-19 years) who had the procedure were included in the study. The le Fort III procedure and the placement of the external frame were followed by an activation period and then a 3-month retention period. Computed tomographic (CT) images taken before and after operation were converted and loaded into 3-dimensional image rendering software and compared with the aid of a paired sample t test and a colour-coded qualitative analysis. Comparison of the CT data before and after distraction indicated that the amount of midface advancement was significant. Le Fort III distraction osteogenesis is an effective way to advance the midface. However, the movement during osteogenesis is not always exactly in the intended direction, and a secondary operation is often necessary.

941,941,33518502,"Autologous repair using costal cartilage grafts remains the most widely accepted method of microtia reconstruction. A major complication of current techniques is loss of ear shape caused by scarring, contracture and cartilage absorption. We present a new surgical technique utilizing the posterior auricular artery free flap in microsurgical reconstruction of the retroauricular sulcus in microtia. Reconstruction is performed in two stages. In the first stage, a fabricated costal cartilage framework is inserted into a skin pocket as described by Nagata. In the second stage, the ear framework is elevated from the scalp and held by an additional cartilage wedge. Following indocyanine green angiography perforator mapping, a posterior auricular artery perforator flap is harvested from the contralateral (normal) ear and used to reconstruct the posterior auricular sulcus covering the cartilage framework and elevating wedge. The technique was applied to three patients aged 11-15 years with a follow-up time of 8 months to 3 years. The average flap artery diameter was 0.73 mm and the vein was 0.7 mm. Venous congestion occurred in one case and was resolved with a vein graft leading to complete flap recovery. Good ear shape, elevation, projection, skin color and texture were achieved in all the cases. Posterior auricular artery flap reconstruction of the retroauricular sulcus in microtia repair is a useful alternative to the current skin graft and tissue expander-based techniques.

This study aims to investigate the normal range of office BP in a healthy, non-overweight Brazilian population of adolescents. The Brazilian Study of Cardiovascular Risks in Adolescents (Portuguese acronym ""ERICA"") is a national school-based study that included adolescents (aged 12 through 17 years), enrolled in public and private schools, in cities with over 100,000 inhabitants, from all five Brazilian macro-regions. Adolescents' height and body mass index (BMI) were classified in percentiles according to age and gender, and reference curves from the World Health Organization were adopted. Three consecutive office BP measurements were taken with a validated oscillometric device using the appropriate cuff size. The mean values of the last two readings were used for analysis. Polynomial regression models relating BP, age, and height were applied. Among 73,999 adolescents, non-overweight individuals represented 74.5% (95% CI: 73.3-75.6) of the total, with similar distribution across ages. The majority of the non-overweight sample was from public schools 84.2% (95% CI: 79.9-87.7) and sedentary 54.8% (95% CI: 53.7-55.8). Adolescents reporting their skin color as brown (48.8% [95% CI: 47.4-50.1]) or white (37.8% [95% CI: 36.1-39.5]) were most frequently represented. BP increased by both age and height percentile. Systolic BP growth patterns were more marked in males when compared to females, along all height percentiles. The same pattern was not observed for diastolic BP. Blood pressure references by sex, age, and height percentiles for Brazilian adolescents are provided. Referências de pressão arterial (PA) para adolescentes brasileiros estão ausentes na literatura.

950,950,19519722,"Previous research has demonstrated that heavy prenatal alcohol exposure affects the size and shape of the corpus callosum (CC) and compromises interhemispheric transfer of information. The aim of this study was to confirm the previous reports of poorer performance on a finger localization test (FLT) of interhemispheric transfer in a cohort of heavily exposed children and to extend these findings to a cohort of moderately exposed young adults. In Study 1, the FLT was administered to 40 heavily exposed and 23 nonexposed children from the Cape Coloured community of Cape Town, South Africa, who were evaluated for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) dysmorphology and growth. Anatomical images of the CC were obtained using structural MRI on a subset of these children. In Study 2, the FLT was administered to a cohort of 85 moderate-to-heavily exposed young adults participating in a 19-year follow-up assessment of the Detroit Prenatal Alcohol Exposure cohort, whose alcohol exposure had been ascertained prospectively during gestation. In Study 1, children with FAS showed more transfer-related errors than controls after adjustment for confounding, and increased transfer-related errors were associated with volume reductions in the isthmus and splenium of the CC. In Study 2, transfer-related errors were associated with quantity of alcohol consumed per occasion during pregnancy. More errors were made if the mother reported binge drinking (> or =5 standard drinks) during pregnancy than if she drank regularly (M > or = 1 drink/day) without binge drinking. These findings confirm a previous report of impaired interhemispheric transfer of tactile information in children heavily exposed to alcohol in utero and extend these findings to show that these deficits are also seen in more moderately exposed individuals, particularly those exposed to binge-like pregnancy drinking.

951,951,17901767,"A study was undertaken to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of Tc-Tetrofosmin scan and color Doppler in the characterization of benign and malignant solitary thyroid nodules. Fifty-two patients found to have a cold solitary thyroid nodule on Tc-pertechnetate scintigraphy were included in this study. All patients underwent a single-injection dual-phase (30 min and 120 min) Tc-Tetrofosmin scan. The intranodular vascularity was measured using color Doppler sonography. Fine-needle aspiration cytology was performed on all the patients. In the following days and weeks all patients underwent surgery. Thirteen out of 15 patients with thyroid cancer showed delayed retention of radiotracer (on 120 min images as compared to the initial 30 min image). Thirty-six out of 37 patients harboring benign solitary nodules showed significant washout of tracer on delayed images. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of delayed Tc-Tetrofosmin scintigraphy were found to be 86.6, 97.2, 92.8 and 94.7%, respectively. The Doppler study was able to demonstrate increased vascularity in the center of 8 of the 15 malignant nodules. Thirty-two patients harboring a benign solitary nodule showed normal or increased peripheral vascularity on Doppler study. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of color Doppler were found to be 53.5, 86.4, 61.5 and 82%, respectively.

954,954,37791924,"Life history theory posits that multigenerational exposure to adversity and deprivation influences childhood growth and development, including pubertal maturation. We applied this ecological, evolutionary theory to examine the contributions of distal and proximal adversity on early puberty, a potentially important marker for population health. Baseline data from 5,645 girls in the adolescent brain cognitive development study were included. Early puberty was defined as midlate/post pubertal development by age 9-11 years. The contributions of multigenerational Black/Indigenous (Black, Indigenous and People of Color [BIPOC]) or Hispanic identities, intergenerational mental health, economic deprivation, personal trauma exposure and mental health, and proximal biological factors of premature birth and body mass index on early puberty were examined with hierarchical modeling. 1,225 girls (21.7%) had early puberty. BIPOC/Hispanic identity, familial adversity, economic deprivation, personal trauma, depression, and a higher body mass index contributed significantly toward early puberty. The effect of multigenerational adversity remained significant across models, but the likelihood of early puberty decreased sequentially for BIPOC and Hispanic youth as proximal adversities were added (e.g., OR decreased from 2.93 to 2.38 for BIPOC youth), supporting a synergistic effect of layered adversity on early puberty. This analysis supports life history theory as a coherent framework to understand early puberty among girls. Findings suggest monitoring pubertal timing as a population health indictor, like birth weight, prematurity, or life expectancy. Addressing early puberty may require policy and social changes to mitigate the negative impact of multiple layers of adversity including racial/ethnic disadvantage, family, and individual mental health and trauma, as well as economic insecurity.

Visuospatial deficits are considered to be one of the hallmark characteristics of their cognitive profile. However, low-level visual processing has not been previously investigated. Our aim was to study contrast perception in these patients to assess the function of early visual areas. Contrast sensitivity was tested in 19 children and adolescents with NF1 and 33 control children and adolescents and 12 adults with NF1 and 24 control adults. The tasks used probed two achromatic spatiotemporal frequency channels and chromatic red-green and blue-yellow pathways. Individuals with NF1 showed significant contrast sensitivity deficits for the achromatic higher spatial frequency channel [F(₁,₈₃) = 36.1, P < 0.001] and for the achromatic low spatial high temporal (magnocellular) frequency channel [F(₁,₇₂) = 8.0, P < 0.01]. Furthermore, individuals with NF1 presented a significant deficit in chromatic red-green (parvocellular) contrast sensitivity (P < 0.01) but not in blue-yellow (koniocelular) sensitivity. The decrease in achromatic sensitivity for higher spatial frequency was observed throughout the visual field, in both central and peripheral locations. In contrast, central contrast sensitivity for the magnocellular-biased condition was relatively preserved and only peripheral sensitivity was affected.

958,958,18972210,"Finding and accessing members of youth subpopulations, such as young men who have sex with men (YMSM) of color or young females of color, for behavioral or disease surveillance or study recruitment, pose particular challenges. Venue-based sampling strategies--which hinge on where individuals congregate or ""hang out"" rather than where they live--appear to be effective alternatives. Methods used to identify venues focus on engaging members of social networks to learn where targeted populations congregate. However, it is not always clear if and how these methods differ according to gender, whether the youth accessed at a venue are actually from neighborhoods in which the venues are found, and whether the location of venues relative to neighborhoods of residence is different for young men and young women. This study illustrates the gender differences in venue type and venue location where eligible youth study participants from high-risk neighborhoods could be accessed for HIV research across 15 research sites (sites). The findings indicate that the study's method led to identifying venues where one quarter or more of the youth were eligible study participants and from the high-risk neighborhoods. Sites targeting young women of color had a higher proportion of eligible study participants who were also from the high-risk neighborhoods than sites targeting YMSM. Clubs were most commonly identified by sites targeting YMSM as recruitment venues, whereas neighborhood-based service or commercial centers were more common venues for young women of color. This study reveals how venue-based recruitment strategies can be tailored and resources maximized by understanding the key differences in the types of venues preferred by males and females and by recognizing that female-preferred venues are more likely to be closer to home.

963,963,34078334,"Trans women experience high rates of gender-based violence (GBV)-a risk factor for adverse health outcomes. Transphobic hate crimes are one such form of GBV that affect trans women. However, little is understood about factors that shape transphobic hate crimes and racial/ethnic variation in these experiences. To contextualize GBV risk and police reporting, we examined self-reported types and correlates of transphobic hate crimes by racial/ethnic group of trans women in the San Francisco Bay Area. From 2016 to 2018, trans women participated in a longitudinal cohort study of HIV. Secondary data analyses (N = 629) examined self-reported experiences of transphobic hate crimes (i.e., robbery, physical assault, sexual assault, and battery with weapon) by race/ethnicity, and whether hate crimes were reported to the police. Chi-square tests and simple logistic regression examined demographic, sociocultural, and gender identity factors associated with transphobic violence experiences and police reporting. About half (45.8%) of participants reported ever experiencing a transphobic hate crime; only 51.1% of these were reported to the police. Among those who reported a hate crime experience, Black (47.9%) and Latina (49.0%) trans women reported a higher prevalence of battery with a weapon; White (26.7%) and trans women of ""other"" race/ethnicities (25.0%) reported a higher prevalence of sexual assault (p = 0.001). Having one's gender questioned, history of sex work, homelessness as a child and adult, and a history incarceration were associated with higher odds of experiencing a transphobic hate crime. Trans women who felt their gender identity questioned had lower odds of reporting a hate crime to the police compared to those did not feel questioned.

964,964,11737663,"Fungal infections have gained considerable importance over the last decade as a result of significant increase in the incidence of opportunistic and systemic candidosis. Although Candida albicans is the predominant causative agent of candidosis, particularly oral disease, recently an epidemiological trend has been observed where other less pathogenic species of Candida, including the newly characterized species Candida dubliniensis, are emerging as significant opportunistic pathogens. The present study aimed to screen for the presence of C. dubliniensis and to compare the recovery of yeast species from 30 seemingly healthy and 30 HIV-positive children in the United States, as well as from 64 malnourished Nigerian children. Oral samples were cultured for fungal growth, and all germ tube and chlamydospore positive isolates were tested for ability to grow at 45 degrees C to differentiate between C. albicans and C. dubliniensis. All isolates were speciated based on colony color production on CHROMagar medium and sugar assimilation profiles. Among the 30 HIV-positive children, 15 (50%) were positive for fungus; 12 were positive for C. albicans, with one of the latter also positive for Candida glabrata, and three were found to harbor C. dubliniensis. Among the 30 non-HIV-positive children, five C. albicans and four C. dubliniensis isolates were recovered. No C. dubliniensis isolates were recovered from the Nigerian group. However, eight other different yeast species were recovered from 31 (48.4%) of the 64 Nigerian children sampled, with six of them growing a combination of species. In comparing the data from the Nigerian and United States children, the frequency of yeasts in the malnourished Nigerian group was considerably higher. The most striking difference between the two groups was in the variety of the usually less encountered and less pathogenic yeast species recovered from the Nigerian population. The findings support previously reported observations that there may be intrinsic differences between different populations sampled and that malnutrition might favor the presence of yeast species other than C. albicans.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to demonstrate the validity of the Worth four dot test in patients with congenital red-green color vision defects who have normal or abnormal binocular vision. A retrospective review of medical records was performed on 30 consecutive congenital red-green color vision defect patients who underwent the Worth four dot test. The type of color vision anomaly was determined by the Hardy Rand and Rittler (HRR) pseudoisochromatic plate test, Ishihara color test, anomaloscope, and/or the 100 hue test. All patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination. Binocular sensory status was evaluated with the Worth four dot test and Randot stereotest. The results were interpreted according to the presence of strabismus or amblyopia. Among the 30 patients, 24 had normal visual acuity without strabismus nor amblyopia and 6 patients had strabismus and/or amblyopia. The 24 patients without strabismus nor amblyopia all showed binocular fusional responses by seeing four dots of the Worth four dot test. Meanwhile, the six patients with strabismus or amblyopia showed various results of fusion, suppression, and diplopia.

966,966,18277355,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrinopathy, affecting 5-10% of women in the reproductive age group, with a wide spectrum of phenotypes. The cardinal features are hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction and/or polycystic ovary (PCO) appearance. Three major diagnostic criteria for PCOS have been proposed by the National Institute of Health (NIH 1990), the Rotterdam European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology/American Society for Reproductive Medicine sponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop Group (ESHRE/ASRM 2003) and the recent task force of the Androgen Excess Society (AES 2006). The PCO appearance is not a prerequisite for the diagnosis of PCOS. The aim of this review was to assess the available evidence in order to highlight the role of ultrasound in the diagnosis and management of PCOS. The evidence supports positive correlation between ultrasound features and biochemical indices of PCOS suggesting that ultrasound could play a role in prediction of PCOS severity and prognosis. Recent advances in ultrasonography resulted in a change of emphasis on the relative importance of total ovarian volume, follicle number and ovarian stromal changes in the diagnosis of PCO. In particular, ovarian stromal area/total area (S/A) ratio seems to have the most efficient diagnostic performance for hyperandrogenism. Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound is a relatively new imaging modality that has the potential to improve the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound without adding much to the practical management of the syndrome. In addition to its role in the definition of PCO, ultrasound is helpful to predict fertility outcome in patients undergoing treatment.

967,967,27021149,"In September 2015, the member states of the United Nations endorsed sustainable development goals (SDG) for 2030 that aspire to human rights-centered approaches to ensuring the health and well-being of all people. The SDGs embody both the UN Charter values of rights and justice for all and the responsibility of states to rely on the best scientific evidence as they seek to better humankind. In April 2016, these same states will consider control of illicit drugs, an area of social policy that has been fraught with controversy, seen as inconsistent with human rights norms, and for which scientific evidence and public health approaches have arguably played too limited a role. The previous UN General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on drugs in 1998 – convened under the theme “a drug-free world, we can do it!” – endorsed drug control policies based on the goal of prohibiting all use, possession, production, and trafficking of illicit drugs. This goal is enshrined in national law in many countries. In pronouncing drugs a “grave threat to the health and well-being of all mankind,” the 1998 UNGASS echoed the foundational 1961 convention of the international drug control regime, which justified eliminating the “evil” of drugs in the name of “the health and welfare of mankind.” But neither of these international agreements refers to the ways in which pursuing drug prohibition itself might affect public health. The “war on drugs” and “zero-tolerance” policies that grew out of the prohibitionist consensus are now being challenged on multiple fronts, including their health, human rights, and development impact. The Johns Hopkins –  The pursuit of drug prohibition has generated a parallel economy run by criminal networks. Both these networks, which resort to violence to protect their markets, and the police and sometimes military or paramilitary forces that pursue them contribute to violence and insecurity in communities affected by drug transit and sales. In Mexico, the dramatic increase in homicides since the government decided to use military forces against drug traffickers in 2006 has been so great that it reduced life expectancy in the country. Injection of drugs with contaminated equipment is a well-known route of HIV exposure and viral hepatitis transmission. People who inject drugs (PWID) are also at high risk of tuberculosis. The continued spread of unsafe injection-linked HIV contrasts the progress that has been seen in reducing sexual and vertical transmission of HIV in the last three decades. The Commission found that that repressive drug policing greatly contributes to the risk of HIV linked to injection. Policing may be a direct barrier to services such as needle and syringe programmes (NSP) and use of non-injected opioids to treat dependence among those who inject opioids, known as opioid substitution therapy (OST). Police seeking to boost arrest totals have been found to target facilities that provide these services to find, harass, and detain large numbers of people who use drugs. Drug paraphernalia laws that prohibit possession of injecting equipment lead PWID to fear carrying syringes and force them to share equipment or dispose of it unsafely. Policing practices undertaken in the name of the public good have demonstrably worsened public health outcomes. Amongst the most significant impacts of pursuit of drug prohibition identified by the Commission with respect to infectious disease is the excessive use of incarceration as a drug-control measure. Many national laws impose lengthy custodial sentences for minor, non-violent drug offenses; people who use drugs (PWUD) are over-represented in prison and pretrial detention. Drug use and drug injection occur in prisons, though their occurrence is often denied by officials. HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission occurs among prisoners and detainees, often complicated by co-infection with TB and in many places multidrug-resistant TB, and too few states offer prevention or treatment services in spite of international guidelines that urge comprehensive measures, including provision of injection equipment, for people in state custody. Mathematical modelling undertaken by the Commission illustrates that incarceration and high HCV risk in the post-incarceration period can contribute importantly to national HCV incidence amongst PWID in a range of countries with varying levels of incarceration, different average prison sentences, durations of injection, and OST coverage levels in prison and following release. For example, in Thailand where PWID may spend nearly half their injection careers in prison, an estimated 63% of incident HCV infection could occur in prison. In Scotland, where prison sentences are shorter for PWUD and OST coverage is relatively high in prison, an estimated 54% of incident HCV infection occurs in prison, but as much as 21% may occur in the high-risk post-release period. These results underscore the importance of alternatives to prison for minor drug offences, ensuring access to OST in prison, and a seamless link from prison services to OST in the community. The evidence also clearly demonstrates that drug law enforcement has been applied in a discriminatory way against racial and ethnic minorities in a number of countries. The US is perhaps the best documented but not the only case of racial biases in policing, arrest, and sentencing. In 2014, African American men were more than five times more likely than whites to be incarcerated in their lifetime, though there is no significant difference in rates of drug use among these populations. The impact of this bias on communities of people of color is inter-generational and socially and economically devastating. The Commission also found significant gender biases in current drug policies. Of women in prison and pretrial detention around the world, a higher percentage are detained because of drug infractions than is the case for men. Women involved in drug markets are often on the bottom rungs – as couriers or drivers – and may not have information about major traffickers to trade as leverage with prosecutors. Gender and racial biases have marked overlap, making this an intersectional threat to women of color, their children, families, and communities. In both prison and the community, HIV, HCV and TB programmes for PWUD – including testing, prevention and treatment – are gravely underfunded at the cost of preventable death and disease. In a number of middle-income countries where large numbers of PWUD live, HIV and TB programmes for PWUD that were expanded with support from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria have lost funding due to changes in the Fund’s eligibility criteria. There is an unfortunate failure to emulate the example of Western European countries that have eliminated unsafe injection-linked HIV as a public health problem by sustainably scaling up prevention and care and enabling minor offenders to avert prison. Political resistance to harm reduction measures dismisses strong evidence of their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Mathematical modeling shows that if OST, NSP and antiretroviral therapy for HIV are all available, even if the coverage of each of them is not over 50%, their synergy can lead to effective prevention in a foreseeable future. PWUD are often not seen to be worthy of costly treatments, or they are thought not to be able to adhere to treatment regimens in spite of evidence to the contrary. Lethal drug overdose is an important public health problem, particularly in light of rising consumption of heroin and prescription opioids in some parts of the world. Yet the Commission found that the pursuit of drug prohibition can contribute to overdose risks in numerous ways. It creates unregulated illegal markets in which it is impossible to control adulterants of street drugs that add to overdose risk. Several studies also link aggressive policing to rushed injection and overdose risk. People with a history of drug use, over-represented in prison because of prohibitionist policies, are at extremely high risk of overdose when released from state custody. Lack of ready access to OST also contributes to injection of opioids, and bans on supervised injection sites cut off an intervention that has proven very effective in reducing overdose deaths. Restrictive drug policies also contribute to unnecessary controls on naloxone, a medicine that can reverse overdose very effectively. Though a small percentage of PWUD will ever need treatment for drug dependence, that minority faces enormous barriers to humane and affordable treatment in many countries. There are often no national standards for quality of drug dependence treatment and no regular monitoring of practices. In too many countries, beatings, forced labor, and denial of health care and adequate sanitation are offered in the name of treatment, including in compulsory detention centres that are more like prisons than treatment facilities. Where there are humane treatment options, it is often the case that those most in need of it cannot afford it. In many countries, there is no treatment designed particularly for women, though it is known that women’s motivations for and physiological reactions to drug use differ from those of men. The pursuit of the elimination of drugs has led to aggressive and harmful practices targeting people who grow crops used in the manufacture of drugs, especially coca leaf, opium poppy, and cannabis. Aerial spraying of coca fields in the Andes with the defoliant glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl glycine) has been associated with respiratory and dermatological disorders and with miscarriages. Forced displacement of poor rural families who have no secure land tenure exacerbates their poverty and food insecurity and in some cases forces them to move their cultivation to more marginal land. Geographic isolation makes it difficult for state authorities to reach drug crop cultivators in public health and education campaigns and it cuts cultivators off from basic health services. Alternative development programmes meant to offer other livelihood opportunities have poor records and have rarely been conceived, implemented, or evaluated with respect to their impact on people’s health. Research on drugs and drug policy has suffered from the lack of a diversified funding base and assumptions about drug use and drug pathologies on the part of the dominant funder, the US government. At a time when drug policy discussions are opening up around the world, there is an urgent to bring the best of non-ideologically-driven health science, social science and policy analysis to the study of drugs and the potential for policy reform. Concrete experiences from many countries that have modified or rejected prohibitionist approaches in their response to drugs can inform discussions of drug policy reform. A number of countries, such as Portugal and the Czech Republic, decriminalised minor drug offenses years ago, with significant savings of money, less incarceration, significant public health benefits, and no significant increase in drug use. Decriminalisation of minor offenses along with scaling up low-threshold HIV prevention services enabled Portugal to control an explosive unsafe injection-linked HIV epidemic and likely enabled the Czech Republic to prevent one from happening. Where formal decriminalisation may not be an immediate possibility, scaling up health services for PWUD can demonstrate the value to society of responding with support rather than punishment to people who commit minor drug infractions. A pioneering OST program in Tanzania is encouraging communities and officials to consider non-criminal responses to heroin injection. In Switzerland and the city of Vancouver, Canada, dramatic improvements in access to comprehensive harm reduction services, including supervised injection sites and heroin-assisted treatment, transformed the health picture for PWUD. Vancouver’s experience also illustrates the importance of meaningful participation of PWUD in decision-making on policies and programmes affecting their communities. Policies meant to prohibit or greatly suppress drugs present a paradox. They are portrayed and defended vigorously by many policy-makers as necessary to preserve public health and safety, and yet the evidence suggests they have contributed directly and indirectly to lethal violence, communicable disease transmission, discrimination, forced displacement, unnecessary physical pain, and the undermining of people’s right to health. Some would argue that the threat of drugs to society may justify some level of abrogation of human rights for protection of collective security, as is also foreseen by human rights law in case of emergencies. International human rights standards dictate that in such cases, societies still must choose the least harmful way to address the emergency and that emergency measures must be proportionate and designed specifically to meet transparently defined and realistic goals. The pursuit of drug prohibition meets none of these criteria. Standard public health and scientific approaches that should be part of policy-making on drugs have been rejected in the pursuit of prohibition. The idea of reducing the harm of many kinds of human behavior is central to public policy in the areas of traffic safety, tobacco and alcohol regulation, food safety, safety in sports and recreation, and many other areas of human life where the behavior in question is not prohibited. But explicitly seeking to reduce drug-related harms through policy and programmes and to balance prohibition with harm reduction is regularly resisted in drug control. The persistence of unsafe injection-linked HIV and HCV transmission that could be stopped with proven, cost-effective measures remains one of the great failures of the global responses to these diseases. Drug policy that is dismissive of extensive evidence of its own negative impact and of approaches that could improve health outcomes is bad for all concerned. Countries have failed to recognise and correct the health and human rights harms that pursuit of prohibition and drug suppression have caused and in so doing neglect their legal responsibilities. They readily incarcerate people for minor offenses but then neglect their duty to provide health services in custodial settings. They recognize uncontrolled illegal markets as the consequence of their policies, but they do little to protect people from toxic, adulterated drugs that are inevitable in illegal markets or the violence of organized criminals, often made worse by policing. They waste public resources on policies that do not demonstrably impede the functioning of drug markets, and they miss opportunities to invest public resources wisely in proven health services for people often too frightened to seek services. To move toward the balanced policy that UN member states have called for, we offer the following recommendations:  ",2967,Public health and international drug policy,"Csete J, Kamarulzaman A, Kazatchkine M, Altice F, Balicki M, Buxton J, Cepeda J, Comfort M, Goosby E, Goulão J, Hart C, Kerr T, Lajous AM, Lewis S, Martin N, Mejía D, Camacho A, Mathieson D, Obot I, Ogunrombi A, Sherman S, Stone J, Vallath N, Vickerman P, Zábranský T, Beyrer C.",Lancet. 2016 Apr 2;387(10026):1427-1480. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00619-X.

968,968,9164637,"Various clinical and biochemical observations point to a relationship between degree of disease expression and metabolic disturbance in autosomal recessive congenital erythropoietic porphyria (Günther's disease). Although the clinical manifestations have been well described since Günther's fundamental observations, an interdependence between disease severity and porphyrin excess has yet to be elucidated. We investigated porphyrin metabolism in nine Indian patients suffering from the characteristic clinical symptoms: skin photosensitivity, red-colored urine as a sign of extremely elevated porphyrinuria and mild to severe hemolytic anemia. Porphyrins in urine, feces and blood were analysed by HPTLC and HPLC in conjunction with spectrophotometry and spectrofluorometry. Uroporphyrinogen III synthase activities in red blood cells were determined using a coupled-enzyme assay. Biochemical studies revealed varying degrees of porphyrinuria with total urinary porphyrins between 23 and 102 mumol/24 h (normal < 0.2 mumol/24 h) and uroporphyrin predominance. Urinary and fecal coproporphyrin isomer I were markedly elevated to 87-97% and 81-93% (normal < 31%, < 75%), respectively. Overproduction of porphyrins led to a considerable porphyrinemia with mainly copro- and protoporphyrin. A hitherto undescribed fecal porphyrin pattern with increased protoporphyrin levels was found in three patients. This atypical finding was probably related to severe hemolysis since protoporphyrin can be excreted only via the liver with bile in the feces. High porphyrin levels in urine, feces and blood were associated with worse cutaneous symptoms. Activities of uroporphyrinogen III synthase in red blood cell lysates were decreased to between 9% and 30% of controls. Patients showed increased porphobilinogen deaminase activities, up to 190% of control. Deficiency of uroporphyrinogen III synthase activity was reflected by inversion of the relationship between and isomer III leading to dominance of isomer I. Elevation of porphobilinogen deaminase activities is related to hemolysis and, additionally, to regulatory compensation for the enzyme deficiency. Variations in both the severity of photosensitivity and the enhancement of porphyrin production and excretion indicate the molecular heterogeneity of this disease. These findings suggest a close relationship between the metabolic disturbance reflected by porphyrin excess and the severity of disease expression.

969,969,27810684,"Infants with asymmetric brain injury (asymBI) are at high risk of Unilateral Cerebral Palsy (UCP). The Grasp and Reach Assessment of Brisbane (GRAB) was developed to detect asymmetries in unimanual/bimanual upper limb (UL) reach and grasp behaviours in infants with asymBI. This study reports the development of the GRAB and evaluates its construct validity and internal consistency. Prospective study of twenty four infants with asymBI and twenty typically developing (TD) infants at 18 weeks corrected age (C.A.) in a structured play session. Three different coloured toys were presented at the midline in a block design of six 30-s trials of toy presentation, separated by five 30-s trials of no toy presentation. The number and duration of: (i) unimanual contacts; (ii) unimanual grasps; (iii) bimanual midline grasps; and (iv) duration of other unimanual behaviours (e.g. prehensile movements and transport phase) were measured. An Asymmetry Index (AI) was calculated to determine asymmetries between ULs. Possible AI values ranged from 0 to 100%, indicating proportion of toy presentation time that unimanual behaviours were asymmetric between ULs. Internal consistency of both the Time Phase (TP) and Toy Colour Phase (TCP) test items were determined by calculating Cronbach's alpha coefficients. Each assessment occasion was split into six TPs and two TCPs; whereby one TP comprised one 30-s trial of one toy presentation and one TCP comprised two 30-s trials of the same toy presentation. For TP, seven out of nine unimanual behaviours and two out of three bimanual behaviours demonstrated strong internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficients 0.72-0.89). No unimanual activity demonstrated the strongest IC (0.89). For TCP, six out of nine unimanual behaviours demonstrated strong IC (0.73-0.82). Number of unimanual contacts and duration of unimanual prehensile movements demonstrated the strongest IC (0.82). Duration of unimanual contribution to hands at midline and duration of bimanual midline behaviour demonstrated the weakest IC for both TP and TCP (0.46-0.50). For unimanual contacts, the asymBI group were more asymmetric between ULs (mean AI=50%) compared to the TD group (mean AI=30%). For unimanual grasps, both groups were similarly asymmetric (both mean AI=40%). The TD group were almost twice as likely to demonstrate bimanual grasps as the asymBI group (incidence rate ratio IRR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.5, p<0.001). Infants with asymBI were less likely to use the impaired UL compared to the unimpaired UL for grasping (IRR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5 to 0.8, p<0.001); and used the impaired UL for a shorter proportion of time compared to the unimpaired UL for grasping (mean difference -9.1%, 95% CI -16.6 to -1.7, p=0.02). The GRAB is a criterion-referenced research measure that detects and quantifies the presence or absence of unimanual and bimanual reach and grasp behaviours at 18 weeks C.A. in infants at risk of UCP. The GRAB demonstrated moderate to strong construct validity and strong IC within an assessment occasion. There was no toy preference or warm-up effect for TP or TCP for either group; confirming that the GRAB is a consistent measure across toy presentations within an assessment occasion. In this study, the GRAB identified that infants with asymBI demonstrated a paucity of bimanual grasping compared to TD infants; and demonstrated asymmetric unimanual grasping between ULs at 18 weeks C.A.

970,970,9809955,"We investigated the role of three-dimensional echocardiography in assessing mitral valve anatomy in greater detail in patients immediately before and after balloon mitral valvuloplasty (BMV). Three-dimensional echocardiography is a recently developed, evolving imaging technique that allows visualization of intracardiac structures from any perspective. We studied 19 patients undergoing BMV using transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) (Chicago, Illinois) to image the mitral valve. The TEE was interfaced to a TomTec three-dimensional workstation that allows electrocardiographic and respiratory cycle gated image acquisition. The acquired images are digitized, and after postprocessing a three-dimensional image is reconstructed. The mitral valve was viewed ""en-face"" as if looking up from the left ventricle. The mean mitral valve area (by pressure half-time from the Doppler of the two-dimensional echocardiogram) increased after BMV from 0.86+/-0.06 cm2 to 2.07+/-0.10 cm2, p < 0.0001. This was similar to the mitral valve areas obtained by planimetry from the three-dimensional images. The three-dimensional reconstructions showed a complete commissural split in 10 patients and partial splitting in 9 patients. In three of the eight patients who had an increase in the amount of mitral regurgitation secondary to BMV, the three-dimensional reconstructions were able to detect tears within the valve leaflet. One leaflet tear actually extended up to the mitral valve annulus and was associated with the only case of severe mitral regurgitation.

973,973,2131357,"To assess the usefulness of transesophageal Doppler echocardiography (TEE) in diagnosing atrial septal defect (ASD), we studied eight cases with secundum type ASD, in which the diagnosis was confirmed by cardiac catheterization and surgery. In all cases, TEE provided clear images of the interatrial septum with its defect. Shunt flow through the defect was observed by color Doppler technique, and its velocity was measured using the FFT mode. In two cases, right-to-left shunt blood flow was detected. Two types of probes were used in this study, a lateral scanning probe and a longitudinal scanning probe. The scanning plane of the former was perpendicular to the axis of the probe, and that of the latter was parallel to it. The two probes facilitated the measurement of the two right-angled dimensions, with which we could calculate the defect area, assuming the defect to be an ellipse. The volume of a left-to-right shunt was obtained by multiplying the defect area by the integration of flow velocity against time. Shunt volume per cardiac cycle obtained by this method correlated well with that obtained by the Fick's method during cardiac catheterization. In six cases without a right-to-left shunt, the coefficient of correlation was 0.98, and in all eight cases it was reduced to 0.72. Thus, we concluded that TEE is useful for diagnosing and evaluating ASD.

Vitamin D is essential for strong bones as it helps to absorb calcium from diet. Vitamin D deficiency mainly occurs if strict vegetarian diet is followed as mostly the source of vitamin D is animal based; therefore, exposure to sunlight is restricted or having dark skin color. Low vitamin D levels results in increased possibility of gestational diabetes among pregnant women, low birth weight and pre-eclampsia in infants, and mothers may suffer bone impairment, osteoporosis, hypocalcaemia, and hypertension.

975,975,12714607,"To determine the width of the posterior vitreous base in human eyes of different ages and to clarify the nature of the postoral retinovitreous adhesion that underlies the development of juxtabasal retinal tears and retinal detachment after posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). The posterior limit of the vitreous base was delineated with indocyanine green after mechanical peeling of the postbasal vitreous cortex from the retina in 58 pairs of donor eyes. The area of residual retinovitreous adhesion was measured by image analysis. Scanning electron microscopy was performed on the undersurface (or retinal aspect) of the inner limiting lamina (ILL) after trypsin digestion of the peripheral retina. An age-dependent increase in the anteroposterior dimension of the posterior vitreous base was revealed that became progressively wider in eyes of male donors than in those of female donors and in the nasal half compared with the temporal half of the globe. Ultrastructural studies showed progressive invasion of the innermost peripheral retina by bundles of collagen fibrils, initially in the form of characteristic braids splaying out beneath the ILL and eventually as a dense sublaminar mat in the elderly. The collagen fibrils penetrated the ILL through localized defects and intertwined with those in the basal gel. With aging, the posterior border of the vitreous base migrates posteriorly so that an annular band of firm adhesion eventually straddles the ora serrata eccentrically. Intraretinal synthesis of collagen fibrils, their penetration of the ILL, and their splicing with cortical vitreous fibrils, underlie the slowly evolving retinovitreous adhesion.

A total of 82 newly diagnosed acute leukemia cases (43 adult myeloid leukaemia, AML cases and 39 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, ALL cases) and 16 relapsed cases (8 AML cases and 8 ALL cases) were studied. The MTS assay was performed using two cytotoxic drugs, dnr and ara-C. Cells were incubated with different concentrations of drugs for 4 days and the IC50 was extrapolated from the viability curve. In newly diagnosed cases, we found that childhood ALL samples showed higher IC50 values of dnr (0.040 +/- 2.320) compared to adult AML samples (0.021 +/- 0.158). In contrast, newly diagnosed adult AML samples showed higher IC50 values of ara-C (0.157 +/- 0.529) compared to childhood ALL samples (0.100 +/- 2.350). In relapsed cases, two samples of childhood ALL showed IC50 values of dnr (0.910 +/- 1.760) and ara-C (1.310 +/- 2.390), which was higher compared to childhood AML samples (0.129 +/- 0.214 and 0.210 +/- 0.003, respectively).

In the vast majority of reported cases, a diagnosis of intrathoracic liver tissue was made either after a thoracic surgery or during a postmortem examination. However, once included in differential diagnosis, surgical intervention or biopsy procedures may be avoided with optimal diagnostic approach. In the present study, we conducted a literature review and proposed a new classification method for accessory liver within the thoracic cavity. This approach may provide a better understanding of underlying pathophysiology and aid in determination of optimal diagnostic modality and clinical management of such cases. According to our literature review, type II ectopic liver is the most common subtype followed by types I and III. All types can be definitively diagnosed with imaging modalities. On the other hand, it is important to prevent patients, particularly children, from unnecessary radiation exposure during performance of sophisticated diagnostic imaging modalities. Ultrasound is a safe, low-cost and accessible imaging modality that has not been previously reported in diagnosis of this entity. With addition of Color Doppler Imaging, ultrasound may allow for diagnosis with high precision in types I and II, as demonstrated in the present study.

This study aims to clinically and genetically characterize the segregating CRD phenotype in two large, consanguineous Pakistani families. Funduscopy, optical coherence tomography (OCT), electroretinography (ERG), color vision, and visual acuity assessments were performed to evaluate the retinal structure and function of the affected individuals. Exome sequencing was performed to identify the genetic cause of CRD. Furthermore, the mutation's effect was evaluated using purified, bacterially expressed ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 3 (ARL3) and mammalian cells. Fundus photography and OCT imaging demonstrated features that were consistent with CRD, including bull's eye macular lesions, macular atrophy, and central photoreceptor thinning. ERG analysis demonstrated moderate to severe reduction primarily of photopic responses in all affected individuals, and scotopic responses show reduction in two affected individuals. The exome sequencing revealed a novel homozygous variant (c.296G>T) in ARL3, which is predicted to substitute an evolutionarily conserved arginine with isoleucine within the encoded protein GTP-binding domain (R99I). The functional studies on the bacterial and heterologous mammalian cells revealed that the arginine at position 99 is essential for the stability of ARL3. Our study uncovers an additional CRD gene and assigns the CRD phenotype to a variant of ARL3.

We report that, compared with controls, the OCD group had significantly poorer performance and less activation in the prefrontal cortex during the Stroop color-word task. Surprisingly, while serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors treatment reduced OCD symptomology, it did not improve the diminished hemodynamic responses or task performance of these patients.

A total of 75 patient with diagnostic criteria for NF were evaluated. Neuro-ophthalmological examination as well as electrophysiological and imaging studies were performed. Special attention was given to the presence of visual dysfunction and to its correlation with the ophthalmic changes that were found. Ocular findings were present in 42 (56%) patients. Visual dysfunction was identified in only 11 (14.7%) patients. Visual acuity decrease was the most prevalent change, being present in eight (72.7%) of patients with visual dysfunction. Nystagmus, strabismus, visual field defects, and color vision defects were also detected. Therapy is also reviewed. The prognosis of the 11 patients with visual dysfunction was unfavorable, and is discussed. The prevalence of NF and ophthalmological findings related to it make the problem of visual dysfunction in NF a serious one, deserving of the attention of all ophthalmologists. Clinical examination, associated with complementary diagnostic techniques (mainly imaging studies), allows NF's identification, definition, and therapy. The high prevalence of asymptomatic ocular findings in NF (73.8%) highlights the role of imaging techniques in its evaluation.

Clitoromegaly due to clitoral priapism and clitoral priapism after appendectomy have not been reported previously. A 7-year-old girl was referred for enlargement of the clitoris. She reported having a mild, pulsating clitoral pain starting three days after an appendectomy operation. Subsequently, painful swelling and an increase in the size of the clitoris was observed. Her growth and physical examination were otherwise normal. Causes of the clitoromegaly due to androgen excess were excluded after a comprehensive work-up. Color Doppler ultrasound revealed a high peak systolic velocity and resistance in the cavernosal artery, consistent with clitoral priapism. The clitoromegaly and associated symptoms improved significantly with oral pseudoephedrine and intracavernosal aspiration.

992,992,21636302,"Pathogenic mutations in the OPA1 gene are the most common identifiable cause of autosomal dominant optic atrophy (DOA), which is characterized by selective retinal ganglion cell loss, a distinctive pattern of temporal pallor of the optic nerve and a typical color vision deficit, with variable effects on visual acuity. Haploinsufficiency has been suggested as the major pathogenic mechanism for DOA. Here we present two siblings with severe ataxia, hypotonia, gastrointestinal dysmotility, dysphagia, and severe, early-onset optic atrophy who were found to be compound heterozygotes for two pathogenic OPA1 mutations. This example expands the clinical phenotype of OPA1-associated disorders and provides additional evidence for semi-dominant inheritance. Molecular analysis of the OPA1 gene in this family by Sanger sequencing revealed compound heterozygosity for two mutations in trans configuration, a p.I382 M missense mutation and a p.V903GfsX3 frameshift deletion in both affected siblings. Electron microscopy of a skeletal muscle biopsy of the older sibling revealed dense osmiophilic bodies within the mitochondria. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content was within normal limits, and electron transport chain analysis showed no deficiencies of the mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes. Multiple mtDNA deletions were not found. Compound heterozygosity of pathogenic OPA1 mutations may cause severe neuromuscular phenotypes in addition to early-onset optic atrophy. While a role for OPA1 in mtDNA maintenance has been discussed, compound biallelic pathogenic OPA1 mutations in our patients did not result in altered mtDNA copy number, mtDNA deletions, or deficiencies of the electron transport chain, despite the severe clinical phenotype.

Classic trichoepithelioma typically presents as a skin-colored papule or nodule on the face or upper trunk; lesions have a predilection for the nose. Trichoepithelioma can be sporadic or familial and solitary or multiple. Most previously reported multiple trichoepithelioma cases are familial, and germline CYLD mutations could be detected in some patients. We performed mutational analysis of the germline CYLD gene in 8 Chinese multiple trichoepitheliomas patients, 6 of which were sporadic cases. A heterozygous missense mutation (c.1112C>A) in the 9th exon of the CYLD gene was detected in some mother-daughter patients. However, the germline CYLD mutation could not be detected in the 6 non-familial cases. The results suggest that the pathogenesis of sporadic multiple trichoepitheliomas may differ from that of familial cases.

Megalencephaly with cutis tri-color of the Blaschko-linear type pigmentary mosaicism and intellectual disability is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder attributed to the recurrent mosaic c.5930C > T (p.Thr1977Ile) MTOR variant. This variant was previously reported at low to intermediate levels of mosaicism in the peripheral blood of three unrelated individuals with consistent clinical findings. We report a fourth case of a 3-year-old female presenting with megalencephaly, obstructive hydrocephalus due to cerebral aqueductal stenosis, asymmetric polymicrogyria, dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, hypotonia, developmental delay, and cutaneous pigmentary mosaicism. Oligonucleotide and SNP chromosomal microarray (CMA), karyotype, and trio whole exome sequencing (WES) in the peripheral blood, as well as a targeted gene variant panel from fibroblasts derived from hyperpigmented and non-hyperpigmented skin did not detect any abnormalities in MTOR or other genes associated with brain overgrowth syndromes. Unlike the previously reported cases, the de novo c.5930C > T (p.Thr1977Ile) MTOR variant was detected at 32% mosaicism in our patient only after WES was performed on fibroblast-derived DNA from the hyperpigmented skin.

B-cell differentiation across ages in AD, and its relation to disease severity scores, has not been well defined. To compare the frequency of B-cell subsets in blood of 0-5, 6-11, 12-17, and ≥18 years old patients with AD versus age-matched controls. Flow cytometry was used to measure B-cell subset frequencies in the blood of 27 infants, 17 children, 11 adolescents, and 31 adults with moderate-to-severe AD and age-matched controls. IgD/CD27 and CD24/CD38 core gating systems and an 11-color flow cytometry panel were used to determine frequencies of circulating B-cell subsets. Serum total and allergen-specific IgE (sIgEs) levels were measured using ImmunoCAP®. Adolescents with AD had lower frequencies of major B-cells subsets (p < .03). CD23 expression increased with age and was higher in AD compared to controls across all age groups (p < .04). In AD patients, multiple positive correlations were observed between IL-17-producing T-cells and B-cell subsets, most significantly non-switched memory (NSM) B-cells (r = .41, p = .0005). AD severity positively correlated with a list of B-cell subsets (p < .05). IL-9 levels gradually increased during childhood, reaching a peak in adolescence, paralleling allergen sensitization, particularly in severe AD. Principal component analysis of the aggregated environmental sIgE data showed that while controls across all ages tightly clustered together, adolescents with AD demonstrated distinct clustering patterns relative to controls. Multiple correlations between B-cells and T-cells, as well as disease severity measures, suggest a complex interplay of immune pathways in AD. Unique B-cell signature during adolescence, with concurrent allergen sensitization and IL-9 surge, point to a potentially wider window of opportunity to implement interventions that may prevent the progression of the atopic march.

997,997,31000316,"Hydroxocobalamin, a precursor molecule to vitamin B12, has emerged as the preferred empiric treatment for patients rescued from enclosed-space fires with concern for inhalational injury and potential concomitant cyanide toxicity. Limited data exist on the effects of hydroxocobalamin toxicity, particularly in pediatric patients. We report a case of a healthy three-year old girl who was rescued from an apartment fire and electively intubated by prehospital providers. Due to concern for potential cyanide toxicity, she received 5 g (373 mg/kg) of intravenous hydroxocobalamin, an amount equivalent to one standard adult dose but over five times the appropriate weight-adjusted dose for this 13.4-kilogram child. On hospital arrival, patient was noted to have chromaturia and diffuse erythroderma without cutaneous burns. She was extubated 4 h after prehospital intubation and discharged home the following morning in good condition with persistent erythroderma. Skin color returned to normal within two days. We believe this to be the first reported case of iatrogenic pediatric hydroxocobalamin overdose for the treatment of suspected cyanide toxicity. Erythroderma and chromaturia are expected side effects of hydroxocobalamin, even at therapeutic levels. Along with minor airway burns, the only other finding was a transient and hemodynamically neutral bradycardia, which began shortly after prehospital intubation. As this bradycardia occurred prior to hydroxocobalamin administration, more likely culprits include vagal nerve stimulation from direct laryngoscopy, and sinoatrial muscarinic receptor stimulation caused by repeated doses of succinylcholine. In all, we were unable to appreciate any complications due to excess hydroxocobalamin administration.

We sought to measure if the disparities seen in the geographic distribution of other COVID-19 healthcare resources were also present during the initial rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine. Using a comprehensive COVID-19 vaccine database (VaccineFinder), we built an empirically parameterized spatial model of access to essential resources that incorporated vaccine supply, time-willing-to-travel for vaccination, and previous vaccination across the US. We then identified vaccine deserts-US Census tracts with localized, geographic barriers to vaccine-associated herd immunity. We link our model results with Census data and two high-resolution surveys to understand the distribution and determinates of spatially accessibility to the COVID-19 vaccine. We find that in early 2021, vaccine deserts were home to over 30 million people, >10% of the US population. Vaccine deserts were concentrated in rural locations and communities with a higher percentage of medically vulnerable populations. We also find that in locations of similar urbanicity, early vaccination distribution disadvantaged neighborhoods with more people of color and older aged residents. Given sufficient vaccine supply, data-driven vaccine distribution to vaccine deserts may improve immunization rates and help control COVID-19. COVID-19 has affected the elderly, people of color, and individuals with chronic illnesses more than the general population. Large barriers to accessing the COVID-19 vaccine could make this problem worse. We used a website called VaccineFinder, which has information on the location of most COVID-19 vaccine doses in the US, to measure vaccine accessibility in early 2021. We then identified vaccine deserts, defined as small US regions with poor access to the COVID-19 vaccine. We found that over 10% of the US lived in a vaccine desert. Overall, we found that vaccines were less available to people in rural areas, people of color, and individuals with chronic illnesses.
