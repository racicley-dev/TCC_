0,0,31693457,"For persons living with chronic conditions, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) symptoms, such as pain, anxiety, depression, and insomnia, often interact and mutually reinforce one another. There is evidence that medical cannabis (MC) may be efficacious in ameliorating such symptoms and improving HRQoL. As many of these HRQoL symptoms may mutually reinforce one another, we conducted an exploratory study to investigate how MC users perceive the efficacy of MC in addressing co-occurring HRQoL symptoms.

1,1,39294485,"The rapidly changing policy climate related to cannabis legalization has led to drastic changes in cannabis use in the United States (US). Medical cannabis use is increasing overall, but at a faster rate among older adults compared to other age groups. The aim was to investigate older adults' cannabis use behaviors and attitudes around disclosing medical cannabis use to their primary healthcare providers (HCPs). Nineteen older adults (ages 65+ years) with self-reported medical cannabis use were recruited from flyers posted in ambulatory clinics in San Diego, CA. Surveys and semi-structured interviews on cannabis use were completed. A multi-methods approach was used to analyze data. Participants' mean age was 75.3 years; 52.6% identified as women, and 89.5% as White. Cannabis was used by all participants to treat pain and by 75% for insomnia, with 25-33% reductions in use of prescription medications to treat these symptoms. Approximately 89% reported their primary HCPs were aware of their cannabis use, and 84.2% felt very comfortable/comfortable talking to HCPs about cannabis. Common themes from interviews included participants (1) being motivated to disclose cannabis use to their HCPs to seek medical advice on dosing, side effects, and benefits of cannabis, (2) feeling comfortable disclosing cannabis use as legalization has eased the stigma around cannabis use, and (3) perceiving mostly neutral attitudes from HCPs on their cannabis use. The study emphasizes the pivotal role of HCPs as educators in addressing patient inquiries about cannabis, underlining the need for equipping healthcare professionals with evidence-based knowledge through education and training initiatives.

2,2,16202145,"The New South Wales State Government recently proposed a trial of the medical use of cannabis. Australians who currently use cannabis medicinally do so illegally and without assurances of quality control. Given the dearth of local information on this issue, this study explored the experiences of medical cannabis users. Australian adults who had used cannabis for medical purposes were recruited using media stories. A total of 147 respondents were screened by phone and anonymous questionnaires were mailed, to be returned by postage paid envelope. Data were available for 128 participants. Long term and regular medical cannabis use was frequently reported for multiple medical conditions including chronic pain (57%), depression (56%), arthritis (35%), persistent nausea (27%) and weight loss (26%). Cannabis was perceived to provide ""great relief"" overall (86%), and substantial relief of specific symptoms such as pain, nausea and insomnia. It was also typically perceived as superior to other medications in terms of undesirable effects, and the extent of relief provided. However, nearly one half (41%) experienced conditions or symptoms that were not helped by its use. The most prevalent concerns related to its illegality. Participants reported strong support for their use from clinicians and family. There was almost universal interest (89%) in participating in a clinical trial of medical cannabis, and strong support (79%) for investigating alternative delivery methods. Australian medical cannabis users are risking legal ramifications, but consistent with users elsewhere, claim moderate to substantial benefits from its use in the management of their medical condition. In addition to strong public support, medical cannabis users show strong interest in clinical cannabis research, including the investigation of alternative delivery methods.

3,3,12618922,"Cannabis occurs naturally in the dried flowering or fruiting tops of the Cannabis sativa plant. Cannabis is most often consumed by smoking marihuana. Cannabinoids are the active compounds extracted from cannabis. Recently, there has been renewed interest in cannabinoids for medicinal purposes. The two proven indications for the use of the synthetic cannabinoid (dronabinol) are chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and AIDS-related anorexia. Other possible effects that may prove beneficial in the oncology population include analgesia, antitumor effect, mood elevation, muscle relaxation, and relief of insomnia. Two types of cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, have been detected. CB1 receptors are expressed mainly in the central and peripheral nervous system. CB2 receptors are found in certain nonneuronal tissues, particularly in the immune cells. Recent discovery of both the cannabinoid receptors and endocannabinoids has opened a new era in research on the pharmaceutical applications of cannabinoids. The use of cannabinoids should be continued in the areas indicated, and further studies are needed to evaluate other potential uses in clinical oncology.

4,4,35970642,"Over the past century a dramatic decline in sleep duration among adolescents, such as more than one hour of sleep loss per night, has been reported. A debt in sleep duration could lead to sleep deprivation, a major risk factor associated with daytime sleepiness. Sleepiness refers to the inability to maintain an adequate level of alertness during the day which may result in more or less being able to control falling asleep at inappropriate times. This literature review updates on sleepiness regarding its characteristics, etiology and consequences on adolescents. Studies revealed that from 25 % to 78 % of adolescents had reported sleepiness. Its manifestations may include heavy lids, yawns, difficulties to concentrate and emotional irritability. In addition, while it is recommended that adolescents under 18 years-old should sleep from eight to ten hours a night, only 63 % of them actually do so. The etiology of sleep deprivation and sleepiness in this population can be explained by various biological and societal factors. First, the sleep-wake cycle of adolescents shows a biological shift from the beginning of pubertal maturation, described as a perfect storm. It refers to a social jetlag by going to sleep and waking up later and accumulating a sleep debt during weekdays which they try to reimburse during weekends. This phenomenon can be explained by physiological changes such as a slower accumulation of sleep pressure. In addition to this perfect storm, environmental and societal factors contribute to the social jetlag and reduce sleep duration in adolescents. Screen exposure before bedtime can delay sleep and wake onset, which is a risk factor for sleeping debt. Substance use such as caffeine, cigarettes or electronic vaporizer, ADHD or freely available medication, alcohol, cannabis use or drug consumption could further disrupt sleep-wake cycle by stimulating, depressing or otherwise disrupting the central nervous system. Early, before 8:30 am, class start times have been associated with chronic sleep deprivation, higher level of sleepiness and delayed melatonin peak secretion. Adolescents working or doing extracurricular occupations for more than 20hours a week are more at risk for reduced sleep duration and sleepiness. Parental supervision about sleep during the weekdays were associated with more appropriate bedtime. Adolescents from low socio-demographic characteristics and from minority ethnic groups have reported displaying a shorter sleep duration. Finally, sleep disorders of a physiological origin such as narcolepsy, sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome, may explain the sleep deprivation and sleepiness. Sleep deprivation and sleepiness in adolescents have consequences on their health. Cognitive functioning, such as problem solving, attention or memory, as well as school performance, can be compromised by sleep deprivation and sleepiness. At the psychological level, adolescents reporting sleepiness are more prone to display mental health problems: associations were found between sleepiness and subjective perception of depression, anxiety, somatic complaints as well as with antisocial behaviors. Finally, 68 % of 16 year-old adolescents reported they drove a car, and the reported sleepiness could lead to road accidents due to reduced attentional functioning, reaction time and decision-making abilities. In the United-States, from 7 % to 16.5 % of deadly accidents were related to driving while drowsy. Highlighting etiology and problems associated with sleep deprivation and sleepiness in adolescents could guide researchers and clinicians towards the development of possible interventions. Public health measures and knowledge transfer programs regarding modifiable psychosocial and societal factors associated with sleep-wake bioregulation could increase awareness in parents as well as in political and societal decision makers.

However, there is little guidance for SUD researchers regarding the use of technologies to objectively assess sleep outcomes in randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). This systematic review aimed to describe the use of technologies to objectively measure sleep outcomes in RCTs conducted in persons with SUDs, in order to inform future sleep intervention studies in SUD populations.

RCTs were reviewed here if they were peer-reviewed manuscripts that included objective measures of sleep in RCTs that sought to improve sleep in persons with SUDs. The initial search yielded 13,403 potential articles, with 27 meeting a priori criteria to be included in this review. The most common SUD was alcohol use disorder (59%). The most common technology used to assess sleep was polysomnography (41%), followed by actigraphy (37%), ambulatory polysomnography or components of polysomnography (e.g., electroencephalography; 19%), and at-home sleep apnea testing (7%). The most common sleep outcome reported was total sleep time (96%). There are a range of options to assess objective sleep outcomes. Polysomnography or ambulatory devices that directly measure brain activity are critical to advance medications through the regulatory process for the indication of improving sleep duration, continuity, and/or sleep onset latency outcomes. Actigraphy is also useful in preliminary investigations and in detecting the relationship between diurnal and SUD-related behaviors.

We seek to define the patterns of MC use among cancer patients, as well as efficacy and safety of MC. Cancer patients attending oncology office visits at Beaumont Hospital, Michigan from July to December 2018 were anonymously surveyed. The survey included data regarding demographics, diagnosis, treatment, symptom burden, and MC use. Patients who reported MC use since their cancer diagnosis completed a section on patterns of use, efficacy, and safety. The response rate was 188 of 327 (57.5%). MC use was reported by 46 of 188 (24.5%). A median composite baseline symptom score ranging from 8 (best) to 32 (worst) was higher in patients using MC versus nonusers; 17.5 versus 14.4 (P<0.001). Pain was the symptom with the highest frequency of improvement 34/42 (81%), followed by appetite 34/44 (77.3%), and anxiety 32/44 (73%). MC improved the ability to tolerate treatment in 24/44 (54.5%). Cloudy thinking is the symptom that worsened the most 7/42 (16.7%), with decreased energy being experienced by 4/41 (9.8%) of the users. MC was utilized by a significant portion of cancer patients in this sample, across age, diagnosis, stage, and treatment. Patients with a higher severity of baseline symptoms were more likely to use MC and report a favorable efficacy profile of MC. Minimal toxicity was reported in this cohort.

The thematic analysis focused on phases of CU and sources of cannabis products and information. Reported motivations for initiation of CU included curiosity, peer pressure, and dissatisfaction with conventional treatments. Factors such as psychotropic effects and coping with mental health symptoms and insomnia contributed to the continuation of CU. More negative effects, including cognitive dysfunction, worsening of mood, and anxiety symptoms, were acknowledged with ongoing CU. Concerning findings included common initiation of CU before age 18, combined medical and recreational CU, rare consultation of medical professionals on CU, and potential effects and harms.

Placebo was administered at bedtime during one abstinence period (withdrawal test) and extended-release zolpidem, a non-benzodiazepine GABA(A) receptor agonist, was administered during the other. Polysomnographic (PSG) sleep architecture measures, subjective ratings, and cognitive performance effects were assessed each day. During the placebo-abstinence period, participants had decreased sleep efficiency, total sleep time, percent time spent in Stage 1 and Stage 2 sleep, REM latency and subjective sleep quality, as well as increased sleep latency and time spent in REM sleep compared with when they were using cannabis. Zolpidem attenuated the effects of abstinence on sleep architecture and normalized sleep efficiency scores, but had no effect on sleep latency. Zolpidem was not associated with any significant side effects or next-day cognitive performance impairments. These data extend prior research that indicates abrupt abstinence from cannabis can lead to clinically significant sleep disruption in daily users.

Two-hundred and twenty seven participants (117 ecstasy/polydrug users, 53 cannabis users and 57 drug naive participants) took part. The participants completed measures of daytime sleepiness, and indicators of sleep quality. The results demonstrated that ecstasy/polydrug users viewed themselves as being more evening types and having poorer sleep quality than cannabis users and drug naive participants. They were also more likely to have missed a night's sleep.

17,17,24474865,"Cannabis is one of the most widely used illicit drugs worldwide. However, while the rates of cannabis dependence and treatment increase, there remains no medications approved for this use. Due to its sedative effects and low abuse liability, the typical antipsychotic pericyazine has been utilized in some parts of Australia for the treatment of cannabis dependence. We aimed to provide documentation of preliminary outcomes and acceptability of pericyazine treatment in a small sample. A naturalistic case series study was conducted in which 21 patients were enrolled for a 4-week course of pericyazine (up to 8 × 2.5 mg tablets daily) and weekly medical review. Levels of cannabis use were reported and side effects with electrocardiography and blood tests were monitored. Measures of dependence severity, depression, anxiety, and insomnia were taken at baseline and follow-up utilizing validated psychometric tools. Significant reductions in cannabis use, depression, anxiety, and insomnia severity occurred across time. Pericyazine appeared to be well tolerated and easily administered in the community clinics. The results provide some preliminary evidence that low-dose short-term pericyazine may be an acceptable mode of treatment in this population. Given the open-label nature of the design, we cannot conclude that pharmacotherapy was uniquely responsible for the treatment effect. Nonetheless, low-dose pericyazine may be a potentially effective approach to the treatment of cannabis dependence, and further evaluation via a randomized placebo-controlled trial is warranted.

18,18,39196883,"Drugs have actions that may be classified as therapeutic effects and side effects; side effects are actions that do not contribute to therapeutic benefit. Some side effects are neutral; others, experienced as undesirable or unpleasant, are recorded as adverse effects. Some drug actions are therapeutic for some disorders and adverse for others; or therapeutic during acute illness and adverse during maintenance treatment. As an example, anticholinergic action may be adverse when a tricyclic antidepressant is used to treat depression but therapeutic when the drug is used to treat irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea. In clinical practice, side or adverse effects of a drug may be leveraged to manage troublesome symptoms. As an example, the sedative effect of a low dose of trazodone may be useful for some patients with insomnia. With this background, studies have examined whether the increase in appetite and weight associated with olanzapine and mirtazapine may be effective against anorexia and cachexia associated with cancer and cancer chemotherapy. The subject is important because cachexia may be present in 30%-50% of patients with cancer (with higher prevalence in patients with more advanced cancer) and because the presence of cachexia is associated with a higher risk of disease progression and mortality. Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have examined pharmacologic interventions such as progestins, corticosteroids, anamorelin, and medical cannabis for cancer related cachexia; most results have been disappointing. A recent RCT found that olanzapine (2.5 mg/d for 12 weeks) improved appetite, weight, other nutritional parameters, and quality of life in patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer treated with chemotherapy. Another RCT, however, found that mirtazapine (30 mg/d for 8 weeks) brought no nutritional or anthropometric gain in patients with cancer and anorexia. It is concluded that olanzapine but not mirtazapine merits further investigation in patients with cancer who have anorexia and cachexia.

In this study we carried out the most comprehensive investigation so far of the demographic, economic, social and clinical correlates of self-reported paranoia in the general population. Data weighted to be nationally representative were analysed from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey in England (APMS 2007; n=7281). The prevalence of paranoid thinking in the previous year ranged from 18.6% reporting that people were against them, to 1.8% reporting potential plots to cause them serious harm. At all levels, paranoia was associated with youth, lower intellectual functioning, being single, poverty, poor physical health, poor social functioning, less perceived social support, stress at work, less social cohesion, less calmness, less happiness, suicidal ideation, a great range of other psychiatric symptoms (including anxiety, worry, phobias, post-traumatic stress and insomnia), cannabis use, problem drinking and increased use of treatment and services. Overall, the results indicate that paranoia has the widest of implications for health, emotional well-being, social functioning and social inclusion.

21,21,34290290,"Cigarette smoking is a modifiable behaviour associated with mental health. We investigated the degree of genetic overlap between smoking behaviours and psychiatric traits and disorders, and whether genetic associations exist beyond genetic influences shared with confounding variables (cannabis and alcohol use, risk-taking and insomnia). Second, we investigated the presence of causal associations between smoking initiation and psychiatric traits and disorders. We found significant genetic correlations between smoking and psychiatric disorders and adult psychotic experiences. When genetic influences on known covariates were controlled for, genetic associations between most smoking behaviours and schizophrenia and depression endured (but not with bipolar disorder or most psychotic experiences). Mendelian randomization results supported a causal role of smoking initiation on psychiatric disorders and adolescent cognitive and negative psychotic experiences, although not consistently across all sensitivity analyses. In conclusion, smoking and psychiatric disorders share genetic influences that cannot be attributed to covariates such as risk-taking, insomnia or other substance use. As such, there may be some common genetic pathways underlying smoking and psychiatric disorders. In addition, smoking may play a causal role in vulnerability for mental illness.

22,22,26285109,"Sleep disturbance is a hallmark feature of cannabis withdrawal. In this study we explored the effects of lithium treatment supplemented with nitrazepam on objective and subjective measures of sleep quality during inpatient cannabis withdrawal. Treatment-seeking cannabis-dependent adults (n = 38) were admitted for 8 days to an inpatient withdrawal unit and randomized to either oral lithium (500 mg) or placebo, twice daily in a double-blind RCT. Restricted nitrazepam (10 mg) was available on demand (in response to poor sleep) on any 3 of the 7 nights. Dependent outcome measures for analysis included repeated daily objective actigraphy and subjective sleep measures throughout the 8 day detox, subjective cannabis withdrawal ratings, and detoxification completion rates. Based on actigraphy, lithium resulted in less fragmented sleep compared to placebo (p = 0.04), but no other objective measures were improved by lithium. Of the subjective measures, only nightmares were suppressed by lithium (p = 0.04). Lithium did not have a significant impact on the use of nitrazepam. Sleep bout length (p < 0.0001), sleep efficiency (p < 0.0001), and sleep fragmentation (p = 0.05) were improved on nights in which nitrazepam was used. In contrast, only night sweats improved with nitrazepam from the subjective measures (p = 0.04). A Cox regression with daily repeated measures of sleep efficiency averaged across all people in the study a predictor suggests that a one-unit increase in sleep efficiency (the ratio of total sleep time to the total time in bed expressed as a percentage) resulted in a 14.6% increase in retention in treatment (p = 0.008, Exp(B) = 0.854, 95% CI = 0.759-0.960). None of the other sleep measures, nor use of lithium or nitrazepam were significantly associated with retention in treatment. Lithium seems to have only limited efficacy on sleep disturbance in cannabis withdrawal. However the nitrazepam improved several actigraphy measures of sleep disturbance, warranting further investigation. Discord between objective and subjective sleep indices suggest caution in evaluating treatment interventions with self-report sleep data only.

Many different synthetic cannabinoid analogues are on the consumer market and sold under misleading names, like ""spice"" or ""incense."" A limited number of studies have reported serious health effects associated with SC use. In this study, we compared clinical and subclinical psychopathological symptoms associated with SC use and natural cannabis (NC) use. A convenience sample of 367 NC and SC users was recruited online, including four validated psychometric questionnaires: The Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Altman Mania Scale (Altman), and Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). The two groups were compared with analysis of variance (ANOVA) and covariance (ANCOVA), chi The SC user group did not differ in age from the NC user group (27.7 years), but contained less females (21% and 30%, respectively). SC users scored higher than NC users on all used psychometric measures, indicating a higher likelihood of drug abuse, sleep problems, (hypo)manic symptoms, and the nine dimensions comprising the BSI, somatization, obsessive-compulsive behavior, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism. Odds ratios (95% CI) for the SC user group vs NC user group were, respectively, drug dependence 3.56 (1.77-7.16), (severe) insomnia 5.01 (2.10-11.92), (hypo-)mania 5.18 (2.04-13.14), and BSI psychopathology 5.21 (2.96-9.17).

This employed a cross-sectional design. The sample consisted of 162 adults (mean age = 42.05 years, SD = 14.8; 22% female), with current recommendations from a doctor for medical cannabis, recruited from a medical cannabis dispensary. Consistent with previous research, individuals with heightened depression symptoms had greater problematic cannabis use. In addition, perceived sleep quality moderated this relation, such that depression symptoms differentially related to problematic cannabis use as a function of perceived quality of sleep (ΔR(2) = .03, p = .02). Participants with higher levels of depression and good perceived sleep quality had the greatest rates of problematic cannabis use. These results suggest that individuals with heightened depression may have higher rates of problematic cannabis use, in part, because of the beneficial effects of cannabis in terms of perceived sleep quality.

Approximately two-thirds of the sample (67.8%) reported at least one moderate or severe withdrawal symptom. The most commonly observed symptom was sleep difficulties (50.3%), followed by anxiety (27.8%), irritability (26.7%), and appetite disturbance (25.2%). Patients with low mental functioning had significantly higher rates of withdrawal symptom endorsement than patients with high mental functioning. However, no association was observed between physical functioning and withdrawal symptom endorsement. These patterns of association were consistent in multivariate analyses that controlled for other potentially confounding variables. Cannabis withdrawal symptomology is highly prevalent among patients who use medical cannabis at least three times a week.

Patients with stable MS at 22 UK centres were randomised to oral cannabis extract (CE) (N=144) or placebo (N=135), stratified by centre, walking ability and use of antispastic medication. This double blind, placebo controlled, phase III study had a screening period, a 2 week dose titration phase from 5 mg to a maximum of 25 mg of tetrahydrocannabinol daily and a 10 week maintenance phase. The primary outcome measure was a category rating scale (CRS) measuring patient reported change in muscle stiffness from baseline. Further CRSs assessed body pain, spasms and sleep quality. Three validated MS specific patient reported outcome measures assessed aspects of spasticity, physical and psychological impact, and walking ability. The rate of relief from muscle stiffness after 12 weeks was almost twice as high with CE than with placebo (29.4% vs. 15.7%; OR 2.26; 95% CI 1.24 to 4.13; p=0.004, one sided). Similar results were found after 4 weeks and 8 weeks, and also for all further CRSs. Results from the MS scales supported these findings. The study met its primary objective to demonstrate the superiority of CE over placebo in the treatment of muscle stiffness in MS. This was supported by results for secondary efficacy variables.

The present study examined the sleep characteristics of alcohol and cannabis users recruited from the wider community. Two hundred forty-eight self-identified alcohol and/or cannabis users (131 women and 117 men) with a mean age of 26.41 years completed an online study that was advertised via online forums, print media and flyers. As part of the study, participants completed validated sleep scales assessing sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) in addition to validated drug scales assessing alcohol (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) and cannabis (Marijuana Screening Inventory) use. Problems with sleep quality were more commonly reported than were complaints of excessive daytime sleepiness. Clinically significant poor sleep quality was associated with comorbid problem alcohol and cannabis use. Women reporting problem alcohol and cannabis use had poorer sleep outcomes than men. Social drug users who report risky alcohol and cannabis use also report poor sleep. Poor sleep quality likely exacerbates any drug-associated problems in non-clinical populations.

37,37,37273370,"Acute aortic dissection (AD) involves the tearing of the aortic intima by shearing forces, resulting in a false lumen, which, depending on its location and extent, may lead to hemodynamic compromise, hypoperfusion of vital organs, or even rupture of the aorta. The classical presentation is a sudden chest or back pain described as sharp or ripping in quality. We present a 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension, Liddle's syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic cannabis use for insomnia who arrived at a non-PCI hospital complaining of severe retrosternal chest pain lasting several hours in evolution that started upon masturbation. The pain was ripping in character, starting retrosternally and radiating to his neck and back. After evidence of rising troponin values, he was initially diagnosed with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), managed with dual antiplatelet therapy with full anticoagulation, and subsequently transferred to our institution for further care. Shortly after his arrival at our hospital, he suddenly deteriorated with recurrent chest pain and hypotension, which triggered an emergent bedside echocardiogram evaluation. This revealed a hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion, moderate to severe aortic valve regurgitation (AR), and an intimal flap visualized on the ascending and descending aorta, suggestive of an extensive AD. A computerized tomographic angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of a Stanford type A AD that required an emergent surgical pericardiotomy, ascending aorta with partial arch replacement, and aortic valve repair. Often, AD may mimic an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or even present with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The appropriate diagnostic imaging evaluation prior to the initiation of anticoagulation therapy should be done in patients with higher-risk clinical criteria for AD to reduce adverse treatment outcomes. The use of a simple three-step diagnostic algorithm for acute aortic syndromes (AAS) may decrease diagnostic delays, misdiagnosis, and inappropriate therapies.

Recent research has connected the role of microglial cells with psychiatric disorders such as substance abuse. The aim was to show the effect of two major components of cannabis on circadian genes regulation in microglial cells. In BV-2 microglial cells, cannabidiol (CBD) induces a deregulation of circadian genes with (P-value = 0.039) or without (P-value = 0.0015) lipopolisaccharides stimulation. CBD up regulated Arntl (P = 9.72E-5) and down regulated Clock (P = 0.0034) in BV-2 cells. Temporal expression of Arntl (light and dark P = 0.0054) and Clock (light and dark P = 0.047) was confirmed to have 24 hours light and dark rhythmic regulation in dissected suprachiasmatic nucleus as well as of Cb1 cannabinoid receptor (light and dark P = 0.019). In BV-2 microglia cells, CBD also up regulated CRY2 (P = 0.0473) and PER1 (P = 0.0131).

Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)-regularized Cox regression was used to refine and externally validate a refined version of a five-item individualized, transdiagnostic, clinically based risk calculator previously developed (Harrell's C = 0.79) and piloted for implementation. The refined version included 14 additional NLP-predictors: tearfulness, poor appetite, weight loss, insomnia, cannabis, cocaine, guilt, irritability, delusions, hopelessness, disturbed sleep, poor insight, agitation, and paranoia. A total of 92 151 patients with a first index diagnosis of nonorganic and nonpsychotic mental disorder within the SLaM Trust were included in the derivation (n = 28 297) or external validation (n = 63 854) data sets.

The relationship between poor sleep quality and the use of alcohol and illicit substances among university students has not been studied. Our study aimed to determine these relationships and the factors influencing the risk of poor sleep in students from health sciences degrees which are the future healthcare providers. A cross-sectional study performed in European university students (n = 676). Sleep quality was assessed by measuring insomnia symptoms with the Athens insomnia scale (AIS). The CRAFFT screening test and AUDIT test were used to measure the use of substances of abuse. Insomnia symptoms were highly prevalent (40.2%) and more common among the youngest students (p = 0.012), who had been studying at the university for less time (p = 0.018), and had high levels of illicit drug use (p = 0.037). Good sleep quality represented a significant protective factor for problematic drug use, with an OR of 0.8 (CI95%: 0.76-0.99). In contrast, the category ""not having a job"" represents risk 1.2 times higher (CI95%: 1.025-1.557) for problematic drug use. The CRAFFT score significantly predicted higher insomnia symptoms (AIS ≥ 6), yielding an OR of 1.2 (CI95%:1.10-1.32, p < 0.001). Poor sleep quality is common in university students. There is an inverse association between higher insomnia symptoms and illicit drug abuse being a good sleep qualitya protective factor against problematic use of illicit drugs.

This study was conducted with orthopaedic trauma patients in a level 1 trauma center. A convergent mixed-methods design was used. Data on pain experience, pain management strategies used and AEs were collected with self-administered questionnaires at hospital discharge (T1) and at 3 months after injury (T2). Patients' preferences about the pain management strategies used, the required support and AEs were further examined through semi-structured individual interviews at the same time measures. Descriptive statistics and thematic analyses were performed. Seventy-one patients were recruited and 30 individual interviews were undertaken. Pharmacological pain management strategies used at T1 and T2 were mainly opioids (95.8%; 20.8%) and acetaminophen (91.5%; 37.5%). The most frequently applied non-pharmacological strategies were sleep (95.6%) and physical positioning (89.7%) at T1 and massage (46.3%) and relaxation (32.5%) at T2. Findings from quantitative and qualitative analyses highlighted that non-pharmacological strategies, such as comfort, massage, distraction, and physical therapy, were perceived as the most effective by participants.

Of the 233 patients included in the study, 98% were forced to discontinue complementary or alternative treatments during lockdown. Up to 30% of responders who had been treated with medical cannabis had to stop due to logistic difficulties and this was associated with significantly higher scores of WPI/SSS (p=0.024). Higher levels of anxiety and depression were significantly correlated with higher levels of pain, sleep disorders and subjective perception of deterioration (p=0.00). Higher scores of social support and positive life approach were correlated with less anxiety and depression (p<0.01), lower levels of pain (p<0.05) and less sleep disturbances (p<0.01).

53,53,39474237,"Medical cannabis (MC) is available upon certification for one of several qualifying conditions in Florida, USA. Previous studies suggested that some people seek cannabis for medical conditions/symptoms beyond those legally permitted. However, data remain limited on patient motives for seeking MC and their experiences around its impact on their health. We aimed to compare reported qualifying conditions for MC certification with the most frequently self-reported reasons for using MC while assessing the alignment between the two and understanding the perceived impacts of MC on self-reported conditions and symptoms. We conducted a cross-sectional study using survey data from the Medical Marijuana and Me (M A total of 632 participants completed the survey, of whom 396 (62.66%) were female and 471 (74.53%) were non-Hispanic white. The median (IQR) age was 45 (35, 58). The most frequently reported qualifying conditions were post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) ( Qualifying conditions and self-reported reasons for using MC aligned for most respondents. Yet, a notable proportion of respondents sought MC for broader treatment effects beyond those delineated by the officially recognized qualifying conditions in Florida, USA. Most patients perceived positive effects, including those with limited available evidence on efficacy. In Florida, USA, medical cannabis (MC) is accessible for certified individuals with specific health conditions. Previous research found that many people seek MC for conditions beyond the officially approved ones. We aimed to understand the alignment between qualifying conditions per statute, the reasons patients reported for using MC, and the perceived impacts on health conditions and symptoms. In a 2022 survey of 632 MC users, the top reported qualifying conditions were post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), medical condition comparable to listed conditions, and chronic nonmalignant pain. The top ten self-reported reasons for using MC were anxiety, chronic pain, depression, PTSD, headaches/migraine, fibromyalgia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, high blood pressure, and cancer. Many patients reported multiple reasons for MC use, including typically one reason that matched their reported qualifying condition. Most respondents noted improvements in anxiety, depression, chronic pain, insomnia, PTSD, headaches/migraine, ADHD, bipolar disorder, and fibromyalgia. These findings suggest that in addition to the officially recognized qualifying conditions, people often use MC for a broader range of conditions and symptoms, some of which are not included in the current statute and/or without evidence of efficacy.

The current study examined daily-level associations between perceived sleep health and SAM use, relative to non-substance-use days and alcohol- or marijuana-only days. We also estimated linear associations between alcohol/marijuana use and perceived sleep health and explored whether effects were moderated by combined use of alcohol and marijuana. A community sample of SAM-using young adults (N = 409; Mage = 21.61, SD = 2.17; 50.9% female; 48.2% White; 48.9% college students) completed twice-daily surveys for five 14-day sampling bursts. Daily measurements assessed substance use and perceived sleep health in terms of subjective sleep quality, negative impact of sleep on functioning, and symptoms of insomnia. Multilevel models indicated that, relative to non-substance-use days, participants reported poorer perceived sleep health on alcohol-only days, better perceived sleep health on marijuana-only days, and mixed evidence regarding SAM use (i.e. fewer perceived symptoms of insomnia, but poorer perceived next day functioning attributed to sleep). Daily-level estimates showed increased alcohol use was associated with poorer perceived sleep health, while stronger effects from marijuana were associated with better perceived sleep health. Across all indices of sleep health, only one linear association was moderated by combined use: The adverse association between alcohol and next day functioning was weaker on days alcohol was combined with marijuana. Findings provide additional evidence for daily-level effects of alcohol and marijuana use on perceived sleep health and address an important literature gap regarding potential adverse effects of SAM use.

More than half of current users were aged 75 and older, and one-quarter were aged 85 and older. Most current users were white women. Of current users, 44% used marijuana products at least weekly for common conditions including chronic pain, depression, anxiety, and insomnia, and most found marijuana helpful for these conditions. Most respondents reported obtaining marijuana recreationally (67%) without a prescription. Nine respondents reported negative side effects attributable to marijuana use. To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize marijuana use of older adults in a state in which it is legal for medical and recreational use. Marijuana was used for several common geriatric conditions, and respondents reported few side effects.

60,60,37279315,"Introduction Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is associated with many unhealthy behaviors. Psychoactive substance (alcohol and drugs) use is present in 78% of adults with BPD. Moreover, a poor sleep seems linked to the clinical profile of adults with BPD. Finally, some physical comorbid disorders like obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes are linked to physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors. However, to this day no study analyzed these behaviors in French-speaking individuals with BPD. Objectives This study's goal is to document health behaviors in adults with BPD in Canada and in France. Method This cross-sectional study consists of an online survey on the LimeSurvey platform including validated questionnaires distributed in France and Canada. To measure physical activity, we used the ""Global Physical Activity Questionnaire."" Insomnia was measured with the ""Insomnia Severity Index."" Substance use was measured with the ""Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Test."" Descriptive statistics (N,% and mean) are used to describe previously mentioned health behaviors. Five regression models have been realized to find the main associated variables (age, perceived social status, education level, household income, body mass index, emotional regulation difficulties, BPD symptoms, depression level, previous suicide attempts and psychotropic medication use) to health behaviors. Results A total of 167 participants (92 Canadians, 75 French; 146 women, 21 men) filled out the online survey. In this sample, 38% of Canadians and 28% of French reported doing less than 150 minutes of physical activity weekly. Insomnia affected 42% of Canadians and 49% of French. Tobacco use disorder affected 50% of Canadians and 60% of French. Alcohol use disorder affected 36% of Canadians and 53% of French. Cannabis use disorder affected 36% of Canadians and 38% of French. All tested variables were linked to physical activity (R² = 0.09). Insomnia was only linked with BPD symptoms (R² = 0.24). Tobacco use disorder was linked to social status and alcohol use disorder (R² = 0.13). Alcohol use disorder was linked to social status, body mass index, tobacco use disorder, and depression (R² = 0.16). Finally, cannabis use disorder was linked to age, body mass index, tobacco use disorder, depression, and past suicide attempts (R² = 0.26). Conclusion These results are essential to design health prevention interventions in French-speaking adults with BPD in Canada and in France. They help identify the main factors associated with these health behaviors.

In this study, we examined the content of marijuana advertising on Weedmaps, a popular website that markets marijuana retailers online. A total of 146 recreational marijuana retailers in Colorado and Washington were examined on Weedmaps. We studied the age verification practices made in retailers' own websites, the presence of health claims they made about marijuana on Weedmaps, and the characteristics of followers of Weedmaps on social media sites. Many retailers had no security measure to determine age (41 % in Colorado, 35 % in Washington). Approximately 61 % of retailers in Colorado and 44 % in Washington made health claims about the benefits of marijuana, including anxiety reduction, treatment of depression, insomnia, and pain/inflammation. Inferred demographic characteristics of followers of Weedmaps on Twitter and Instagram revealed that over 60 % were male and nearly 70 % or more were age 20-29 years old, yet some (15-18 %) were under the age of 20. Our findings indicate that marijuana retailers have a visible presence on the Internet. Potential customers might be enticed by retailers who tout health claims about marijuana use. It may also be appealing for a younger demographic to overlook age restrictions and engage with marijuana retailers via social media.

This retrospective study of 104 male inmates with serious mental illness prescribed nabilone analyzes the indications, efficacy, and safety of its use. Medications discontinued with the initiation of nabilone were also reviewed. The results showed nabilone targeting a mean of 3.5 indications per patient, thus likely reducing polypharmacy risk. The mean final dosage was 4.0 mg. Results indicated significant improvement in PTSD-associated insomnia, nightmares, PTSD symptoms, and Global Assessment of Functioning and subjective improvement in chronic pain. Medications associated with greater risk for adverse effects or abuse than nabilone were often able to be discontinued with the initiation of nabilone, most often antipsychotics and sedative/hypnotics.

68,68,35754104,"Sleep problems and substance use frequently co-occur. While substance use can result in specific sleep deficits, genetic pleiotropy could explain part of the relationship between sleep and substance use and use disorders. Here we use the largest publicly available genome-wide summary statistics of substance use behaviours (N = 79,729-632,802) and sleep/activity phenotypes to date (N = 85,502-449,734) to (1) assess the genetic overlap between substance use behaviours and both sleep and circadian-related activity measures, (2) estimate clusters from genetic correlations and (3) test processes of causality versus genetic pleiotropy. We found 31 genetic correlations between substance use and sleep/activity after Bonferroni correction. These patterns of overlap were represented by two genetic clusters: (1) tobacco use severity (age of first regular tobacco use and smoking cessation) and sleep health (sleep duration, sleep efficiency and chronotype) and (2) substance consumption/problematic use (drinks per day and cigarettes per day, cannabis use disorder, opioid use disorder and problematic alcohol use) and sleep problems (insomnia, self-reported short sleep duration, increased number of sleep episodes, increased sleep duration variability and diurnal inactivity) and measures of circadian-related activity (L5, M10 and sleep midpoint). Latent causal variable analyses determined that horizontal pleiotropy (rather than genetic causality) underlies a majority of the associations between substance use and sleep/circadian related measures, except one plausible genetically causal relationship for opioid use disorder on self-reported long sleep duration.

69,69,35986953,"Transgender and nonbinary (TGNB) individuals are a health disparity population at high risk for sleep disturbance (e.g., insomnia). Recent evidence suggests minority stress (e.g., discrimination) is associated with sleep disturbance in TGNB adults. However, investigators have yet to identify factors that might explain this relationship. In this study, we investigated the role of problematic drug use (PDU) in the relationship between discrimination and sleep disturbance in TGNB individuals. The study sample included 194 TGNB participants from Wave 5 (2021) of Project AFFIRM, a multi-site longitudinal study of transgender health. Discrimination, PDU, and sleep disturbance were measured using the Everyday Discrimination Scale, Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT), and PROMIS Sleep Disturbance measures, respectively. Individuals were classified as having PDU using established DUDIT criteria that were applied based on sex assigned at birth. Regression analyses were used to estimate the associations of study variables, and subsequently, mediation analysis was used to determine whether PDU partially mediated the association between discrimination and sleep disturbance. Nearly half of participants reported PDU, of which 83.2% reported cannabis use. Higher levels of discrimination were associated with worse self-reported sleep disturbance scores. Additionally, participants with greater discrimination were more likely to have PDU. Surprisingly, participants with PDU had lower sleep disturbance scores. Our cross-sectional findings suggest that PDU partially suppressed the association between discrimination and sleep disturbance in TGNB people. Efforts to address PDU in TGNB adults may consider assessing sleep disturbance as a motivating factor for drug use and the potential role of discrimination in perpetuating PDU.

Subjects received each drug for 2 wk with a 2-wk washout period. The primary outcome was sleep quality, measured by the Insomnia Severity Index and the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes included pain, mood, quality of life, and adverse events (AEs). Thirty-one subjects were enrolled and 29 completed the trial (26 women, mean age 49.5 yr).

Nabilone was marginally better on the restfulness (Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire difference = 0.5 [0.0-1.0]) but not on wakefulness (difference = 0.3 [-0.2 to 0.8]). No effects on pain, mood, or quality of life were observed. AEs were mostly mild to moderate and were more frequent with nabilone. The most common AEs for nabilone were dizziness, nausea, and dry mouth. Nabilone is effective in improving sleep in patients with FM and is well tolerated. Low-dose nabilone given once daily at bedtime may be considered as an alternative to amitriptyline. Longer trials are needed to determine the duration of effect and to characterize long-term safety.

72,72,35775024,"Prescribed cannabinoids are now legal in the UK and increasingly being used for a variety of conditions, with one of the most frequent conditions being chronic pain. This paper describes the characteristics of individuals seeking prescribed cannabinoids for the treatment of chronic pain in Project Twenty 21, a UK based real world data registry of prescribed cannabis patients. By 1st November 2021 data were available for 1,782 people who had sought treatment with medical cannabis as part of Project Twenty 21. The most common diagnosis among this cohort was chronic pain with 949 (53.5%) of the cohort reporting a primary condition related to chronic pain. Medical and self-report data on the characteristics of these patients, their health status and type/s of cannabinoid/s prescribed are summarized in this report. Of the 949 people reporting chronic pain as a primary condition 54.7% were male and their average age was 42.0 years (range = 18-84). Patients reported a low quality of life and high levels of comorbidity: people reported an average of 4.6 comorbid conditions with the most common comorbid conditions including anxiety, depression, insomnia and stress. A range of cannabinoid products were prescribed with the most common products being classified as high THC flower (48.5%). The majority of patients also reported using at least one other prescribed medication (68.7%). Consistent with findings in other national and international databases, chronic pain was the most common primary condition in this real world study of prescribed cannabinoids. There was considerable variation in the types of chronic pain, comorbid pathology and in the characteristics of products being prescribed to treat these conditions. Together, this evidence supports the utility of real world evidence, as opposed to clinical trial approaches to studying the potential benefits of prescribed cannabinoids in treating chronic pain.

73,73,34285125,"Cannabidiol (CBD) is a cannabis derivative that has been popularized as a medicinal product with analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. Given the anecdotal observations that several patients have reported use of CBD for spine-related pain, this study was designed to characterize CBD consumption patterns and perceived effects in patients with spine-related complaints. The study design was a cross-sectional survey. Over a 4-week period, an anonymous paper survey was administered to all patients presenting for evaluation by 1 of 9 spine surgeons at a single institution. Surveys were given upon registration for the office visit and collected by the office manager or nurse before evaluation by the surgeon. Patients were included regardless of surgical status (ie, preoperative, postoperative, or nonoperative) or region of pathology (lumbar, thoracic, or cervical). The survey consisted of multiple-choice questions on patient patterns of CBD use. Out of 300 surveys, 214 (71%) were completed. CBD use for spine-related pain was reported by 54 (25.2%) patients. CBD was initially used for potential relief of back pain (66.7%), neck pain (37.0%), leg pain (35.2%), and/or arm pain (9.3%). Users also sought improvements in insomnia (25.9%) and mood (18.5%). Oil was the most popular formulation (64.8%). CBD was most often consumed 2-5 times (40.7%) or 6-10 times (31.5%) per week. The most common source of initial recommendation for CBD was friends or family (75.9%). Reported benefits were pain relief (46.3%), improved sleep (33.3%), and reduced anxiety (20.4%); however, 24.1% of patients reported no benefit from CBD use. The most reported side effect was fatigue (7.4%). Most users (63.0%) would recommend CBD to a friend for pain relief. CBD is already used by many patients, and further high-quality research on this supplement is essential. 4. CBD is a commonly used by spine patients as an off label treatment.

74,74,32758411,"Sleep disruption and relaxation are commonly cited reasons for marijuana use. Job loss is a significant stressor associated with high risk for sleep disruption. Little is known about marijuana use in relation to other intervention choices for sleep/relaxation in individuals who have experienced recent, involuntary job loss. This study compared self-reported use of marijuana to evidence-based treatments (EBT) for sleep/relaxation using data from the ongoing Assessing Daily Activity Patterns through Occupational Transitions (ADAPT) study. Participants were 1639 completers of the ADAPT phone screen interview. EBT was defined as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, and benzodiazepines. Marijuana was the most common treatment for sleep/relaxation. Two-sample tests of proportions revealed that prevalence of use of marijuana was comparable to the entire class of EBTs (~5%). Only 2 (0.1%) participants reported receiving CBT-I, the first-line treatment for insomnia disorder, as per the American College of Physicians Clinical Practice Guidelines. Rates of dose increase following job-loss were comparable between users of marijuana and EBTs (Z = 0.56, p = .58). Multiple logistic regression models demonstrated that male sex (OR = 0.28, 95%CI = 0.14-0.57) and substance abuse (OR = 7.68, 95%CI = 2.89-20.43) were significantly associated with increased likelihood of marijuana use. Individuals who have recently experienced involuntary job loss may be more likely to use marijuana than any one EBT for sleep/relaxation and as likely to increase their treatment dose. Dissemination of evidence-based sleep health interventions is needed in unemployed populations to prevent habitual patterns resulting in the long-term use of marijuana for sleep/relaxation.

75,75,24281562,"Cannabidiol (CBD), a major phytocannabinoid constituent of cannabis, is attracting growing attention in medicine for its anxiolytic, antipsychotic, antiemetic and anti-inflammatory properties. However, up to this point, a comprehensive literature review of the effects of CBD in humans is lacking. The aim of the present systematic review is to examine the randomized and crossover studies that administered CBD to healthy controls and to clinical patients. A systematic search was performed in the electronic databases PubMed and EMBASE using the key word ""cannabidiol"". Both monotherapy and combination studies (e.g., CBD + ∆9-THC) were included. A total of 34 studies were identified: 16 of these were experimental studies, conducted in healthy subjects, and 18 were conducted in clinical populations, including multiple sclerosis (six studies), schizophrenia and bipolar mania (four studies), social anxiety disorder (two studies), neuropathic and cancer pain (two studies), cancer anorexia (one study), Huntington's disease (one study), insomnia (one study), and epilepsy (one study). Experimental studies indicate that a high-dose of inhaled/intravenous CBD is required to inhibit the effects of a lower dose of ∆9-THC. Moreover, some experimental and clinical studies suggest that oral/oromucosal CBD may prolong and/or intensify ∆9-THC-induced effects, whereas others suggest that it may inhibit ∆9-THC-induced effects. Finally, preliminary clinical trials suggest that high-dose oral CBD (150-600 mg/d) may exert a therapeutic effect for social anxiety disorder, insomnia and epilepsy, but also that it may cause mental sedation. Potential pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic explanations for these results are discussed.

To assess utilization patterns and perceived impact of cannabinoid use among a national cohort of PwMS. Data collected were part of a nationwide survey to characterize pain in PwMS. Items included questions about current/recent cannabinoid use, reasons for use, preferred THC/CBD formulations, and perceived benefits/side effects. PROMIS short-forms assessed symptom severity. Pain phenotype was assessed with the painDETECT questionnaire and FMSurvey Criteria Questionnaires. Among n = 1,027 respondents, 42% endorsed recent cannabinoid use, of which 18% endorsed healthcare provider guidance regarding use. PROMIS scores (except cognitive abilities), and pain centralization and neuropathic pain scores, were higher among recent/current users (each p < 0.0001). Sleep and pain were the most frequently reported reasons for use. Benefit from cannabinoids for sleep and pain were strongly correlated (r = 0.65, p < 0.0001). For those who expressed a preference for specific THC/CBD ratios, CBD-predominant formulations were favored. Cannabinoid use is common in PwMS, despite a paucity of provider guidance. The range of perceived benefits, and potential differential effects of THC and CBD, highlight the need for personalized, evidence-based guidelines regarding cannabinoid use.

77,77,29764217,"Individuals with an evening chronotype are at increased risk of experiencing emotional problems, including depressive symptoms. However, the mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear. The present study aimed to determine whether poor sleep quality, substance use and cognitive emotion regulation difficulties - which have been implicated in the etiology of depression - mediate the relationship between chronotype and depressive symptoms in a student sample, which was assessed cross-sectionally and after 1 year. A total of 742 Dutch students (75% women, mean age 21.4 ± 2.9 years) completed the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, a questionnaire assessing alcohol, caffeine, tobacco and cannabis use, the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and the Behavioral Inhibition/Activation Scale. A subsample (n = 115) was assessed 1 year later with the same questionnaires. Cross-sectional analyses showed that evening chronotype was associated with more depressive symptoms, adjusted for age and gender (β = -0.082, p = 0.028). The relationship between eveningness and depressive symptoms was mediated by sleep quality, alcohol consumption and the cognitive emotion regulation strategies of self-blame and positive reappraisal. In longitudinal analyses, eveningness at baseline predicted more depressive symptoms at follow-up, adjusted for age and gender (β = -0.29, p = 0.002); after additional adjustment for baseline depressive symptoms, chronotype remained a significant predictor of depressive symptoms at T2 (β = -0.16, t = -2.01, p = 0.047). Only poor sleep quality at follow-up was a significant mediator of this relationship. Even though the effect is small in terms of explained variance, eveningness is related to depressive symptoms and this relationship is mediated by poor sleep quality, also in a prospective design. Self-blame and reduced positive reappraisal are correlated with eveningness. Further research is needed to assess the efficacy of chronotherapeutic interventions for the prevention of depression, in addition to sleep education and cognitive approaches.

This study assessed the impact of sleep difficulty on single and repeated school and out-of-school injuries and the confounding role of socioeconomic factors and school, behaviour and health-related difficulties among adolescents. The study population included 1559 middle-school adolescents from north-eastern France (mean age 13.5, SD 1.3) who completed at the end of school year a self-administered questionnaire to gather school and out-of-school injuries during the school year, and to assess sleep difficulty and previous injury risk factors which were socioeconomic factors (family structure, parents' education, father's occupation, and family income), school performance, obesity, alcohol/tobacco/cannabis/hard drugs use, health status, psychological health, and involvement-in-violence. For sleep difficulty and behaviour and health-related difficulties their first occurring over adolescent's life course was gathered. Multinomial logistic regression models were used retaining only sleep difficulty and other risk factors which had started before the school year (thus before the injuries studied). School and out-of-school injuries and sleep difficulty were frequent. The adolescents with sleep difficulty without medical treatment had a higher risk of single school and out-of-school injuries (gender-age-adjusted odds ratio gaOR 1.86 and 1.76, respectively) and a much higher risk of repeated school and out-of-school injuries (≥2 injuries; gaOR 2.43 and 3.73, respectively). The adolescents with persistent sleep difficulty despite a medical treatment also had a higher risk of single school and out-of-school injury (gaOR 2.31 and 1.78, respectively), and a much higher risk of repeated school and out-of-school injuries (gaOR 4.92 and 4.36, respectively). Socioeconomic factors had a moderate contribution (<27%) while school, behaviour and health-related difficulties had a high contribution (reaching 71%) to the association between sleep difficulty and single/repeated injuries. The role of these factors differed between single/repeated school/out-of-school injuries.

87,87,29808787,"Non-psychotic affective symptoms are important components of psychotic syndromes. They are frequent and are now thought to influence the emergence of paranoia and hallucinations. Evidence supporting this model of psychosis comes from recent cross-fertilising epidemiological and intervention studies. Epidemiological studies identify plausible targets for intervention but must be interpreted cautiously. Nevertheless, causal inference can be strengthened substantially using modern statistical methods. Directed Acyclic Graphs were used in a dynamic Bayesian network approach to learn the overall dependence structure of chosen variables. DAG-based inference identifies the most likely directional links between multiple variables, thereby locating them in a putative causal cascade. We used initial and 18-month follow-up data from the 2000 British National Psychiatric Morbidity survey (N = 8580 and N = 2406). We analysed persecutory ideation, hallucinations, a range of affective symptoms and the effects of cannabis and problematic alcohol use. Worry was central to the links between symptoms, with plausible direct effects on insomnia, depressed mood and generalised anxiety, and recent cannabis use. Worry linked the other affective phenomena with paranoia. Hallucinations were connected only to worry and persecutory ideation. General anxiety, worry, sleep problems, and persecutory ideation were strongly self-predicting. Worry and persecutory ideation were connected over the 18-month interval in an apparent feedback loop. These results have implications for understanding dynamic processes in psychosis and for targeting psychological interventions. The reciprocal influence of worry and paranoia implies that treating either symptom is likely to ameliorate the other.

88,88,21763331,"Most recreational users of 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ""ecstasy"") also take cannabis, in part because cannabis can reduce the dysphoric symptoms of the ecstasy come-down such as agitation and insomnia. Although previous animal studies have examined the acute effects of co-administering MDMA and Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the major psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, research on chronic exposure to this drug combination is lacking. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the effects of chronic adolescent administration of both THC and MDMA on behavior and on regional serotonin transporter (SERT) binding and serotonin (5-HT) concentrations as indices of serotonergic system integrity. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four drug administration groups: (1) MDMA alone, (2) THC alone, (3) MDMA plus THC, and (4) vehicle controls. MDMA (2 × 10 mg/kg × 4 h) was administered every fifth day from postnatal day (PD) 35 to 60 to simulate intermittent recreational ecstasy use, whereas THC (5mg/kg) was given once daily over the same time period to simulate heavy cannabis use. THC unexpectedly produced a modest hyperthermic effect when administered alone, but in animals co-treated with both THC and MDMA, there was an attenuation of MDMA-induced hyperthermia on dosing days. Subsequent testing conducted after a drug washout period revealed that THC reduced MDMA-related behavioral changes in the emergence and social interaction tests of anxiety-like behavior and also blunted the MDMA-induced decrease in exploratory behavior in the hole-board test. THC additionally attenuated MDMA -induced decreases in 5-HT levels and in SERT binding in the frontal cortex, parietal cortex, and striatum, but not in the hippocampus. These results suggest that chronic co-administration of THC during adolescence can provide some protection against various adverse physiological, behavioral, and neurochemical effects produced by MDMA.

Data were collected from 211 (121 women; 90 men) adults using the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies, medical records, and additional information gathered from relatives. Most gender comparisons showed no evidence of differences. Nonetheless, more men than women reported mania at the onset of bipolar I disorder. Men also had higher rates of comorbid alcohol abuse/dependence, cannabis abuse/dependence, pathological gambling and conduct disorder. Men were more likely to report 'behavioural problems' and 'being unable to hold a conversation' during mania. Women reported higher rates of comorbid eating disorders, and weight change, appetite change and middle insomnia during depression. Men and women were generally similar in their symptom presentation, age of onset of bipolar disorder, and in the total number of mood episodes.

However, current formulations suffer from low bioavailability and side effects. PTL-101, an oral formulation containing highly purified cannabidiol (CBD) embedded in seamless gelatin matrix beadlets was designed to enhance bioavailability and maintain a constant gastrointestinal transit time. This phase II, prospective study was open to pediatric patients with TRE on stable antiepileptic drugs' (AEDs) doses, who experienced ≥4 seizures within four weeks of enrolment and with a history of ≥4 AEDs failing to provide seizure control. Following a 4-week observation period, patients began a 2-week dose-titration phase (up to ≤25mg/kg or 450mg, the lower of the two), followed by a 10-week maintenance treatment period. Caregivers recorded seizure frequency, type, and severity and ranked their global impressions after 7 and 12weeks of treatment. Responders were those showing a ≥50% reduction from baseline monthly seizure frequency. Safety assessments monitored vital signs, adverse effects, physical and neurological exams, and laboratory tests. Sixteen patients (age: 9.1±3.4) enrolled in the study; 11 completed the full treatment program. The average maintenance dose was 13.6±4.2mg/kg. Patient adherence to treatment regimens was 96.3±9.9%. By the end of the treatment period, 81.9% and 73.4±24.6% (p<0.05) reductions from baseline median seizure count and monthly seizure frequency, respectively, were recorded. Responders' rate was 56%; two patients became fully seizure-free. By study end, 8 (73%) caregivers reported an improved/very much improved condition, and 9 (82%) reported reduced/very much reduced seizure severity. Most commonly reported treatment-related adverse effects were sleep disturbance/insomnia, (4 (25.0%) patients), followed by somnolence, increased seizure frequency, and restlessness (3 patients each (18.8%)).

92,92,28341617,"Due to easy access and low cost, Internet-delivered therapies offer an attractive alternative to improving health. Although numerous websites contain health-related information, finding evidence-based programs (as demonstrated through randomized controlled trials, RCTs) can be challenging. We sought to bridge the divide between the knowledge gained from RCTs and communication of the results by conducting a global systematic review and analyzing the availability of evidence-based Internet health programs. The study aimed to (1) discover the range of health-related topics that are addressed through Internet-delivered interventions, (2) generate a list of current websites used in the trials which demonstrate a health benefit, and (3) identify gaps in the research that may have hindered dissemination. Our focus was on Internet-delivered self-guided health interventions that did not require real-time clinical support. A systematic review of meta-analyses was conducted using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (PROSPERO Registration Number CRD42016041258). MEDLINE via Ovid, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) were searched. Inclusion criteria included (1) meta-analyses of RCTs, (2) at least one Internet-delivered intervention that measured a health-related outcome, and (3) use of at least one self-guided intervention. We excluded group-based therapies. There were no language restrictions. Of the 363 records identified through the search, 71 meta-analyses met inclusion criteria. Within the 71 meta-analyses, there were 1733 studies that contained 268 unique RCTs which tested self-help interventions. On review of the 268 studies, 21.3% (57/268) had functional websites. These included evidence-based Web programs on substance abuse (alcohol, tobacco, cannabis), mental health (depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD], phobias, panic disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder [OCD]), and on diet and physical activity. There were also evidence-based programs on insomnia, chronic pain, cardiovascular risk, and childhood health problems. These programs tended to be intensive, requiring weeks to months of engagement by the user, often including interaction, personalized and normative feedback, and self-monitoring. English was the most common language, although some were available in Spanish, French, Portuguese, Dutch, German, Norwegian, Finnish, Swedish, and Mandarin.

93,93,29054032,"Opioid substitution treatment (OST) is often continued long-term and, therefore, opioid-associated symptoms are of interest. Symptoms associated with methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) in men are well described, but there are fewer reports concerning symptoms associated with buprenorphine maintenance treatment (BMT) and very few reports among women. Recipients of BMT (n=113) and MMT (n=184), non-opioid users (n=105) and opioid users not receiving OST (n=87) completed the Patient Assessment of Constipation (PAC-SYM) and a general symptom checklist. Multivariate analysis included other potential moderators of opioid-associated symptoms. Opioid users reported a higher frequency and severity of symptoms than non-opioid users. Constipation, dry mouth, decreased appetite, sweating and fatigue were highly prevalent in the previous 30days (51-80%). Nausea, itchy skin, trouble urinating, menstrual problems, lightheadedness, blurred vision, heart racing were also common (30-50%). Non-OST opioid users had significantly higher frequency and severity than OST recipients of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, decreased appetite, sweating and itchy skin. Sweating was significantly more common in MMT than BMT. Constipation scores were higher in women, otherwise most sex differences were small. Higher PAC-SYM scores were associated with vomiting (OR=1.04) and sweating (OR=1.06). Cannabis use was associated with vomiting (OR=2.19). Constipation (OR=1.07), insomnia (OR=2.5) and depression (OR=2.82) were associated with fatigue.

95,95,17994489,"After Sweden's zero-tolerance law came into force (1 July 1999), the number of cases of driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) submitted by the police for toxicological analysis increased more than 10-fold. This prompted an in-depth investigation into the kinds of drugs used by DUID offenders, whether licit or illicit, and the frequency of their occurrence. All blood samples from DUID suspects sent by the police for toxicological analysis over a 4-year period (2001-2004) were investigated (N = 22,777 cases). Specimens of blood or urine were subjected to a broad screening analysis by immunoassay methods aimed at detecting amphetamines, cannabis, opiates, cocaine metabolite, and the major benzodiazepines. All positive results from the screening stage were verified by use of more specific analytical methods (e.g., GC-MS, LC-MS, GC-FID, and GC-NPD). Between 80 and 85% of all the blood samples contained at least one banned substance and many contained two or more therapeutic and/or illicit drugs. About 15% of cases were negative for drugs, although these frequently (30-50%) contained ethanol above the legal limit for driving in Sweden, which is 0.20 mg/g (0.02 g%). Amphetamine was the most prominent illicit drug seen in 55-60% of cases either alone or together with other drugs of abuse. Stimulants like cocaine and/or its metabolite were infrequently encountered ( approximately 1.2% of cases). The next most prevalent illicit drug was cannabis, with positive results for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in blood either alone ( approximately 4%) or together with other psychoactive substances ( approximately 20%). Morphine, codeine, and/or 6-acetyl morphine were identified in approximately 2% of all DUID suspects, being indicative of heroin abuse. The major prescription drugs identified in blood were benzodiazepines (10%) as exemplified by diazepam, alprazolam, nitrazepam, and flunitrazepam. Drugs for treating insomnia, zolpidem and zopiclone, were also identified in blood samples from DUID suspects over the study period. Other therapeutic agents were encountered in only 1-2% of all cases. The dramatic increase in DUID after the zero-tolerance law came into force probably reflects enhanced police activity and more enthusiasm to apprehend and charge individuals for this offence. Illicit drugs, particularly amphetamine and cannabis, and poly-drug use were predominant compared with use of scheduled prescription drugs. The typical DUID offender in Sweden abuses central stimulants, particularly amphetamine, and has probably done so over many years. Options for treating offenders for their underlying substance abuse problem should be considered instead of the more conventional penalties for drug-impaired driving.

There was a significant degree of comorbidity between the two subtypes of phobia, with females exhibiting a significantly greater frequency of co-occurrence of both disorders than males. The course of the two disorders was quite similar. In general, subjects with both disorders reported a more severe course. Assessment of comorbidity of phobias and other disorders revealed that agoraphobia was most significantly associated with extended neurasthenia, sexual problems, and the consumption of cannabis. On the other hand, social phobia was associated with other disorders than agoraphobia, with the strongest associations emerging for simple phobia, extended insomnia, and alcohol abuse.

97,97,26228404,"There is ample data suggesting that individuals with bipolar disorder more frequently suffer from disturbed sleep even when euthymic. Since sleep is a process that is crucial for affective homeostasis, disturbed sleep in healthy individuals may be a risk factor for the subsequent onset of bipolar disorder. Utilizing data from a large cohort of adolescents and young adults, this study tests the hypothesis that disturbed sleep constitutes a risk factor for the later onset of bipolar disorder. A representative community sample of N = 3021 adolescents and young adults (baseline age 14-24) was assessed using the standardized Composite International Diagnostic Interview and followed-up prospectively up to 3 times over up to 10 years. Disturbed sleep at baseline was quantified utilizing the corresponding items from the self-report inventory SCL-90-R. The compound value (insomnia-score) as an ordinal parameter for the severity of sleep disturbances was used to assess associations with the incidence of bipolar disorder among participants free of major mental disorder at baseline (N = 1943) using odds ratios (OR) from logistic regressions. Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, parental mood disorder and lifetime alcohol or cannabis dependence. Poor sleep quality significantly increased the risk for the subsequent development of bipolar disorder (OR = 1.75; p = 0.001). Regarding individual sleep items, trouble falling asleep and early morning awakening were predictive for the subsequent onset of bipolar disorder. Disturbed sleep in persons otherwise free of major mental disorders appears to confer an increased risk for the subsequent onset of bipolar disorder.

103,103,17306186,"Poor mental health is a common problem in adolescence. Little information is available, however, about the factors influencing negative mood states in otherwise healthy adolescents. We aimed to describe the mood states and related factors in a sample of adolescents in the city of Barcelona (Spain). We administered a health survey to a sample of 2,727 students from public, subsidized, and private schools in Barcelona, aged approximately 14, 16, and 18 years old. To analyze the associations among moods and related factors, we used bivariate logistic regression, and fitted multivariate logistic regressions using the statistically significant variables from the bivariate analysis. To examine the possible group effects of the school on individual students, we employed multilevel analysis. The frequencies of negative mood states increased with age, with girls consistently reporting more frequent negative mood states than boys. The factors associated with negative mood states were problematic alcohol use, perceived mistreatment or abuse, antisocial behavior, intention to use or current use of illegal drugs (not including cannabis), lower perceived academic performance, and feeling isolated. Mood states are influenced by lifestyle and social factors, about which there is little local information. To plan and implement appropriate public health interventions, more complete information about the possible areas of influence is required. To complement the information obtained from studies such as the present study, longitudinal and qualitative studies would be desirable.

104,104,11436938,"This study examined the relationship between cocaine withdrawal and lifetime history of depression (major depression, dysthymia). Participants with a history of regular cocaine use (n = 146) were administered the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV (SCID) and were asked to recall whether they experienced any of the six DSM-IV cocaine withdrawal symptoms. Results of bivariate analyses demonstrated that those meeting criteria for the cocaine withdrawal syndrome (dysphoria plus two or more other symptoms), in comparison to those who did not, were significantly (P<.001) more likely to have a lifetime history of depression. Lifetime history of depression was also more common in those individuals reporting the withdrawal symptoms of ""dysphoria"" (P<.001), ""insomnia/hypersomnia"" (P<.05), ""vivid unpleasant dreams"" (P<.01), and ""psychomotor agitation/retardation"" (P<.01). These relationships remained significant after controlling for demographics, severity of addiction, and the presence of opiate, alcohol and cannabis dependence or abuse. The withdrawal symptoms of ""fatigue"" and ""increased appetite"" were not associated with mood history. Results suggest that lifetime history of depression is strongly related to whether or not a cocaine abuser self-reports withdrawal symptoms. Several competing hypotheses regarding the nature of this relationship are discussed.

106,106,25470912,"Anecdotal reports and some clinical studies suggest that marihuana (Cannabis sativa) is effective in treating a variety of conditions such as glaucoma, migraine, pain, spasticity of multiple sclerosis, anorexia, insomnia, depression, nausea and vomiting. One of the diseases mostly associated to a beneficial effect from marihuana is cancer. Twenty-one states of the United States including the District of Columbia have approved the use of marihuana for cancer and other medical conditions. In Puerto Rico, public debate on criminal penalty removal and medicalization of marihuana has intensified. It is considered essential for health professionals to have strong scientific evidence on the effectiveness and safety of medications or substances when recommending them for treating illness. This article discusses scientific evidence and information provided by prestigious organizations on the effectiveness and safety of marihuana and its derivatives in cancer patients.
